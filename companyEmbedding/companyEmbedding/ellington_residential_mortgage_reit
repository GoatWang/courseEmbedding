About Ellington Residential Mortgage REIT

Investment Strategy


For Our Shareholders









			Ellington Residential Mortgage REIT ("EARN") specializes in acquiring, investing in and 
            managing residential mortgage- and real estate-related assets, with a primary focus on residential mortgage-backed 
            securities for which the principal and interest payments are guaranteed by a U.S. Government agency or a U.S. 
            Government-sponsored enterprise.
		









            Our primary objective is to generate attractive current yields and risk-adjusted total returns for our shareholders 
            by investing in assets that we believe compensate us appropriately for the risks associated with them. 
            We were formed through an initial strategic venture between affiliates of Ellington Management Group, L.L.C. 
            ("Elllington Management Group" or "EMG") and a group of funds managed by an affiliate of The Blackstone Group LP. 
            EARN is externally managed by Ellington Residential Mortgage Management LLC, an affiliate of EMG, and thus benefits 
            from EMG’s deep experience in the mortgage-related markets, highly analytical investment processes, operational expertise

Competitive Strengths



Experienced and Cohesive Management Team: 
            The extensive experience of our officers and the officers of our Manager provides us with expertise across 
            all of our targeted asset classes. Many members of our team have worked together 
            for over 18 years and members of our management team have experience as heads of RMBS origination and trading, 
            whole loan MBS origination and trading, and fixed income research and quantitative systems at major financial 
            institutions.
        

Sophisticated Platform and Analytical Capabilities: 
            We benefit from Ellington Management Group’s proprietary analytical models and infrastructure, which have been 
            developed through many years of experience and across multiple market cycles. EMG's risk management process 
            emphasizes the quantitative assessment and management of interest rate, prepayment, and credit risks, both on 
            a security by security and portfolio basis. This is made possible with sophisticated quantitative tools and 
            methodologies that are the foundation of EMG's unique investment acquisition and portfolio construction process. 
            Analyzing mortgage credit risk and prepayment risk in particular necessitates the development and continuous 
            refinement of sophisticated statistics-based computer models. We believe that this expertise and infrastructure, 
            together with EMG's experience investing and leveraging large pools of capital in complex mortgage and derivative 
            instruments through various economic and business cycles, are critical for us to meet our objectives.
        

Disciplined Security Selection Process: 
            Our disciplined approach to security selection is a fundamental component of our asset acquisition strategy. 
            Ellington’s proprietary analytics allow it to analyze securities individually based on a variety of factors 
            driving value, including favorable prepayment characteristics of Agency-guaranteed mortgage-backed securities.
            Coupled with our active and opportunistic management of our investments and hedges, our security selection process 
            aims to generate attractive current yields and risk-adjusted total returns for our shareholders.

Investment Strategy


For Our Shareholders









			Ellington Residential Mortgage REIT ("EARN") specializes in acquiring, investing in and 
            managing residential mortgage- and real estate-related assets, with a primary focus on residential mortgage-backed 
            securities for which the principal and interest payments are guaranteed by a U.S. Government agency or a U.S. 
            Government-sponsored enterprise.
		









            Our primary objective is to generate attractive current yields and risk-adjusted total returns for our shareholders 
            by investing in assets that we believe compensate us appropriately for the risks associated with them. 
            We were formed through an initial strategic venture between affiliates of Ellington Management Group, L.L.C. 
            ("Elllington Management Group" or "EMG") and a group of funds managed by an affiliate of The Blackstone Group LP. 
            EARN is externally managed by Ellington Residential Mortgage Management LLC, an affiliate of EMG, and thus benefits 
            from EMG’s deep experience in the mortgage-related markets, highly analytical investment processes, operational expertise 
            and resources, and extensive relationship base, providing significant competitive advantages.
        

            Additionally, an emphasis on security selection, as well as active management of our investments and hedges, are fundamental 
            to EARN’s approach.  EARN’s understanding of the market across sectors, over time, and through a highly analytical lens helps 
            us to realize potential and unlock value.
        

            We have elected to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, which requires that we distribute at least 
            90% of our REIT income to our shareholders on an annual basis.

Investment Strategy


For Our Shareholders









			We intend to utilize an opportunistic strategy that we believe will enable us to generate attractive current yields and risk-adjusted total returns for our shareholders.
		



			Our strategy utilizes an investment model that focuses on security selection and allocates capital to assets that balance a range of mortgage-related risks.  We construct and actively manage our investment portfolio, comprised primarily of Agency RMBS and, to a lesser extent, non-Agency RMBS.  We may also opportunistically acquire and manage other mortgage- and real estate-related assets, such as MSRs and residential whole mortgage loans.  We expect to opportunistically mitigate our interest rate and prepayment risk using a variety of hedging instruments.
		

			EARN’s approach to investing in the mortgage-backed securities markets is highly disciplined and analytical. We concentrate primarily on the development of proprietary interest-rate and prepayment models, as well as other proprietary research and analytics.
		

Target Asset Classes



Agency Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities
Non-Agency Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities
Other

Agency Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities

RMBS backed by fixed rate mortgages and Hybrid ARMs
Whole pool and other mortgage pass-through certificates
Agency CMOs, including IOs, POs, IIOs, and inverse floaters
RMBS backed by manufactured housing loans 
TBAs

Non-Agency Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities

RMBS backed by prime jumbo, Alt-A and subprime mortgages
RMBS backed by fixed rate mortgages, ARMs, Option-ARMs, Neg-Am ARMs and Hybrid ARMs
RMBS backed by first lien and second lien mortgages
RMBS backed by manufactured housing loans

This Stock Has A 12.21% Yield, Sells For Less Than Book, and Insiders Have Been Buying
In this series, we look through the most recent Dividend Channel ''DividendRank'' report, and then we cherry pick only those companies that have experienced insider buying within the past six months. The officers and directors of a company tend to have a unique insider's view of the business, and presumably the only reason an insider would choose to take their hard-earned cash and use it to buy stock in the open market, is that they expect to make money — maybe they find the stock very undervalued, or maybe they see exciting progress within the company, or maybe both.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
