History[edit]
The forerunner of HSN was launched by Lowell "Bud" Paxson and Roy Speer in 1982 as the Home Shopping Club, a local cable channel seen on Vision Cable and Group W Cable in Pinellas County, Florida. It expanded into the first national shopping network three years later on July 1, 1985, changing its name to the Home Shopping Network, and pioneering the concept of a televised sales pitch for consumer goods and services. Its competitor and future owner QVC was launched the following year.
The idea for HSN had its roots in a radio station managed by Paxson. Due to an advertiser's liquidity problem in 1977, the company was paid in can openers. Left with having to raise the funds, on-air personality Bob Circosta went on the radio and sold the can openers for $9.95 each. The can openers sold out, and an industry was born. Circosta later became the new network's first ever home shopping host and would eventually sell 75,000 different products in over 20,000 hours of live television.
In 1986, HSN began a second network that broadcast over-the-air on a number of television stations it had acquired under the name Silver King Broadcasting. In 1999, the stations were sold to IAC founder Barry Diller and changed its name to USA Broadcasting, with a few of them ending HSN programming outside of overnight hours and taking on a local programming format equivalent to Toronto's Citytv. HSN continues to air on low-power stations (one of these is owned in agreement by Univision). Ventana Television (ventana meaning window in Spanish) has the same street address as HSN, and is the holding company for its broadcast licenses.
In 1997, HSN formally launched its second nationwide electronic retail venture, a 24-hour network under the America's Store name (it had operated similar concepts of more limited scale since 1988). In April 2007, America's Store ceased operating permanently. Most of the America's Store hosts (some of which were already splitting hosting duties between networks) were absorbed into the HSN programming schedule.
In 1998, Home Shopping Network launched a Spanish-language service Home Shopping en Español on the Univision-owned Galavision cable network. In 2000, the Spanish version rebranded itself as HSE and began broadcasting on low-power stations in the U.S. and Puerto Rico. It also ceased to broadcast through Galavision. In June 2002, HSE ceased to operate.
In 1999, the company launched HSN.com, which as of 2009 is one of the 10 most trafficked e-commerce websites. In an attempt to engage with younger consumers in 2009, HSN produced a 14-episode online video series, Faces of Beautiful You, which follows three young women who find solutions to many of life's problems through HSN's beauty products. The campaign included a Facebook widget, character blogs, and profiles for the three main characters on Twitter, MySpace, and Facebook.> On August 19, 2012, HSN co-founder Roy Speer died after a long illness. Bud Paxson died on January 9, 2015.
In April 2017, HSN CEO Mindy Grossman stepped down as CEO to assume the CEO position at Weight Watchers.[5] On July 6, 2017, Liberty Interactive announced it would buy the remaining 62% of HSN stock to acquire the company for its QVC Group. QVC CEO Mike George would be CEO of the QVC-HSN merger.[6]
High definition[edit]
In August 2009, HSN launched a high definition simulcast feed, which broadcasts in the 1080i resolution format. At launch, it was carried by Time Warner Cable and Verizon FiOS;[7] it has since been added by other providers such as Comcast and AT&T U-verse. When the HD channel launched, the network had a different presentation than most HD channels, choosing to present content on the standard definition feed using a left cut of the HD image rather than taken from the center of the screen within the standard 4:3 safe area. As of February 2013, the standard definition channel is now merely downscaled at the provider from the HD feed rather than having a devoted channel for 4:3 TVs.
Sister channels[edit]
HSN2[edit]
HSN launched a companion channel, HSN2, on August 1, 2010. Dish Network has carried it since launch.[8]
America's Store[edit]
America's Store (AS) began in 1988 as the Home Shopping Club Overnight Service, which aired on broadcast stations around the USA from midnight to 9 a.m. and, in particular, on WWOR-TV from 3 to 6 a.m. in the New York City metropolitan area, along with its national superstation feed. In 1989, HSN purchased a number of low-power television stations and began operating the service 24 hours a day as Home Shopping Spree. In 1997, the name was changed again to America's Jewelry Store to reflect a switch to selling exclusively jewelry. This incarnation met with limited success, and as a result, in 1998, the selection was expanded to include all of HSN's inventory categories, with the word "Jewelry" being removed from the network's name. In 2003, America's Store began to be carried on DirecTV. The network went off the air in April 2007.
United States[edit]
HSN's U.S. operations are based in St. Petersburg, Florida, which houses its corporate headquarters, studio and broadcasting facilities. Additional call center facilities are located in Roanoke, Virginia & Toledo, Ohio. Distribution centers are situated in Roanoke, Piney Flats, Tennessee, and Fontana, California in order to ensure rapid delivery of items.
HSN also operates retail outlet stores in Orlando, Brandon, Bardmoor, Tampa and St. Petersburg (Emplorium). HSN broadcasts 24 hours a day, 364 days a year. On Christmas, a mix of special programming airs from Christmas Eve afternoon until midnight on December 25. For the first twelve years, a looping Yule log was aired from Noon Christmas Eve to Midnight December 26. The show allows members of the staff to go on camera with their families to say hello to relatives back home.
United Kingdom[edit]
HSN had a UK sister network called HSE, which has ceased operating.
Germany[edit]
HSN has a sister network in Europe called HSE24. ("Home Shopping Europe")
Japan[edit]
HSN's sister network in Japan is known as The Shop Channel.
Canada[edit]
The Shopping Channel was launched in 1987 as Canadian Home Shopping Network (CHSN), HSN's sister network in Canada. In 1999, the station was sold to Rogers Communications and is no longer affiliated with HSN.
Philippines[edit]
Home Shopping Network is currently aired in the Philippines via Shop TV, a shopping channel owned by Solar Entertainment Corporation. It is also aired as a paid advertising block on GMA, GMA News TV, BEAM TV, AksyonTV and most of the channels owned by Solar Entertainment Corporation including Diva Universal Philippines which is a joint venture with NBCUniversal. In 2015, The HSN brand is no longer named on screen, but they used the shopping channel's name.
Italy[edit]
Home Shopping Europe was launched in Italy in 2001 as Home Shopping Europe, replacing H.O.T. Italia (when this acronym intended the television channel Home Order Television). In 2003, the frequencies of HSE were sold to Mediaset and the channel was renamed Mediashopping.[9] In 2011, Home Shopping Europe bought the channel back; the channel was renamed HSE24.
Technology[edit]
Call center[edit]
HSN National started life with a standard rotary phone system that concentrated calls to the front of the queue. This corresponded to the front row of order takers in the HSN Studio at the Levitz Center (so named as the location was a former Levitz furniture store) in Clearwater, Florida. After several months, this system was no longer adequate and HSN entered a phase where a phone system from GTE was used. HSN claimed that the systems' inability to handle the high call volumes resulted in a loss of business. HSN sued GTE for $1.5 billion. In a counter-libel suit, GTE claimed that HSN had slandered the company; GTE won a $100 million judgment. Both parties settled out of court.[10] In the interim, HSN found another telephone vendor to handle its call volume. The Rockwell corporation's Galaxy line of switches was used for the current call center (as well as the new locations in St. Petersburg).
HSN has an in-house call center in St. Petersburg, Florida, which mostly handles customer service calls. HSN also employs several hundred customer service representatives from work at home positions who take calls and place orders via HSN's customer service intranet. HSN also contracts call centers to handle its sales calls especially when HSN is broadcasting shows with highly popular items.
Interactive Voice Response[edit]
HSN was an early adopter of an Interactive Voice Response (IVR) system for order entry. This system allowed customers to place orders through the IVR rather than an agent. The original IVR was a product supplied by Precision Software, Incorporated (PSi) of St. Paul, Minnesota. The product made use of an Intel PC chassis and Dialogic boards for call termination. As the system also needed to communicate with the Burroughs mainframe, it used a serial connection to communicate with the online application. While PSi had off-the-shelf components, it required a great deal of customization to create scripts and interface with the order entry system. PSi ran up a high amount of hours and this caused HSN to actually purchase PSi rather than pay their bill. Once released, the system was branded TOOTIE (after the bicycle horn that show hosts used to help excite the audience and was the network's mascot up until the mid-1990s).
As the size of HSN's call center kept increasing, it decided to create a new IVR platform that could handle more load. As nothing available on the open market could handle the volume HSN required, the PSi subsidiary started work on a customer platform called the TSP. This platform was installed in HSN's new facility and could handle a large number of T1 lines (each T1 has a capacity of 24 separate callers). This system originally communicated through a Stratus computer (acting as a poll/select terminal gateway) to the mainframe, but this was later changed to a direct TCP/IP connection. This system was dubbed Tootie II internally.

History[edit]
The forerunner of HSN was launched by Lowell "Bud" Paxson and Roy Speer in 1982 as the Home Shopping Club, a local cable channel seen on Vision Cable and Group W Cable in Pinellas County, Florida. It expanded into the first national shopping network three years later on July 1, 1985, changing its name to the Home Shopping Network, and pioneering the concept of a televised sales pitch for consumer goods and services. Its competitor and future owner QVC was launched the following year.
The idea for HSN had its roots in a radio station managed by Paxson. Due to an advertiser's liquidity problem in 1977, the company was paid in can openers. Left with having to raise the funds, on-air personality Bob Circosta went on the radio and sold the can openers for $9.95 each. The can openers sold out, and an industry was born. Circosta later became the new network's first ever home shopping host and would eventually sell 75,000 different products in over 20,000 hours of live television.
In 1986, HSN began a second network that broadcast over-the-air on a number of television stations it had acquired under the name Silver King Broadcasting. In 1999, the stations were sold to IAC founder Barry Diller and changed its name to USA Broadcasting, with a few of them ending HSN programming outside of overnight hours and taking on a local programming format equivalent to Toronto's Citytv. HSN continues to air on low-power stations (one of these is owned in agreement by Univision). Ventana Television (ventana meaning window in Spanish) has the same street address as HSN, and is the holding company for its broadcast licenses.
In 1997, HSN formally launched its second nationwide electronic retail venture, a 24-hour network under the America's Store name (it had operated similar concepts of more limited scale since 1988). In April 2007, America's Store ceased operating permanently. Most of the America's Store hosts (some of which were already splitting hosting duties between networks) were absorbed into the HSN programming schedule.
In 1998, Home Shopping Network launched a Spanish-language service Home Shopping en Español on the Univision-owned Galavision cable network. In 2000, the Spanish version rebranded itself as HSE and began broadcasting on low-power stations in the U.S. and Puerto Rico. It also ceased to broadcast through Galavision. In June 2002, HSE ceased to operate.
In 1999, the company launched HSN.com, which as of 2009 is one of the 10 most trafficked e-commerce websites. In an attempt to engage with younger consumers in 2009, HSN produced a 14-episode online video series, Faces of Beautiful You, which follows three young women who find solutions to many of life's problems through HSN's beauty products. The campaign included a Facebook widget, character blogs, and profiles for the three main characters on Twitter, MySpace, and Facebook.> On August 19, 2012, HSN co-founder Roy Speer died after a long illness. Bud Paxson died on January 9, 2015.
In April 2017, HSN CEO Mindy Grossman stepped down as CEO to assume the CEO position at Weight Watchers.[5] On July 6, 2017, Liberty Interactive announced it would buy the remaining 62% of HSN stock to acquire the company for its QVC Group. QVC CEO Mike George would be CEO of the QVC-HSN merger.[6]
High definition[edit]
In August 2009, HSN launched a high definition simulcast feed, which broadcasts in the 1080i resolution format. At launch, it was carried by Time Warner Cable and Verizon FiOS;[7] it has since been added by other providers such as Comcast and AT&T U-verse. When the HD channel launched, the network had a different presentation than most HD channels, choosing to present content on the standard definition feed using a left cut of the HD image rather than taken from the center of the screen within the standard 4:3 safe area. As of February 2013, the standard definition channel is now merely downscaled at the provider from the HD feed rather than having a devoted channel for 4:3 TVs.
Sister channels[edit]
HSN2[edit]
HSN launched a companion channel, HSN2, on August 1, 2010. Dish Network has carried it since launch.[8]
America's Store[edit]
America's Store (AS) began in 1988 as the Home Shopping Club Overnight Service, which aired on broadcast stations around the USA from midnight to 9 a.m. and, in particular, on WWOR-TV from 3 to 6 a.m. in the New York City metropolitan area, along with its national superstation feed. In 1989, HSN purchased a number of low-power television stations and began operating the service 24 hours a day as Home Shopping Spree. In 1997, the name was changed again to America's Jewelry Store to reflect a switch to selling exclusively jewelry. This incarnation met with limited success, and as a result, in 1998, the selection was expanded to include all of HSN's inventory categories, with the word "Jewelry" being removed from the network's name. In 2003, America's Store began to be carried on DirecTV. The network went off the air in April 2007.
United States[edit]
HSN's U.S. operations are based in St. Petersburg, Florida, which houses its corporate headquarters, studio and broadcasting facilities. Additional call center facilities are located in Roanoke, Virginia & Toledo, Ohio. Distribution centers are situated in Roanoke, Piney Flats, Tennessee, and Fontana, California in order to ensure rapid delivery of items.
HSN also operates retail outlet stores in Orlando, Brandon, Bardmoor, Tampa and St. Petersburg (Emplorium). HSN broadcasts 24 hours a day, 364 days a year. On Christmas, a mix of special programming airs from Christmas Eve afternoon until midnight on December 25. For the first twelve years, a looping Yule log was aired from Noon Christmas Eve to Midnight December 26. The show allows members of the staff to go on camera with their families to say hello to relatives back home.
United Kingdom[edit]
HSN had a UK sister network called HSE, which has ceased operating.
Germany[edit]
HSN has a sister network in Europe called HSE24. ("Home Shopping Europe")
Japan[edit]
HSN's sister network in Japan is known as The Shop Channel.
Canada[edit]
The Shopping Channel was launched in 1987 as Canadian Home Shopping Network (CHSN), HSN's sister network in Canada. In 1999, the station was sold to Rogers Communications and is no longer affiliated with HSN.
Philippines[edit]
Home Shopping Network is currently aired in the Philippines via Shop TV, a shopping channel owned by Solar Entertainment Corporation. It is also aired as a paid advertising block on GMA, GMA News TV, BEAM TV, AksyonTV and most of the channels owned by Solar Entertainment Corporation including Diva Universal Philippines which is a joint venture with NBCUniversal. In 2015, The HSN brand is no longer named on screen, but they used the shopping channel's name.
Italy[edit]
Home Shopping Europe was launched in Italy in 2001 as Home Shopping Europe, replacing H.O.T. Italia (when this acronym intended the television channel Home Order Television). In 2003, the frequencies of HSE were sold to Mediaset and the channel was renamed Mediashopping.[9] In 2011, Home Shopping Europe bought the channel back; the channel was renamed HSE24.
Technology[edit]
Call center[edit]
HSN National started life with a standard rotary phone system that concentrated calls to the front of the queue. This corresponded to the front row of order takers in the HSN Studio at the Levitz Center (so named as the location was a former Levitz furniture store) in Clearwater, Florida. After several months, this system was no longer adequate and HSN entered a phase where a phone system from GTE was used. HSN claimed that the systems' inability to handle the high call volumes resulted in a loss of business. HSN sued GTE for $1.5 billion. In a counter-libel suit, GTE claimed that HSN had slandered the company; GTE won a $100 million judgment. Both parties settled out of court.[10] In the interim, HSN found another telephone vendor to handle its call volume. The Rockwell corporation's Galaxy line of switches was used for the current call center (as well as the new locations in St. Petersburg).
HSN has an in-house call center in St. Petersburg, Florida, which mostly handles customer service calls. HSN also employs several hundred customer service representatives from work at home positions who take calls and place orders via HSN's customer service intranet. HSN also contracts call centers to handle its sales calls especially when HSN is broadcasting shows with highly popular items.
Interactive Voice Response[edit]
HSN was an early adopter of an Interactive Voice Response (IVR) system for order entry. This system allowed customers to place orders through the IVR rather than an agent. The original IVR was a product supplied by Precision Software, Incorporated (PSi) of St. Paul, Minnesota. The product made use of an Intel PC chassis and Dialogic boards for call termination. As the system also needed to communicate with the Burroughs mainframe, it used a serial connection to communicate with the online application. While PSi had off-the-shelf components, it required a great deal of customization to create scripts and interface with the order entry system. PSi ran up a high amount of hours and this caused HSN to actually purchase PSi rather than pay their bill. Once released, the system was branded TOOTIE (after the bicycle horn that show hosts used to help excite the audience and was the network's mascot up until the mid-1990s).
As the size of HSN's call center kept increasing, it decided to create a new IVR platform that could handle more load. As nothing available on the open market could handle the volume HSN required, the PSi subsidiary started work on a customer platform called the TSP. This platform was installed in HSN's new facility and could handle a large number of T1 lines (each T1 has a capacity of 24 separate callers). This system originally communicated through a Stratus computer (acting as a poll/select terminal gateway) to the mainframe, but this was later changed to a direct TCP/IP connection. This system was dubbed Tootie II internally.

History[edit]
The forerunner of HSN was launched by Lowell "Bud" Paxson and Roy Speer in 1982 as the Home Shopping Club, a local cable channel seen on Vision Cable and Group W Cable in Pinellas County, Florida. It expanded into the first national shopping network three years later on July 1, 1985, changing its name to the Home Shopping Network, and pioneering the concept of a televised sales pitch for consumer goods and services. Its competitor and future owner QVC was launched the following year.
The idea for HSN had its roots in a radio station managed by Paxson. Due to an advertiser's liquidity problem in 1977, the company was paid in can openers. Left with having to raise the funds, on-air personality Bob Circosta went on the radio and sold the can openers for $9.95 each. The can openers sold out, and an industry was born. Circosta later became the new network's first ever home shopping host and would eventually sell 75,000 different products in over 20,000 hours of live television.
In 1986, HSN began a second network that broadcast over-the-air on a number of television stations it had acquired under the name Silver King Broadcasting. In 1999, the stations were sold to IAC founder Barry Diller and changed its name to USA Broadcasting, with a few of them ending HSN programming outside of overnight hours and taking on a local programming format equivalent to Toronto's Citytv. HSN continues to air on low-power stations (one of these is owned in agreement by Univision). Ventana Television (ventana meaning window in Spanish) has the same street address as HSN, and is the holding company for its broadcast licenses.
In 1997, HSN formally launched its second nationwide electronic retail venture, a 24-hour network under the America's Store name (it had operated similar concepts of more limited scale since 1988). In April 2007, America's Store ceased operating permanently. Most of the America's Store hosts (some of which were already splitting hosting duties between networks) were absorbed into the HSN programming schedule.
In 1998, Home Shopping Network launched a Spanish-language service Home Shopping en Español on the Univision-owned Galavision cable network. In 2000, the Spanish version rebranded itself as HSE and began broadcasting on low-power stations in the U.S. and Puerto Rico. It also ceased to broadcast through Galavision. In June 2002, HSE ceased to operate.
In 1999, the company launched HSN.com, which as of 2009 is one of the 10 most trafficked e-commerce websites. In an attempt to engage with younger consumers in 2009, HSN produced a 14-episode online video series, Faces of Beautiful You, which follows three young women who find solutions to many of life's problems through HSN's beauty products. The campaign included a Facebook widget, character blogs, and profiles for the three main characters on Twitter, MySpace, and Facebook.> On August 19, 2012, HSN co-founder Roy Speer died after a long illness. Bud Paxson died on January 9, 2015.
In April 2017, HSN CEO Mindy Grossman stepped down as CEO to assume the CEO position at Weight Watchers.[5] On July 6, 2017, Liberty Interactive announced it would buy the remaining 62% of HSN stock to acquire the company for its QVC Group. QVC CEO Mike George would be CEO of the QVC-HSN merger.[6]
High definition[edit]
In August 2009, HSN launched a high definition simulcast feed, which broadcasts in the 1080i resolution format. At launch, it was carried by Time Warner Cable and Verizon FiOS;[7] it has since been added by other providers such as Comcast and AT&T U-verse. When the HD channel launched, the network had a different presentation than most HD channels, choosing to present content on the standard definition feed using a left cut of the HD image rather than taken from the center of the screen within the standard 4:3 safe area. As of February 2013, the standard definition channel is now merely downscaled at the provider from the HD feed rather than having a devoted channel for 4:3 TVs.
Sister channels[edit]
HSN2[edit]
HSN launched a companion channel, HSN2, on August 1, 2010. Dish Network has carried it since launch.[8]
America's Store[edit]
America's Store (AS) began in 1988 as the Home Shopping Club Overnight Service, which aired on broadcast stations around the USA from midnight to 9 a.m. and, in particular, on WWOR-TV from 3 to 6 a.m. in the New York City metropolitan area, along with its national superstation feed. In 1989, HSN purchased a number of low-power television stations and began operating the service 24 hours a day as Home Shopping Spree. In 1997, the name was changed again to America's Jewelry Store to reflect a switch to selling exclusively jewelry. This incarnation met with limited success, and as a result, in 1998, the selection was expanded to include all of HSN's inventory categories, with the word "Jewelry" being removed from the network's name. In 2003, America's Store began to be carried on DirecTV. The network went off the air in April 2007.
United States[edit]
HSN's U.S. operations are based in St. Petersburg, Florida, which houses its corporate headquarters, studio and broadcasting facilities. Additional call center facilities are located in Roanoke, Virginia & Toledo, Ohio. Distribution centers are situated in Roanoke, Piney Flats, Tennessee, and Fontana, California in order to ensure rapid delivery of items.
HSN also operates retail outlet stores in Orlando, Brandon, Bardmoor, Tampa and St. Petersburg (Emplorium). HSN broadcasts 24 hours a day, 364 days a year. On Christmas, a mix of special programming airs from Christmas Eve afternoon until midnight on December 25. For the first twelve years, a looping Yule log was aired from Noon Christmas Eve to Midnight December 26. The show allows members of the staff to go on camera with their families to say hello to relatives back home.
United Kingdom[edit]
HSN had a UK sister network called HSE, which has ceased operating.
Germany[edit]
HSN has a sister network in Europe called HSE24. ("Home Shopping Europe")
Japan[edit]
HSN's sister network in Japan is known as The Shop Channel.
Canada[edit]
The Shopping Channel was launched in 1987 as Canadian Home Shopping Network (CHSN), HSN's sister network in Canada. In 1999, the station was sold to Rogers Communications and is no longer affiliated with HSN.
Philippines[edit]
Home Shopping Network is currently aired in the Philippines via Shop TV, a shopping channel owned by Solar Entertainment Corporation. It is also aired as a paid advertising block on GMA, GMA News TV, BEAM TV, AksyonTV and most of the channels owned by Solar Entertainment Corporation including Diva Universal Philippines which is a joint venture with NBCUniversal. In 2015, The HSN brand is no longer named on screen, but they used the shopping channel's name.
Italy[edit]
Home Shopping Europe was launched in Italy in 2001 as Home Shopping Europe, replacing H.O.T. Italia (when this acronym intended the television channel Home Order Television). In 2003, the frequencies of HSE were sold to Mediaset and the channel was renamed Mediashopping.[9] In 2011, Home Shopping Europe bought the channel back; the channel was renamed HSE24.
Technology[edit]
Call center[edit]
HSN National started life with a standard rotary phone system that concentrated calls to the front of the queue. This corresponded to the front row of order takers in the HSN Studio at the Levitz Center (so named as the location was a former Levitz furniture store) in Clearwater, Florida. After several months, this system was no longer adequate and HSN entered a phase where a phone system from GTE was used. HSN claimed that the systems' inability to handle the high call volumes resulted in a loss of business. HSN sued GTE for $1.5 billion. In a counter-libel suit, GTE claimed that HSN had slandered the company; GTE won a $100 million judgment. Both parties settled out of court.[10] In the interim, HSN found another telephone vendor to handle its call volume. The Rockwell corporation's Galaxy line of switches was used for the current call center (as well as the new locations in St. Petersburg).
HSN has an in-house call center in St. Petersburg, Florida, which mostly handles customer service calls. HSN also employs several hundred customer service representatives from work at home positions who take calls and place orders via HSN's customer service intranet. HSN also contracts call centers to handle its sales calls especially when HSN is broadcasting shows with highly popular items.
Interactive Voice Response[edit]
HSN was an early adopter of an Interactive Voice Response (IVR) system for order entry. This system allowed customers to place orders through the IVR rather than an agent. The original IVR was a product supplied by Precision Software, Incorporated (PSi) of St. Paul, Minnesota. The product made use of an Intel PC chassis and Dialogic boards for call termination. As the system also needed to communicate with the Burroughs mainframe, it used a serial connection to communicate with the online application. While PSi had off-the-shelf components, it required a great deal of customization to create scripts and interface with the order entry system. PSi ran up a high amount of hours and this caused HSN to actually purchase PSi rather than pay their bill. Once released, the system was branded TOOTIE (after the bicycle horn that show hosts used to help excite the audience and was the network's mascot up until the mid-1990s).
As the size of HSN's call center kept increasing, it decided to create a new IVR platform that could handle more load. As nothing available on the open market could handle the volume HSN required, the PSi subsidiary started work on a customer platform called the TSP. This platform was installed in HSN's new facility and could handle a large number of T1 lines (each T1 has a capacity of 24 separate callers). This system originally communicated through a Stratus computer (acting as a poll/select terminal gateway) to the mainframe, but this was later changed to a direct TCP/IP connection. This system was dubbed Tootie II internally.

History[edit]
The forerunner of HSN was launched by Lowell "Bud" Paxson and Roy Speer in 1982 as the Home Shopping Club, a local cable channel seen on Vision Cable and Group W Cable in Pinellas County, Florida. It expanded into the first national shopping network three years later on July 1, 1985, changing its name to the Home Shopping Network, and pioneering the concept of a televised sales pitch for consumer goods and services. Its competitor and future owner QVC was launched the following year.
The idea for HSN had its roots in a radio station managed by Paxson. Due to an advertiser's liquidity problem in 1977, the company was paid in can openers. Left with having to raise the funds, on-air personality Bob Circosta went on the radio and sold the can openers for $9.95 each. The can openers sold out, and an industry was born. Circosta later became the new network's first ever home shopping host and would eventually sell 75,000 different products in over 20,000 hours of live television.
In 1986, HSN began a second network that broadcast over-the-air on a number of television stations it had acquired under the name Silver King Broadcasting. In 1999, the stations were sold to IAC founder Barry Diller and changed its name to USA Broadcasting, with a few of them ending HSN programming outside of overnight hours and taking on a local programming format equivalent to Toronto's Citytv. HSN continues to air on low-power stations (one of these is owned in agreement by Univision). Ventana Television (ventana meaning window in Spanish) has the same street address as HSN, and is the holding company for its broadcast licenses.
In 1997, HSN formally launched its second nationwide electronic retail venture, a 24-hour network under the America's Store name (it had operated similar concepts of more limited scale since 1988). In April 2007, America's Store ceased operating permanently. Most of the America's Store hosts (some of which were already splitting hosting duties between networks) were absorbed into the HSN programming schedule.
In 1998, Home Shopping Network launched a Spanish-language service Home Shopping en Español on the Univision-owned Galavision cable network. In 2000, the Spanish version rebranded itself as HSE and began broadcasting on low-power stations in the U.S. and Puerto Rico. It also ceased to broadcast through Galavision. In June 2002, HSE ceased to operate.
In 1999, the company launched HSN.com, which as of 2009 is one of the 10 most trafficked e-commerce websites. In an attempt to engage with younger consumers in 2009, HSN produced a 14-episode online video series, Faces of Beautiful You, which follows three young women who find solutions to many of life's problems through HSN's beauty products. The campaign included a Facebook widget, character blogs, and profiles for the three main characters on Twitter, MySpace, and Facebook.> On August 19, 2012, HSN co-founder Roy Speer died after a long illness. Bud Paxson died on January 9, 2015.
In April 2017, HSN CEO Mindy Grossman stepped down as CEO to assume the CEO position at Weight Watchers.[5] On July 6, 2017, Liberty Interactive announced it would buy the remaining 62% of HSN stock to acquire the company for its QVC Group. QVC CEO Mike George would be CEO of the QVC-HSN merger.[6]
High definition[edit]
In August 2009, HSN launched a high definition simulcast feed, which broadcasts in the 1080i resolution format. At launch, it was carried by Time Warner Cable and Verizon FiOS;[7] it has since been added by other providers such as Comcast and AT&T U-verse. When the HD channel launched, the network had a different presentation than most HD channels, choosing to present content on the standard definition feed using a left cut of the HD image rather than taken from the center of the screen within the standard 4:3 safe area. As of February 2013, the standard definition channel is now merely downscaled at the provider from the HD feed rather than having a devoted channel for 4:3 TVs.
Sister channels[edit]
HSN2[edit]
HSN launched a companion channel, HSN2, on August 1, 2010. Dish Network has carried it since launch.[8]
America's Store[edit]
America's Store (AS) began in 1988 as the Home Shopping Club Overnight Service, which aired on broadcast stations around the USA from midnight to 9 a.m. and, in particular, on WWOR-TV from 3 to 6 a.m. in the New York City metropolitan area, along with its national superstation feed. In 1989, HSN purchased a number of low-power television stations and began operating the service 24 hours a day as Home Shopping Spree. In 1997, the name was changed again to America's Jewelry Store to reflect a switch to selling exclusively jewelry. This incarnation met with limited success, and as a result, in 1998, the selection was expanded to include all of HSN's inventory categories, with the word "Jewelry" being removed from the network's name. In 2003, America's Store began to be carried on DirecTV. The network went off the air in April 2007.
United States[edit]
HSN's U.S. operations are based in St. Petersburg, Florida, which houses its corporate headquarters, studio and broadcasting facilities. Additional call center facilities are located in Roanoke, Virginia & Toledo, Ohio. Distribution centers are situated in Roanoke, Piney Flats, Tennessee, and Fontana, California in order to ensure rapid delivery of items.
HSN also operates retail outlet stores in Orlando, Brandon, Bardmoor, Tampa and St. Petersburg (Emplorium). HSN broadcasts 24 hours a day, 364 days a year. On Christmas, a mix of special programming airs from Christmas Eve afternoon until midnight on December 25. For the first twelve years, a looping Yule log was aired from Noon Christmas Eve to Midnight December 26. The show allows members of the staff to go on camera with their families to say hello to relatives back home.
United Kingdom[edit]
HSN had a UK sister network called HSE, which has ceased operating.
Germany[edit]
HSN has a sister network in Europe called HSE24. ("Home Shopping Europe")
Japan[edit]
HSN's sister network in Japan is known as The Shop Channel.
Canada[edit]
The Shopping Channel was launched in 1987 as Canadian Home Shopping Network (CHSN), HSN's sister network in Canada. In 1999, the station was sold to Rogers Communications and is no longer affiliated with HSN.
Philippines[edit]
Home Shopping Network is currently aired in the Philippines via Shop TV, a shopping channel owned by Solar Entertainment Corporation. It is also aired as a paid advertising block on GMA, GMA News TV, BEAM TV, AksyonTV and most of the channels owned by Solar Entertainment Corporation including Diva Universal Philippines which is a joint venture with NBCUniversal. In 2015, The HSN brand is no longer named on screen, but they used the shopping channel's name.
Italy[edit]
Home Shopping Europe was launched in Italy in 2001 as Home Shopping Europe, replacing H.O.T. Italia (when this acronym intended the television channel Home Order Television). In 2003, the frequencies of HSE were sold to Mediaset and the channel was renamed Mediashopping.[9] In 2011, Home Shopping Europe bought the channel back; the channel was renamed HSE24.
Technology[edit]
Call center[edit]
HSN National started life with a standard rotary phone system that concentrated calls to the front of the queue. This corresponded to the front row of order takers in the HSN Studio at the Levitz Center (so named as the location was a former Levitz furniture store) in Clearwater, Florida. After several months, this system was no longer adequate and HSN entered a phase where a phone system from GTE was used. HSN claimed that the systems' inability to handle the high call volumes resulted in a loss of business. HSN sued GTE for $1.5 billion. In a counter-libel suit, GTE claimed that HSN had slandered the company; GTE won a $100 million judgment. Both parties settled out of court.[10] In the interim, HSN found another telephone vendor to handle its call volume. The Rockwell corporation's Galaxy line of switches was used for the current call center (as well as the new locations in St. Petersburg).
HSN has an in-house call center in St. Petersburg, Florida, which mostly handles customer service calls. HSN also employs several hundred customer service representatives from work at home positions who take calls and place orders via HSN's customer service intranet. HSN also contracts call centers to handle its sales calls especially when HSN is broadcasting shows with highly popular items.
Interactive Voice Response[edit]
HSN was an early adopter of an Interactive Voice Response (IVR) system for order entry. This system allowed customers to place orders through the IVR rather than an agent. The original IVR was a product supplied by Precision Software, Incorporated (PSi) of St. Paul, Minnesota. The product made use of an Intel PC chassis and Dialogic boards for call termination. As the system also needed to communicate with the Burroughs mainframe, it used a serial connection to communicate with the online application. While PSi had off-the-shelf components, it required a great deal of customization to create scripts and interface with the order entry system. PSi ran up a high amount of hours and this caused HSN to actually purchase PSi rather than pay their bill. Once released, the system was branded TOOTIE (after the bicycle horn that show hosts used to help excite the audience and was the network's mascot up until the mid-1990s).
As the size of HSN's call center kept increasing, it decided to create a new IVR platform that could handle more load. As nothing available on the open market could handle the volume HSN required, the PSi subsidiary started work on a customer platform called the TSP. This platform was installed in HSN's new facility and could handle a large number of T1 lines (each T1 has a capacity of 24 separate callers). This system originally communicated through a Stratus computer (acting as a poll/select terminal gateway) to the mainframe, but this was later changed to a direct TCP/IP connection. This system was dubbed Tootie II internally.

History[edit]
The forerunner of HSN was launched by Lowell "Bud" Paxson and Roy Speer in 1982 as the Home Shopping Club, a local cable channel seen on Vision Cable and Group W Cable in Pinellas County, Florida. It expanded into the first national shopping network three years later on July 1, 1985, changing its name to the Home Shopping Network, and pioneering the concept of a televised sales pitch for consumer goods and services. Its competitor and future owner QVC was launched the following year.
The idea for HSN had its roots in a radio station managed by Paxson. Due to an advertiser's liquidity problem in 1977, the company was paid in can openers. Left with having to raise the funds, on-air personality Bob Circosta went on the radio and sold the can openers for $9.95 each. The can openers sold out, and an industry was born. Circosta later became the new network's first ever home shopping host and would eventually sell 75,000 different products in over 20,000 hours of live television.
In 1986, HSN began a second network that broadcast over-the-air on a number of television stations it had acquired under the name Silver King Broadcasting. In 1999, the stations were sold to IAC founder Barry Diller and changed its name to USA Broadcasting, with a few of them ending HSN programming outside of overnight hours and taking on a local programming format equivalent to Toronto's Citytv. HSN continues to air on low-power stations (one of these is owned in agreement by Univision). Ventana Television (ventana meaning window in Spanish) has the same street address as HSN, and is the holding company for its broadcast licenses.
In 1997, HSN formally launched its second nationwide electronic retail venture, a 24-hour network under the America's Store name (it had operated similar concepts of more limited scale since 1988). In April 2007, America's Store ceased operating permanently. Most of the America's Store hosts (some of which were already splitting hosting duties between networks) were absorbed into the HSN programming schedule.
In 1998, Home Shopping Network launched a Spanish-language service Home Shopping en Español on the Univision-owned Galavision cable network. In 2000, the Spanish version rebranded itself as HSE and began broadcasting on low-power stations in the U.S. and Puerto Rico. It also ceased to broadcast through Galavision. In June 2002, HSE ceased to operate.
In 1999, the company launched HSN.com, which as of 2009 is one of the 10 most trafficked e-commerce websites. In an attempt to engage with younger consumers in 2009, HSN produced a 14-episode online video series, Faces of Beautiful You, which follows three young women who find solutions to many of life's problems through HSN's beauty products. The campaign included a Facebook widget, character blogs, and profiles for the three main characters on Twitter, MySpace, and Facebook.> On August 19, 2012, HSN co-founder Roy Speer died after a long illness. Bud Paxson died on January 9, 2015.
In April 2017, HSN CEO Mindy Grossman stepped down as CEO to assume the CEO position at Weight Watchers.[5] On July 6, 2017, Liberty Interactive announced it would buy the remaining 62% of HSN stock to acquire the company for its QVC Group. QVC CEO Mike George would be CEO of the QVC-HSN merger.[6]
High definition[edit]
In August 2009, HSN launched a high definition simulcast feed, which broadcasts in the 1080i resolution format. At launch, it was carried by Time Warner Cable and Verizon FiOS;[7] it has since been added by other providers such as Comcast and AT&T U-verse. When the HD channel launched, the network had a different presentation than most HD channels, choosing to present content on the standard definition feed using a left cut of the HD image rather than taken from the center of the screen within the standard 4:3 safe area. As of February 2013, the standard definition channel is now merely downscaled at the provider from the HD feed rather than having a devoted channel for 4:3 TVs.
Sister channels[edit]
HSN2[edit]
HSN launched a companion channel, HSN2, on August 1, 2010. Dish Network has carried it since launch.[8]
America's Store[edit]
America's Store (AS) began in 1988 as the Home Shopping Club Overnight Service, which aired on broadcast stations around the USA from midnight to 9 a.m. and, in particular, on WWOR-TV from 3 to 6 a.m. in the New York City metropolitan area, along with its national superstation feed. In 1989, HSN purchased a number of low-power television stations and began operating the service 24 hours a day as Home Shopping Spree. In 1997, the name was changed again to America's Jewelry Store to reflect a switch to selling exclusively jewelry. This incarnation met with limited success, and as a result, in 1998, the selection was expanded to include all of HSN's inventory categories, with the word "Jewelry" being removed from the network's name. In 2003, America's Store began to be carried on DirecTV. The network went off the air in April 2007.
United States[edit]
HSN's U.S. operations are based in St. Petersburg, Florida, which houses its corporate headquarters, studio and broadcasting facilities. Additional call center facilities are located in Roanoke, Virginia & Toledo, Ohio. Distribution centers are situated in Roanoke, Piney Flats, Tennessee, and Fontana, California in order to ensure rapid delivery of items.
HSN also operates retail outlet stores in Orlando, Brandon, Bardmoor, Tampa and St. Petersburg (Emplorium). HSN broadcasts 24 hours a day, 364 days a year. On Christmas, a mix of special programming airs from Christmas Eve afternoon until midnight on December 25. For the first twelve years, a looping Yule log was aired from Noon Christmas Eve to Midnight December 26. The show allows members of the staff to go on camera with their families to say hello to relatives back home.
United Kingdom[edit]
HSN had a UK sister network called HSE, which has ceased operating.
Germany[edit]
HSN has a sister network in Europe called HSE24. ("Home Shopping Europe")
Japan[edit]
HSN's sister network in Japan is known as The Shop Channel.
Canada[edit]
The Shopping Channel was launched in 1987 as Canadian Home Shopping Network (CHSN), HSN's sister network in Canada. In 1999, the station was sold to Rogers Communications and is no longer affiliated with HSN.
Philippines[edit]
Home Shopping Network is currently aired in the Philippines via Shop TV, a shopping channel owned by Solar Entertainment Corporation. It is also aired as a paid advertising block on GMA, GMA News TV, BEAM TV, AksyonTV and most of the channels owned by Solar Entertainment Corporation including Diva Universal Philippines which is a joint venture with NBCUniversal. In 2015, The HSN brand is no longer named on screen, but they used the shopping channel's name.
Italy[edit]
Home Shopping Europe was launched in Italy in 2001 as Home Shopping Europe, replacing H.O.T. Italia (when this acronym intended the television channel Home Order Television). In 2003, the frequencies of HSE were sold to Mediaset and the channel was renamed Mediashopping.[9] In 2011, Home Shopping Europe bought the channel back; the channel was renamed HSE24.
Technology[edit]
Call center[edit]
HSN National started life with a standard rotary phone system that concentrated calls to the front of the queue. This corresponded to the front row of order takers in the HSN Studio at the Levitz Center (so named as the location was a former Levitz furniture store) in Clearwater, Florida. After several months, this system was no longer adequate and HSN entered a phase where a phone system from GTE was used. HSN claimed that the systems' inability to handle the high call volumes resulted in a loss of business. HSN sued GTE for $1.5 billion. In a counter-libel suit, GTE claimed that HSN had slandered the company; GTE won a $100 million judgment. Both parties settled out of court.[10] In the interim, HSN found another telephone vendor to handle its call volume. The Rockwell corporation's Galaxy line of switches was used for the current call center (as well as the new locations in St. Petersburg).
HSN has an in-house call center in St. Petersburg, Florida, which mostly handles customer service calls. HSN also employs several hundred customer service representatives from work at home positions who take calls and place orders via HSN's customer service intranet. HSN also contracts call centers to handle its sales calls especially when HSN is broadcasting shows with highly popular items.
Interactive Voice Response[edit]
HSN was an early adopter of an Interactive Voice Response (IVR) system for order entry. This system allowed customers to place orders through the IVR rather than an agent. The original IVR was a product supplied by Precision Software, Incorporated (PSi) of St. Paul, Minnesota. The product made use of an Intel PC chassis and Dialogic boards for call termination. As the system also needed to communicate with the Burroughs mainframe, it used a serial connection to communicate with the online application. While PSi had off-the-shelf components, it required a great deal of customization to create scripts and interface with the order entry system. PSi ran up a high amount of hours and this caused HSN to actually purchase PSi rather than pay their bill. Once released, the system was branded TOOTIE (after the bicycle horn that show hosts used to help excite the audience and was the network's mascot up until the mid-1990s).
As the size of HSN's call center kept increasing, it decided to create a new IVR platform that could handle more load. As nothing available on the open market could handle the volume HSN required, the PSi subsidiary started work on a customer platform called the TSP. This platform was installed in HSN's new facility and could handle a large number of T1 lines (each T1 has a capacity of 24 separate callers). This system originally communicated through a Stratus computer (acting as a poll/select terminal gateway) to the mainframe, but this was later changed to a direct TCP/IP connection. This system was dubbed Tootie II internally.

History[edit]
The forerunner of HSN was launched by Lowell "Bud" Paxson and Roy Speer in 1982 as the Home Shopping Club, a local cable channel seen on Vision Cable and Group W Cable in Pinellas County, Florida. It expanded into the first national shopping network three years later on July 1, 1985, changing its name to the Home Shopping Network, and pioneering the concept of a televised sales pitch for consumer goods and services. Its competitor and future owner QVC was launched the following year.
The idea for HSN had its roots in a radio station managed by Paxson. Due to an advertiser's liquidity problem in 1977, the company was paid in can openers. Left with having to raise the funds, on-air personality Bob Circosta went on the radio and sold the can openers for $9.95 each. The can openers sold out, and an industry was born. Circosta later became the new network's first ever home shopping host and would eventually sell 75,000 different products in over 20,000 hours of live television.
In 1986, HSN began a second network that broadcast over-the-air on a number of television stations it had acquired under the name Silver King Broadcasting. In 1999, the stations were sold to IAC founder Barry Diller and changed its name to USA Broadcasting, with a few of them ending HSN programming outside of overnight hours and taking on a local programming format equivalent to Toronto's Citytv. HSN continues to air on low-power stations (one of these is owned in agreement by Univision). Ventana Television (ventana meaning window in Spanish) has the same street address as HSN, and is the holding company for its broadcast licenses.
In 1997, HSN formally launched its second nationwide electronic retail venture, a 24-hour network under the America's Store name (it had operated similar concepts of more limited scale since 1988). In April 2007, America's Store ceased operating permanently. Most of the America's Store hosts (some of which were already splitting hosting duties between networks) were absorbed into the HSN programming schedule.
In 1998, Home Shopping Network launched a Spanish-language service Home Shopping en Español on the Univision-owned Galavision cable network. In 2000, the Spanish version rebranded itself as HSE and began broadcasting on low-power stations in the U.S. and Puerto Rico. It also ceased to broadcast through Galavision. In June 2002, HSE ceased to operate.
In 1999, the company launched HSN.com, which as of 2009 is one of the 10 most trafficked e-commerce websites. In an attempt to engage with younger consumers in 2009, HSN produced a 14-episode online video series, Faces of Beautiful You, which follows three young women who find solutions to many of life's problems through HSN's beauty products. The campaign included a Facebook widget, character blogs, and profiles for the three main characters on Twitter, MySpace, and Facebook.> On August 19, 2012, HSN co-founder Roy Speer died after a long illness. Bud Paxson died on January 9, 2015.
In April 2017, HSN CEO Mindy Grossman stepped down as CEO to assume the CEO position at Weight Watchers.[5] On July 6, 2017, Liberty Interactive announced it would buy the remaining 62% of HSN stock to acquire the company for its QVC Group. QVC CEO Mike George would be CEO of the QVC-HSN merger.[6]
High definition[edit]
In August 2009, HSN launched a high definition simulcast feed, which broadcasts in the 1080i resolution format. At launch, it was carried by Time Warner Cable and Verizon FiOS;[7] it has since been added by other providers such as Comcast and AT&T U-verse. When the HD channel launched, the network had a different presentation than most HD channels, choosing to present content on the standard definition feed using a left cut of the HD image rather than taken from the center of the screen within the standard 4:3 safe area. As of February 2013, the standard definition channel is now merely downscaled at the provider from the HD feed rather than having a devoted channel for 4:3 TVs.
Sister channels[edit]
HSN2[edit]
HSN launched a companion channel, HSN2, on August 1, 2010. Dish Network has carried it since launch.[8]
America's Store[edit]
America's Store (AS) began in 1988 as the Home Shopping Club Overnight Service, which aired on broadcast stations around the USA from midnight to 9 a.m. and, in particular, on WWOR-TV from 3 to 6 a.m. in the New York City metropolitan area, along with its national superstation feed. In 1989, HSN purchased a number of low-power television stations and began operating the service 24 hours a day as Home Shopping Spree. In 1997, the name was changed again to America's Jewelry Store to reflect a switch to selling exclusively jewelry. This incarnation met with limited success, and as a result, in 1998, the selection was expanded to include all of HSN's inventory categories, with the word "Jewelry" being removed from the network's name. In 2003, America's Store began to be carried on DirecTV. The network went off the air in April 2007.
United States[edit]
HSN's U.S. operations are based in St. Petersburg, Florida, which houses its corporate headquarters, studio and broadcasting facilities. Additional call center facilities are located in Roanoke, Virginia & Toledo, Ohio. Distribution centers are situated in Roanoke, Piney Flats, Tennessee, and Fontana, California in order to ensure rapid delivery of items.
HSN also operates retail outlet stores in Orlando, Brandon, Bardmoor, Tampa and St. Petersburg (Emplorium). HSN broadcasts 24 hours a day, 364 days a year. On Christmas, a mix of special programming airs from Christmas Eve afternoon until midnight on December 25. For the first twelve years, a looping Yule log was aired from Noon Christmas Eve to Midnight December 26. The show allows members of the staff to go on camera with their families to say hello to relatives back home.
United Kingdom[edit]
HSN had a UK sister network called HSE, which has ceased operating.
Germany[edit]
HSN has a sister network in Europe called HSE24. ("Home Shopping Europe")
Japan[edit]
HSN's sister network in Japan is known as The Shop Channel.
Canada[edit]
The Shopping Channel was launched in 1987 as Canadian Home Shopping Network (CHSN), HSN's sister network in Canada. In 1999, the station was sold to Rogers Communications and is no longer affiliated with HSN.
Philippines[edit]
Home Shopping Network is currently aired in the Philippines via Shop TV, a shopping channel owned by Solar Entertainment Corporation. It is also aired as a paid advertising block on GMA, GMA News TV, BEAM TV, AksyonTV and most of the channels owned by Solar Entertainment Corporation including Diva Universal Philippines which is a joint venture with NBCUniversal. In 2015, The HSN brand is no longer named on screen, but they used the shopping channel's name.
Italy[edit]
Home Shopping Europe was launched in Italy in 2001 as Home Shopping Europe, replacing H.O.T. Italia (when this acronym intended the television channel Home Order Television). In 2003, the frequencies of HSE were sold to Mediaset and the channel was renamed Mediashopping.[9] In 2011, Home Shopping Europe bought the channel back; the channel was renamed HSE24.
Technology[edit]
Call center[edit]
HSN National started life with a standard rotary phone system that concentrated calls to the front of the queue. This corresponded to the front row of order takers in the HSN Studio at the Levitz Center (so named as the location was a former Levitz furniture store) in Clearwater, Florida. After several months, this system was no longer adequate and HSN entered a phase where a phone system from GTE was used. HSN claimed that the systems' inability to handle the high call volumes resulted in a loss of business. HSN sued GTE for $1.5 billion. In a counter-libel suit, GTE claimed that HSN had slandered the company; GTE won a $100 million judgment. Both parties settled out of court.[10] In the interim, HSN found another telephone vendor to handle its call volume. The Rockwell corporation's Galaxy line of switches was used for the current call center (as well as the new locations in St. Petersburg).
HSN has an in-house call center in St. Petersburg, Florida, which mostly handles customer service calls. HSN also employs several hundred customer service representatives from work at home positions who take calls and place orders via HSN's customer service intranet. HSN also contracts call centers to handle its sales calls especially when HSN is broadcasting shows with highly popular items.
Interactive Voice Response[edit]
HSN was an early adopter of an Interactive Voice Response (IVR) system for order entry. This system allowed customers to place orders through the IVR rather than an agent. The original IVR was a product supplied by Precision Software, Incorporated (PSi) of St. Paul, Minnesota. The product made use of an Intel PC chassis and Dialogic boards for call termination. As the system also needed to communicate with the Burroughs mainframe, it used a serial connection to communicate with the online application. While PSi had off-the-shelf components, it required a great deal of customization to create scripts and interface with the order entry system. PSi ran up a high amount of hours and this caused HSN to actually purchase PSi rather than pay their bill. Once released, the system was branded TOOTIE (after the bicycle horn that show hosts used to help excite the audience and was the network's mascot up until the mid-1990s).
As the size of HSN's call center kept increasing, it decided to create a new IVR platform that could handle more load. As nothing available on the open market could handle the volume HSN required, the PSi subsidiary started work on a customer platform called the TSP. This platform was installed in HSN's new facility and could handle a large number of T1 lines (each T1 has a capacity of 24 separate callers). This system originally communicated through a Stratus computer (acting as a poll/select terminal gateway) to the mainframe, but this was later changed to a direct TCP/IP connection. This system was dubbed Tootie II internally.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

It also includes an industry comparison table to see how your stock compares to its expanded industry, and the S&P 500.
Researching stocks has never been so easy or insightful as with the ZER Analyst and Snapshot reports.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Disappointed

This ring is beautiful to look at and the rubies are outstanding.  However, it snags on almost everything.  Two of my silk blouses have been ruined.

About HSN, INC.

   No need to worry about normal business hours when shopping with this retailer. Known to night owls and from-the-couch shoppers as Home Shopping Network, HSN Inc. (HSNi) sells more than 50,000 types of apparel and accessories, jewelry, electronics, housewares, health, beauty, and fitness products through its home shopping television network with 95 million US viewers, and through fast-growing HSN.com. Its Cornerstone Brands business is a catalog and Internet retailer whose brands include Garnet Hill, Ballard Designs, and TravelSmith. Overall, about 50% of HSNi's total sales come from home-related product sales, while nearly 30% comes from beauty and health product sales. In 2015, 50% of HSNi's total sales came from its e-commerce channels.
   Operations

   HSNi operates two main segments: HSN and Cornerstone. The HSN segment, which includes broadcast and online media activities, accounted for 69% of sales during 2015. The HSN segment also includes HSN.com, a transactional e-commerce site that sells merchandise offered on the HSN television networks, as well as select merchandise sold exclusively on HSN.com. The e-commerce site, which features more than 50,000 product videos available for sale, has grown to account for more than 40% of HSN's total sales (as of early 2016).
  

   The Cornerstone Brands segment (31% of sales) sells through its catalogs, websites, and 14 retail stores. Cornerstone's home and apparel lifestyle brands include Ballard Designs, Chasing Fireflies, Frontgate, Garnet Hill, Grandin Road, Improvements, and TravelSmith. The segment's e-commerce channel accounted for 69% of its sales during 2015.
  

   In 2015, HSNi had affiliation agreements with 87 broadcast television stations for leased carriage of the HSN television network with terms ranging from several weeks to several years. Subsidiary Ventana Television also owns 25 broadcast television stations that carry the HSN television networks on a full-time basis. HSN2 (launched in 2010) is a network that distributes taped programming on a limited distribution basis.
  
Geographic Reach

   HSNi serves customers across the US from leased fulfillment centers in Fontana, California; Roanoke, Virginia; Ronkonkoma, New York; and Greeneville, Tennessee. It also has five outlet stores and various administrative offices and data centers across the US. Cornerstone leases fulfillment centers in West Chester, Ohio; Monroe, Ohio; and Phoenix.
  
Sales and Marketing

   HSNi offers retail experiences on TV, online, via mobile devices, in catalogs, and in brick and mortar stores. Cornerstone distributes 330 million catalogs annually (as of 2016), operates eight separate digital sales sites and operates 14 retail and outlet stores.
  

   HSNi has multi-year distribution and affiliation agreements with cable television, Telco and DBS operators, to carry HSN television networks, as well as to promote the networks by carrying related commercials and distributing related marketing materials to their respective subscriber bases. HSN's larger pay television operators include Comcast, DirecTV, Echostar/DISH, and Time Warner Cable.
  

   The company has been ramping up its advertising spend to support sales in recent years. It spent $288.5 million during 2015, up from $279.6 million and $268 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively.
  
Financial Performance

   HSNi's sales have risen more than 20% since 2011 thanks largely to sales growth from the home-related product category (which includes home, electronics, culinary, and similar home goods) and strong online channel sales growth.
  

   The company's revenue climbed 3% to $3.7 billion during 2015 with sales growth across all categories except jewelry, with most of the growth continuing to come from HSN's rising Home-related product sales. Cornerstone's sales rose 3% thanks to increased home product and Garnet Hill-brand sales growth, though Chasing Fireflies and TravelSmith-brand sales declined. Digital sales from HSN.com and Cornerstone grew 7% for the year, and accounted for 50% of total sales, up from 48% in 2014.
  

   Despite revenue growth in 2015, HSNi's net income dipped 2% to $169 million as its overhead, interest expenses, and sales and marketing costs rose during the year. The company's operating cash levels climbed 47% to $203 million for the year thanks to positive working capital changes, as HSNi used less cash toward building inventories and accounts receivables balances than in 2014.
  
Strategy

   Harnessing star power to sell products, HSNi regularly participates in joint marketing and promotional partnerships with major motion picture companies as well as well-known recording artists. HSNi also creates strategic alliances with world-class, consumer brands in an effort to reach new prospects through relevant brand integration and occasion-based event marketing.
  

   In 2016, for example, HSNi partnered with DreamWorks Animation to begin offering
   
    Kung Fu Panda 3
   
   inspired products.
  

   In 2015, it inked a deal with Margaritaville Enterprises to offer
   
    Margaritaville
   
   inspired culinary, home, electronics, beauty, and apparel products. That year HSNi also launched the 'Modern Princess Collection by Coco Rocha' as part of a marketing collaboration with Walt Disney Studios for the
   
    Cinderella
   
   movie. The capsule collection, which features some of HSN's top designers and brands across fashion, footwear, jewelry, accessories, home and beauty, is part of a larger assortment of merchandise inspired by the movie.
  

   In 2014, the company signed a multi-film marketing collaboration with Disney for three films,
   
    Maleficent
   
   ,
   
    Cinderella
   
   , and
   
    The Hundred-Foot Journey
   
   ; in 2013 it partnered with Disney on
   
    Oz The Great and Powerful
   
   . In 2013, the company and Univision teamed up to launch an integrated marketing partnership.
  
Company Background

   The HSN business, which generates more than two-thirds of the company's sales, boasts a flexible business model that enables the retailer to quickly change its merchandise mix to meet customer demand. Being able to react quickly allowed the company to weather the recession and remain profitable.
