        Here's what you get with every domain
      



            Private registration at no additional cost
          


              When you purchase or transfer a domain name, private registration is almost always an
              option (some domain name endings do not support this feature). If private
              registration is selected, we cover the cost of keeping your details private (e.g.
              your name, address, and other contact information). Learn more
              in the Help Center.





            Easy integration with top website builders
          


              When you purchase or transfer a domain to Google Domains, you can immediately start
              creating your website with one of our website building providers. Plans vary in cost,
              and options include secure and reliable hosting, customizable templates, and powerful
              features like drag & drop creation and mobile site-management. To
              learn more, visit the Help Center.

              .photography will become available. We will be working to provide you with as many

              started online. View all the available domain name endings in the Help Center.





            Customizable sub-domains
          


              Customize your domain with up to 100 sub-domains, such as blog.example.com and
              shop.example.com. This will allow you to create unique pages within your website.

            Fast, secure, and reliable Internet infrastructure with Google
          


              Every time you visit a website, your computer performs what's called a "DNS lookup".
              When you manage a domain with us, you get to use the same DNS servers as Google. This
              means your domain name will connect quickly and reliably to your website. We include
              10 million resolutions per year for each domain you register with Google Domains.
              Learn more in the Help Center.





            Simple domain management tools
          


              A full set of simple-to-use, robust domain management tools are at your disposal:
            

Set up Dynamic DNS to keep your domain pointing to the same computer even when
              the IP address changes
              
Add and manage resource records: A, AAAA, CNAME, MX, NS, PTR, SOA, SPF, SRV, TXT
              
Use Google Synthetic Records for integration with Google App Engine, subdomain
              forwarding, and Google Apps setup

Domain purchase and registration
Google Domains offers domains at a price per year of registration determined by the domain ending or top-level domain (TLD), like ".com", ".org", or ".company". See the table of supported TLDs and prices for the list of prices.
Renewing your domain
You can renew your domain manually before it expires, or automatically each year. If you set up automatic renewal, you will receive a notification email before each renewal with the opportunity to cancel.
You can buy up to ten years of registration in advance (five years for some domains, like .co and .io. See the list below for exceptions). For example, if you buy .com domain for $12 you can buy two years of registration for $24 or ten years for $120. You can auto-renew your domain every year for the same $12.
Note:

If you purchase a domain at a one-time promotional price or with a coupon, the renewal price will still be the regular market price for the domain (for example, $12 for a .com).
If your domain registration has been expired for longer than the grace period (30 days for most domains), there is usually an extra fee for restoring the expired domain.

See  Domain renewal and restoration for more information on renewing and restoring your domain.

Website building and web host partners
Google Domains offers you a choice of 3rd-party website building and web hosting companies. Each partner has their own list of plans and pricing. They are available on the Website tab  for your domain. See Web presence for more information on choosing a website builder.
G Suite integration
You can create user accounts for your domain and provide them with email, Google Drive, Google Sites, and many more features. See the G Suite website for information on pricing. See Integrate with G Suite for instructions on integrating your domain with G Suite.
Premium domains
Premium domains are domains offered for sale or resale at a premium price. There are two kinds of premium domains:

Aftermarket premium domains - These are domains offered for resale by owners for a premium price. Once you have purchased it, you can add multiple years of registration and renew at the regular price for the TLD of the domain (for example, $12 per year for a .com).
Registry premium domains - These are domains the registry is offering for a premium price. In most cases transfer, additional years of registration, renewal, and restoration are charged at a different price from the base price for the TLD—usually the same as the initial premium price.

              Customize your domain with up to 100 sub-domains, such as blog.example.com and
              shop.example.com. This will allow you to create unique pages within your website.
              Learn how to do this in the Help Center.





            Fast, secure, and reliable Internet infrastructure with Google
          


              Every time you visit a website, your computer performs what's called a "DNS lookup".
              When you manage a domain with us, you get to use the same DNS servers as Google. This
              means your domain name will connect quickly and reliably to your website. We include
              10 million resolutions per year for each domain you register with Google Domains.
              Learn more in the Help Center.





            Simple domain management tools
          


              A full set of simple-to-use, robust domain management tools are at your disposal:
            

Set up Dynamic DNS to keep your domain pointing to the same computer even when
              the IP address changes
              
Add and manage resource records: A, AAAA, CNAME, MX, NS, PTR, SOA, SPF, SRV, TXT
              
Use Google Synthetic Records for integration with Google App Engine, subdomain
              forwarding, and Google Apps setup
              
Add and manage name servers
              
Configure TTL
              
Domain locking
              





            Email forwarding
          


              Create up to 100 email aliases with your domain, such as help@yourdomain or
              sales@yourdomain, and have them forwarded to existing email accounts, like
              you@gmail.com. Learn how to do this in the Help Center.

              registration is selected, we cover the cost of keeping your details private (e.g.
              your name, address, and other contact information). Learn more
              in the Help Center.

Domain purchase and registration
Google Domains offers domains at a price per year of registration determined by the domain ending or top-level domain (TLD), like ".com", ".org", or ".company". See the table of supported TLDs and prices for the list of prices.
Renewing your domain
You can renew your domain manually before it expires, or automatically each year. If you set up automatic renewal, you will receive a notification email before each renewal with the opportunity to cancel.
You can buy up to ten years of registration in advance (five years for some domains, like .co and .io. See the list below for exceptions). For example, if you buy .com domain for $12 you can buy two years of registration for $24 or ten years for $120. You can auto-renew your domain every year for the same $12.
Note:

If you purchase a domain at a one-time promotional price or with a coupon, the renewal price will still be the regular market price for the domain (for example, $12 for a .com).
If your domain registration has been expired for longer than the grace period (30 days for most domains), there is usually an extra fee for restoring the expired domain.

See  Domain renewal and restoration for more information on renewing and restoring your domain.

Website building and web host partners
Google Domains offers you a choice of 3rd-party website building and web hosting companies. Each partner has their own list of plans and pricing. They are available on the Website tab  for your domain. See Web presence for more information on choosing a website builder.
G Suite integration
You can create user accounts for your domain and provide them with email, Google Drive, Google Sites, and many more features. See the G Suite website for information on pricing. See Integrate with G Suite for instructions on integrating your domain with G Suite.
Premium domains
Premium domains are domains offered for sale or resale at a premium price. There are two kinds of premium domains:

Aftermarket premium domains - These are domains offered for resale by owners for a premium price. Once you have purchased it, you can add multiple years of registration and renew at the regular price for the TLD of the domain (for example, $12 per year for a .com).
Registry premium domains - These are domains the registry is offering for a premium price. In most cases transfer, additional years of registration, renewal, and restoration are charged at a different price from the base price for the TLD—usually the same as the initial premium price.
