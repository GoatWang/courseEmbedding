History[edit]
Gilat Satellite Networks was founded in 1987 by brothers Joshua and Amiram Levinberg, Yoel Gat, Shlomo Tirosh, Arik Keshet, and Gideon Kaplan.[4] In its early days, Gilat struggled to compete with larger and better-established companies the likes of EchoStar.[5]
In 1998, Gilat was involved in founding Global Village Telecom (GVT), a company that build a satellite-based phone network for remote locations in South America using the VSAT technology that was developed by Gilat. During 1998 and 1999 GVT won tenders to build rural phone networks in Colombia,[6] Chile and Peru[7]
In 2000, Gilat introduced an innovation involving VSAT technology allowing remote locations, such as the Havasupai Reservation in Arizona and rural communities in Brazil, to access the internet at high speeds.[8][9] In February 2000, Gilat and Microsoft announced that they are co-developing a two-way satellite broadband service for consumer purposes. The satellite service delivered Internet connections at speeds of up to 1.5 Mbps and did not require a second telephone line. A new company, Gilat-To-Home, was established to deliver the broadband two-way satellite service and Microsoft took an initial 26 percent stake in the company with an investment of US$50 million.[10] In September 2000, Gilat-To-Home changed its name to StarBand Communications and received an investment of $50 million from EchoStar, who received an equity stake of 32 percent in StarBand.[11]
In 2011, Gilat announced the creation of a new division, headed by Brigadier General (Res.) Moshe Tamir, expanding its presence in the U.S. defense market.[12]

History[edit]
Gilat Satellite Networks was founded in 1987 by brothers Joshua and Amiram Levinberg, Yoel Gat, Shlomo Tirosh, Arik Keshet, and Gideon Kaplan.[4] In its early days, Gilat struggled to compete with larger and better-established companies the likes of EchoStar.[5]
In 1998, Gilat was involved in founding Global Village Telecom (GVT), a company that build a satellite-based phone network for remote locations in South America using the VSAT technology that was developed by Gilat. During 1998 and 1999 GVT won tenders to build rural phone networks in Colombia,[6] Chile and Peru[7]
In 2000, Gilat introduced an innovation involving VSAT technology allowing remote locations, such as the Havasupai Reservation in Arizona and rural communities in Brazil, to access the internet at high speeds.[8][9] In February 2000, Gilat and Microsoft announced that they are co-developing a two-way satellite broadband service for consumer purposes. The satellite service delivered Internet connections at speeds of up to 1.5 Mbps and did not require a second telephone line. A new company, Gilat-To-Home, was established to deliver the broadband two-way satellite service and Microsoft took an initial 26 percent stake in the company with an investment of US$50 million.[10] In September 2000, Gilat-To-Home changed its name to StarBand Communications and received an investment of $50 million from EchoStar, who received an equity stake of 32 percent in StarBand.[11]
In 2011, Gilat announced the creation of a new division, headed by Brigadier General (Res.) Moshe Tamir, expanding its presence in the U.S. defense market.[12]

History[edit]
Gilat Satellite Networks was founded in 1987 by brothers Joshua and Amiram Levinberg, Yoel Gat, Shlomo Tirosh, Arik Keshet, and Gideon Kaplan.[4] In its early days, Gilat struggled to compete with larger and better-established companies the likes of EchoStar.[5]
In 1998, Gilat was involved in founding Global Village Telecom (GVT), a company that build a satellite-based phone network for remote locations in South America using the VSAT technology that was developed by Gilat. During 1998 and 1999 GVT won tenders to build rural phone networks in Colombia,[6] Chile and Peru[7]
In 2000, Gilat introduced an innovation involving VSAT technology allowing remote locations, such as the Havasupai Reservation in Arizona and rural communities in Brazil, to access the internet at high speeds.[8][9] In February 2000, Gilat and Microsoft announced that they are co-developing a two-way satellite broadband service for consumer purposes. The satellite service delivered Internet connections at speeds of up to 1.5 Mbps and did not require a second telephone line. A new company, Gilat-To-Home, was established to deliver the broadband two-way satellite service and Microsoft took an initial 26 percent stake in the company with an investment of US$50 million.[10] In September 2000, Gilat-To-Home changed its name to StarBand Communications and received an investment of $50 million from EchoStar, who received an equity stake of 32 percent in StarBand.[11]
In 2011, Gilat announced the creation of a new division, headed by Brigadier General (Res.) Moshe Tamir, expanding its presence in the U.S. defense market.[12]

The prediction is that this market will be $10B in next 8 years. And obviously Gilat intends to be the major player here. Given the quality of Israeli engineers this as well may happen.

The project will trial and assess these through live testbed demonstrations across Europe. The 30-month project is starting in June 2017.Since 5G is regarded as the future standard for the cellular communication, this project is essential for Gilat and can open plenty of opportunities in this very important market.

Their subscribers will get access to the network at a rate of up to 20 Mbit/s in the forward link, and up to 5 Mbit/s in the return link, without any limitations for the downloaded/ transmitted traffic.MoreReply21ssmkcstrIs Apple in the satellite communication business?It looks like. There is plenty of talk that Apple intends (possible with the help of Boeing, that has the same plans) to provide broadband access through more than 1,000 satellites in low-earth orbit.At the annual Satellite 2017 conference in Washington D.C. last month, industry insiders said Boeing's project was being funded by Apple, Tim Farrar, a satellite and telecom consultant at TMF Associates Inc., wrote in a recent blog. "It's not hard to discern why Apple might want to consider a satellite constellation," Farrar wrote, noting a Wall Street Journal report that Elon Musk's Space Exploration Technologies Corp. has forecast $30 billion in revenue from satellite internet by 2025.Apple has recruited a pair of top Google satellite executives for a new hardware team, suggesting they are serious about it.Well, this activity can be very positive for Gilat, the company’s know-how and products.
