Neighborhood - Pleasant Valley







Home of the Original Mardi Gras, Mobile hosts the oldest Carnival celebration in the United States every year. Mobile was the first capital of French Louisiana in the early 18th century and was once referred to as the Paris of the South. The site of many milestones in American history, modern-day Mobile contains several museums that would delight any history buff. From the History Museum of Mobile to the USS Alabama Battleship Memorial Park, there are plenty of opportunities to dig deeper into the rich cultural history of the third largest city in Alabama today.

Entertainment abounds in Mobile. Residents can watch a performance at Soul Kitchen Music Hall, Saenger Theatre Mobile, or Crescent Theater. Shoppers relish the ever-present deals at Springdale Mall, the Shoppes at Bel Air, and Festival Centre. Outdoor enthusiasts savor access to many parks and nearby Gulf Shores beaches. Foodies enjoy the expansive array of international cuisine and brunch spots available throughout the city.

Neighborhood - Pleasant Valley







Home of the Original Mardi Gras, Mobile hosts the oldest Carnival celebration in the United States every year. Mobile was the first capital of French Louisiana in the early 18th century and was once referred to as the Paris of the South. The site of many milestones in American history, modern-day Mobile contains several museums that would delight any history buff. From the History Museum of Mobile to the USS Alabama Battleship Memorial Park, there are plenty of opportunities to dig deeper into the rich cultural history of the third largest city in Alabama today.

Entertainment abounds in Mobile. Residents can watch a performance at Soul Kitchen Music Hall, Saenger Theatre Mobile, or Crescent Theater. Shoppers relish the ever-present deals at Springdale Mall, the Shoppes at Bel Air, and Festival Centre. Outdoor enthusiasts savor access to many parks and nearby Gulf Shores beaches. Foodies enjoy the expansive array of international cuisine and brunch spots available throughout the city.
