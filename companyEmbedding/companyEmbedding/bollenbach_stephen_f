He lived primarily in East Hampton, N.Y., and also had homes in New York and Paris.Mr. Bollenbach was chief executive of the Hilton Hotels Corporation from 1996 until 2007, when he retired. He presided over the acquisition of the Bally Entertainment Corporation, giving the company a presence in Atlantic City, as well as the reunification of Hilton’s American and international properties and the expansion of its franchise business.The Hilton Hotels company was sold in 2007 to the Blackstone Group, a private-equity powerhouse, for $26 billion.

Mr. Bollenbach took the helm at Hilton after overseeing the finances of several other companies, including the Trump Organization. It appointed Mr. Bollenbach its first chief financial officer in 1990, and he quickly moved to change how Mr. Trump financed his empire of buildings, Atlantic City casinos, hotels and an airline, which was crumbling at the time.

Those measures, which included debt-for-equity swaps and the sale or planned bankruptcy of some of the Trump Organization’s flagging assets, were credited at that time with helping Mr. Trump avoid personal bankruptcy.“The work I had to do for Donald is really finished,” Mr. Bollenbach said in a 1992 interview when he left the Trump Organization and returned to the Marriott Corporation, where he became its chief financial officer. “The financial restructuring is done.”Mr. Bollenbach was long praised for his financial skills. As chief financial officer of Walt Disney in 1995, he persuaded its executives that the company could afford to take on the debt necessary to acquire Capital Cities/ABC. The acquisition was among the biggest media deals ever at the time.When he became chief executive of Hilton the following year, he was the first person outside of the Hilton family to hold that position.

About Hilton College



Stephen F. Bollenbach 
Former Co-Chairman & CEO of Hilton Hotels Corporation



Stephen F. Bollenbach joined the Hilton Hotels Corporation in February 1996 as CEO, a position he held until his retirement in 2007. In May 2004, he was named co-chairman. During his tenure with Hilton Hotels, Bollenbach oversaw a complete transformation of the company, including developing new sales and marketing alliances, acquiring Bally Entertainment and amassing $1.5 billion in hotel real estate.Under Bollenbach’s leadership at the Hilton Hotels Corporation, the company developed a marketing alliance between Hilton Hotels and Hilton International (owner of the Hilton brand outside the United States), which reunited the brands for the first time in 34 years. With the acquisition of Bally Entertainment, Hilton also became the world’s largest gaming company—Hilton’s gaming arm later became Caesars Entertainment Corporation. Hilton also acquired Promus Hotel Corporation, adding 1,400 hotels and several well-known hospitality brands, including Doubletree, Embassy Suites Hotels, Hampton and Homewood Suites by Hilton to the company’s portfolio of properties.At the time of Bollenbach’s 2005 induction into the Hospitality Industry Hall of Honor, the company had grown to encompass more than 2,100 hotels and 330,000 rooms under different brands. Before joining Hilton, Bollenbach served as CEO of the Trump Organization, CEO of the Host Marriott Corporation, an organization he helped create in 1993 by leading an innovative restructuring of the Marriott Corporation; and senior executive vice president and chief financial officer of The Walt Disney Company. While at Disney, Bollenbach was instrumental in the $19 billion acquisition of Capital Cities/ABC—at the time, the second-largest acquisition in U.S. business history.

Hospitality Industry Hall of Honor

Recognizing industry leaders since 1996, the Hospitality Industry Hall of Honor is an exceptional educational resource for students pursuing careers in hospitality management, for people working in the profession and for individuals interested in one of the world's leading industries.
The more than 60 men and women who’ve been inducted into the Hall of Honor—names like J.W. Marriott, Conrad N. Hilton, Ray Kroc, Ernest and Julio Gallo, Walt Disney and Vernon Stouffer—represent the world’s most successful hospitality companies and most recognizable brands.
Every year, Hilton College hosts a formal reception, induction ceremony and dinner for a new class of inductees. Those events, along with a series of industry-related “Think Tanks,” are planned and executed by a team of student managers.
The Hall of Honor Gallery, located off the main lobby of the Hilton University of Houston, features specially commissioned portraits of each inductee by artist Robert Lapsley. Personal papers, memorabilia and corporate histories are archived and displayed in the Massad Family Library Research Center and Hospitality Industry Archives at Hilton College to memorialize the inductees' achievements and leadership—providing a lasting tribute to the companies they conceived and built during their lifetimes.
On Tuesday, October 17, the 22nd Annual Hospitality Industry Hall of Honor will feature “A Taste of Hilton College” honoring alumni. More details to come!

Industry Update




Press Release 6 September 2007Lodging Industry Leader Stephen F. Bollenbach To Receive ALIS Lifetime Achievement Award

Washington, D.C. | Stephen F. Bollenbach, co-chairman and CEO of Hilton Hotels, will be honored with the Lifetime Achievement Award at the Americas Lodging Investment Summit (ALIS), January 28–30, 2008, at the Hyatt Regency Century Plaza in Los Angeles, Calif. Bollenbach will receive the prestigious award in recognition of his remarkable accomplishments in the lodging industry and across the spectrum of business, as well as his dedication and service to the community.

Bollenbach is one of the hotel industry's most respected and successful leaders. Since joining Hilton, Bollenbach has overseen a complete transformation of the company, including the acquisition of Bally Entertainment, which made Hilton the world’s largest gaming company, and the acquisition of $1.5 billion of hotel real estate in markets with high barriers to entry. He also spun off Hilton’s gaming operations in a tax-free transaction to shareholders to form Park Place Entertainment (formerly Caesars Entertainment, Inc., now Harrah’s Entertainment, Inc.) and acquired Promus Hotel Corporation. The Promus acquisition added 1,400 hotels and several well-known hospitality brands including Doubletree, Embassy Suites Hotels, Hampton, and Homewood Suites by Hilton to Hilton’s portfolio of outstanding properties. In 2006, the company acquired the lodging assets of Hilton Group, plc, reuniting the Hilton brand for the first time in more than 40 years and making Hilton Hotels Corporation the world’s largest hotel company.

Before joining Hilton, Bollenbach’s accomplishments included execution of The Walt Disney Company’s acquisition of Capital Cities/ABC; an innovative restructuring of the Marriott Corporation resulting in two companies - Host Marriott and Marriott International; and a distinguished history of successes in the financial arena with banks, investment businesses, and the Trump Organization.
Co-hosted by the American Hotel & Lodging Association (AH&LA) and the Burba Hotel Network (BHN), the two-and-a-half-day event features an extensive array of seminars and panels hosted by leading experts and investors discussing important trends and identifying new opportunities. The conference attracts the lodging industry’s leading hotel executives, investors, lenders, developers and professional advisory community. Proceeds from ALIS will benefit the educational, research, and training missions of the American Hotel & Lodging Educational Foundation, AH&LA’s not-for-profit affiliate.
Online registration is available now via the ALIS Website, . An early registration discount of $150 is available through September 28, 2007. For general event information and sponsorship opportunities, contact Jonathon Zink, BHN conference manager, at (714) 540-9300 or jzink@burba.com or visit the ALIS Website at .


Serving the hospitality industry for nearly a century, AH&LA is the sole national association representing all sectors and stakeholders in the lodging industry, including individual hotel property members, hotel companies, student and faculty members, and industry suppliers. Headquartered in Washington, D.C., AH&LA provides members with national advocacy on Capitol Hill, public relations and image management, education, research and information, and other value-added services to provide bottom line savings and ensure a positive business climate for the lodging industry. Partner state associations provide local representation and additional cost-saving benefits to members.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
