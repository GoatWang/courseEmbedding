The net proceeds to us from the sale of the shares are estimated to be
approximately $15,500 if only half of the Shares offered herein are sold, and
$31,000 if the entire offering is sold. However, there are no assurances we will
be able to sell any of the Shares offered herein.

The net proceeds of this offering will be used for marketing and working
capital. To the extent that less than the maximum amount is attained, the amount
of offering proceeds applied to the aforesaid categories are expected to be
reduced pro rata. The following table sets forth the intended use of the
estimated net proceeds of the offering, budgeted to cover a twelve-month period.

                                                  Approximate           Approximate

Application of Proceeds                           (50% sold)            (100% sold)           Offering

(1) These funds will be used to market via Orthodontic and Dental Magazines and  
    online marketing.                         

(2) Includes general and administrative expenses, as well as costs associated    
    with our becoming a reporting company under the Securities Act of 1933, as   
    amended, and costs associated with having out Common Stock approved for      
    trading.                                                                     

None of the proposed allocations set forth in the foregoing table is a firm
commitment by us. Projected expenditures are estimations or approximations only.
Actual expenditures will differ from projected expenditures if: (1) less than
the maximum offering is sold; (2) more funds than estimated are required to
accomplish the objectives set by management in a particular area; (3) a
particular objective can be obtained with less funding than anticipated; or (4)
the objectives set by management are determined to be unobtainable. To the
extent that the proposed objectives cannot be achieved for the scheduled
amounts, management may draw supplemental amounts from other categories of
estimated expenses (if available), from operating revenues (if any) or from
additional financing, the availability of which cannot be assured. Any amounts
not expended for scheduled purposes will be reallocated for general corporate
purposes. In the event we are not successful in selling all of the Units offered
herein, the amount allocated in the above table will be reduced proportionately
to the amount of proceeds actually received.

The foregoing table does not give effect to any operating profits that we may
realize during the next 12 month period. If, in fact, working capital is
generated through operations (which cannot be assured) then additional funds
will be available to accomplish the corporate objectives.

Management believes that the proceeds of this offering plus operating revenues
will satisfy our net capital and cash requirements for at least 12 months
following the completion of this offering, provided that all of the Units
offered herein are sold. Even if all of the Units are sold, it is anticipated
they may need to obtain additional financing, either debt or equity, in order to
fully implement our business plan described herein. We do not have existing
arrangements to raise additional capital through bank loans or otherwise should
it be needed. There can be no assurance that any additional funds could be
secured on terms favorable to us, or that they could be secured at all.


We face competition from larger, better-financed and national brands, including
Televox, Sesame Communications, and The Online Practice. There are numerous
other marketing and web design companies. All of these companies and most of our
other competitors have significantly greater resources, both financial and
otherwise than available to us.


Company Description
We are a digital design and media company which develops and maintains websites
and is a provider of marketing communications services to customers in the
United States. We conduct our operations primarily through Smile Producer, Inc.,
our wholly owned subsidiary company.

We provide a range of

graphics and client website construction, interactive and mobile marketing,

streams, marketing services and website hosting subscriptions.
