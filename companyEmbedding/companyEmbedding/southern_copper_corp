					Full Description



Southern Copper Corporation, incorporated on September 7, 1995, is an integrated copper producer. The Company principally produces copper and, in the production process, obtains several by-products, including molybdenum, silver, zinc, sulfuric acid and other metals. It operates through three segments: the Peruvian operations, the Mexican open-pit operations and the Mexican underground mining operations segment identified as the IMMSA unit. The Peruvian operations segment includes the Toquepala and Cuajone mine complexes, and the smelting and refining plants, including a metals plant industrial railroad and port facilities that service both mines. The Mexican open-pit operations segment includes the La Caridad and Buenavista mine complexes, and the smelting and refining plants, including a metals plant and a copper rod plant, and support facilities that service both mines. As of December 31, 2016, the Mexican underground mining operations segment included five underground mines that produce zinc, copper, silver and gold, a coal mine and a zinc refinery. The Company's operations include open-pit and underground mining, concentrating, copper smelting, copper refining, copper rod production, solvent extraction/electrowinning (SX-EW), zinc refining, sulfuric acid production, molybdenum concentrate production, and silver and gold refining.The Company's San Luis Potosi electrolytic zinc refinery is located in the city of San Luis Potosi, in the state of San Luis Potosi, Mexico. The city of San Luis Potosi is connected to its refinery by a major highway. It conducts its primary operations in Peru through a registered branch (the Peruvian Branch or Branch or SPCC Peru Branch). The Company's Mexican operations are conducted through subsidiaries. The Company also conducts exploration activities in Argentina, Chile, Ecuador, Mexico and Peru.Peruvian operationsThe Peruvian copper operations segment involves mining, milling and flotation of copper ore to produce copper concentrates and molybdenum concentrates; the smelting of copper concentrates to produce anode copper, and the refining of anode copper to produce copper cathodes. As part of this production process, it also produces amounts of molybdenum concentrate and sulfuric acid. Its precious metals plant at the Ilo refinery produces refined silver, gold, and other materials. Additionally, it produces refined copper using solvent extraction/electrowinning technology (SX-EW). It operates the Toquepala and Cuajone open-pit mines high in the Andes Mountains, approximately 860 kilometers southeast of the city of Lima, Peru. It also operates a smelter and refinery west of the Toquepala and Cuajone mines in the coastal city of Ilo, Peru.The Company's Toquepala operations consist of an open-pit copper mine and a concentrator. It also refines copper at the SX-EW facility through a leaching process. Toquepala is located in southern Peru, 30 kilometers from Cuajone and 870 kilometers from Lima, at an altitude of 3,220 meters above sea level. The deposit is part of a mineral district that contains two additional known deposits, Cuajone and Quellaveco. The deposit is in a territory with intrusive and eruptive activities of rhyolitic and andesitic rocks. Ore minerals include chalcopyrite (CuFeS2), chalcosine (Cu2S) and molybdenite (MoS2). The SX-EW facility at Toquepala produces electrowon copper cathodes. Its Ilo smelter produces copper anodes for the refinery the Company operates as part of the same facility. The Ilo refinery consists of an electrolytic plant, a precious metal plant and various ancillary installations. The refinery produces copper cathode.Mexican open-pit operationsThe Mexican open-pit segment operations combine two units of Minera Mexico S.A. de C.V. (Minera Mexico), La Caridad and Buenavista. Its Mexican operations are conducted through its subsidiary, Minera Mexico, which engages primarily in the mining and processing of copper, molybdenum, zinc, silver, gold and lead. Minera Mexico operates through subsidiaries that are grouped into over three separate units. Mexicana de Cobre S.A. de C.V. (together with its subsidiaries, the La Caridad unit) operates La Caridad, an open-pit copper mine, a copper ore concentrator, a SX-EW plant, a smelter, refinery and a rod plant. The La Caridad refinery has a metals plant, which produces refined silver, gold and other materials. Operadora de Minas e Instalaciones Mineras S.A de C.V. (the Buenavista unit) operates Buenavista, an open-pit copper mine and a copper concentrator. The Buenavista unit operates a leaching facility and over three SX-EW plants. The La Caridad complex includes an open-pit mine, concentrator, smelter, copper refinery, precious metals refinery, rod plant, SX-EW plant, lime plant and over two sulfuric acid plants.

Major operations[edit]
The firm's operations are primarily within southern Peru and northern Mexico.
Operations in southern Peru[edit]
Southern Peruvian operations include the mines located at the Cuajone and Toquepala mines. The two mines produced a total of 359,655 tons of copper in 2007, with Cuajone producing 182,117 tons and Toquepala producing 177,538 tons respectively.
A recent[when?] strike at the largest mine, Cuajone, was suspended pending mediation between the two parties.[citation needed]
Tia Maria is a copper project mine which has been granted the environmental approval by the Peruvian Ministry of Energy and Mining (MINEM) to move forward with the project development. Geoservice Ingeniería was the engineering and consulting firm in charge of executing satisfactory the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) studies, the EIA approval was received on August 1, 2014 with directorial resolution Nº392-2014-MEM/DGA-AM given by MINEM.[1]
The social protest against the project started in March 2015, causing tens of injuries and up to the beginning of May 2015, two deaths[2] have also led to massive strikes and road blocks in the region. Local farmers fear the open-pit project will contaminate water supplies and cover their crops in dust.[3]
Operations in Mexico[edit]
The Cananea Mine, located in northern Mexico, produced 98,503 tons of copper in 2007. It is among the world's largest copper mines in terms of reserves, and has the longest remaining mine life of any major open-pit copper mine in the world, based on current production levels.
La Caridad Mine, located in northern Mexico, produced 124,972 tons of copper in 2007.

Mining and metals stocks rally on higher copper, gold prices; Freeport McMoRan up 3.5% to lead S&P 500
Shares of mining and metals companies got a boost Monday from rising copper prices, after Chinese GDP and industrial production data beat expectations. Copper for September delivery rose 1.7% to $2.7355 a pound on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, their highest level since early March. Gold was also higher with August contracts up 0.5% at $1,233.50 a troy ounce. Adding to the updraft, Jefferies on Friday said it expects a significant increase in capital returns from metals and mining companies this earnings season as balance sheets are strong and cash is abundant. Jefferies named Freeport McMoRan as one of its top picks. Freeport stock  surged 3.8% to lead S&P 500 gainers.  Newmont Mining  rose 1.2%, and Southern Copper Corp.  gained 2.3%. Rio Tinto ADRs  were up 1%. The iPath Bloomberg Copper Subindex Total Return ETN  was up 1.1%, while the S&P 500  was flat.

Mining and metals stocks rally on higher copper, gold prices; Freeport McMoRan up 3.5% to lead S&P 500
Shares of mining and metals companies got a boost Monday from rising copper prices, after Chinese GDP and industrial production data beat expectations. Copper for September delivery rose 1.7% to $2.7355 a pound on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, their highest level since early March. Gold was also higher with August contracts up 0.5% at $1,233.50 a troy ounce. Adding to the updraft, Jefferies on Friday said it expects a significant increase in capital returns from metals and mining companies this earnings season as balance sheets are strong and cash is abundant. Jefferies named Freeport McMoRan as one of its top picks. Freeport stock  surged 3.8% to lead S&P 500 gainers.  Newmont Mining  rose 1.2%, and Southern Copper Corp.  gained 2.3%. Rio Tinto ADRs  were up 1%. The iPath Bloomberg Copper Subindex Total Return ETN  was up 1.1%, while the S&P 500  was flat.
