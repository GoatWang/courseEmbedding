NASDAQ:BIIB 






CAMBRIDGE, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Biogen Idec (Nasdaq: BIIB) today named Hans Peter Hasler Chief Operating        Officer (COO) of the company. Mr. Hasler, age 52, has served as        Executive Vice President, Global Neurology and Head of International. In        his new role, Mr. Hasler will oversee all commercial operations as well        as the company’s business development function.       “In view of the continued expansion of our        commercial businesses, and the advances of our extensive pipeline, it is        important to further integrate Biogen Idec’s        commercial units,” said James C. Mullen,        Biogen Idec’s Chief Executive Officer. “Bringing        together these businesses to enhance our commercial and new product        opportunities on a global basis is a logical step in the continued        implementation of our growth strategy – and        Hans Peter Hasler is the ideal person to fill this new organizational        role. Over the last few years, Hans Peter has led the great success and        growth of our business outside the U.S. I am confident that we will        continue meeting and exceeding our goals under his strong and capable        leadership.”         Since assuming responsibilities for Biogen Idec’s        International business in 2003, the company’s        sales outside the U.S. have grown at a compound annual rate of 23        percent between 2004 and 2007. A stated strategic goal of Biogen Idec is        to continue the geographic diversification of the company’s        revenue base, with more than 40 percent of revenue coming from our        International business by the end of year 2010.             Hans Peter Hasler joined Biogen in 2001 from Wyeth Pharmaceuticals where        he worked for eight years, serving since 1998 as Senior Vice President,        Head of Global Strategic Marketing. He was also a member of the Wyeth        Executive Committee and Chair of the Commercial Council. From 1993 to        1998, he served in senior management capacities, including Managing        Director of Wyeth Group, Germany; General Manager of Wyeth in        Switzerland; and General Manager of Central Eastern Europe. Prior to        joining Wyeth, Mr. Hasler held several positions at Abbott AG and Sanofi        Pharma AG in Switzerland.       About Biogen Idec         Biogen Idec creates new standards of care in therapeutic areas with high        unmet medical needs.
