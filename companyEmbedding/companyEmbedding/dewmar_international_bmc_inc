Brand ManagementWarehousing and FulfillmentOur CompanyDewmar International BMC, Inc.
Dewmar International Brand Management Company, Inc. (“Dewmar”) is a U.S. based, veteran-owned brand management services and diversified operating company that specializes in developing, acquiring and/or licensing new products and brands for successful launch or distribution in both national and international markets.  Dewmar’s primary business strategy has been to transform high profit-margin brands traditionally reserved for niche consumer markets into more widely available general consumer brands while building a sustainable business growth model.
The Company’s flagship brand, Lean Slow Motion Potion, is rated as one of the top 3 selling relaxation brands in the United States of the purported over 100 plus relaxation brands currently available in the world market. Lean has sales grossing well over 5 million dollars and has been distributed and sold in 28 states and 3 countries, with successful continuous online sales.
The Company formed Health & Wellness Research Consortium (HWRC), LLC as a wholly owned subsidiary, to develop and market non-opioid, alternative therapies used to treat acute or chronic pain management.

The signing of the 2014 Agricultural Act (the “Farm Bill”) forecasts several strong groundbreaking opportunities for companies at the forefront of the industrial hemp and cannabidiol (CBD) industries for production and development of textiles, building materials, consumable goods, nutritional supplements and medicinal compounds.
Dewmar’s subsidiary, U.S. Hemp Corporation, has developed significant presence in this high demand space for the immediate and long-term future. We published Hemp Report I and Hemp Report II to outline our operations and achievements in this fledgling industry so full of opportunity.

Hemp Report I [Hemp Report I | March 31st, 2015]
In 2014, Dewmar International formed the United States Hemp Corporation, LLC (as a subsidiary) with a mission to become a best of breed incubator for hemp brands and products in the USA. We are proud to announce the U.S. Hemp Corporation (USHC) is making a lot of progress since its incorporation. The company recently launched www.USHempCorporation.com as its consumer website. The website offers a selection of the finest hemp beverages on the market including Canna Energy, C-Swiss Hemp Iced Tea and Chillo Hemp Energy. All of these products that we fulfill from USHC now are available for sale on Amazon.com.
The 2014 Farm Bill, aka the Agricultural Act of 2014, included a provision to allow some people to begin growing industrial hemp, provided it is for “purposes of research conducted under an agricultural pilot program or other agricultural or academic research,” and complies with state law.  The economics alone are enough to convince anyone.  Despite the fact that hemp farming has been illegal, the U.S. is the world’s biggest consumer of it, importing $580 million worth in 2013, with predicted double-digit percentage growth.  I believe that “a major change is coming” and my goal is to position Dewmar to be one of the first few companies to take full advantage of the wealth of opportunities early on as change occurs.
To properly position the Company, in addition to the website and products the U.S. Hemp Corporation launched the Hemp Incubator. It is the only Industrial Hemp focused business incubator in the world. With the U.S. Hemp Corporation office in Denver (and manufacturing near Boulder) we believe the location for the Hemp Incubator is ideal. We selected Colorado for the location of the Hemp Incubator because the area is known as the “Silicon Valley of Food” and “Epicenter of LOHAS.” It is at the nexus of the industrial hemp movement that is sweeping America, particularly with hemp consumer products. We are excited to announce the Hemp Incubator is fully operating and working to bring several products to market.
Hemp Brownies
The first-to-market product that will come out of the Hemp Incubator is our hemp-protein brownie eligible for sale in all 50 states.  Dewmar and Hemp, Inc. (OTCPink: HEMP) have partnered to improve this marvelous brand of brownie making them healthier, tastier, and more moist, than ever. We are working on final packaging and labeling, and are ordering additional machinery to help handle increased manufacturing volumes and efficiency. We urge all persons interested in being one of the first to gain access to an order of our brownies to SUBSCRIBE for our newsletter on our corporate website’s Home Page.  Dewmar International and our brownie co-manufacturing partner have discussed providing routine tours of our FDA regulated bakery for our investor community or simply to fans of our product some time later this year after we have ramped up production and have met our backlog demand on days that we may not be actively running batches of our brownies. We will send out an email blast to all registered subscribers about this opportunity as it surfaces.
CBD, HEMP SEEDS AND RESEARCH
The U.S. Hemp Corporation team is currently performing research and due-diligence on a variety of cannabinoid based therapeutics. The primary cannabinoid we are researching is cannabidiol (CBD). To date, more than 20 states and Washington D.C. have enacted law to legalize cannabidiol and other medical cannabis products. We believe CBDs offer incredible potential in both their healing applications and growing market demand. We invite universities, research institutions, distribution channels and other businesses who are interested in CBDs to contact the USHC.
The U.S Hemp Corporation understands the importance and need to help farmers gain access to seed and industrial hemp processing technology. The USHC will continue its efforts to work with companies, universities and state departments of agriculture in these areas through the Hemp Incubator.  I have spent much time over the past several months meeting with leading researchers at a number of top Universities across the country that have taken specific interests in new developments in CBD particularly in the states of Louisiana, Colorado and Mississippi. I have toured a number of existing and potential grow facilities, MIP licensed facilities, medical cannabis manufacturing facilities and research labs. Dewmar is currently actively seeking such facilities to lease or purchase as a long term investments for research partnerships, grants and new product developments along with some of the brightest scientific minds in the industry.
Politically, I am striving to make all of the right connections on the local, state and federal government levels to put our Company in a position to become more readily involved in CBD research, hemp farming, nutraceuticals, cosmoceutical and possibly even pharmaceuticals as it relates to the medicinal and industrial hemp movement.  Expect to see more developments in the upcoming months regarding these newly cultivated relationships. As Chair of the Mississippi District Export Council, I currently have immediate access to two very active staff members of the Mississippi Department of Agriculture & Commerce as part of my committee.  The state of Mississippi is making great strides and increased interest in the Industrial Hemp and medicinal cannabis movement.
Recently, USHC became a member of the Hemp Industries Association (HIA) and is a part of the Mississippi chapter which has a strong presence to lobby statewide government officials. The mission of the HIA is to represent the interests of the hemp industry and to encourage the research and development of new hemp products. Currently, Walmart.com sales over 1,500 hemp products of which only 26 of these products are within the Food department. I will speak in greater detail in our future CEO Message regarding our updated Walmart efforts and our plans to increase the hemp product lines for the worlds largest retailer.
Our goal would be to grow various strains of hemp with a primary focus on high CBD, low THC hemp oils for new product developments. We have already confirmed with top seed researchers in Colorado that we can have a pure high CBD/low THC hemp strain genetically customized for the 3 varied regions of Mississippi – Gulf Coast sands, fertile Piney Woods, and the flat planes Mississippi Delta. If we are successful at growing our own hemp plants to have a high seed protein yield, we would prefer to manufacture our hemp-based products in America and disseminate them across the country and abroad to counter the heavy importing of hemp oils from countries such as China or Canada. The long term objective is for Dewmar to be managing one of the largest industrial and organic hemp farms in the state of Mississippi.
Dewmar International recently became a member of Louisiana State University’s Dean Circle. Since Dewmar has received the prestigious LSU100 Award in 2013, I have been having contact with a number Chemists and the graduate studies program to test chemical compounds for further research.  I am glad to announce that we are now taking this a step further as I am now working with a top research scientist and plant geneticist from the pharmaceutical industry within LSU’s LBTC Business Incubator in sampling various CBD oil water solubility enzyme technologies.  I am hopeful to work with their leading researcher to potentially produce the first line of water-soluble CBD organic juices and functional food lines to help improve the health and quality of lives of individuals throughout the world. We anticipate to work closely with the LSU AgCenter  Food Incubator over the next few years to conduct food and beverage R&D for potential new product launches.
Industry Events
As a part of the website and Hemp Incubator launches, the USHC has attended multiple hemp industry events to establish its brand and services. Below are some of the recent events the USHC has attended.
November 10th, 2014: The Naturally Boulder Networking Night was designed to connect professionals in the Colorado natural food industry. The U.S. Hemp Corporation met with industry leaders to discuss FDA labeling requirements, food manufacturing and distribution channels.
November 15th, 2014: The Indo Expo Show was a full-spectrum cannabis event with exhibitors featuring cannabis cultivation, technology, lifestyle, education, industry services and industrial hemp.  The U.S. Hemp Corporation joined fellow U.S. based hemp businesses to build and support connections between wholesalers, retailers/buyers and the public.
Hemp Pitch Academy
December 17th, 2014: The Hemp Legislative Training Session provided attendees with helpful information to better understand how to offer input to the bill making process and update participants about upcoming industrial hemp related legislation. Congressman Jared Polis provided an update on hemp legislation being proposed at the federal level. For updates on his proposed legislation please see below.
January 15th, 2015: The RVC Hemp Pitch Academy was a half-day workshop designed to polish investor pitches, sharpen business strategy and provide a background on what investors are looking for and negotiating a successful deal. The Pitch Academy, designed in partnership with our friends at the Rocky Mountain Hemp Association, was specifically for “Hempreneurs” who are building companies within the rapidly growing industrial hemp sector in Colorado.  
I personally gained much insight at this conference on the fledgling companies entering the hemp industry, meeting a top hemp seed researcher from Colorado State University to share ideas was a bonus. My goal is to find some companies young enough to work into the auspices of USHC’s Hemp Incubator and we find the next diamond in the rough before they are exposed to potentially harmful and greedy investors who don’t put the best interest of the entrepreneur and their products first. This also gave me many ideas on how to help finance the efforts of USHC without causing any dilution for Dewmar investors.
Hemp Investor Briefing
March 5th, 2015: The Hemp Investor Briefing showcased opportunities for investors interested in the hemp industry. The 2-hour lunch briefing provided participating investors with in-depth knowledge about the diverse opportunities in the industrial hemp space. The event was sponsored by the Rocky Mountain Hemp Association and the U.S. Hemp Corporation’s investor program, the Hemp Investment Network.
Upcoming Industry Events:
As the hemp industry gains momentum, we’re excited to attend the following upcoming industry events.
April 4th, 2015 : The 2nd Annual NoCo Hemp Expo will take place at the Budweiser Events Complex in Loveland, Colorado. Now in its second year, the conference will include a hemp movie room, hemp food samples, hemp paper products and apparel, freshly brewed Colorado Hemp Beer, CBD hemp products and more. Don’t miss the original hemp-bodied sports car on display in Colorado for the first time in history! The US Hemp Corporation will be presenting our brownie product and hemp research project targeted for palliative and end of life care at the Investor/Founder Dinner the night before conference.
April 14-15: The Big Industry Show will be held in Denver, Colorado, and is this year’s must-attend show for retailers, wholesalers and distributers. The innovative B2B smoke shop tradeshow will feature the most dynamic and exciting vendors from across the country.
April 18-20: The U.S. Cannabis Cup in Denver is back and is bigger than ever with three days of 700+ vendors, three levels of VIP experiences, world-class musical entertainment, awards show and the biggest 4/20 party on the planet.
April 20-22: The Marijuana Investor Summit 2015 offers early adopters a deep dive into the legalized cannabis markets. Summit sessions and the pre-conference half-day boot camp will be taught by experts from both the investment industry and the successful entrepreneurs of the legal cannabis community.
June 1 – June 7: Now in its sixth year, Hemp History Week is a nation-wide education campaign and marketing program put on by the Hemp Industries Association. The week seeks to renew strong support for hemp farming in the U.S. while raising awareness about the benefits of hemp products. The 6th Annual campaign will include grass-roots events across the country, nationwide retail promotions, hemp plantings (in some states where hemp farming is legal under Section 7606 of the U.S. Farm Bill), documentary screenings, and farmer outreach. The U.S. Hemp Corporation is full member of the Hemp Industries Association and is planning several campaigns to assist HIA’s programs and legislative advocacy.
Legislative Updates
The future of hemp in the United States is looking brighter than ever. Over the last few months promising legislation has been introduced in the 114th Congress to further industrial hemp and access to Cannabidiol to patients, particularly veterans. We are working with our Hemp Ambassador, Dannion Brinkley, and his non-profit, the Twilight Brigade, to create positive change and better legislation for cannabinoid based healthcare treatments in palliative and end of life care. Please join our efforts and call your representatives to support this important (and historic) legislation.
1. S.134 – Industrial Hemp Farming Act of 2015 (January 8, 2015) 
2. H.R. 525 – Industrial Hemp Farming Act, Reintroduced (January 22, 2015)
3. H.R. 667 – Veterans Equal Access Act (February 3, 2015)
4. S. 683 – CARERS Act of 2015 (March 10, 20015)
In Conclusion 
I am hopeful that this detailed briefing of our activities since December 2014 gives more insight toward the many long-term efforts of Dewmar International BMC, Inc.  I believe that by the time you have had a chance to fathom the greatness to which Dewmar is working to achieve; we shall hopefully have our 2015 CEO Message released to provide further insight into all of the many other aspects of the Company beyond the realm of hemp. Until then, well wishes.
Dr. Marco Moran, CEO
Dewmar International BMC, Inc.

Dewmar International BMC, Inc. (DEWM) Achieves a Positive SER and Credit Rating from Dun & BradstreetHOUSTON, TX–(Marketwired – September 14, 2016) –  Dewmar International BMC, Inc. (OTCPink:DEWM), announces that on August 24, 2016 the Company received an updated Supplier Qualifier Report issued by Dun & Bradstreet (D&B) in conjunction with its Walmart National Vendor Account that issued Dewmar with an exceptional SER rating of 2.
The objective of the report, in context to Walmart, is to assess the credit and financial risk of Vendors who supply goods and services to the Retailer. As noted below, the Supplier Qualifier Report takes thousands of financial and business factors into account culminating in a Supplier Evaluation Risk (SER) Rating. The D&B SER rating is a number between 1-10; with 10 (ten) being the highest risk and 1 (one) being the lowest risk. Dewmar improved its rating by an impressive 4 points from this point in time last year.
Many big box retailers such as Walmart Corporation, use Dun & Bradstreet’s Supplier Evaluation Risk (SER) Rating to help decide whether or not to accept a supplier. In fact, given the retailer’s purchasing policies, a company’s SER Rating can determine a Vendor’s consideration for national, multi-million dollar contracts.
Here is a Risk Score Analysis Summary for an SER Rating of 2 for Publicly Traded Companies:

The Company has diversified its industry portfolio profile to increase likelihood of success
Only 15% of U.S. corporations have an SER Rating of 2 or better (1 is the highest possible)
There is an average probability of only 0.48% that this supplier will ever cease business operations
The Company has a favorable debt to asset ratio with good payment history and a high Paydex score

Review this link to learn more about what all factors are associated with SER Ratings: https://creditreports.dnb.com/m/business-glossary/supplier-evaluation-risk-rating.html
“After a thorough evaluation by D&B, we are satisfied with the SER Rating Dewmar received,” said J.D. Houston, COO of Dewmar International BMC, Inc. “D&B is in the business of evaluating the financials of more than 235 million companies across 200 countries worldwide, so to achieve a high mark from such an experienced and discerning source we think is reflective of Dewmar’s swing to annual profitability and improved financial strength,” Mr. Houston continued.
”Now that D&B has completed its review and assigned Dewmar a SER Rating of 2, Dewmar is better positioned to immediately proceed with our plans to pursue and win national contracts for the delivery of services and products to major corporations, inclusive of, but not limited to Walmart”, said Dr. Marco Moran, CEO of Dewmar International BMC, Inc.

Dewmar International BMC, Inc. (DEWM) Secures Memorandum of Understanding with Smart Rx Systems for Distribution of Smart PharmAssist 


JACKSON, MS--(NewMediaWire - Jul 20, 2017) -  Dewmar International BMC, Inc.  (OTC PINK: DEWM) announced today that it has entered into an agreement with Smart RX Systems, Inc. ("Smart Rx") to sell and market its Smart PharmAssist Kiosk.
Per the agreement, Health & Wellness Research Consortium ("HWRC"), a fully owned subsidiary of Dewmar International, sold its Texas-based Dimension Pharmacy in exchange for some cash and limited exclusive rights to sale and distribute Smart Rx kiosks in specified geographical territories and shared vertical markets. Additionally, Smart Rx has agreed to provide HWRC's Clinton Wellness Center in Clinton, MS with a high profit margin program and pharmaceutical products for intravenous (IV) weight loss and intravenous (IV) rejuvenation.
The Smart PharmAssistTM pharmacy kiosk is the most efficient, self-dispensing tele-pharmacy kiosk in the market today that allows hospitals, clinics, pharmacies and employers with over 1,000 employees to efficiently dispense medication at a fraction of the cost of traditional pharmacy overhead.
"Our recent collaborations illustrate our efforts to work with organizations worldwide to help make our commitment to sustainable innovative technology a reality," stated Mr. Sandeep Mathow, Founder & CEO of Smart RX. "Working with Dewmar and their many healthcare affiliates will help us accelerate speed-to-market in critical geographies here in the U.S.," he continued.
 Dr. Marco Moran, CEO of Dewmar International, stated, "We are excited to be introducing this 'game-changing' pharmacy solution to our growing network of hospitals, clinics, major employers and self-insured cities and municipalities." Dr. Marco Moran continued, "As a 20 year licensed pharmacist, I know that pharmacy kiosks creates a more affordable and highly profitable retail pharmacy solution for our many clients whose patients will be able to leave their facilities with a pharmacist-verified prescription in hand as opposed to having to run another errand to wait over an hour at the local corner drugstore. Furthermore, major employers and large health systems will be able to eliminate their drug inventory costs and participate in a profit-share program thus bringing in (or saving) potential revenue in the six figure range for installation of this state of the art pharmacy system."
A need for efficiency, accuracy and cost savings is driving automation of the pharmacy industry. The Smart PharmAssist™ Kiosk takes one-fourth of the space of a traditional small pharmacy, eliminates theft/shrink, and optimizes revenue while simultaneously having the highest sales per square feet in retail but with the lowest labor costs. Overall, the global pharmacy automation systems market is expected to grow to $7.8 billion by 2018 and is virtually untapped.
In 2014 Chicago's Mercy Hospital rolled out one of the earliest outpatient prescription-dispensing kiosks. As with Smart PharmAssist, all prescription insurance carriers are accepted, including Medicaid and Medicare. The kiosk accepts all debit and credit cards for payment. "This first-of-its-kind, ATM-style prescription kiosk will make it easier and more convenient for our patients to receive those commonly prescribed discharge medications 24/7 prior to leaving the hospital," said Carol Schneider, President and Chief Executive Officer of Mercy Hospital. "We are also able to offer this service to our own hospital staff, increasing access to both staff and the community; it's about helping our community live well." 
Pharmacy automation is a business driver and Dewmar has secured the international rights to be the first Company to include Smart PharmAssist advanced technologies for medicinal cannabis dispensing in as early as 2018. By automating the identification, purchasing, and dispensing processes; legally operating cannabis dispensaries can reduce concerns about security, cash management, storage, and authenticating identification, while at the same time reducing time and labor expense according to Self Service News Magazine.

July 18, 2017 08:13 ET
Dewmar International BMC, Inc. (DEWM) Files Provisional Patent to Treat Lung Cancer with Cannabinoids 



BATON ROUGE, LA--(Marketwired - Jul 18, 2017) -  Dewmar International BMC, Inc.  (OTC PINK: DEWM) announced today that it has filed a provisional patent with the United States Patent and Trademark Office for the treatment of lung cancer with cannabinoids. The title of the provisional patent filing is Cannabinoid Formulation to Treat Lung Cancer.
The invention relates to an inhalation pharmaceutical formulation of metered and/or titrated doses of certain types of cannabinoids to treat lung cancer using either a pressurized inhaler or a dry powder inhaler. The invention also pertains to the pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives of the compounds of the invention, to processes for the preparation of these compounds, to chemical intermediates useful in preparation of these compounds, to a method of combating cancerous tumors in a mammal, and to pharmaceutical compositions containing these compounds or their derivatives. 
Dr. Marco Moran, CEO of Dewmar International, is the former Director of Pharmacy and head of U.S. Regulatory Affairs for INO Therapeutics ("INO") once located in Port Allen, LA but is now a part of Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals via a $2.3 billion acquisition of Ikaria. INO provides Inhaled Nitric Oxide, for treating hypoxic respiratory failure in newborns. INO was a private firm that patented, manufactured and shipped the first FDA approved gaseous drug in the United States to help premature babies to quickly develop their lung capacity. Dr. Moran played an integral role in the early 2000s in working with the company's France headquarters to spread these life-saving inhalation therapies across many neonatal intensive care units (ICUs) across the United States.
"I traveled from state to state with our quality assurance team to assure the proper set up and implementation of our innovative inhalation systems," said Dr. Moran. "I learned many state-of-the-art inhalation dosing forms and techniques from this forward-thinking company who was in the process of trying to create an 'inhalation Viagra' that could work in a matter of seconds as opposed to minutes. INO is the entity that helped expand my creativity when it came to new product development and implementation; they encouraged me to think outside of the box. This invaluable experience with INO has perfectly positioned me to maximize my talents to take Dewmar to greater heights than I could have ever imagined." 
By combining proven science with innovative methods which allow cancer fighting cannabinoid compounds to be delivered to the site of the cancerous tissue in a metered, precise therapeutic dose, Dr. Moran believes this invention will offer significant advantages over some of the conventional chemotherapies that have been used in the treatment of lung cancer. Dewmar International has already recruited a team of research physicians, including oncology specialists, to test this invention in the near future. They continue to recruit both oncologists and respiratory therapists.
"Our premise is simple; we asked this basic question: 'How many routine or chronic marijuana smokers do you know that have ever been diagnosed with lung cancer?' No one could really come back with a single patient of record," stated Dr. Moran. "Cannabinoids have the potential to be one of the most effective treatments of lung cancer ever introduced to oncologists. We have taken this medical hypothesis one step further to deliver these chemicals in a metered, controlled dose which is what medical doctors are seeking."
As previously announced, Dewmar's medical cannabis intellectual property assets will be held by its second-tier subsidiary, Cannabis Intellectual Property Holdings, LLC. The Company believes the development of its cannabis delivery mechanisms designed for specific disease states will bring a new era in targeted therapeutics to improve patient care and outcomes.

Several New Developments on Dewmar International BMC Inc (OTCMKTS:DEWM)

By Michael Luke -  July 17, 2017 354 




Share on Facebook
Tweet on Twitter











Dewmar International BMC Inc (OTCMKTS:DEWM) has been a topic of discussion here on Street Register a couple of times in as many weeks, and in addition to making nearly a 100% push to the upside, the company continues to roll out new information.
We try to keep our readers informed of any relevant developments that might occur in the stocks that we mention, and in the case of DEWM there have been a number of them in just the past week.
First it was reported that Dewmar International BMC Inc (OTCMKTS:DEWM) CEO, Dr. Marco Moran has been appointed as a Board Member of the Minority Cannabis Business Association (“MCBA”). The MCBA is the first non-profit organization created specifically to increase inclusion and equity for minorities and other underserved groups in the cannabis industry. Their mission is to increase participation and economic empowerment for entrepreneurs, their patients and consumers, and the communities most negatively impacted by the war on drugs.
“Although every aspect of the MCBA resonates with me as a young African-American business leader, my primary areas of interest where I believe that I can be most beneficial in promoting the cause of MCBA is with Economic Empowerment and Patient/Practitioner Awareness,” said Dr. Moran. (Source: Marketwired)

 

DEWM’s Nevada-based cannabis subsidiary, United States Hemp Corporation, then announced it has created its own wholly-owned subsidiary by the name of Cannabis Intellectual Property Holdings, LLC in order to protect a number of medical cannabis intellectual property assets.
Now this week we’ve learned that Dr. Derrick Brooks, M.D. who currently serves as a Board Member for DEWM, is a contributing author to an application to assist a Louisiana company in the execution and pursuit of a contract to be named the sole operator of a Medical Marijuana Cultivation and Production Facility Operator for Southern University A&M.
As a company, Dewmar International identified a critical area of intellectual property that they believe can secure several of the largest healthcare markets existing in the country today to share with Dr. Brooks to help Southern University monetize its cannabis research and development plan.
Dr. Brooks said, “My focus will be in general cannabis therapeutic dosing for pain management; while medical director Dr. Donisha Dunn-Lombard’s focus will be on psychiatry, PTSD and pain. Dr. Ato Wright will focus on various types of cancer and oncology therapies. Our unique team of local physicians was organized by the Dewmar International executive staff.”  (Source: Marketwired)
Of course we can’t forget about the fact that the company has recently come current on its filings, as well as signing a licensing agreement with KW Brands, LLC of Louisiana for the purpose of operating Willie’s Duck Diner. Willie’s Duck Diner is owned by Willie Robertson, the star of A&E’s “Duck Dynasty.”
So not only have members of the DEWM team been ingratiating and integrating themselves into the cannabis community, but the company also has other promising irons in the fire as well, with a stock that has shown the ability to make significant moves over a short time period. That’s exactly why we’ve caught onto following the DEWM story and will continue to do so moving forward. Stay locked to Street Register for updates, and we’ll deliver important developments on DEWM as they unfold. In the meantime, if you’ve yet to sign up for our 100% free newsletter, do so now! Just enter your active email address into the box below and submit!
Disclosure: No one at Street Register has been compensated in any way for the publishing of this article, nor do we hold any position in DEWM stock, short or long.

DEWMAR INTERNATIONAL BMC, INC 3/27/14
  Department of Health and Human ServicesPublic Health ServiceFood and Drug Administration New Orleans District404 BNA DriveBuilding 200 – Suite 500Nashville, TN 37217 Telephone: (615) 366-7801          FAX: (615) 366-7802 March 27, 2014 WARNING LETTER NO. 2014-NOL-13   UNITED PARCEL SERVICEDELIVERY SIGNATURE REQUESTED Marco Moran, PresidentDewmar International BMC, Inc.101 Convention Center Drive, Suite 700Las Vegas, Nevada 89109 Dear Mr. Moran: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has reviewed the regulatory status of the ingredients declared on the label of your beverage products, Lean Slow Motion…Potion (Easta Pink, Purp, and Yella varieties) and has determined your products are adulterated under Section 402(a)(2)(C) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) [21 United States Code (USC) 342(a)(2)(C)] because they bear or contain an unsafe food additive.  Specifically, the products contain melatonin (5-methoxy-N-acetyltryptamine, CAS Reg. No. 73-31-4), which is a neurohormone and is an unapproved food additive under Section 409 of the Act [21 USC 348]. The regulations pertaining to the general provisions for food additives are located in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 170 (21 CFR 170). Additionally, based on our review of your product labels, your Lean Slow Motion…Potion (Easta Pink, Purp, and Yella) products are misbranded within the meaning of Section 403 of the Act [21 USC 343]. You may find the Act and FDA regulations through links at FDA’s Internet home page at www.fda.gov.  Your Lean Slow Motion…Potion (Easta Pink, Purp, and Yella) products are represented for use as conventional foods, and accordingly are not dietary supplements, as defined under Section 201(ff) of the Act [21 USC 321(ff)].  The Act excludes from the definition of a dietary supplement a product represented for use as a conventional food or as a sole item of a meal or the diet [21 USC 321(ff)(2)(B)].  Your use of the term “dietary supplement” below the Nutrition Facts panel on your product labels does not make your products dietary supplements, because your Lean Slow Motion…Potion products are represented for use as conventional foods.  Examples of factors and information that establish that the products are represented for use as conventional foods are as follows: Your products are described as beverages on the information panels of the cans.The “Products” page on your website describes your Yella product as for people who like “pineapple-based Fanta” carbonated soft drink, your Purp product as for people who “like it raw mixed with Sprite” carbonated soft drink and your Easta Pink product as inspired by “Sprite Easta Pink.”The homepage of your website, www.slowmotionpotion.com, refers to your line of products as, “#1 relaxation beverage” and “the most potent relaxation drink.”The “Products” page on your website describes the flavor of your Yella product as having a “hint of red Jolly Rancher flavor” and “unique flavor combination that is ranked number 1 in blind taste tests.” The page describes the flavor of your Purp product as including “grape Jolly Rancher candy.” The page describes the flavor of your Easta Pink product as “a secret flavor combination” that “creates the sweetest of the Leans.”Your products, sold in single-serving pop-top aluminum cans, have the appearance and packaging of carbonated soft drinks.Your products contain a Nutrition Facts label.Your products are comprised of typical ingredients for carbonated soft drinks (carbonated water, sugar, citric acid, natural flavor, potassium sorbate, sodium benzoate) plus melatonin and extracts.The president’s message on your company website at www.dewmarinternational.com/presidents-message/ refers to your products as “relaxation beverages” and a “beverage brand.” Unapproved Food Additive Any substance added to a conventional food, such as your Lean Slow Motion…Potion (Easta Pink, Purp, and Yella) beverage products, must be used in accordance with a food additive regulation, unless the substance is the subject of a prior sanction or is generally recognized as General Recognized As Safe (GRAS) among qualified experts for its use in foods [21 CFR 170.30(g)]. There is no food additive regulation that authorizes the use of melatonin.  We are not aware of any information to indicate that melatonin is the subject of a prior sanction (see 21 CFR 181). As explained below, we are not aware of any basis to conclude that melatonin is GRAS for use in conventional foods. FDA's regulations in 21 CFR 170.30(a)-(c) describe criteria for eligibility for classification of a food ingredient as GRAS. General recognition of safety must be based only on the views of qualified experts.  The basis of such views may be either (1) scientific procedures, or (2) in the case of a substance used in food prior to January 1, 1958, through experience based on common use in food. In addition, general recognition of safety requires common knowledge about the substance throughout the scientific community knowledgeable about the safety of substances directly or indirectly added to food. Under 21 CFR 170.3(h), “[s]cientific procedures include those human, animal, analytical, and other scientific studies, whether published or unpublished, appropriate to establish the safety of a substance.”  Under 21 CFR 170.30(b), “[g]eneral recognition of safety based upon scientific procedures shall require the same quantity and quality of scientific evidence as is required to obtain approval of a food additive regulation for the ingredient.”  Section 170.30(b) further states that general recognition of safety through scientific procedures is ordinarily based upon published studies, which may be corroborated by unpublished studies and other data and information.Under 21 CFR 170.3(f), “[c]ommon use in food means a substantial history of consumption of a substance for food use by a significant number of consumers.”  Under 21 CFR 170.30(c)(1), “[g]eneral recognition of safety through experience based on common use in food prior to January 1, 1958, shall be based solely on food use of the substance prior to January 1, 1958, and shall ordinarily be based upon generally available data and information.”  Importantly, however, the fact a substance was added to food before 1958 does not, in itself, demonstrate such use is safe, unless the pre-1958 use is sufficient to demonstrate to qualified experts that the substance is safe when added to food [21 CFR 170.30(a)].Under 21 CFR 170.3(i), “[s]afe or safety means that there is a reasonable certainty in the minds of competent scientists that the substance is not harmful under the intended conditions of use.”  The regulation provides that, in determining safety, the following factors are to be considered:  (1) The probable consumption of the substance and of any substance formed in or on food because of its use; (2) the cumulative effect of the substance in the diet, taking into account any chemically or pharmacologically related substance or substances in such diet; and (3) safety factors which, in the opinion of qualified experts, are generally recognized as appropriate. Such safety factors ordinarily are established through extensive testing in animals to determine whether consumption of the ingredient produces adverse effects when consumed chronically (i.e., on a daily basis over the course of a lifetime).1 We know of no basis for general recognition of safety for melatonin based either on scientific procedures or common use in food prior to January 1, 1958. Melatonin is a neurohormone that is used for medicinal purposes, primarily as a sleep aid in the treatment of sleep-related disorders.  In assessing the GRAS status of melatonin for use in a conventional food such as “Lean Slow Motion…Potion (Easta Pink, Purp, and Yella),” we considered the criteria described above. FDA is not aware of data to establish the safety of melatonin for use as an ingredient in conventional foods. On the contrary, reports in the scientific literature have raised safety concerns about the use of melatonin. Among these are concerns about effects on blood glucose homeostasis (References 1- 4), and effects on the reproductive/developmental (References 5- 11), cardiovascular (References 12- 18), ocular (References 19- 21) and neurological systems (References 22, 23). Therefore, the use of melatonin in your “Lean Slow Motion…Potion (Easta Pink, Purp, and Yella)” products does not satisfy the criteria for GRAS status under 21 CFR 170.30. FDA is not aware of any other exemption from the food additive definition that would apply to melatonin for use as an ingredient in a conventional food, such as your beverage product. Therefore, melatonin added to a conventional food is a food additive under Section 201(s) of the Act [21 USC 321(s)] and is subject to the provisions of Section 409 of the Act [21 USC 348].  Under Section 409, a food additive is deemed unsafe unless it is approved by FDA for its intended use prior to marketing. Melatonin is not approved for use in any food, including beverages.  Therefore, your “Lean Slow Motion…Potion (Easta Pink, Purp, and Yella)” products are adulterated within the meaning of Section 402(a)(2)(C) of the Act [21 USC 342(a)(2)(C)]. Misbranded Food Your Lean Slow Motion…Potion (Easta Pink, Purp, and Yella) products are misbranded within the meaning of Section 403(a)(1) of the Act [21 USC 343(a)(1)]. As discussed above, the products are represented for use as conventional foods, however, below the Nutrition Facts panel, the labels state:  “DIETARY SUPPLEMENT.” Your Lean Slow Motion…Potion (Easta Pink, Purp, and Yella) products are misbranded within the meaning of Section 403 (i)(1) of the Act [21 USC 343(i)(1)] because they fail to bear a statement of identity in accordance with 21 CFR 101.3. Your Lean Slow Motion…Potion (Easta Pink, Purp, and Yella) products are misbranded within the meaning of Section 403(q) of the Act [21 USC 343(q)] because the nutrition information is not in an appropriate format, as specified in 21 CFR 101.9. For example: A declaration of “Acai Berry Extract” is not allowed within the nutrition label (e.g., Nutrition Facts panel). According to 21 CFR 101.9(c), no nutrients or food components other than those listed in 21 CFR 101.9(c) as either mandatory or voluntary may be included within the nutrition label.The amounts of saturated fat and trans fat are not declared as provided for in either of the methods specified in 21 CFR 101.9(c)(2)(i) and 21 CFR 101.9(c)(2)(ii) or 21 CFR 101.9(f)(4).  Further, the amount of cholesterol is not declared as provided for in either of the methods specified in 21 CFR 101.9(c)(3) or 21 CFR 101.9(f)(4).The label uses the simplified Nutrition Facts labeling format under 21 CFR 101.9(f). When using this format, the declaration of voluntary nutrients triggers the requirement that the statement “Not a significant source of ___” be included at the bottom of the nutrition label. We note the labels fail to use this statement to declare trans fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, vitamins A and C, iron and calcium. This letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive list of violations in your products. It is your responsibility to ensure all of your products comply with the Act and other applicable regulations. You should take prompt action to correct the violations cited in this letter. Failure to promptly correct these violations may result in FDA taking regulatory action without further notice, such as seizure or injunction. (b)(4)   You should respond in writing within 15 working days from the date you receive this letter. Your response should include specific steps you have taken to correct the noted violations, including an explanation of how you plan to prevent these violations, or similar violations, from occurring again. Include documentation of the corrective action you have taken. If your planned correction will occur over time, please include a timetable for implementation of those corrections. If corrective action cannot be completed within 15 working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which the corrections will be completed. Your response should be comprehensive and address all violations included in this Warning Letter. Your response should be sent to:  Ms. Kimberly Dutzek, Compliance Officer, at the address above.  If you have any questions about the content of this letter, please contact Ms. Dutzek at (615) 366-7826.                                                                        Sincerely,/S/ Patricia K.

With the expanded placement of our branded products in Walmart, we continue to see growth in our traditional  business lines of brand management and consumer goods. Simultaneously, we are diversifying into new markets  and business opportunities that show high growth potential and leverage our expertise in pharmaceuticals,  healthcare and product development. A key initiative is in the cannabis market, which is growing rapidly due to  legalization and adoption of products for medicinal, nutraceutical and recreational use.  o We are expanding on the initial success of Kush Cakes, by improving upon our hemp protein infusion  techniques and shelf-life stabilization through improved packaging methods. We have expanded  our partnership with bakeries to multiple states that have legal edible cannabis laws.  o We formed U.S. Hemp Corporation to develop consumer products for food, beverage, nutraceutical  and medicinal applications, and establish partnerships and brand alliances to promote our products  and the industry in general.  o We are in the product development stage of creating well branded edible THC/CBD infused products  in multiple states with both medical and recreational cannabis laws. These products are unique in  the marketplace and offer a compelling option for Millennials and Generation-X seeking a trusted  source of functional products that induce relaxation because not only does it include quality  measurements of active CBD, THC, CBDA and THCA; the products may include a host of other  synergistic pharmaceutical grade products formulated by our CEO and chief pharmacist.  o We are also developing a list of quality suppliers of Cannabidiol (CBD), a cannabis extract we view as  a key ingredient for a wide range of new products which makes for an appealing option for patients  looking for relief from inflammation, pain, anxiety, psychosis, seizures, spasms and other conditions  without disconcerting feelings of lethargy or dysphoria.  o In addition to product marketing, we provide an array of hemp industry services —with our  exclusive Hemp Incubator —to foster overall market growth, as well as promote our brands as well  as various clients who sign a contract with us. Our services include:  ? Go-to-market consulting and research  ? Brand management  ? Product development and food science testing  ? Third-party manufacturing relationships  ? Warehousing and order fulfillment  o We have also diversified our hemp/cannabis business with other activities to communicate and  promote the benefits of the plant. We see these activities as potential revenue contributors, as well  as brand-building exercises.  ? We formed a Historically Black Colleges & Universities (HBCU) program for Hemp and  Medicinal Cannabis Research, which shall provide a self-directed learning curriculum,  including expert lectures on the legal, agricultural, social and business aspects of the  hemp/cannabis industry.  ? We are developing partnerships with Colleges and Universities across the globe to study  hemp plant cultivation and consumer and industrial applications. We have gained access to  over 100 patented technologies in bio-sciences and engineering to aide us in our  advancement to develop and introduce new technologies to consumer markets worldwide.  ? We are executive producers of and have extensive product placement in a documentary  film, called “Weed for Warriors” which tells the story of how medicinal marijuana, in lieu of  harsh sedative pharmaceutical drugs, have helped many disabled veterans cope with their  debilitating injuries and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).  ? We have invested in ownership rights and our CEO has a repetitive co-starring role as a  panelist, healthcare subject matter specialist and accredited investor in a cannabis business  investment reality television series geared toward offering advice and direct cash  investments to aspiring “ganja-preneurs” across the United States. This production gives  Dewmar the opportunity to find, invest in or acquire the latest cannabis technologies before

	Dewmar International BMC, Inc. (DEWM) Secures Memorandum of Understanding with Smart Rx Systems for Distribution of Smart PharmAssist 
















News Room

July 20, 2017 06:09 ET
Dewmar International BMC, Inc. (DEWM) Secures Memorandum of Understanding with Smart Rx Systems for Distribution of Smart PharmAssist 



JACKSON, MS--(Marketwired - Jul 20, 2017) -  Dewmar International BMC, Inc.  (OTC PINK: DEWM) announced today that it has entered into an agreement with Smart RX Systems, Inc. ("Smart Rx") to sell and market its Smart PharmAssist Kiosk.
Per the agreement, Health & Wellness Research Consortium ("HWRC"), a fully owned subsidiary of Dewmar International, sold its Texas-based Dimension Pharmacy in exchange for some cash and limited exclusive rights to sale and distribute Smart Rx kiosks in specified geographical territories and shared vertical markets. Additionally, Smart Rx has agreed to provide HWRC's Clinton Wellness Center in Clinton, MS with a high profit margin program and pharmaceutical products for intravenous (IV) weight loss and intravenous (IV) rejuvenation.
The Smart PharmAssistTM pharmacy kiosk is the most efficient, self-dispensing tele-pharmacy kiosk in the market today that allows hospitals, clinics, pharmacies and employers with over 1,000 employees to efficiently dispense medication at a fraction of the cost of traditional pharmacy overhead.
"Our recent collaborations illustrate our efforts to work with organizations worldwide to help make our commitment to sustainable innovative technology a reality," stated Mr. Sandeep Mathow, Founder & CEO of Smart RX. "Working with Dewmar and their many healthcare affiliates will help us accelerate speed-to-market in critical geographies here in the U.S.," he continued.
 Dr. Marco Moran, CEO of Dewmar International, stated, "We are excited to be introducing this 'game-changing' pharmacy solution to our growing network of hospitals, clinics, major employers and self-insured cities and municipalities." Dr. Marco Moran continued, "As a 20 year licensed pharmacist, I know that pharmacy kiosks creates a more affordable and highly profitable retail pharmacy solution for our many clients whose patients will be able to leave their facilities with a pharmacist-verified prescription in hand as opposed to having to run another errand to wait over an hour at the local corner drugstore. Furthermore, major employers and large health systems will be able to eliminate their drug inventory costs and participate in a profit-share program thus bringing in (or saving) potential revenue in the six figure range for installation of this state of the art pharmacy system."
A need for efficiency, accuracy and cost savings is driving automation of the pharmacy industry. The Smart PharmAssist™ Kiosk takes one-fourth of the space of a traditional small pharmacy, eliminates theft/shrink, and optimizes revenue while simultaneously having the highest sales per square feet in retail but with the lowest labor costs. Overall, the global pharmacy automation systems market is expected to grow to $7.8 billion by 2018 and is virtually untapped.
In 2014 Chicago's Mercy Hospital rolled out one of the earliest outpatient prescription-dispensing kiosks. As with Smart PharmAssist, all prescription insurance carriers are accepted, including Medicaid and Medicare. The kiosk accepts all debit and credit cards for payment. "This first-of-its-kind, ATM-style prescription kiosk will make it easier and more convenient for our patients to receive those commonly prescribed discharge medications 24/7 prior to leaving the hospital," said Carol Schneider, President and Chief Executive Officer of Mercy Hospital. "We are also able to offer this service to our own hospital staff, increasing access to both staff and the community; it's about helping our community live well." 
Pharmacy automation is a business driver and Dewmar has secured the international rights to be the first Company to include Smart PharmAssist advanced technologies for medicinal cannabis dispensing in as early as 2018. By automating the identification, purchasing, and dispensing processes; legally operating cannabis dispensaries can reduce concerns about security, cash management, storage, and authenticating identification, while at the same time reducing time and labor expense according to Self Service News Magazine.
About The Smart PharmAssist™ Kiosk
The Smart PharmAssist™ Kiosk is a remote pharmacy dispensing technology that allows people to have access to multi-lingual pharmacy services 24-hours a day, seven days a week. The Kiosk is a complete pharmacy-in-a-box, with the capacity to dispense 225 or more different types of medications, including narcotics and over the counter (OTC) medications. Features include automated pill counting, live video conferencing with a licensed Pharmacist, barcode reader, biometrics, facial recognition, back end data collection, automated vile capping, automated labeling, medication image capture, automated climate control, and automated remote insurance processing.
About Smart Rx Systems
Smart Rx Systems is a global healthcare leader in automation. The company is one of the first to develop an on-demand medication dispensing kiosk designed to help the world get their medication when and where it is needed the most. Smart Rx Systems is the developer, manufacturer, and operator of the Smart PharmAssist™ Kiosk line of remote healthcare technologies and services.

Dewmar International BMC, Inc. (DEWM) and Hemp, Inc. (HEMP) Announces Official Launch of Hemp Infused Brownies

Apr 13, 2015, 11:12 ET
		  		  					
						 from   Dewmar International BMC, Inc. 











 
















































 

 




















 


DENVER, April 13, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Dewmar International BMC, Inc. (OTCPink: DEWM) ("Dewmar" or "Company") a leading provider of consumer brands and Hemp, Inc. (OTCPink: HEMP) a company whose vision is foreseeing the potential worldwide benefits that may be derived from the myriad of uses for industrial hemp announces that it will officially launch Kush Cake hemp-infused chocolate brownies tomorrow, April 14th at the sold out Big Industry Show and Horticulture 360 at the Denver Mart in Denver, Colorado.  This show is a two day event that will feature hundreds of buyers and wholesalers throughout the world in the smoke shop industry.
"This is our official industry launch where we have reserved a 10 x 10 booth space that will be draped in psychedelic tie-dye banners that will be easily seen by passers-by as we expect thousands upon thousands to visit our booth, #1802, over the next two days at this sold out event," says Marco Moran, Dewmar's CEO. The Company plans to give out over 2,000 free Kush Cake samples to all registered attendees, most of which are smoke shop and adult store industry buyers or representatives of such companies that will be future retailers of the brand. Kush Cake brownies will also be featured in the next issue of the Buyers Industry Guide. To follow the daily happenings of the show and see how #MyKushCakes are trending, download the Web App at www.App.BigIndustryShow.com.
Dewmar signed a contract during first quarter of 2014 with Hemp, Inc.'s Industrial Hemp & Medical Marijuana Consulting Company, Inc. (IHMMCC) and the Kush Cakes launch marks the first successful completion of an IHMMCC Hemp Ambassador Program. "Dannion and I are both veterans, having been stationed at Marine Corps bases around the world; re-launching Kush Cakes has been a top priority for Dewmar International since Kush Cakes was created by High Margins, Inc. in 2011," said Marco Moran.  
Hemp, Inc.'s CEO Bruce Perlowin will be in attendance as he has been dubbed as the face of the Kush Cakes brand for this specific channel of distribution with the moniker, "The King of Pot…Still Bringing in Loads."  "We are not only seeking the best bakeries, but seeking to find the best and most innovative bakers," says Bruce Perlowin, CEO of Hemp, Inc. "Dewmar and Hemp, Inc. are looking forward to the future with all the realizations of the benefits of hemp and its many different compounds. We are defining this launch as the beginning of a partnership to bring into creating an absolutely amazing brownie,the ultimate comfort food…the NEW KUSH CAKE. I'm still bringing in loads but this time it's legal, enjoyable and nutritional.  Buy one, eat one and join the revolution!"
Dewmar International plans to have a number of promotional show girls and sales staff to occupy the booth each day to aggressively sell product on the spot at the show and take larger orders to ship out over the upcoming weeks to major smoke shop industry retailers and wholesalers.  The 2011 former distributor of the brand, EdiblesRUs, reportedly sold over $700,000 worth of these brownies in a 6 month period with little to no advertising budget and no major promotional sales plans.  Conversely, Dewmar has a rather extensive promotional program that it is implementing to cause sales to BOOM from the very beginning as well as launch a series of social media, industry email newsblasts and traditional magazine advertising in major industry journals over the upcoming months in order to maximize its sales efforts.  A box of 1 dozen Kush Cakes will be sold for $60.00 with free shipping within the Continental U.S.  For the next 24 hours, the company will ship out a limited number of 100 V.I.P. brownies for free with an $8.00 shipping and handling fee per brownie.  Visit us at www.MyKushCakes.com to place an order today.  Kush Cakes are legal to be sold in all 50 states as the brownies do not contain any THC.

Brand ManagementWarehousing and FulfillmentOur CompanyDewmar International BMC, Inc.
Dewmar International Brand Management Company, Inc. (“Dewmar”) is a U.S. based, veteran-owned brand management services and diversified operating company that specializes in developing, acquiring and/or licensing new products and brands for successful launch or distribution in both national and international markets.  Dewmar’s primary business strategy has been to transform high profit-margin brands traditionally reserved for niche consumer markets into more widely available general consumer brands while building a sustainable business growth model.
The Company’s flagship brand, Lean Slow Motion Potion, is rated as one of the top 3 selling relaxation brands in the United States of the purported over 100 plus relaxation brands currently available in the world market. Lean has sales grossing well over 5 million dollars and has been distributed and sold in 28 states and 3 countries, with successful continuous online sales.
The Company formed Health & Wellness Research Consortium (HWRC), LLC as a wholly owned subsidiary, to develop and market non-opioid, alternative therapies used to treat acute or chronic pain management.
Furthermore, the Company is leveraging the explosion in the worldwide popularity of products derived from industrial hemp. The signing of the 2014 Agricultural Act (the “Farm Bill”) forecasts several strong groundbreaking opportunities for companies at the forefront of the industrial hemp and cannabidiol (CBD) industries for production and development of textiles, building materials, consumable goods, nutritional supplements and medicinal compounds.
Dewmar’s subsidiary, U.S. Hemp Corporation, has developed significant presence in this high demand space for the immediate and long-term future. We published Hemp Report I and Hemp Report II to outline our operations and achievements in this fledgling industry so full of opportunity.


About the CEO & TEAM:
The company’s Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Marco Moran, has 20 years of combined leadership experience and a superb work ethic as a former U.S. Naval Officer and U.S. Olympian who founded a series of successful entrepreneurial ventures of which three were sales/distribution or marketing related. He is a licensed healthcare professional with two post graduate degrees in business and pharmaceutical sciences, particularly with new product development, and with a sustainable immense passion for success.
Dr. Moran focuses on transparency and creating shareholder value through his annual Message from the CEO. To learn about the latest news and events happening at Dewmar International, we invite you to have a read.
Dewmar International is continuously exploring new functional product line concepts to match the most viable consumer base to yield more immediate profitability with reduced risk. Dewmar International is continuously exploring new functional food and beverage product lines to add to its growing portfolio.  Additionally, our brand management team prides itself on matching the the most viable consumer base with non-edible innovative products to yield highly profitability for Dewmar with reduced risk.
