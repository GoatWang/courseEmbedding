Contact Us

 
Thank you for contacting Athene with your life insurance questions. In 2013, Athene sold most of the life insurance business acquired from Aviva USA to Accordia Life and Annuity Company, a subsidiary of Global Atlantic Financial Group Limited. Athene continued to administer the life insurance business during a two-year transition period with the final affected life insurance policies transferred to Accordia Life in early 2016. On January 11, the transition was finalized and Accordia Life began administering the affected life insurance policies.
You can be assured that during the conversion period your policy will remain in-force — including all guarantees provided by the policy — and all valid claims will be paid. Athene continues to work with Accordia Life to service affected customers and agents.
Accordia Life has set up a website dedicated to the conversion that may help answer common questions at accordiapolicyconversion.com. Also, customers can contact Accordia Life via email at askcustomerservice@gafg.com or via phone at 877-462-8992.
While Accordia Life has the immediate responsibility for resolving those customers’ concerns, we want Athene’s customers – past, present and future – to know that we are doing everything possible to ease your transition.
For Athene customer questions, please email askathene@athene.com.

Our Story


The Company
Athene Holding Ltd. (Athene) is a leading retirement services company that issues, reinsures and acquires retirement savings products designed for the increasing number of individuals and institutions seeking to fund retirement needs. Athene’s operating subsidiaries1 issue and reinsure these retirement savings products, including fixed annuities and funding agreements. Athene was founded in 2009 by James Belardi, former President of SunAmerica Life Insurance Company and now CEO of Athene Holding Ltd., and Chip Gillis, former head of Bear Stearns’ Insurance Solutions Group and now CEO of Athene Life Re.
What Drives Us
We are a company driven to do more and never satisfied with the status quo. Drive. Discipline. Confidence. Focus. Commitment. These are the attributes that set Athene apart and establish us as an industry leader. “We formed Athene based on the fundamentals that I had learned working for 20 years at SunAmerica,” stated Jim Belardi, Athene’s CEO:

A net investment spread business focused on policyholder protection
Disciplined risk management based on managing interest rate, credit and equity risks as well as liquidity in current and stressed scenarios
Hiring smart, focused, achievement-oriented employees
A high quality, liquid, fixed income asset portfolio together with long-term, low-cost retirement savings liabilities

Our Approach
Our operating subsidiaries’ primary business is issuing, reinsuring and acquiring retirement savings products and similar liabilities through our four distribution channels:

Retail
Reinsurance
Institutional Products
Mergers & Acquisitions

Performance
With our experienced management team, we have grown from a startup in 2009 to $89 billion in total assets2.
We began operating in 2009 when the burdens of the financial crisis and resulting capital demands caused many companies to exit the retirement market, creating the need for a well-capitalized company with an experienced management team to fill the void.

Reaching Higher
We are relentless when it comes to creating innovative financial solutions and building a strong team to serve our shareholders and policyholders. We are committed to a high level of performance which is reflected in our brand tagline “Driven to Do More.” 
1. Athene Annuity & Life Assurance Company, Wilmington, DE, and Athene Annuity and Life Company, West Des Moines, IA, issue annuities in all states except New York. Athene Annuity & Life Assurance Company of New York and Athene Life Insurance Company of New York, both in Nyack, NY, are licensed to do business in the state of New York. Each insurance subsidiary is responsible for meeting its ongoing insurance policy and contract obligations. Athene Holding Ltd. is not responsible for meeting the ongoing insurance policy and contract obligations of its subsidiary insurance companies.
2. GAAP total assets as of March 31, 2017.

Athene Advertising


ATHENE CONTINUES ITS "DRIVEN TO DO MORE" NATIONAL AD CAMPAIGN


											Athene’s new campaign continues the momentum of last year's campaign and communicates our commitment to a high level of performance and our brand ethos “Driven to Do More.” The integrated brand campaign amplifies awareness for Athene through TV, print and digital communications using a unique and compelling ad campaign.
										
TV Ads
Our 30- and 15-second advertisements use a uniform sea of people to represent conformity and the age-old metaphor of individuals having their heads in the sand compared to those of us who are more progressive, innovative thinkers. The ads highlight our focus, commitment and higher expectations for ourselves and our company and celebrates those like us. The ads are running on national networks such as Fox News, Fox Business News, Bloomberg, CNN and HGTV programming.

Print Advertising
Our print advertising carries through our “Driven to Do More” theme and emphasizes how our company sees things differently and takes performance to a whole new level. 
Look for Athene advertising in these top-tier publications:

Bloomberg Business Week

Our Growth


Since it commenced operations in 2009, Athene has experienced tremendous growth. Today, we are one of the largest fixed index annuity platforms in the United States, based on fixed indexed deferred annuity assets.
While our company has grown principally through acquisitions, we have positioned the company to rely more on our three organic channels for future growth. Our organic channels include retail, flow reinsurance and institutional products. This will be supplemented by our inorganic channels, which include M&A and block reinsurance.
Since our inception, we have completed five major acquisitions of well-established companies with long and proud histories in the annuity business (see table below). In each case we built upon the solid reputations of these companies to form the company that Athene is today. We also strengthened many areas, aligned operations where appropriate and introduced new products and services that distinguish the Athene brand.

Style Scores:



A Value | D Growth | C Momentum | B VGM                


The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.


Value Score
A


Growth Score
A


Momentum Score
A


VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score
A


Growth Score

Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Athene Holding Ltd.’s IPO Raises $1.1B

By Corrie Driebusch and Michael Wursthorn
A lethargic year for IPOs is getting a late lift.
The selling shareholders of Athene Holding Ltd. raised $1.1 billion in an initial public offering late Thursday, according to people familiar with the matter, which values the fixed-annuities provider at roughly $8 billion. That makes Athene the second-biggest U.S.-listed company to debut in 2016, according to Dealogic.
A successful debut could set the stage for a revitalized IPO market in 2017, some bankers and analysts said. The pipeline for new offerings in the coming months includes Travel BV, which plans to change its name to Trivago, and Snapchat parent Snap Inc. How a big IPO like Bermuda-based Athene prices and trades in its debut often serves as a litmus test for companies waiting in the wings to go public.
Athene’s shares priced at $40 apiece and 27 million shares were sold, according to people familiar with the offering. The company expected to sell 23.75 million shares at between $38 to $42 a share. Shares are set to start trading Friday morning on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol ATH.
The deal comes at the end of what is on track to be the slowest year for U.S.-listed IPOs by money raised since 2003 even if Athene is added to the tally, according to Dealogic. The biggest IPO of the year so far was ZTO Express Inc., which raised $1.4 billion in an October deal that valued the Shanghai-based logistics company at roughly $14 billion, Dealogic data show.
Athene is set to raise $950 million through the sale of 23.75 million shares, according to a regulatory filing. That figure is based on pricing the offering at the midpoint of its expected range of $38 to $42 a share. The deal is set to price Thursday night, according to people familiar with the matter, and is expected to start trading Friday on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol ATH.
Athene is one of the top sellers of U.S. fixed annuities by dollars sold, according to industry-funded research firm Limra, after a series of acquisitions of fixed-annuities businesses in recent years. The insurer, backed by private-equity firm Apollo Global Management LLC, guarantees steady payments to millions of retirees and other consumers through savings contracts that promise to pay buyers a set amount of interest each year.
Athene’s debut comes as the outlook has brightened for the financial-services sector, potentially boosting investor interest in the annuities provider, some analysts and money managers said.
Financial companies in the S&P 500 are up 18% since the U.S. presidential election, on investors’ expectations of loosened regulation and higher interest rates under President-elect Donald Trump. The broader S&P 500 index has risen 5% in that time.
Last spring, the Labor Department issued a new regulation that toughens standards for financial advisers recommending certain insurance-company products, including some annuities, to retirement savers. While Mr. Trump hasn’t directly addressed the fiduciary rules, one of his top advisers has said publicly that they should be repealed.
As Athene pitched its IPO to potential investors at the Ritz Carlton in Boston this month, management acknowledged, but also played down, the potentially adverse impact of the fiduciary rules, according to one person in attendance.
Athene’s fast growth as it scooped up fixed-annuity businesses helped spur a regulatory debate about whether private-equity firms and other nontraditional buyers of annuity-focused insurers might be taking excessive risks in pursuit of profits.
Apollo earns fees overseeing credit, real estate and other investments that back Athene’s annuity products. Apollo affiliates raked in $268 million in asset-management and other fees related to Athene last year, according to regulatory filings.
Doug Butler, research director at Rockland Trust, said the relationship doesn’t deter him from considering buying into the deal and, if anything, could be a potential positive.
Athene had said the company itself wouldn’t receive any of the proceeds from the public sale of stock. Rather, the IPO stands to benefit executives at the buyout firm who own shares.
“Apollo does not need Athene to be successful, but it certainly helps,” Mr. Butler said.
Athene’s IPO was led by Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Barclays PLC, Citigroup Inc. and Wells Fargo & Co.
