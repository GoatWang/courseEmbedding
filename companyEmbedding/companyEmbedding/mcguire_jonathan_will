Second Sight Medical Products Names New CEO
By Joel Russell
Thursday, June 25, 2015








Tweet





Second Sight Medical Products Inc. has appointed Will McGuire to become the company’s new chief executive starting Aug. 18.
The Sylmar biotech, which makes a system with an implant and camera mounted on eyeglasses to provide sight for blind patients, said its current Chief Executive Robert Greenberg will become chairman of the board, replacing billionaire Alfred Mann, who will become chairman emeritus.
Mann, who helped develop the insulin pump and cochlear hearing aid, founded Second Sight in 1998, with Greenberg serving as chief executive since the inception. Mann owns about 33 percent of the stock and Greenberg owns about 3 percent.
McGuire joins Second Sight from Volcano Corp., a heart imaging company in San Diego. Volcano was acquired by Royal Philips in February.
Previously. McGuire was chief executive at AtheroMed, Inc., a venture capital-backed company that developed arterial clearing devices, and chief operating officer at Spectranetics Corp., a publicly traded medical device company.
Shares closed down 69 cents or 4.4 percent to $15.04 on the Nasdaq.

Reader Poll

                            READER POLL: Do you think it's a good idea to extend last call at California bars to 4 a.m.?
                        




Yes, it's about time.



No, it will only cause problems.



Only bars in certain areas should stay open that late.
