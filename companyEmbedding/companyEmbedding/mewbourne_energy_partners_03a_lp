Results of OperationsLiquidity and Capital Resources
Mewbourne Energy Partners 03-A, L.P. was formed February 19, 2003.

During 2005, all general partner equity interests were converted to limited partner equity interests.
The Partnership had negative net working capital of $30,212 at March 31, 2016. MOC has informed the Partnership that if cash flows are insufficient to fund its operating costs, MOC will not demand immediate payment of amounts owed to it.
The Partnership had reduced cash flows from operations for the three months ended March 31, 2016 due to the steep decline in oil and gas prices during the previous twelve months. Considering these reduced operating cashflows, the Partnership does not anticipate resuming distributions until oil and gas prices improve.
During the three months ended March 31, 2015, the Partnership made cash distributions to the investor partners in the amount of $25,784 as compared to none for the three months ended March 31, 2016. Since inception, the Partnership has made distributions of $20,448,648, inclusive of state tax payments.
The sale of crude oil and natural gas produced by the Partnership will be affected by a number of factors that are beyond the Partnership's control. These factors include the price of crude oil and natural gas, the fluctuating supply of and demand for these products, competitive fuels, refining, transportation, extensive federal and state regulations governing the production and sale of crude oil and natural gas, and other competitive conditions. It is impossible to predict with any certainty the future effect of these factors on the Partnership.

March 31, 2015:



                       Three Months Ended March 31,
                          2016               2015
Oil sales           $      12,314       $      14,610
Barrels produced              426                 347
Average price/bbl   $       28.91       $       42.10

Gas sales           $      39,110       $      65,922
Mcf produced               24,833              26,830
Average price/mcf   $        1.57       $        2.46




Oil and gas revenues. As shown in the above table, total oil and gas sales decreased by $29,108, a 36.1% decline, for the three months ended March 31, 2016 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2015.
Of this decline, $4,580 and $23,667 were due to decreases in the average prices of oil and gas sold, respectively. The average price fell to $28.91 from $42.10 per barrel (bbl) and to $1.57 from $2.46 per thousand cubic feet (mcf) for the three months ended March 31, 2016 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2015.
Also contributing to the decline in sales was $3,145 due to a lower volume of gas sold by 1,997 mcf.
Slightly offsetting these declines was an increase of $2,284 from an increase in the volume of oil sold by 79 bbls.
Lease operations. Lease operating expense during the three month period ended March 31, 2016 decreased to $52,698 from $88,788 for the three month period ended March 31, 2015 due to fewer well repairs and workovers.
Production taxes. Production taxes during the three month period ended March 31, 2016 decreased to $3,181 from $6,298 for the three month period ended March 31, 2015. This was due to lower overall oil and gas revenue for the three month period ended March 31, 2016.
Administrative and general expense. Administrative and general expense for the three month period ended March 31, 2016 fell to $7,636 from $10,623 for the three month period ended March 31, 2015 due to decreased administrative expenses allocable to the Partnership.
Depreciation, depletion and amortization. Depreciation, depletion and amortization for the three months ended March 31, 2016 decreased to $15,235 from $31,019 for the three months ended March 31, 2015 due to the overall decrease in oil and gas production.
Cost ceiling write-down. There was a cost ceiling write-down of $25,193 for the three months ended March 31, 2016. This was due to lower average oil and gas prices for the twelve months preceding the write-down. There was no cost ceiling write-down for the three months ended March 31, 2015.

CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.



Description of
Business




Mewbourne
Energy Partners 03-A, L.P. (the “Registrant” or the
“Partnership”), a Delaware limited partnership, is
engaged primarily in oil and gas development and production in
Texas, Oklahoma, and New Mexico, and was organized on
February 19, 2003. The offering of limited and general
partnership interests began May 16, 2003 as a part of an
offering registered under the name Mewbourne Energy Partners 02-03
Drilling Program, (the “Program”), and concluded
July 9, 2003, with total investor contributions of $18,000,000
originally being sold to 710 subscribers of which $16,107,005 were
sold to 644 subscribers as general partner interests and $1,892,995
were sold to 66 subscribers as limited partner interests. During
2005, all general partner equity interests were converted to
limited partner equity interests. In accordance with the laws of
the State of Delaware, Mewbourne Development Corporation
(“MD”), a Delaware Corporation, has been appointed as
the Partnership’s managing general partner. MD has no
significant equity interest in the Partnership.

 




2.



Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies




Reference is
hereby made to the Registrant’s Annual Report on Form 10-K
for 2010, which contains a summary of significant accounting
policies followed by the Partnership in the preparation of its
financial statements. These policies are also followed in preparing
the quarterly report included herein.

In
the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited financial
statements contain all adjustments of a normal recurring nature
necessary to present fairly our financial position, results of
operations, cash flows and partners’ capital for the periods
presented. The results of operations for the interim periods are
not necessarily indicative of the final results expected for the
full year.

 




3.



Accounting for
Oil and Gas Producing Activities




The
Partnership follows the full-cost method of accounting for its oil
and gas activities. Under the full-cost method, all productive and
non-productive costs incurred in the acquisition, exploration and
development of oil and gas properties are capitalized.
Depreciation, depletion and amortization of oil and gas properties
subject to amortization is computed on the units-of-production
method based on the proved reserves underlying the oil and gas
properties. At June 30, 2011 and 2010, all capitalized costs
were subject to amortization. Proceeds from the sale or other
disposition of properties are credited to the full cost pool. Gains
and losses on the sale or other disposition of properties are not
recognized unless such adjustments would significantly alter the
relationship between capitalized costs and the proved oil and gas
reserves. Capitalized costs are subject to a quarterly ceiling test
that limits such costs to the aggregate of the present value of
future net cash flows of proved reserves and the lower of cost or
fair value of unproved properties. There was no cost ceiling
write-down for the three or six months ended June 30, 2011 or
2010.

4.



Asset
Retirement Obligations




The
Partnership has recognized an estimated liability for future
plugging and abandonment costs. The estimated liability is based on
historical experience and estimated well life. The liability is
discounted using the credit-adjusted risk-free rate. Revisions to
the liability could occur due to changes in well ownership
interests or well plugging and abandonment costs, or if federal or
state regulators enact new well restoration requirements. The
Partnership recognizes accretion expense in connection with the
discounted liability over the remaining life of the
well.

A
reconciliation of the Partnership’s liability for well
plugging and abandonment costs for the six months ended
June 30, 2011 and the year ended December 31, 2010 is as
follows:

Related Party
Transactions




In
accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, Mewbourne
Development Corporation (“MD”), a Delaware Corporation,
has been appointed as the Partnership’s managing general
partner. MD has no significant equity interest in the Partnership.
Mewbourne Oil Company (“MOC”) is operator of oil and
gas properties owned by the Partnership. Mewbourne Holdings, Inc.
is the parent of both MD and MOC. Substantially all transactions
are with MD and MOC.

In
the ordinary course of business, MOC will incur certain costs that
will be passed on to owners of the well for which the costs were
incurred. The Partnership will receive their portion of these costs
based upon their ownership in each well incurring the costs. These
costs are referred to as operator charges and are standard and
customary in the oil and gas industry. Operator charges include
recovery of gas marketing costs, fixed rate overhead, supervision,
pumping, and equipment furnished by the operator, some of which
will be included in the full cost pool pursuant to Rule 4-10(c)(2)
of Regulation S-X. Services and operator charges are billed in
accordance with the program and partnership agreements.

In
general, during any particular calendar year the total amount of
administrative expenses allocated to the Partnership by MOC shall
not exceed the greater of (a) 3.5% of the Partnership’s
gross revenue from the sale of oil and natural gas production
during each year (calculated without any deduction for operating
costs or other costs and expenses) or (b) the sum of $50,000
plus .25% of the capital contributions of limited and general
partners.

The
Partnership participates in oil and gas activities through the
Program. The Partnership and MD are the parties to the Program, and
the costs and revenues are allocated between them as

(1)



Pursuant to the
Program, MD must contribute 100% of organization and offering costs
and lease acquisition costs which should approximate 30% of total
capital costs. To the extent that organization and offering costs
and lease acquisition costs are less than 30% of total capital
costs, MD is responsible for tangible drilling costs until its
share of the Program’s total capital costs reaches
approximately 30%. The Partnership’s financial statements
reflect its respective proportionate interest in the
Program.




   Item 2.  Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations

Liquidity and
Capital Resources

Mewbourne
Energy Partners 03-A, L.P. was formed February 19, 2003. The
offering of limited and general partnership interests began
May 16, 2003 and concluded July 9, 2003, with total
investor contributions of $18,000,000. During 2005, all general
partner equity interests were converted to limited partner equity
interests.

Future capital
requirements and operations will be conducted with available funds
generated from oil and gas activities. No bank borrowing is
anticipated. The Partnership had net working capital of $123,089 at
June 30, 2011.

During the six
months ended June 30, 2011, the Partnership made cash
distributions to the investor partners in the amount of $259,523 as
compared to $212,237 for the six months ended June 30, 2010.
The Partnership expects that cash distributions will continue
during 2011 as additional oil and gas revenues are sufficient to
produce cash flows from operations.

The sale of
crude oil and natural gas produced by the Partnership will be
affected by a number of factors that are beyond the
Partnership’s control. These factors include the price of
crude oil and natural gas, the fluctuating supply of and demand for
these products, competitive fuels, refining, transportation,
extensive federal and state regulations governing the production
and sale of crude oil and natural gas, and other competitive
conditions. It is impossible to predict with any certainty the
future effect of these factors on the Partnership.

PART I


ITEM 1. Business
Mewbourne Energy Partners 03-A, L.P. (the �Registrant�) is a limited
partnership organized under the laws of the State of Delaware on February�19,
2003 (date of inception). Its managing general partner is Mewbourne
Development Corporation, a Delaware corporation (�MD�).

A Registration Statement was filed pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended, registering limited and general partnership interests in a series of
two Delaware limited partnerships formed under Mewbourne Energy 02-03 Drilling
Programs. General and limited partnership interests were offered at $1,000
each. The maximum offering amount was $18,000,000 (18,000 interests) per
partnership. The Registrant was declared effective by the Securities and
Exchange Commission on May�16, 2003. On July�9, 2003, the offering of limited
and general partnership interests in the Registrant was closed, with interests
aggregating $18,000,000 being sold to 710 subscribers of which $16,107,000 were
sold to 644 subscribers as general partner interests and $1,893,000 were sold
to 66 subscribers as limited partner interests.

The Registrant engages primarily in oil and gas development and production and
is not involved in any other industry segment. See the selected financial data
in Item�6 and the financial statements in Item�8 of this report for a summary
of the Registrant�s revenue, income and identifiable assets.

The Registrant has acquired interests in oil and gas prospects for the purpose
of development drilling. At December�31, 2003, 23 wells had been drilled and
were productive and 7 wells were drilled and abandoned. The following table

The sale of crude oil and natural gas produced by the Registrant will be
affected by a number of factors that are beyond the Registrant�s control.
These factors include the price of crude oil and natural gas, the fluctuating
supply of and demand for these products, competitive fuels, refining,
transportation, extensive federal and state regulations governing the
production and sale of crude oil and natural gas, and other competitive
conditions. It is impossible to predict with any certainty the future effect
of these factors on the Registrant.

The Registrant does not have long-term contracts with purchasers of its crude
oil or natural gas. The market for crude oil is such that the Registrant
anticipates it will be able to sell all the crude oil it can produce. Natural
gas will be sold to local distribution companies, gas marketers and end users
on the spot market. The spot market reflects immediate sales of natural gas
without long-term contractual commitments. The future market condition for
natural gas cannot be predicted with any certainty, and the Registrant may
experience delays in marketing natural gas production and fluctuations in
natural gas prices.

Many aspects of the Registrant�s activities are highly competitive including,
but not limited to, the acquisition of suitable drilling prospects and the
procurement of drilling and related oil field equipment, and are subject to
governmental regulation, both at Federal and state levels. The Registrant�s
ability to compete depends on its financial resources and on the managing
general partner�s staff and facilities, none of which are significant in
comparison with those of the oil and gas exploration, development and
production industry as a whole. Federal and state regulation of oil and gas
operations generally includes drilling and spacing of wells on producing
acreage, the imposition of maximum allowable production rates, the taxation of
income and other items, and the protection of the environment.

The Registrant does not have any employees of its own. MD is responsible for
all management functions. Mewbourne Oil Company (�MOC�), a wholly owned
subsidiary

Table of Contents

of Mewbourne Holdings, Inc., which is also the parent of the Registrant�s
managing general partner, has been appointed Program Manager and is responsible
for activities in accordance with a Drilling Program Agreement entered into by
the Registrant, MD and MOC. At March�29, 2004, MOC employed 139 persons, many
of whom dedicated a part of their time to the conduct of the Registrant�s
business during the period for which this report is filed.

The production of oil and gas is not considered subject to seasonal factors
although the price received by the Registrant for natural gas sales will
generally tend to increase during the winter months. Order backlog is not
pertinent to the Registrant�s business.



ITEM 2. Properties
The Registrant�s properties consist primarily of leasehold interests in
properties on which oil and gas wells are located. Such property interests are
often subject to landowner royalties, overriding royalties and other oil and
gas leasehold interests.

Fractional working interests in developmental oil and gas prospects located
primarily in the Anadarko Basin of Western Oklahoma, the Texas Panhandle, and
the Permian Basin of New Mexico and West Texas, were acquired by the
Registrant. At December�31, 2003, 23 wells had been drilled and were
productive and 7 wells had been drilled and abandoned.



ITEM 3. Legal Proceedings
�����1.�Faulconer Resources 2000, LP, et al. v. Mewbourne Oil Company; No.
CV-2004-56 JWF; In the Fifth Judicial District Court, Eddy County New Mexico

�����Plaintiffs Faulconer filed suit February�13, 2004 for Declaratory
Judgment, Tortuous Interference with Leasehold Interest, Temporary Restraining
Order and Preliminary Injunction, seeking direct and consequential damages for
breach of duties, attorneys fees and punitive damages for tortuous interference
with malice. Plaintiffs seek an injunction to deny Mewbourne Oil Company
(�MOC�) the opportunity to drill its La Huerta �30� Fee Com. No.�1 well, in
which the partnership owns a working interest.

�����Plaintiffs claim that MOC has no right to cause the wellbore of the La
Huerta well to traverse the underground rock strata in the SE/4 of Section�19
and the NE/4 of Section�30 on its way to a bottom hole location in the SE/4 of
Section�30, all in Township 21 South, Range 27 East, Eddy County, New Mexico.
Plaintiffs own no interest in the SE/4 of Section�30, but do own oil and gas
leasehold interests in the SE/4 of Section�19 and the NE/4 of Section�30,
subject to a current Farmout Agreement with MOC as Farmee and Plaintiffs as
Farmor. Plaintiffs claim the right to exclude MOC�s La Huerta�s wellbore from
proceeding through the underground rock strata where Plaintiffs own oil and gas
leasehold interests. Plaintiffs assert MOC�s wellbore would constitute a
permanent trespass, causing Plaintiffs irreparable injury and seek to enjoin
the drilling of the well. Plaintiffs claim MOC�s filing of an application to
drill the well with regulatory bodies constitutes a deliberate and malicious
interference with the contractual relationships between Plaintiffs and their
lessors.

�����MOC believes it has the right to drill its La Huerta well as planned. The
bottom hole location for the well is within a residential area nearby the city
of Carlsbad, New Mexico. A surface location for the well within the SE/4 of
Section�30 is not feasible or appropriate due to the proximity of residences
and the inability to construct and use a natural gas pipeline to gather and
transport natural gas produced by the well. Thus, MOC proposes to drill a
deviated well from a surface location within the SE/4 of Section�19,for which
MOC has acquired a surface use easement and agreement. The wellbore would
traverse the SE/4 of Section�19 and the NE/4 of Section�30 before entering
MOC�s leasehold area in the S/2 of Section�30. After MOC notified Plaintiffs
of MOC�s plans, Plaintiffs asserted that MOC did not have authority to execute
its plans without Plaintiffs consent and sued MOC. Plaintiffs have refused to
consent to MOC�s plans unless MOC gives Plaintiffs a substantial working
interest in the La Huerta well.

Table of Contents

�����Plaintiff�s� presented their application for preliminary injunction to the
court on March�3, 2004. MOC vigorously contested Plaintiffs� claims. MOC
believes that Plaintiffs should not be permitted to block the drilling of the
La Huerta well unless Plaintiffs can show that their leasehold rights in the
SE/4 of Section�19 and the NE/4 of Section�30 would be interfered with
unreasonably by MOC�s well. MOC further believes Plaintiffs failed to prove
such unreasonable interference would occur as a result of the drilling of the
La Huerta well. By Order dated March�17, 2004, the court denied Plaintiffs�
application for injunctive relief, finding that MOC would not be trespassing
upon Plaintiffs� oil and gas leasehold estates, that MOC�s operations would not
interfere with operation of Plaintiffs� oil and gas leasehold interests, either
surface or subsurface and that Plaintiffs would not suffer irreparable damage
in any respect. Plaintiffs have advised MOC that they will appeal the Court�s
ruling. MOC does not believe the Court�s order will be reversed on appeal.
Accordingly, MOC has commenced drilling operations on the La Huerta �30� No.
1-Y well in keeping with the Court�s order and to prevent drainage and protect
its correlative rights.

ITEM 5. Market for Registrant�s Common Equity and Related Stockholder Matters
At March�29, 2004, the Registrant had 18,000 outstanding limited and general
partnership interests held of record by 710 subscribers. There is no
established public or organized trading market for the limited and general
partnership interests.

Revenues which, in the sole judgement of the managing general partner, are not
required to meet the Registrant�s obligations will be distributed to the
partners at least quarterly in accordance with the Registrant�s Partnership
Agreement. Distributions made to limited and general partners during the period
from February�19, 2003 (date of inception) through December�31, 2003 were
$180,000.

ITEM 7. Management�s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations
General

Mewbourne Energy Partners 03-A, L.P. (the �Registrant�) was organized as a
Delaware limited partnership on February�19, 2003. The offering of limited and
general partner interests began May�16, 2003 as part of an offering registered
under the name Mewbourne Energy 02-03 Drilling Programs. The offering of
limited and general partner interests in the Registrant concluded July�9, 2003,
with total investor partner contributions of $18,000,000.

The Registrant was formed to engage primarily in the business of drilling
development wells, to produce and market crude oil and natural gas produced
from such properties, to distribute any net proceeds from operations to the
general and limited partners and to the extent necessary, acquire leases which
contain drilling prospects. The economic life of the Registrant depends on the
period over which the Registrant�s oil and gas reserves are economically
recoverable.

Results of Operations

Because the Registrant was formed during the period covered by this report, no
trend analysis based on yearly changes in liquidity, capital resources or
results of operations is available.

Revenues and other income during the period from February�19, 2003 (date of
inception) through December�31, 2003 totaled $420,182, and consisted of oil and
gas sales in the amount of $370,391, and interest income in the amount of
$49,791. Gas production volumes during the period ended December�31, 2003
5



Table of Contents

amounted to approximately 69,676 mcf of gas at a corresponding average realized
price of $4.69 per mcf of gas. Oil production volumes during the period ended
December�31, 2003 amounted to approximately 1,457 bbls of oil at a
corresponding average realized price of $29.88 per bbl of oil. Expenses
totaling $321,017, consisted primarily of depreciation, depletion and
amortization in the amount of $173,088,and a cost ceiling write-down of
$83,646. Lease operating expenses totaled $22,525. Production taxes were
$27,668. Administrative and general expenses were $5,371. Asset retirement
obligation accretion expenses were $8,719. At December�31, 2003, 23 wells had
been drilled and were productive and 7 wells had been drilled and abandoned.
The Registrant�s oil and gas revenues should increase during 2004 as additional
wells are completed and oil and gas production is sold. Interest income should
decrease in 2004 as the remaining wells are drilled and the available cash is
utilized for the equipping of such wells. The Registrant expects that drilling
and completion costs will decrease during 2004 and that lease operating cost
and depletion provisions will increase.

Liquidity and capital resources

Net cash increased by $5,551,936 during the period from February�19, 2003 (date
of inception) through December�31, 2003. Approximately $12,653,947 of the net
initial partners� capital of $18,000,000 was used for drilling and completion
and prepaid well costs. Capital requirements in the future are expected to be
paid with the initial partners� capital. Management believes that funds are
sufficient to complete the wells for which funds have been committed. Under
certain circumstances, as provided in the Registrant�s Partnership Agreement,
the Registrant may use revenues and/or borrow monies, either through a
financial institution or through an affiliate of MD, to fund additional capital
requirements. Revenues which, in the sole judgement of the managing general
partner, are not required to meet the Registrant�s obligations will be
distributed to the partners at least quarterly in accordance with the
Registrant�s Partnership Agreement.

Critical Accounting Policies

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Significant estimates inherent in the Registrant�s financial statements include
the estimate of oil and gas reserves as reported in the footnotes to the
financial statements. Changes in oil and gas prices, changes in production
estimates and the success or failure of future development activities could
have a significant effect on reserve estimates. The reserve estimates directly
impact the computation of depreciation, depletion and amortization, and the
ceiling test for the Registrant�s oil and gas properties.

The Registrant follows the full-cost method of accounting for its oil and gas
activities. Under the full-cost method, all productive and nonproductive costs
incurred in the acquisition, exploration and development of oil and gas
properties are capitalized. Depreciation, depletion and amortization of oil
and gas properties subject to amortization is computed on the
units-of-production method based on the proved reserves underlying the oil and
gas properties. Oil and gas properties are subject to an annual ceiling test
that limits such costs to the aggregate of the present value of future net cash
flows of proved reserves and the lower of cost or fair value of unproved
properties. The present value of future net cash flows has been prepared
assuming year-end selling prices, year end development and production cost and
a 10�percent annual discount rate.

All financing activities of the Registrant are reported in the financial
statements. The Registrant does not engage in any off-balance sheet financing
arrangements.

Organization and Related Party Transactions

The Partnership was organized on February�19, 2003. Mewbourne Development
Corporation (MD)�is managing general partner and Mewbourne Oil Company (MOC)�is
operator of oil and gas properties owned by the Partnership. Mewbourne
Holdings, Inc. is the parent of both MD and MOC. Substantially all
transactions are with MD and MOC.

Reimbursement to MOC for supervision and other operator charges totaled
$389,778 for the period February�19, 2003 (date of inception) through December
31, 2003. Services and operator charges are billed in accordance with the
program and partnership agreements.

In general, during any particular calendar year the total amount of
administrative expenses allocated to the Partnership shall not exceed the
greater of (a)�3.5% of the Partnership�s gross revenue from the sale of oil and
natural gas production during each year (calculated without any deduction for
operating costs or other costs and expenses) or (b)�the sum of $50,000 plus
..25% of the capital contributions of limited and general partners. Under this
arrangement, there were $654 allocated to the Partnership during the period
ended December�31, 2003.

The Partnership participates in oil and gas activities through an income tax
partnership, the Program. The Partnership and MD are parties to the Program
agreement. The costs and revenues of the Program are allocated to MD and the
Partnership as follows:

organization and offering costs and lease acquisition costs which will
approximate 30% of total capital costs. To the extent that organization and
offering costs and lease acquisition costs are less that 30% of total capital
costs, MD is responsible for tangible drilling costs until its share of the
Program�s total capital costs reaches approximately 30%.

The Partnership�s financial statements reflect its respective proportionate
interest in the Program.

MEWBOURNE ENERGY PARTNERS 03-A, L. P.
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. Significant Accounting Policies:

����Accounting for Oil and Gas Producing Activities

Mewbourne Energy Partners 03-A, L.P., (the �Partnership�), a Delaware limited
partnership engaged primarily in oil and gas development and production in
Texas, Oklahoma, and New Mexico, was organized on February�19, 2003. The
offering of limited and general partnership interests began May�16, 2003 as a
part of an offering registered under the name Mewbourne Energy Partners 02-03
Drilling Programs, (the �Program�), and concluded July�9, 2003, with total
investor contributions of $18,000,000 being sold to 710 subscribers of which
$16,107,000 were sold to 644 subscribers as general partner interests and
$1,893,000 were sold to 66 subscribers as limited partner interests.

The Program�s sole business is the development and production of oil and gas
with a concentration on gas. Substantially all of the Program�s gas reserves
are being sold regionally in the spot market. Due to the highly competitive
nature of the spot market, prices are subject to wide seasonal and regional
pricing fluctuations. In addition, such spot market sales are generally
short-term in nature and are dependent upon obtaining transportation services
provided by pipelines. The prices received for the Program�s oil and gas are
subject to influences such as global consumption and supply trends.

The Partnership follows the full-cost method of accounting for its oil and gas
activities. Under the full-cost method, all productive and nonproductive costs
incurred in the acquisition, exploration and development of oil and gas
properties are capitalized. Depreciation, depletion and amortization of oil
and gas properties subject to amortization is computed on the
units-of-production method based on the proved reserves underlying the oil and
gas properties. At December�31, 2003, approximately $475,392 of capitalized
costs were excluded from amortization. The excluded costs were development
costs incurred in 2003 on wells in progress. These costs will be subject to
amortization in 2003. Proceeds from the sale or other disposition of
properties are credited to the full cost pool. Gains and losses are not
recognized unless such adjustments would significantly alter the relationship
between capitalized costs and the proved oil and gas reserves. Capitalized
costs are subject to an annual ceiling test that limits such costs to the
aggregate of the present value of future net cash flows of proved reserves and
the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties. A cost ceiling
write-down of $83,646 was recorded for the year ended December�31, 2003.

Significant estimates inherent in the partnership�s financial statements
include the estimate of oil and gas reserves as reported in the footnotes to
the financial statements. Changes in oil and gas prices, changes in production
estimates and the success or failure of future development activities could
have a significant effect on reserve estimates. The reserve estimates directly
impact the computation of depreciation, depletion and amortization, and the
ceiling test for the Registrants oil and gas properties.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported
amounts
of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could
differ from
those estimates.

�����Cash and cash equivalents

The Partnership considers all highly liquid investments, those with original
maturities of three months or less at the date of acquisition, to be cash
equivalents.

The Partnership maintains all its cash in one financial institution.

�����Asset Retirement Obligation

In accordance with FAS 143, the Partnership has recognized an estimated
liability for future oil and gas well plugging and abandonment costs.
The estimated liability is based

20



Table of Contents

on historical experience and estimated well lives. The liability is discounted
using the credit-adjusted risk-free rate. Revisions to the liability could
occur due to changes in well plugging and abandonment costs or well useful
lives, or if federal or state regulators enact new well restoration
requirements.

A reconciliation of the Partnership�s liability for well plugging and
abandonment costs for the period from February�19, 2003 (date of inception) to
December�31, 2003, is as follows:

�����Oil and Gas Sales

The Program�s oil and condensate production is sold, title passed, and revenue
recognized at or near the Program�s wells under short-term purchase contracts
at prevailing prices in accordance with arrangements which are customary in the
oil industry. Sales of gas applicable to the Program�s interest are recorded
as revenue when the gas is metered and title transferred pursuant to the gas
sales contracts covering the Program�s interest in gas reserves. The
Partnership uses the sales method to recognize oil and gas revenue whereby
revenue is recognized for the amount of production taken regardless of the
amount for which the Partnership is entitled based on its working interest
ownership. As of December�31, 2003, no material gas imbalances between the
Partnership and other working interest owners existed.

�����Income Taxes

The Partnership is treated as a partnership for income tax purposes, and as a
result, income of the Partnership is reported on the tax returns of the
partners and no recognition is given to income taxes in the financial
statements.

2. Organization and Related Party Transactions:

The Partnership was organized on February�19, 2003. Mewbourne Development
Corporation (MD)�is managing general partner and Mewbourne Oil Company (MOC)�is
operator of oil and gas properties owned by the Partnership. Mewbourne
Holdings, Inc. is the parent of both MD and MOC. Substantially all
transactions are with MD and MOC.

Reimbursement to MOC for supervision and other operator charges totaled
$389,778 for the period February�19, 2003 (date of inception) through December
31, 2003. Services and operator charges are billed in accordance with the
program and partnership agreements.

In general, during any particular calendar year the total amount of
administrative expenses allocated to the Partnership shall not exceed the
greater of (a)�3.5% of the Partnership�s gross revenue from the sale of oil and
natural gas production during each year (calculated without any deduction for
operating costs or other costs and expenses) or (b)�the sum of
$50,000 plus .25% of the capital contributions of limited and general partners. Under this
arrangement, there were $654 allocated to the Partnership during the period
ended December�31, 2003.

The Partnership participates in oil and gas activities through an income tax
partnership, the Program. The Partnership and MD are parties to the Program
agreement. The costs and revenues of the Program are allocated to MD and the
Partnership as follows:

(1)�As noted above, pursuant to the Program, MD must contribute 100% of
organization and offering costs and lease acquisition costs which will
approximate 30% of total capital costs. To the extent that organization and
offering costs and lease acquisition costs are less than 30% of total capital
costs, MD is responsible for tangible drilling costs until its share of the
Program�s total capital costs reaches approximately 30%.

The Partnership�s financial statements reflect its respective proportionate
interest in the Program.

4. Legal

�����1.�Faulconer Resources 2000, LP, et al. v. Mewbourne Oil Company; No.
CV-2004-56 JWF; In the Fifth Judicial District Court, Eddy County New Mexico

�����Plaintiffs Faulconer filed suit February�13, 2004 for Declaratory
Judgment, Tortuous Interference with Leasehold Interest, Temporary Restraining
Order and Preliminary Injunction, seeking direct and consequential damages for
breach of duties, attorneys fees and punitive damages for tortuous interference
with malice. Plaintiffs seek an injunction to deny Mewbourne Oil Company
(�MOC�) the opportunity to drill its La Huerta �30� Fee Com. No.�1 well, in
which the partnership owns a working interest.

�����Plaintiffs claim that MOC has no right to cause the wellbore of the La
Huerta well to traverse the underground rock strata in the SE/4 of Section�19
and the NE/4 of Section�30 on its way to a bottom hole location in the SE/4 of
Section�30, all in Township 21 South, Range 27 East, Eddy County, New Mexico.
Plaintiffs own no interest in the SE/4 of Section�30, but do own oil and gas
leasehold interests in the SE/4 of Section�19 and the NE/4 of Section�30,
subject to a current Farmout Agreement with MOC as Farmee and Plaintiffs as
Farmor. Plaintiffs claim the right to exclude MOC�s La Huerta�s wellbore from
proceeding through the underground rock strata where Plaintiffs own oil and gas
leasehold interests. Plaintiffs assert MOC�s wellbore would constitute a
permanent trespass, causing Plaintiffs irreparable injury and seek to enjoin
the drilling of the well. Plaintiffs claim MOC�s filing of an application to
drill the well with regulatory bodies constitutes a deliberate and malicious
interference with the contractual relationships between Plaintiffs and their
lessors.

�����MOC believes it has the right to drill its La Huerta well as planned. The
bottom hole location for the well is within a residential area nearby the city
of Carlsbad, New

22



Table of Contents

Mexico. A surface location for the well within the SE/4 of
Section�30 is not feasible or appropriate due to the proximity of residences
and the inability to
construct and use a natural gas pipeline to gather and transport natural gas
produced by the well. Thus, MOC proposes to drill a deviated well from a
surface location within the SE/4 of Section�19, for which MOC has acquired a
surface use easement and agreement. The wellbore would traverse the SE/4 of
Section�19 and the NE/4 of Section�30 before entering MOC�s leasehold area in
the S/2 of Section�30. After MOC notified Plaintiffs of MOC�s plans,
Plaintiffs asserted that MOC did not have authority to execute its plans
without Plaintiffs consent and sued MOC. Plaintiffs have refused to consent to
MOC�s plans unless MOC gives Plaintiffs a substantial working interest in the
La Huerta well.

Plaintiff�s� presented their application for preliminary injunction to the
court on March�3, 2004. MOC vigorously contested Plaintiffs� claims. MOC
believes that Plaintiffs should not be permitted to block the drilling of the
La Huerta well unless Plaintiffs can show that their leasehold rights in the
SE/4 of Section�19 and the NE/4 of Section�30 would be interfered with
unreasonably by MOC�s well. MOC further believes Plaintiffs failed to prove
such unreasonable interference would occur as a result of the drilling of the
La Huerta well. By Order dated March�17, 2004, the court denied Plaintiffs�
application for injunctive relief, finding that MOC would not be trespassing
upon Plaintiffs� oil and gas leasehold estates, that MOC�s operations would not
interfere with operation of Plaintiffs� oil and gas leasehold interests, either
surface or subsurface and that Plaintiffs would not suffer irreparable damage
in any respect. Plaintiffs have advised MOC that they will appeal the Court�s
ruling. MOC does not believe the Court�s order will be reversed on appeal.
Accordingly, MOC has commenced drilling operations on the La Huerta �30� No.
1-Y well in keeping with the Court�s order and to prevent drainage and protect
its correlative rights.

Depreciation, depletion, and amortization per one thousand cubic feet of gas
equivalent was $2.21 for the period from February�19, 2003 (date of inception)
through December�31, 2003.

Although certain wells had been drilled, completed and began producing in
December, 2003, a majority of the wells drilled, or to be drilled, by the
Partnership have been, or will be, completed subsequent to December�31, 2003.
The following information relates to the wells drilled and completed by
December�31, 2003.

����������������������Estimated Net Quantities of Proved Oil and Gas Reserves

Proved reserve quantities were based on estimates prepared by MOC engineers in
accordance with guidelines established by the Securities and Exchange
Commission. The Partnership considers such estimates to be reasonable,
however, due to inherent uncertainties and the limited nature of reservoir
data, estimates of oil and gas reserves are imprecise and subject to change
over time as additional information becomes available.

There have been no favorable or adverse events that have caused a significant

�����Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows:

The Standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows from estimated
production of proved oil and gas reserves is presented in accordance with the
provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.�69, �Disclosures
about Oil and Gas Producing Activities� (SFAS No.�69). In computing this data,
assumptions other than those mandated by SFAS No.�69 could produce
substantially different results. The Partnership cautions against viewing this
information as a forecast of future economic conditions, revenues, or fair
value.

The standardized measure has been prepared assuming year-end selling prices,
year end development and production cost and a 10�percent annual discount rate.
No future income tax expense has been provided for the Partnership since it
incurs no income tax liability. (See Significant Accounting Policies � Income
Taxes in Note 1 to the Financial Statements.) The year-end prices were $30.60
per barrel of oil and $5.55 per MCF of gas for the period ended December�31,
2003.
