HOUSTON, June 17, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- Salient Partners L.P. (Salient), a $19.8 billion asset management firm, has launched the Salient MLP Fund (Class A Ticker: SAMCX, Class C Ticker: SCMCX, Class I Ticker: SIMCX). This is the firm's second mutual fund focused on master limited partnerships (MLPs).
The Salient MLP Fund (the "Fund") seeks to provide a high level of total return and emphasizes making quarterly cash distributions to shareholders. Its strategy entails investing at least 80 percent of its net assets in equity securities of MLPs. The Fund may also invest in securities of other energy companies and securities issued by open and closed-end investment companies, including money market funds, actively managed and index exchange traded funds and exchange traded notes, U.S. government securities, debt securities, cash and/or other cash equivalents.  
"We believe economic uncertainty and a low interest rate environment have caused an increased interest in yield-oriented securities," said Gregory A. Reid, Partner and Managing Director of Salient, who serves as the President and CEO of Salient's Master Limited Partnership business. "Many investors seeking attractive yields, potential inflation protection and distribution growth are turning to MLPs, which have demonstrated a compelling historical performance since 2006." 
Focused on the midstream energy industry, with long-term, fee-based real assets that engage in the transportation and storage of natural resources, the Salient MLP Fund utilizes a C-Corp structure. The Advisor intends to strategically utilize leverage to minimize the effects of deferred tax liability accruing on any unrealized gains, realized gains and net income. Leverage will be approximately 25 percent of the value of the Fund's total assets. The Fund is non-diversified, which means that it may invest in a limited number of issuers, and its investment may be in issuers of any market capitalization ranges. Portfolio allocation will be focused in Midstream MLPs that principally own and operate assets used in energy logistics.
"The Fund's investment process puts emphasis on seeking cash flow stability, balance sheet strength and management experience," said Mr. Reid. "Daily liquidity, quarterly distributions and 1099 tax reporting are additional attributes of the Fund's investor-friendly structure."
To learn more about the Salient MLP Fund, please visit www.salientfunds.com. For more information about Salient, please contact Chris Moon of JCPR at 973-850-7304 or cmoon@jcprinc.com.
The Fund's investments are concentrated in the energy infrastructure industry with an emphasis on securities issued by MLPs, which may increase price fluctuation. The value of commodity-linked investments such as the MLPs and Other Energy Companies in which the Fund invests are subject to risks specific to the industry they serve, such as fluctuations in commodity prices, reduced volumes of available natural gas or other energy commodities, slowdowns in new construction and acquisitions, a sustained reduced demand for crude oil, natural gas and refined petroleum products, depletion of the natural gas reserves or other commodities, changes in the macroeconomic or regulatory environment, environmental hazards, rising interest rates and threats of attack by terrorists on energy assets, each of which could affect the Fund's profitability. MLPs are subject to significant regulation and may be adversely affected by changes in the regulatory environment including the risk that an MLP could lose its tax status as a partnership. If an MLP were to be obligated to pay federal income tax on its income at the corporate tax rate, the amount of cash available for distribution would be reduced and such distributions received by the Fund would be taxed under federal income tax laws applicable to corporate dividends received (as dividend income, return of capital, or capital gain). 
In addition, investing in MLPs involves additional risks as compared to the risks of investing in common stock, including risks related to cash flow, dilution and voting rights. Such companies may trade less frequently than larger companies due to their smaller capitalizations which may result in erratic price movement or difficulty in buying or selling. 
Additional management fees and other expenses are associated with investing in MLP funds. The Fund is subject to certain MLP tax risks and risks associated with accounting for its deferred tax liability which could materially reduce the net asset value. An investment in the Fund does not offer the tax benefits of a direct investment in an MLP. 
The Fund, unlike most open-end funds, is classified for federal tax purposes as a domestic taxable corporation or so-called Subchapter "C" corporation. As a "C" corporation, the Fund will incur tax expenses. This treatment is still a relatively recent strategy for open-end funds, and it involves complicated accounting, tax and valuation aspects that may cause the Fund to differ significantly from most other open-end registered investment companies. This could result in unexpected and potentially significant accounting, tax and valuation consequences for the Fund and for its shareholders. In addition, accounting, tax and valuation practices in this area are still developing, and there may not always be a clear consensus among industry participants as to the most appropriate approach. This could result in changes over time in the practices applied by the Fund, which, in turn, could have significant adverse consequences on the Fund and its shareholders.
No fund is a complete investment program and you may lose money investing in a fund. The Fund may engage in other investment practices that may involve additional risks and you should review the Fund prospectus for a complete description.
You should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Fund carefully before investing. The prospectus contains this and other information about the Fund and is available, along with information on other Salient funds, by calling 866-667-9228 or from your financial professional. The prospectus should be read carefully before investing.
A Word about Forward-Looking Statements. This press release contains "forward-looking statements" as defined under the U.S. federal securities laws. Generally, the words "believe," "expect," "intend," "estimate," "anticipate," "project," "will," and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements, which generally are not historical in nature. Forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual future results to differ significantly from the Fund's present expectations or projections indicated in any forward looking statements. These risks include, but are not limited to, changes in economic and political conditions; regulatory and legal changes; leverage risk; valuation risk; interest rate risk; tax risk; the volume of sales and purchase of shares; the continuation of investment advisory, administration and other service arrangements; and other risks discussed in the Fund's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. The Fund undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements made herein.
This press release does not constitute an offering of any security, product, service or fund, including the Fund, for which an offer can be made only by the Fund's Prospectus.
Any tax or legal information discussed herein is merely a summary of our current understanding and interpretation of certain tax characteristics and is not exhaustive.  MLPs and MLP investments have unique tax characteristics. Investors must consult their tax advisor or legal counsel for advice and information regarding their particular situation. Neither the Fund nor its representatives purport to give tax or legal advice.

					Overview				


Overview
The fund is designed as a core investment for those who worry about losing money in equity market downturns but also want to participate in the market’s upside. The nimble strategy seeks to sidestep downturns while aiming for positive returns through market cycles. Using active market exposure management, the fund moves in and out of the market incrementally based upon macro and technical factors.
Three Things to Know

The investment team uses proprietary models to judge the direction of the market and is able to change exposure immediately as market conditions change
The fund is able to be up to 200% long when models are positive and go up to 100% short if models turn negative while also being able to hold up to 100% cash
With a very low standard deviation, the strategy seeks to add value by helping to lower the impact of volatility and to preserve capital during down markets

Process
Objective: The fund seeks to produce, in any market environment, above-average risk-adjusted returns and less downside volatility than the S&P 500 Index.

The investment process begins with an assessment of the fundamental economic environment through valuation, monetary policy and investor sentiment
The team then validates these qualitative factors with a quantitative assessment using a proprietary multifactor Volume/Breadth Momentum Model
After evaluating these models, the team adjusts the fund’s market exposure accordingly, increasing equity exposure when the risks are low, decreasing equity exposure when the risks are high or taking a neutral position when no clear opportunities are apparent
Catalyst-driven, policy-focused trades are implemented seeking to generate alpha regardless the overall market environment.


Prior to May 1, 2016, Salient Tactical Plus Fund was named Salient Broadmark Tactical Plus Fund.

        1. As of 06/30/2017
        2. As of 06/30/2017


Returns for periods greater than one year are annualized.
* Excludes sales charge.
** Reflects effects of the fund’s maximum sales charge of 5.75%.
† Excludes the effects of the 1% contingent deferred sales charge.
‡ Includes the effects of the 1% contingent deferred sales charge.
Performance data quoted represents past performance and does not guarantee future results. Investment returns and principal values will fluctuate so that an investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than that shown. All returns reflect reinvestment of all dividend and capital gain distributions. Index performance is shown for illustrative purposes only and does not reflect the payment of advisory fees and other expenses associated with an investment in a mutual fund. Investors cannot directly invest in an index. The performance shown is for the stated time period only; due to market volatility, each account’s performance may be different. Note that performance “With Sales Charge” for the Fund will be available beginning December 31, 2014.
Class A/C/I shares of the fund commenced operations on December 15, 2014. The returns prior to that date are those of the predecessor fund’s Investor Class shares, which commenced operations on December 31, 2012. Performance for the period from 12/31/2012 to 12/12/2014 reflects the gross performance of the Investor Class shares of the predecessor fund adjusted to apply the fees and anticipated expenses of Class A/C/I shares of the fund. All share classes of the fund are invested in the same portfolio of securities and returns only differ to the extent that fees and expenses of the classes are different. In the reorganization, investor class and institutional class shares of the Broadmark Tactical Fund were exchanged for Class F shares of the Salient Tactical Plus Fund.
The share classes have different sales charges, fees and other features. Returns with sales charge reflect the deduction of current maximum front end sales charge of 5.50% for Class A shares, and the maximum contingent deferred sales charge of 1.00% which is applied to Class C shares upon which a finder’s fee has been paid and that are sold within one year of purchase. Class A shares are available with no front-end sales charge on investments of $1 million or more, and Class C shares are offered at NAV, without any initial sales charge. Class I shares are offered without any sales charge to certain institutional investors and affiliates of the fund’s investment advisor. The return figures shown do not reflect the deduction of taxes that a shareholder may pay on fund distributions or the redemption of fund shares.

Annual Fund Operating Expenses includes management fees, distribution and service (12b-1) fees, acquired fund (subsidiary) fees and expenses, and “other expenses.” See the Fund’s prospectus for more information.
Under an expense limitation agreement, the investment advisor has contractually agreed to waive its management fee and/or reimburse or pay operating expenses of the Fund to the extent necessary to maintain the Fund’s total operating expenses at 2.05% for Class A, 2.80% for Class C, 1.80% for Class I and 1.49% for Class F shares, excluding certain expenses, such as taxes, brokerage commissions, interest and borrowing expense, short dividend expense, any acquired fund fees and expenses, litigation and extraordinary expenses. This expense limitation agreement expires on April 30, 2018, and may only be modified or terminated by a majority vote of the independent trustees. The advisor is permitted to recover waived expenses for a period of up to three years.

Fund Specific Risks

Salient Tactical Plus Fund
Principal Investment Risks
An investment in the fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) or any other government agency. The fund’s principal risk factors are listed below. The fund’s shares will go up and down in price, meaning that you could lose money by investing in the fund. Many factors influence a mutual fund’s performance. An investment in the fund is not intended to constitute a complete investment program and should not be viewed as such. Before investing, be sure to read the additional descriptions of these risks beginning on page 13 of the prospectus.
As an overall matter, instability in the financial markets has led many governments, including the United States government, to take a number of unprecedented actions designed to support certain financial institutions and segments of the financial markets that have experienced extreme volatility and, in some cases, a lack of liquidity. Federal, state and other governments, and their regulatory agencies or self-regulatory organizations, may take actions that affect the regulation of the instruments in which the fund invests, or the issuers of such instruments, in ways that are unforeseeable. Legislation or regulation may also change the way in which the Fund itself is regulated. Such legislation or regulation could limit or preclude the fund’s ability to achieve its investment objective.
Risks of Investment Activities Generally
All securities investing and trading activities risk the loss of capital. No assurance can be given that the fund’s investment activities will be successful or that the fund’s shareholders will not suffer losses.
Cash and Cash Equivalents Risk
It is part of the fund’s investment strategy to, at times, hold a substantial portion of its assets in cash and/or cash equivalents, including money market instruments. Under certain market conditions, such as during a rising stock market, this strategy could have a negative effect on the fund’s ability to achieve its investment objective. To the extent that the fund invests in a money market fund, the fund will indirectly bear a proportionate share of the money market fund’s expenses, in addition to the operating expenses of the fund, which are borne directly by fund shareholders.
Debt Securities
Fixed-income securities generally are subject to credit risk and interest rate risk. Credit risk refers to the possibility that the issuer of a security will be unable to make interest payments and/or repay the principal on its debt. Interest rate risk refers to fluctuations in the value of a fixed-income security resulting from changes in the general level of interest rates. When the general level of interest rates goes up, the prices of most fixed-income securities go down. When the general level of interest rates goes down, the prices of most fixed-income securities go up.
Credit Risk
Credit risk refers to the possibility that the issuer of the security will not be able to make principal and interest payments when due. Changes in an issuer’s credit rating or the market’s perception of an issuer’s creditworthiness may also affect the value of the fund’s investment in that issuer. The degree of credit risk depends on both the financial condition of the issuer and the terms of the obligation. Securities rated by the rating agencies in the four highest categories (Standard & Poor’s (“S&P”) (AAA, AA, A and BBB), Fitch Ratings (“Fitch”) (AAA, AA, A and BBB) or Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. (“Moody’s”) (Aaa, Aa, A and Baa)) are considered investment grade, but they may also have some speculative characteristics, meaning that they carry more risk than higher rated securities and may have problems making principal and interest payments in difficult economic climates. Investment grade ratings do not guarantee that bonds will not lose value.
Extension Risk
Extension risk is the risk that, when interest rates rise, certain obligations will be paid off by the issuer (or obligor) more slowly than anticipated, causing the value of these securities to fall. Rising interest rates tend to extend the duration of securities, making them more sensitive to changes in interest rates. The value of longer-term securities generally changes more in response to changes in interest rates than shorter-term securities. As a result, in a period of rising interest rates, securities may exhibit additional volatility and may lose value.
Interest Rate Risk
The yields for certain securities are susceptible in the short-term to fluctuations in interest rates, and the prices of such equity securities may decline when interest rates rise. Interest rate risk in general is the risk that prices of fixed income securities generally increase when interest rates decline and decrease when interest rates increase. The fund may decline in value or suffer losses if short term or long term interest rates rise sharply or otherwise change in a manner not anticipated by the Sub-Advisor.
Prepayment Risk
Prepayment risk is the risk that certain debt securities with high interest rates will be prepaid by the issuer before they mature. When interest rates fall, certain obligations will be paid off by the obligor more quickly than originally anticipated, and an investor may have to invest the proceeds in securities with lower yields. In periods of falling interest rates, the rate of prepayments tends to increase (as does price fluctuation) as borrowers are motivated to pay off debt and refinance at new lower rates. During such periods, reinvestment of the prepayment proceeds by the management team will generally be at lower rates of return than the return on the assets that were prepaid. Prepayment reduces the yield to maturity and the average life of the security.
Derivatives Risk
The use of derivative instruments exposes the Fund to additional risks and transaction costs. These instruments come in many varieties and have a wide range of potential risks and rewards, and may include futures contracts, options on futures contracts, options (both written and purchased), swaps and swaptions. A risk of the fund’s use of derivatives is that the fluctuations in their values may not correlate perfectly with the overall securities markets.
Emerging Market Risk
The fund may have exposure to emerging markets. Emerging markets are riskier than more developed markets because they tend to develop unevenly and may never fully develop. Investments in emerging markets may be considered speculative. Emerging markets are more likely to experience hyperinflation and currency devaluations, which adversely affect returns to U.S. investors. In addition, many emerging securities markets have far lower trading volumes and less liquidity than developed markets.
Equity Securities Risk
Equity securities may be subject to general movements in the stock market, and a significant drop in the stock market may depress the price of securities to which the fund has exposure. The fund may have exposure to or invest in equity securities of companies with small or medium capitalization. Investments in securities of companies with small or medium capitalization involve certain risks that may differ from, or be greater than, those for larger companies, such as higher volatility, lower trading volume, lack of liquidity, fewer business lines and lack of public information (See “Small and Mid-Capitalization Securities Risk”).
Exchange Traded Fund (“ETF”) Risk
Because the fund invests in ETFs and in options on ETFs, the Fund is exposed to the risks associated with the securities and other investments held by such ETFs. The value of any investment in an ETF will fluctuate according to the performance of that ETF. In addition, the fund will indirectly bear a proportionate share of expenses, including any management fees, paid by each ETF in which the fund invests. Such expenses are in addition to the operating expenses of the fund, which are borne directly by shareholders of the fund. Further, individual shares of an ETF may be purchased and sold only on a national securities exchange through a broker-dealer. The price of such shares is based on market price, and because ETF shares trade at market prices rather than NAV, shares may trade at a price greater than NAV (a premium) or less than NAV (a discount). The market price of an ETF’s shares, like the price of any exchange-traded security, includes a “bid-ask spread” charged by the exchange specialists, market makers or other participants that trade the particular security. The bid-ask spread often increases significantly during times of market disruption, which means that, to the extent that the fund invests directly in an ETF, the shares of that ETF may trade at a greater discount at a time when the fund wishes to sell its shares.
Many ETFs have obtained exemptive relief from the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) permitting unaffiliated funds to invest in shares of the ETF beyond the limitations imposed by the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “1940 Act”), subject to certain conditions. The fund may rely on these exemptive orders to invest in unaffiliated ETFs, and the risks described above may be greater than if the fund limited its investment in an ETF in accordance with the limitations imposed by the 1940 Act.
Foreign Securities Risk
Foreign investments often involve special risks not present in U.S. investments that can increase the chances that the fund will lose money. These risks include:

The fund generally holds its foreign securities and cash in foreign banks and securities depositories, which may be recently organized or new to the foreign custody business and may be subject to only limited or no regulatory oversight.
Changes in foreign currency exchange rates can affect the value of the Fund’s portfolio.
The economies of certain foreign markets may not compare favorably with the economy of the United States with respect to such issues as growth of gross national product, reinvestment of capital, resources and balance of payments position.
The governments of certain countries may prohibit or impose substantial restrictions on foreign investments in their capital markets or in certain industries.
Many foreign governments do not supervise and regulate stock exchanges, brokers and the sale of securities to the same extent as does the United States and may not have laws to protect investors that are comparable to U.S. securities laws.
Settlement and clearance procedures in certain foreign markets may result in delays in payment for or delivery of securities not typically associated with settlement and clearance of U.S. investments.

Hedging Risk
Although hedging activities are generally engaged in to help offset negative movements with respect to an investment, such activities will not always be successful. Moreover, hedging may cause the fund to lose money and may reduce the opportunity for gain.
High Portfolio Turnover Risk
To the extent that the Fund makes investments on a shorter-term basis, the fund may as a result trade more frequently and incur higher levels of brokerage fees and commissions.
Leverage Risk
The fund may make investments in options, swaps and futures contracts or other derivative instruments. These and certain other derivatives provide the economic effect of financial leverage by creating additional investment exposure, as well as the potential for greater loss. In connection with derivatives investments, the Fund will be required to maintain specified asset coverage with respect to such investments by both the 1940 Act and the terms of these investments. The fund may be required to dispose of portfolio investments on unfavorable terms if market fluctuations or other factors reduce the required asset coverage below necessary amounts.
Market Events
The U.S. Government and the Federal Reserve, as well as certain foreign governments and their central banks, have taken various steps designed to support and stabilize credit and financial markets since 2008. Reduction or withdrawal of this support, failure of efforts to stabilize the markets, or investor perception that such efforts are not succeeding could negatively affect financial markets generally, as well as have an adverse impact on the liquidity and value of certain securities. In addition, policy and legislative changes in the United States and in other countries are affecting many aspects of financial regulation. For example, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) was enacted in the U.S., reflecting a significant revision of the U.S. financial regulatory framework. The Dodd-Frank Act addresses a variety of topics, including, among others, new rules for trading in derivatives; restrictions on banking entities from engaging in proprietary trading of certain instruments; the registration and additional regulation of private fund managers; and new federal requirements for residential mortgage loans. Securities in which the Fund invests, or the issuers of such securities, may be impacted by the Dodd-Frank Act and any related or additional legislation or regulation in unforeseeable ways. The ultimate effect of the Dodd-Frank Act and any related or additional regulation is not yet known. The impact of these changes on the markets, and the practical implications for market participants, may not be fully known for some time.
Market Risk
Market risk is the risk that the markets on which the fund’s investments trade will increase or decrease in value. Prices may fluctuate widely over short or extended periods in response to company, market or economic news. Markets also tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising and falling prices. If there is a general decline in the securities and other markets, your investment in the Fund may lose value, regardless of the individual results of the securities and other instruments in which the fund invests.
New Fund Risk
The fund is newly-formed. Accordingly, investors in the fund bear the risk that the fund may not be successful in implementing its investment strategy, and may not employ a successful investment strategy, any of which could result in the fund being liquidated at any time without shareholder approval and at a time that may not be favorable for all shareholders. Such a liquidation could have negative tax consequences for shareholders.
Short Sale Risk
The fund may take a short position in a derivative instrument, such as a future, forward or swap. A short position on a derivative instrument involves the risk of a theoretically unlimited increase in the value of the underlying instrument. The fund may also from time to time sell securities short, which involves borrowing and selling a security and covering such borrowed security through a later purchase. A short sale creates the risk of an unlimited loss, in that the price of the underlying security could theoretically increase without limit, thus increasing the cost of buying those securities to cover the short position. There can be no assurance that the securities necessary to cover a short position will be available for purchase. The fund must set aside “cover” for short sales to comply with applicable SEC positions under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (“1940 Act”).
Small- and Mid-Capitalization Securities Risk
The fund may invest its assets in the common stocks and other equity securities of small and mid-capitalization companies with smaller market capitalizations. While the Sub-Advisor believes these investments may provide significant potential for appreciation, they involve higher risks in some respects than do investments in common stocks and other equity securities of larger companies. For example, prices of such investments are often more volatile than prices of large-capitalization stocks and other equity securities. In addition, due to thin trading in some such investments, an investment in these common stocks and other equity securities may be more illiquid than that of common stocks or other equity securities of larger market capitalization issuers. Smaller capitalization companies also fail more often than larger companies and may have more limited management and financial resources than larger companies.
Volatility and Creditworthiness Risk
The downgrade of the U.S. government’s credit rating in 2011 may adversely affect fund performance. In 2011, S&P downgraded the U.S. government’s credit rating from AAA to AA+, and this unprecedented downgrade could lead to subsequent downgrades by S&P or downgrades by other credit rating agencies. These developments, and the government’s credit concerns in general, could cause an increase in interest rates and borrowing costs, which may negatively impact both the perception of credit risk associated with the debt securities issued by the U.S. and the country’s ability to access the debt markets on favorable terms. In addition, a lowered credit rating could create broader financial turmoil and uncertainty, which may negatively affect the value of Fund shares or the fund’s performance.
Definition of Terms
The S&P 500 Index is a widely recognized, unmanaged index of 500 of the largest companies in the United States as measured by market capitalization. The S&P 500 Index assumes reinvestment of all dividends and distributions. Because indices cannot be invested in directly, the returns of the S&P 500 Index do not reflect a deduction for fees, expenses or taxes.

Summary







 


Overall Rating

2 out of 5 Stars

Morningstar has awarded this fund 2 stars based on its risk-adjusted performance compared to the 76 funds within its Morningstar Category.



How is it determined?


The Overall Morningstar RatingTM for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics, which are based on risk-adjusted returns, as of the date stated.

What does it mean?


A fund's Morningstar Rating is a quantitative assessment of a fund's past performance that accounts for both risk and return, with funds earning between 1 and 5 stars. As always, this rating system is designed to be used as a first step in the fund evaluation process. A high rating alone is not sufficient basis upon which to make an investment decision.











 


Returns


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Below Average


This fund scores Below Average because it delivered returns that were in the bottom 22.5% when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.





How is it calculated?



This rating is based on a fund's Morningstar Return (its annualized return in excess to the return of the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill over a three-, five-, or ten-year period). The Morningstar Returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve. In each Morningstar Category: top 10% - High next 22.5% - Above Average middle 35% - Average next 22.5% - Below Average bottom 10% - Low




What does it mean?



While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the Morningstar Return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group. It does not, however, show the effects of risk.Therefore, the Morningstar Return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the Morningstar Risk Score. For example, an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same Morningstar Star Rating and similar Morningstar Risk Adjusted Returns but different levels of risk.










 


Expenses


LOW
AVG
HIGH


High


This fund's expenses are rated as High because they are above the 80th percentile when compared with other funds in the category.





How is it calculated?


This Morningstar data point compares the fund's net expense ratio to the net expense ratio of all the other funds within its Morningstar Category grouping.





What does it mean?


Excessive expenses can detract from overall returns and can be a drain on performance. While you should not base any investment decision entirely on expenses or expense ratios, a fund's expense structure may be one factor to consider.











 


Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.






How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.  Because the score is based on past performance, it may not reflect the future risk of the category. In addition to risk, you should evaluate a fund's investment objective, strategy, fees and other characteristics before making your investment decision.Learn more

Fund Overview




Objective



The investment seeks to maximize total return (capital appreciation and income).




Strategy



The fund normally seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing at least 80% of its net assets (plus the amount of borrowings, if any, for investment purposes) in securities of MLPs and Energy Infrastructure Companies. It invests in equity securities such as common units, preferred units, subordinated units, general partner interests, common shares and preferred shares in MLPs and Energy Infrastructure Companies. The fund is non-diversified.


Risk



The energy industries can be significantly affected by fluctuations in energy prices and supply and demand of energy fuels, energy conservation, the success of exploration projects, and tax and other government regulations. Funds categorized as Energy Limited Partnership (ELP) Funds may invest in Master Limited Partnerships (MLPs).  Many MLPs are concentrated in the energy infrastructure sector. Sector funds can be more volatile because of their narrow concentration in a specific industry or sector. MLPs are sensitive to interest rate changes, and consequently, as interest rates rise, the price of ELP Funds may decline (and vice versa).  MLPs may be relatively illiquid, which can negatively impact their sale and may subject Funds to a significant loss.  Funds organized as Subchapter "C" Corporations (Corporate ELP Funds) are subject to US federal income tax at the corporate tax rate (currently as high as 35%) as well as state and local income taxes, and the amounts available for distribution by a Corporate ELP Fund to its shareholders will be reduced by these entity-level taxes. This could result in a reduction of the investment's value.  Corporate ELP Funds accrue deferred income taxes for future tax liabilities associated with their underlying investments. These deferred tax liabilities are reflected in the daily NAVs of a Corporate ELP Fund, and consequently, the Fund's after-tax performance could differ significantly from its underlying assets, even if the pre-tax performance is closely tracked. Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, economic or other developments.  These risks may be magnified in foreign markets. Additional risk information for this product may be found in the prospectus or other product materials, if available.




Additional Disclosures

This description is only intended to provide a brief overview of the mutual fund. Read the fund's prospectus for more detailed information about the fund.
The analysis on these pages may be based, in part, on adjusted historical returns for periods prior to the class's actual inception of 01/08/2013.  These calculated returns reflect the historical performance of the oldest share class of the fund, with an inception date of 09/19/2012, adjusted to reflect the fees and expenses of this share class (when this share class's fees and expenses are higher.)  Please refer to a fund's prospectus for information regarding fees and expenses.  These adjusted historical returns are not actual returns.  Calculation methodologies utilized by Morningstar may differ from those applied by other entities, including the fund itself.

Risk


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Above Average

This fund scores Above Average because Morningstar has rated its risk between the 60th and 80th percentiles when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.




How is it calculated?


Risk is calculated using the Sharpe ratio, which compares portfolio returns to a rate comparable to U.S. Treasury bonds, relative to the fund's overall volatility. For this measure, Morningstar has compared the Sharpe ratio of this fund against all other funds that invest in it's Morningstar Category.




What does it mean?


A higher Sharpe implies better risk-adjusted returns. Therefore, if a fund has a Sharpe ratio higher than its category average, it's returns relative to it's risk were better than other similar funds. If its Sharpe ratio is lower, that's usually a sign that the risk-adjusted returns were lower than other similar funds.










 


Returns


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Below Average


This fund scores Below Average because it delivered returns that were in the bottom 22.5% when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.





How is it calculated?



This rating is based on a fund's Morningstar Return (its annualized return in excess to the return of the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill over a three-, five-, or ten-year period). The Morningstar Returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve. In each Morningstar Category: top 10% - High next 22.5% - Above Average middle 35% - Average next 22.5% - Below Average bottom 10% - Low




What does it mean?



While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the Morningstar Return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group. It does not, however, show the effects of risk.Therefore, the Morningstar Return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the Morningstar Risk Score. For example, an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same Morningstar Star Rating and similar Morningstar Risk Adjusted Returns but different levels of risk.










 


Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.






How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.  Because the score is based on past performance, it may not reflect the future risk of the category. In addition to risk, you should evaluate a fund's investment objective, strategy, fees and other characteristics before making your investment decision.Learn more

Risk



The energy industries can be significantly affected by fluctuations in energy prices and supply and demand of energy fuels, energy conservation, the success of exploration projects, and tax and other government regulations. Funds categorized as Energy Limited Partnership (ELP) Funds may invest in Master Limited Partnerships (MLPs).  Many MLPs are concentrated in the energy infrastructure sector. Sector funds can be more volatile because of their narrow concentration in a specific industry or sector. MLPs are sensitive to interest rate changes, and consequently, as interest rates rise, the price of ELP Funds may decline (and vice versa).  MLPs may be relatively illiquid, which can negatively impact their sale and may subject Funds to a significant loss.  Funds organized as Subchapter "C" Corporations (Corporate ELP Funds) are subject to US federal income tax at the corporate tax rate (currently as high as 35%) as well as state and local income taxes, and the amounts available for distribution by a Corporate ELP Fund to its shareholders will be reduced by these entity-level taxes. This could result in a reduction of the investment's value.  Corporate ELP Funds accrue deferred income taxes for future tax liabilities associated with their underlying investments. These deferred tax liabilities are reflected in the daily NAVs of a Corporate ELP Fund, and consequently, the Fund's after-tax performance could differ significantly from its underlying assets, even if the pre-tax performance is closely tracked. Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, economic or other developments.  These risks may be magnified in foreign markets. Additional risk information for this product may be found in the prospectus or other product materials, if available.

The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. (Exchange-traded funds and open-end mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes.) It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of  funds in each fund category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star.

The Morningstar information contained herein: (1) is proprietary to Morningstar and/or its content providers; (2) may not be copied or redistributed; and (3) is not warranted to be accurate, complete or timely. Neither Morningstar nor its content providers are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information. Fidelity does not review the Morningstar data and, for fund performance, you should check the fund's current prospectus or other product materials for the most up-to-date information concerning applicable loads, fees and expenses.

The "Mutual Funds" area at the top of each page allows access to mutual fund holdings with individual and joint Fidelity non-retirement accounts. Individual stock positions, ETFs and 529 funds are not available through this view. For the full list of your holdings visit Portfolio Summary.Mutual Funds are priced as of the previous business day's market close when the market is open. Mutual fund positions are priced as of the official market close (typically 4p.m.) and prices are generally available between 5 p.m. and 6p.m.

The performance data featured represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results.  Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate; therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.  Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.











1. Transaction Fee:A transaction fee is similar to a  brokerage fee or commission which you pay when you buy or sell a stock. For some funds available through Fidelity you are required to pay a transaction fee. However, you will not pay a sales load on Transaction Fee (TF) funds. You will only be charged a transaction fee when you buy a FundsNetwork TF fund, not when you sell one. All other fees and expenses described in a fund's prospectus still apply. You can choose to buy or sell shares directly from the fund itself or its principal underwriter or distributor without paying a transaction fee to Fidelity.Online Transaction Fees:  $49.95 for most funds.  Certain funds will have a transaction fee of $75. To identify any applicable transaction fees associated with the purchase of a given fund, please refer to the "Fees and Distributions" tab.Fidelity Automated Service Telephone (FAST): 25% off representative-assisted rates, Maximum: $187.50, Minimum:$75Representative-Assisted: 0.75% of principal, Maximum: $250, Minimum: $100Automatic Investment: $5 per transaction, after the initial investment.Sales load:A sales charge added to the price of the fund.  Funds have different sales charge structures, including front-end loads, back-end loads (deferred), and no loads. Sales loads can either be charged when a fund is purchased, commonly known as a front-end load, or when a fund is sold, known as a deferred load. Not  all funds charge a load. Refer to the Loads, Expense and Minimums section of the fund's prospectus for details on these amounts. Although no load funds do not have a front-end or deferred load, they may incur other fees, such as a 12b-1 fee.
2. Total returns are historical and include change in share value and reinvestment of dividends and capital gains, if any. Cumulative total returns are reported as of the period indicated. Life of fund figures are reported as of the commencement date to the period indicated and are cumulative if the fund is less than one year old. Total returns do not reflect the fund's [%] sales charge. If sales charges were included, total returns would have been lower. Except for Life of Fund returns, the analysis on these pages may be based, in part, on adjusted historical returns for periods prior to the class's actual inception of 1/8/2013.  These calculated returns reflect the historical performance of the oldest share class of the fund, with an inception date of 9/19/2012, adjusted to reflect the fees and expenses of this share class (when this share class's fees and expenses are higher.)  Please refer to a fund's prospectus for information regarding fees and expenses.  These adjusted historical returns are not actual returns.  Calculation methodologies utilized by Morningstar may differ from those applied by other entities, including the fund itself.
3. The Morningstar Category Average is the average return for the peer group based on the returns of each individual fund within the group, for the period shown. This average assumes reinvestment of dividends.
4. This chart illustrates the performance of a hypothetical $10,000 investment made in this investment product (and a benchmark or category average, if shown) from the beginning date shown or on the inception date of the product (whichever is later).  The inception date used for products with underlying funds, or multiple shares classes, or are offered as a separate account, strategy or sub account, may be the inception date of the underlying fund, the earliest share class of the product, or the date composite performance for the product was first made available. The product's returns may not reflect all its expenses. Any fees not reflected would lower the returns. Benchmark returns include reinvestment of capital gains and dividends, if any, but do not reflect any fees or expenses. It is not possible to invest in an index. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. This chart is not intended to imply any future performance of the investment product.
5. Initial minimum investments into group retirement accounts such as Fidelity Simplified Employee Pension-IRA, Keogh, Self-Employed 401(k), and Non-Fidelity Prototype Retirement accounts are $500 or higher. Additional investments into Regular, IRA, and Group accounts are $250 or higher.
6. A standard yield calculation developed by the Securities and Exchange Commission for bond funds. The yield is calculated by dividing the net investment income per share earned during the 30-day period by the maximum offering price per share on the last day of the period. The yield figure reflects the dividends and interest earned during the 30-day period, after the deduction of the fund's expenses. It is sometimes referred to as "SEC 30-Day Yield" or "standardized yield".
7. Any holdings, asset allocation, diversification breakdowns or other composition data shown are as of the date indicated and are subject to change at any time. They may not be representative of the fund's current or future investments. Some breakdowns may be intentionally limited to a particular asset class or other subset of the fund's entire portfolio, particularly in multi-asset class funds where the attributes of the equity and fixed income portions are different. Under the asset allocation section, international (or foreign) assets may be reported differently depending on how an investment options reports its holdings.  Some do not report international (or foreign) holdings here, but instead report them in a "Regional Diversification" section.  Some report them in this section as an to the equity, bond and other allocation shown.  Others report international (or foreign) holding as a subset of the equity and bond allocations shown.  If the allocation without the foreign component (or round to) 100%, then international (or foreign) is a subset of the equity and bond percentage shown.
8. Percent Rank in Category is the fund's total-return percentile rank relative to all funds that have the same Morningstar Category.  The highest (or most favorable) percentile rank is 1 and the lowest (or least favorable) percentile rank is 100. The top-performing fund in a category will always receive a rank of 1. % Rank in Category is based on total returns which include reinvested dividends and capital gains, if any, and exclude sales charges.
9. The analysis on these pages may be based, in part, on adjusted historical returns for periods prior to the class's actual inception of 1/8/2013.  These calculated returns reflect the historical performance of the oldest share class of the fund, with an inception date of 9/19/2012, adjusted to reflect the fees and expenses of this share class (when this share class's fees and expenses are higher.)  Please refer to a fund's prospectus for information regarding fees and expenses.  These adjusted historical returns are not actual returns.  Calculation methodologies utilized by Morningstar may differ from those applied by other entities, including the fund itself.
10. StyleMap® depictions of mutual fund characteristics are produced using data and calculations provided by Morningstar, Inc. StyleMapsSM estimate characteristics of a fund's equity holdings over two dimensions: market capitalization and valuation. The percentage of fund assets represented by these holdings is indicated beside each StyleMap. Current StyleMap characteristics are calculated each time Morningstar receives updated portfolio holdings from a fund and are denoted with a dot. Historical StyleMap characteristics are calculated for the shorter of either the past 3 years or the life of the fund, and are represented by the shading of the box(es) previously occupied by the dot. StyleMap characteristics represent an approximate profile of the fund's equity holdings (e.g., domestic stocks, foreign stocks, and American Depositary Receipts), are based on historical data, and are not predictive of the fund's future investments. Although the data are gathered from reliable sources, accuracy and completeness cannot be guaranteed.
11. Please note Regional Diversification information is based on the equity components only.


Generally, data on Fidelity mutual funds is provided by FMR, LLC, Morningstar ratings and data on non-Fidelity mutual funds is provided by Morningstar, Inc. and data on non-mutual fund products is provided by the product's investment manager, trustee or issuer or the plan sponsor whose plan is offering the product to  participants.  Although Fidelity believes the data gathered from these third-party sources is reliable, it does not review such information and cannot warrant it to be accurate, complete or timely.  Fidelity is not responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this third-party information.

Before investing, consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the fund or annuity and its investment options. Contact Fidelity for a free prospectus and, if available, summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.

Total returns for periods greater than one year are annualized.
NAV is the net asset value of the fund on the date as referenced above and equals the value of all the fund’s assets (less liabilities) divided by the number of shares outstanding.
Share Price is the price that the fund closed at on the New York Stock Exchange on the date as referenced above.
Premium/Discount is the percentage difference between the net asset value of the fund and the share price. The premium/discount is based on last computed net asset value as referenced above. Shares of closed-end funds frequently trade at a discount to their net asset value in the secondary market and the net asset value of the closed-end fund shares may decrease.
The fund NAV performance is reflected net of expenses. The stock price performance assumes that distributions have been reinvested into the security.
The returns quoted represent past performance and does not guarantee future results. There is no assurance that a closed-end fund will achieve its investment objective. Like any stock, a closed-end fund’s share price will fluctuate with market conditions and other factors. At the time of sale, your shares may have a market price that is above or below NAV, and may be worth more or less than your original investment. Accordingly, it is possible to lose money investing in the fund.

Fund Specific Risks

Salient Midstream & MLP Fund
Principal Investment Risks
A summary of certain risks associated with an investment in the Fund is set forth below. The summary is not complete and an investor should carefully review the more detailed risks applicable to the Fund set forth in the Fund’s preliminary prospectus.
Closed-end funds frequently trade at a discount from their net asset value. The risk of loss due to this discount may be greater for initial investors expecting to sell their shares in a relatively short period after completion of the offering. An investment in the Fund is not appropriate for all investors and is not designed to be a complete investment program. The Fund is designed to be a long-term investment and not as a trading vehicle.
Additional Risks
As the resources of the underlying MLPs deplete, production and cash flows steadily decline, which may decrease distribution rates to the fund.
As applicable, MLP Funds with international holdings are subject to currency fluctuation risk, differences in accounting principles, and country specific risks.
Given the energy sector focus of many MLPs, a sustained decline in the demand for energy products could adversely affect MLP revenues and cash flows.
No Operating or Trading History
The Fund is a newly-organized, non-diversified, closed-end management investment company and has no operating or public trading history. Being a newly-organized company, the Fund is subject to all of the business risks and uncertainties associated with any new business, including the risk that the Fund will not achieve its investment objective and that the value of an investment could decline substantially.
Investment and Market Risk
An investment in the Fund’s common shares is subject to investment risk, including the possible loss of the entire amount that you invest. An investment in the Fund’s common shares is not intended to constitute a complete investment program and should not be viewed as such. The value of the securities in which the Fund invests, like other market investments, may move up or down, sometimes rapidly and unpredictably. Your investment in the Fund’s common shares at any point in time may be worth less than your original investment, even after taking into account the reinvestment of distributions.
Risks Relating to MLPs in Investments
An investment in MLP units involves risks that differ from a similar investment in equity securities, such as common stock, of a corporation. Holders of MLP units have the rights typically afforded to limited partners in a limited partnership. As compared to common stockholders of a corporation, holders of MLP units have more limited control and limited rights to vote on matters affecting the partnership. There are certain tax risks associated with an investment in MLP units. Additionally, conflicts of interest may exist among common unit holders, subordinated unit holders and the general partner or managing member of an MLP.
Midstream Sector Risk
Certain risks inherent in investing in Midstream Companies and MLPs include changes in the supply and demand for natural resources, depletion of reserves, changes in governmental regulations, changes in commodity prices, inability to consummate acquisitions or realize the benefits therefrom, dependency on affiliates, the occurrence of significant natural or man-made catastrophes, terrorist activities, government instability and the occurrence of extreme weather conditions.
Derivates Risk
The Fund may purchase and sell derivative investments such as exchange-listed and over-the-counter put and call options on securities, equity, fixed income, interest rate and currency indices, and other financial instruments, and enter into various interest rate transactions such as swaps or credit default swaps. The Fund also may purchase derivative investments that combine features of these instruments. The use of derivatives has risks, including high price volatility, government intervention, non-performance by the counterparty and the imperfect correlation between the value of such instruments and the underlying assets, the possible default of the other party to the transaction or illiquidity of the derivative investments. Furthermore, the ability to successfully use these techniques depends on Salient Capital Advisors, LLC’s ability to predict pertinent market movements, which cannot be assured. The use of derivatives may result in losses greater than if they had not been used, may require the Fund to sell or purchase portfolio securities at inopportune times or for prices other than current market values, may limit the amount of appreciation the Fund can realize on an investment or may cause the Fund to hold a security that the Fund might otherwise sell. In addition, amounts paid by the Fund as premiums and cash or other assets held in margin accounts with respect to derivative transactions are not otherwise available to the Fund for investment purposes.
Options Risk
The Fund currently expects to write covered call options on portfolio positions, in an amount up to 30% of the value of total assets in its portfolio, with the purpose of generating realized gains. The Fund also intends to write uncovered call options, in an amount up to 10% of the value of total assets in its portfolio, and purchase put options as part of its hedging strategy. As the writer of a covered call option, during the option’s life the Fund gives up the opportunity to profit from increases in the market value of the security covering the call option above the sum of the premium and the strike price of the call, but the Fund retains the risk of loss should the price of the underlying security decline. The seller of an uncovered call option assumes the risk of a theoretically unlimited loss as a result of an increase in the market price of the underlying security above the exercise price of the option. The buyer of a put or call option assumes the risk of losing its entire premium invested in the option.
Short Sales Risk
A short sale creates the risk of an unlimited loss, in that the price of the underlying security could theoretically increase without limit, thus increasing the cost of buying the securities that were sold short to cover the short position. There can be no assurance that the securities necessary to cover a short position will be available for purchase. The Fund intends to limit its use of short sales to 30% of the value of total assets in the portfolio.
Use of Leverage
Under normal market conditions, the Fund intends to leverage instruments in an amount that represents approximately 25% of its total assets (which represents approximately 33% of net assets), including proceeds from such leverage instruments. However, as market conditions develop, the Fund may use leverage instruments in amounts that represent greater than 25% leverage to the extent permitted by the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”). Any subsidiary C corporations used by the Fund will comply with the 1940 Act restrictions on borrowing and will be included in the Fund’s leverage calculations. Leverage instruments will have seniority over the common shares and may be secured by the assets of the Fund. The Fund currently anticipates leveraging its assets through borrowings from banks and other financial institutions. The Fund currently anticipates that it will enter into at least one credit facility in an amount up to 33 1/3% of total assets. Although the use of leverage by the Fund may create an opportunity for increased return for common shareholders, it also results in additional risks and can magnify the effect of any losses. There is no assurance that the Fund’s use of leverage will be successful.
Delay in Use of Proceeds
Although the Fund currently intends to invest the proceeds from the sale of the common shares within three months after the closing of this offering, such investments may be delayed if suitable investments are unavailable at the time. The trading market and volumes for the Midstream Companies and MLPs in which the Fund intends to invest may at times be less liquid than the market for other securities.
Cash Flow Risk
A substantial portion of the cash flow received by the Fund is derived from its investment in equity securities of Midstream Companies and MLPs. The amount of cash that any such company has available to pay its equity holders in the form of distributions/dividends depends on the amount of cash flow generated from such company’s operations.
Interest Rate Risk
The yields for equity securities of MLPs and certain Midstream MLPs and Midstream Companies are susceptible to fluctuations in interest rates, and the prices of such equity securities may decline when interest rates rise. Rising interest rates could adversely impact the financial performance of energy companies by increasing their cost of capital. Interest rates are at or near historic lows, and as a result they are likely to rise over time.
Capital Markets Risk
Global financial markets and economic conditions have been, and continue to be, volatile due to a variety of factors. As a result, the cost of raising capital in the debt and equity capital markets has increased while the ability to raise capital from those markets has diminished. If funding is not available when needed, or is available only on unfavorable terms, Midstream Companies and MLPs may not be able to meet their obligations as they come due. Moreover, without adequate funding, Midstream Companies and MLPs may be unable to execute their growth strategies, complete future acquisitions, take advantage of other business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures, any of which could have a material adverse effect on their revenues and results of operations.
Equity Securities Risk
Equity securities are sensitive to general movements in the stock market and a drop in the stock market may depress the price of securities to which the Fund has exposure.
Debt Securities Risk
Debt securities in which the Fund invests are subject to many of the risks described elsewhere in this section. In addition, they are subject to credit risk, interest rate risk, prepayment risk and, depending on their quality, other special risks.
Risks Associated with an Investment in Initial Public Offerings (“IPOs’)
Securities purchased in IPOs are often subject to the general risks associated with investments in companies with small market capitalizations, and typically to a heightened degree. Securities issued in IPOs have no trading history, and information about the companies may be available for very limited periods. In addition, the prices of securities sold in an IPO may be highly volatile.
Privately Held Company Risk
Privately held companies are not subject to SEC reporting requirements, are not required to maintain their accounting records in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and are not required to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting. As a result, Salient Capital Advisors, LLC may not have timely or accurate information about the business, financial condition and results of operations of the privately held companies in which the Fund invests. In addition, the securities of privately held companies are generally illiquid, and entail the risks described under—“Liquidity Risk” below.
Liquidity Risk
Securities with limited trading volumes may display volatile or erratic price movements. Therefore, it may be more difficult for the Fund to buy and sell significant amounts of such securities without an unfavorable impact on prevailing market prices.
Interest Rate Hedging Risk
Interest rate transactions that the Fund may use for hedging purposes will expose the Fund to certain risks that differ from the risks associated with its portfolio holdings. The Fund’s success in using hedging instruments is subject to Salient Capital Advisors, LLC’s ability to predict correctly changes in the relationships of such hedging instruments to its interest rate risk, and there can be no assurance that Salient Capital Advisors, LLC’s judgment in this respect will be accurate.
Concentration Risk
The focus of the Fund’s portfolio on companies within the Midstream Sector may present more risks than if its portfolio were broadly diversified over numerous sectors of the economy.
Inflation Risk
Inflation risk is the risk that the value of assets or income from investment will be worth less in the future as inflation decreases the value of money. As inflation increases, the real value of the common shares and distributions can decline.
Portfolio Turnover Risk
The Fund anticipates that its annual portfolio turnover rate will range between 30% and 50%, excluding the turnover from its hedging program, but the rate may vary greatly from year to year. A higher portfolio turnover rate results in correspondingly greater brokerage commissions and other transactional expenses that are borne by the Fund.
Management Risk; Dependence on Key Personnel of Salient Capital Advisors, LLC
The Fund’s portfolio is subject to management risk because it is actively managed. Salient Capital Advisors, LLC applies investment techniques and risk analyses in making investment decisions for us, but there can be no guarantee that they will produce the desired results. The Fund depends upon Salient Capital Advisors, LLC’s key personnel for its future success and upon their access to certain individuals and investments in the Midstream Sector. The departure of any of Salient Capital Advisors, LLC’s portfolio managers or the senior management of Salient Capital Advisors, LLC could have a material adverse effect on Salient Capital Advisors, LLC’s ability to achieve the Fund’s investment objective. In addition, the Fund can offer no assurance that Salient Capital Advisors, LLC will remain its investment adviser or that the Fund will continue to have access to Salient Capital Advisors, LLC’s industry contacts and deal flow.
Conflicts of Interest of Salient Capital Advisors, LLC
Conflicts of interest may arise because Salient Capital Advisors, LLC and its affiliates generally carry on substantial investment activities for other clients in which the Fund will have no interest. Salient Capital Advisors, LLC or its affiliates may have financial incentives to favor certain of such accounts over the Fund. Any of their proprietary accounts and other customer accounts may compete with the Fund for specific trades.
Risk of Owning Securities of Affiliates
From time to time, the Fund may “control” or may be an “affiliate” of one or more of its portfolio companies which, depending on Securities and Exchange Commission interpretations, may result in restrictions being imposed on the size of positions that may be taken for the Fund or on the type of investments that the Fund could make.
Competition Risk
There are a limited number of other companies, including other publicly traded investment companies and private funds, which may serve as alternatives to the Fund for investment in a portfolio of companies in the Midstream Sector.
Valuation Risk
Market prices may not be readily available for any restricted or unregistered investments in public companies or investments in private companies made by the Fund. Due to the difficulty in valuing these securities and the absence of an active trading market for these investments, the Fund may not be able to realize these securities’ carrying value or may have to delay their sale in order to do so.
Restricted Securities
The Fund may invest in unregistered or otherwise restricted securities. Restricted securities may be more difficult to value and the Fund may have difficulty disposing of such assets either in a timely manner or for a reasonable price.
Non-Diversified Status
Overall risk can be reduced by investing in securities from a diversified pool of issuers, while overall risk is increased by investing in securities of a small number of issuers. Credit, market and other risks associated with its investment strategies or techniques may be more pronounced for the Fund than for a fund that is more “diversified.”
Anti-Takeover Provisions
Provisions of the Declaration of Trust and Bylaws could have the effect of discouraging, delaying, deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in control that might otherwise be in the best interests of the Fund’s common shareholders. As a result, these provisions may deprive the Fund’s common shareholders of opportunities to sell common shares at a premium over the then current market price of common shares.
Market Discount Risk
Shares of closed-end management investment companies frequently trade at prices lower than their net asset value, which is commonly referred to as “trading at a discount.” The risk of loss due to this discount may be greater for initial investors expecting to sell their shares in a relatively short period after completion of the offering. An investment in the Fund is not appropriate for all investors and is not designed to be a complete investment program. The Fund is designed to be a long-term investment and not as a trading vehicle.
Legal and Regulatory Risk
Legal and regulatory changes may materially adversely affect the Fund. The regulation of the U.S. and non-U.S. securities and futures markets and investment funds such as the Fund has undergone substantial change in recent years and such change may continue.
Tax Risks
The Fund’s ability to meet its investment objective will depend, in part, on the level of taxable income and distributions the Fund receives from the equity securities in which the Fund invests, a factor over which the Fund has no control. If an MLP were treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, such MLP would be obligated to pay U.S. federal income tax on its income at the corporate tax rate. The amount of cash available for distribution by the MLP would be reduced and distributions received by the Fund would be taxed under U.S. federal income tax laws applicable to corporate dividends (as dividend income, return of capital, or capital gain).

Summary







 


Overall Rating

2 out of 5 Stars

Morningstar has awarded this fund 2 stars based on its risk-adjusted performance compared to the 76 funds within its Morningstar Category.



How is it determined?


The Overall Morningstar RatingTM for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics, which are based on risk-adjusted returns, as of the date stated.

What does it mean?


A fund's Morningstar Rating is a quantitative assessment of a fund's past performance that accounts for both risk and return, with funds earning between 1 and 5 stars. As always, this rating system is designed to be used as a first step in the fund evaluation process. A high rating alone is not sufficient basis upon which to make an investment decision.











 


Returns


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Below Average


This fund scores Below Average because it delivered returns that were in the bottom 22.5% when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.





How is it calculated?



This rating is based on a fund's Morningstar Return (its annualized return in excess to the return of the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill over a three-, five-, or ten-year period). The Morningstar Returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve. In each Morningstar Category: top 10% - High next 22.5% - Above Average middle 35% - Average next 22.5% - Below Average bottom 10% - Low




What does it mean?



While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the Morningstar Return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group. It does not, however, show the effects of risk.Therefore, the Morningstar Return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the Morningstar Risk Score. For example, an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same Morningstar Star Rating and similar Morningstar Risk Adjusted Returns but different levels of risk.










 


Expenses


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Above Average


This fund's expenses are rated as Above Average because they fall between the 60th and 80th percentiles when compared with other funds in the category.





How is it calculated?


This Morningstar data point compares the fund's net expense ratio to the net expense ratio of all the other funds within its Morningstar Category grouping.





What does it mean?


Excessive expenses can detract from overall returns and can be a drain on performance. While you should not base any investment decision entirely on expenses or expense ratios, a fund's expense structure may be one factor to consider.











 


Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.






How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.  Because the score is based on past performance, it may not reflect the future risk of the category. In addition to risk, you should evaluate a fund's investment objective, strategy, fees and other characteristics before making your investment decision.Learn more

Fund Overview




Objective



The investment seeks to maximize total return (capital appreciation and income).




Strategy



The fund normally seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing at least 80% of its net assets (plus the amount of borrowings, if any, for investment purposes) in securities of MLPs and Energy Infrastructure Companies. It invests in equity securities such as common units, preferred units, subordinated units, general partner interests, common shares and preferred shares in MLPs and Energy Infrastructure Companies. The fund is non-diversified.


Risk



The energy industries can be significantly affected by fluctuations in energy prices and supply and demand of energy fuels, energy conservation, the success of exploration projects, and tax and other government regulations. Funds categorized as Energy Limited Partnership (ELP) Funds may invest in Master Limited Partnerships (MLPs).  Many MLPs are concentrated in the energy infrastructure sector. Sector funds can be more volatile because of their narrow concentration in a specific industry or sector. MLPs are sensitive to interest rate changes, and consequently, as interest rates rise, the price of ELP Funds may decline (and vice versa).  MLPs may be relatively illiquid, which can negatively impact their sale and may subject Funds to a significant loss.  Funds organized as Subchapter "C" Corporations (Corporate ELP Funds) are subject to US federal income tax at the corporate tax rate (currently as high as 35%) as well as state and local income taxes, and the amounts available for distribution by a Corporate ELP Fund to its shareholders will be reduced by these entity-level taxes. This could result in a reduction of the investment's value.  Corporate ELP Funds accrue deferred income taxes for future tax liabilities associated with their underlying investments. These deferred tax liabilities are reflected in the daily NAVs of a Corporate ELP Fund, and consequently, the Fund's after-tax performance could differ significantly from its underlying assets, even if the pre-tax performance is closely tracked. Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, economic or other developments.  These risks may be magnified in foreign markets. Additional risk information for this product may be found in the prospectus or other product materials, if available.




Additional Disclosures

This description is only intended to provide a brief overview of the mutual fund. Read the fund's prospectus for more detailed information about the fund.
The analysis on these pages may be based, in part, on adjusted historical returns for periods prior to the class's actual inception of 12/21/2012.  These calculated returns reflect the historical performance of the oldest share class of the fund, with an inception date of 09/19/2012, adjusted to reflect the fees and expenses of this share class (when this share class's fees and expenses are higher.)  Please refer to a fund's prospectus for information regarding fees and expenses.  These adjusted historical returns are not actual returns.  Calculation methodologies utilized by Morningstar may differ from those applied by other entities, including the fund itself.

Risk


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Above Average

This fund scores Above Average because Morningstar has rated its risk between the 60th and 80th percentiles when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.




How is it calculated?


Risk is calculated using the Sharpe ratio, which compares portfolio returns to a rate comparable to U.S. Treasury bonds, relative to the fund's overall volatility. For this measure, Morningstar has compared the Sharpe ratio of this fund against all other funds that invest in it's Morningstar Category.




What does it mean?


A higher Sharpe implies better risk-adjusted returns. Therefore, if a fund has a Sharpe ratio higher than its category average, it's returns relative to it's risk were better than other similar funds. If its Sharpe ratio is lower, that's usually a sign that the risk-adjusted returns were lower than other similar funds.










 


Returns


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Below Average


This fund scores Below Average because it delivered returns that were in the bottom 22.5% when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.





How is it calculated?



This rating is based on a fund's Morningstar Return (its annualized return in excess to the return of the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill over a three-, five-, or ten-year period). The Morningstar Returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve. In each Morningstar Category: top 10% - High next 22.5% - Above Average middle 35% - Average next 22.5% - Below Average bottom 10% - Low




What does it mean?



While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the Morningstar Return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group. It does not, however, show the effects of risk.Therefore, the Morningstar Return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the Morningstar Risk Score. For example, an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same Morningstar Star Rating and similar Morningstar Risk Adjusted Returns but different levels of risk.










 


Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.






How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.  Because the score is based on past performance, it may not reflect the future risk of the category. In addition to risk, you should evaluate a fund's investment objective, strategy, fees and other characteristics before making your investment decision.Learn more

Risk



The energy industries can be significantly affected by fluctuations in energy prices and supply and demand of energy fuels, energy conservation, the success of exploration projects, and tax and other government regulations. Funds categorized as Energy Limited Partnership (ELP) Funds may invest in Master Limited Partnerships (MLPs).  Many MLPs are concentrated in the energy infrastructure sector. Sector funds can be more volatile because of their narrow concentration in a specific industry or sector. MLPs are sensitive to interest rate changes, and consequently, as interest rates rise, the price of ELP Funds may decline (and vice versa).  MLPs may be relatively illiquid, which can negatively impact their sale and may subject Funds to a significant loss.  Funds organized as Subchapter "C" Corporations (Corporate ELP Funds) are subject to US federal income tax at the corporate tax rate (currently as high as 35%) as well as state and local income taxes, and the amounts available for distribution by a Corporate ELP Fund to its shareholders will be reduced by these entity-level taxes. This could result in a reduction of the investment's value.  Corporate ELP Funds accrue deferred income taxes for future tax liabilities associated with their underlying investments. These deferred tax liabilities are reflected in the daily NAVs of a Corporate ELP Fund, and consequently, the Fund's after-tax performance could differ significantly from its underlying assets, even if the pre-tax performance is closely tracked. Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, economic or other developments.  These risks may be magnified in foreign markets. Additional risk information for this product may be found in the prospectus or other product materials, if available.

The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. (Exchange-traded funds and open-end mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes.) It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of  funds in each fund category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star.

The Morningstar information contained herein: (1) is proprietary to Morningstar and/or its content providers; (2) may not be copied or redistributed; and (3) is not warranted to be accurate, complete or timely. Neither Morningstar nor its content providers are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information. Fidelity does not review the Morningstar data and, for fund performance, you should check the fund's current prospectus or other product materials for the most up-to-date information concerning applicable loads, fees and expenses.

The "Mutual Funds" area at the top of each page allows access to mutual fund holdings with individual and joint Fidelity non-retirement accounts. Individual stock positions, ETFs and 529 funds are not available through this view. For the full list of your holdings visit Portfolio Summary.Mutual Funds are priced as of the previous business day's market close when the market is open. Mutual fund positions are priced as of the official market close (typically 4p.m.) and prices are generally available between 5 p.m. and 6p.m.

The performance data featured represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results.  Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate; therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.  Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.











1. Transaction Fee:A transaction fee is similar to a  brokerage fee or commission which you pay when you buy or sell a stock. For some funds available through Fidelity you are required to pay a transaction fee. However, you will not pay a sales load on Transaction Fee (TF) funds. You will only be charged a transaction fee when you buy a FundsNetwork TF fund, not when you sell one. All other fees and expenses described in a fund's prospectus still apply. You can choose to buy or sell shares directly from the fund itself or its principal underwriter or distributor without paying a transaction fee to Fidelity.Online Transaction Fees:  $49.95 for most funds.  Certain funds will have a transaction fee of $75. To identify any applicable transaction fees associated with the purchase of a given fund, please refer to the "Fees and Distributions" tab.Fidelity Automated Service Telephone (FAST): 25% off representative-assisted rates, Maximum: $187.50, Minimum:$75Representative-Assisted: 0.75% of principal, Maximum: $250, Minimum: $100Automatic Investment: $5 per transaction, after the initial investment.Sales load:A sales charge added to the price of the fund.  Funds have different sales charge structures, including front-end loads, back-end loads (deferred), and no loads. Sales loads can either be charged when a fund is purchased, commonly known as a front-end load, or when a fund is sold, known as a deferred load. Not  all funds charge a load. Refer to the Loads, Expense and Minimums section of the fund's prospectus for details on these amounts. Although no load funds do not have a front-end or deferred load, they may incur other fees, such as a 12b-1 fee.
2. Total returns are historical and include change in share value and reinvestment of dividends and capital gains, if any. Cumulative total returns are reported as of the period indicated. Life of fund figures are reported as of the commencement date to the period indicated and are cumulative if the fund is less than one year old. Total returns do not reflect the fund's [%] sales charge. If sales charges were included, total returns would have been lower. Except for Life of Fund returns, the analysis on these pages may be based, in part, on adjusted historical returns for periods prior to the class's actual inception of 12/21/2012.  These calculated returns reflect the historical performance of the oldest share class of the fund, with an inception date of 9/19/2012, adjusted to reflect the fees and expenses of this share class (when this share class's fees and expenses are higher.)  Please refer to a fund's prospectus for information regarding fees and expenses.  These adjusted historical returns are not actual returns.  Calculation methodologies utilized by Morningstar may differ from those applied by other entities, including the fund itself.
3. The Morningstar Category Average is the average return for the peer group based on the returns of each individual fund within the group, for the period shown. This average assumes reinvestment of dividends.
4. This chart illustrates the performance of a hypothetical $10,000 investment made in this investment product (and a benchmark or category average, if shown) from the beginning date shown or on the inception date of the product (whichever is later).  The inception date used for products with underlying funds, or multiple shares classes, or are offered as a separate account, strategy or sub account, may be the inception date of the underlying fund, the earliest share class of the product, or the date composite performance for the product was first made available. The product's returns may not reflect all its expenses. Any fees not reflected would lower the returns. Benchmark returns include reinvestment of capital gains and dividends, if any, but do not reflect any fees or expenses. It is not possible to invest in an index. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. This chart is not intended to imply any future performance of the investment product.
5. Initial minimum investments into group retirement accounts such as Fidelity Simplified Employee Pension-IRA, Keogh, Self-Employed 401(k), and Non-Fidelity Prototype Retirement accounts are $500 or higher. Additional investments into Regular, IRA, and Group accounts are $250 or higher.
6. A standard yield calculation developed by the Securities and Exchange Commission for bond funds. The yield is calculated by dividing the net investment income per share earned during the 30-day period by the maximum offering price per share on the last day of the period. The yield figure reflects the dividends and interest earned during the 30-day period, after the deduction of the fund's expenses. It is sometimes referred to as "SEC 30-Day Yield" or "standardized yield".
7. Any holdings, asset allocation, diversification breakdowns or other composition data shown are as of the date indicated and are subject to change at any time. They may not be representative of the fund's current or future investments. Some breakdowns may be intentionally limited to a particular asset class or other subset of the fund's entire portfolio, particularly in multi-asset class funds where the attributes of the equity and fixed income portions are different. Under the asset allocation section, international (or foreign) assets may be reported differently depending on how an investment options reports its holdings.  Some do not report international (or foreign) holdings here, but instead report them in a "Regional Diversification" section.  Some report them in this section as an to the equity, bond and other allocation shown.  Others report international (or foreign) holding as a subset of the equity and bond allocations shown.  If the allocation without the foreign component (or round to) 100%, then international (or foreign) is a subset of the equity and bond percentage shown.
8. Percent Rank in Category is the fund's total-return percentile rank relative to all funds that have the same Morningstar Category.  The highest (or most favorable) percentile rank is 1 and the lowest (or least favorable) percentile rank is 100. The top-performing fund in a category will always receive a rank of 1. % Rank in Category is based on total returns which include reinvested dividends and capital gains, if any, and exclude sales charges.
9. The analysis on these pages may be based, in part, on adjusted historical returns for periods prior to the class's actual inception of 12/21/2012.  These calculated returns reflect the historical performance of the oldest share class of the fund, with an inception date of 9/19/2012, adjusted to reflect the fees and expenses of this share class (when this share class's fees and expenses are higher.)  Please refer to a fund's prospectus for information regarding fees and expenses.  These adjusted historical returns are not actual returns.  Calculation methodologies utilized by Morningstar may differ from those applied by other entities, including the fund itself.
10. StyleMap® depictions of mutual fund characteristics are produced using data and calculations provided by Morningstar, Inc. StyleMapsSM estimate characteristics of a fund's equity holdings over two dimensions: market capitalization and valuation. The percentage of fund assets represented by these holdings is indicated beside each StyleMap. Current StyleMap characteristics are calculated each time Morningstar receives updated portfolio holdings from a fund and are denoted with a dot. Historical StyleMap characteristics are calculated for the shorter of either the past 3 years or the life of the fund, and are represented by the shading of the box(es) previously occupied by the dot. StyleMap characteristics represent an approximate profile of the fund's equity holdings (e.g., domestic stocks, foreign stocks, and American Depositary Receipts), are based on historical data, and are not predictive of the fund's future investments. Although the data are gathered from reliable sources, accuracy and completeness cannot be guaranteed.
11. Please note Regional Diversification information is based on the equity components only.


Generally, data on Fidelity mutual funds is provided by FMR, LLC, Morningstar ratings and data on non-Fidelity mutual funds is provided by Morningstar, Inc. and data on non-mutual fund products is provided by the product's investment manager, trustee or issuer or the plan sponsor whose plan is offering the product to  participants.  Although Fidelity believes the data gathered from these third-party sources is reliable, it does not review such information and cannot warrant it to be accurate, complete or timely.  Fidelity is not responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this third-party information.

Before investing, consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the fund or annuity and its investment options. Contact Fidelity for a free prospectus and, if available, summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.

                            MLPs and Energy                        


The Houston-based MLP Team is led by seasoned MLP portfolio managers Greg Reid and Ted Gardner, and director of research Parag Sanghani. Houston is the home for many MLPs. In fact, corporate headquarters for 65% of the total market capitalization of the midstream MLP universe is within minutes of our offices. Salient’s MLP strategies are designed to provide the opportunity to potentially capture attractive total returns driven by a combination of distribution yield plus prospective distribution growth. MLP returns have historically had a low correlation to the S&P 500, REITs, high yield, and bonds.

Total returns for periods greater than one year are annualized.
NAV is the net asset value of the fund on the date as referenced above and equals the value of all the fund’s assets (less liabilities) divided by the number of shares outstanding.
Share Price is the price that the fund closed at on the New York Stock Exchange on the date as referenced above.
Premium/Discount is the percentage difference between the net asset value of the fund and the share price. The premium/discount is based on last computed net asset value as referenced above. Shares of closed-end funds frequently trade at a discount to their net asset value in the secondary market and the net asset value of the closed-end fund shares may decrease.
The fund NAV performance is reflected net of expenses. The stock price performance assumes that distributions have been reinvested into the security.
The returns quoted represent past performance and does not guarantee future results. There is no assurance that a closed-end fund will achieve its investment objective. Like any stock, a closed-end fund’s share price will fluctuate with market conditions and other factors. At the time of sale, your shares may have a market price that is above or below NAV, and may be worth more or less than your original investment. Accordingly, it is possible to lose money investing in the fund.

Fund Specific Risks

Salient Midstream & MLP Fund
Principal Investment Risks
A summary of certain risks associated with an investment in the Fund is set forth below. The summary is not complete and an investor should carefully review the more detailed risks applicable to the Fund set forth in the Fund’s preliminary prospectus.
Closed-end funds frequently trade at a discount from their net asset value. The risk of loss due to this discount may be greater for initial investors expecting to sell their shares in a relatively short period after completion of the offering. An investment in the Fund is not appropriate for all investors and is not designed to be a complete investment program. The Fund is designed to be a long-term investment and not as a trading vehicle.
Additional Risks
As the resources of the underlying MLPs deplete, production and cash flows steadily decline, which may decrease distribution rates to the fund.
As applicable, MLP Funds with international holdings are subject to currency fluctuation risk, differences in accounting principles, and country specific risks.
Given the energy sector focus of many MLPs, a sustained decline in the demand for energy products could adversely affect MLP revenues and cash flows.
No Operating or Trading History
The Fund is a newly-organized, non-diversified, closed-end management investment company and has no operating or public trading history. Being a newly-organized company, the Fund is subject to all of the business risks and uncertainties associated with any new business, including the risk that the Fund will not achieve its investment objective and that the value of an investment could decline substantially.
Investment and Market Risk
An investment in the Fund’s common shares is subject to investment risk, including the possible loss of the entire amount that you invest. An investment in the Fund’s common shares is not intended to constitute a complete investment program and should not be viewed as such. The value of the securities in which the Fund invests, like other market investments, may move up or down, sometimes rapidly and unpredictably. Your investment in the Fund’s common shares at any point in time may be worth less than your original investment, even after taking into account the reinvestment of distributions.
Risks Relating to MLPs in Investments
An investment in MLP units involves risks that differ from a similar investment in equity securities, such as common stock, of a corporation. Holders of MLP units have the rights typically afforded to limited partners in a limited partnership. As compared to common stockholders of a corporation, holders of MLP units have more limited control and limited rights to vote on matters affecting the partnership. There are certain tax risks associated with an investment in MLP units. Additionally, conflicts of interest may exist among common unit holders, subordinated unit holders and the general partner or managing member of an MLP.
Midstream Sector Risk
Certain risks inherent in investing in Midstream Companies and MLPs include changes in the supply and demand for natural resources, depletion of reserves, changes in governmental regulations, changes in commodity prices, inability to consummate acquisitions or realize the benefits therefrom, dependency on affiliates, the occurrence of significant natural or man-made catastrophes, terrorist activities, government instability and the occurrence of extreme weather conditions.
Derivates Risk
The Fund may purchase and sell derivative investments such as exchange-listed and over-the-counter put and call options on securities, equity, fixed income, interest rate and currency indices, and other financial instruments, and enter into various interest rate transactions such as swaps or credit default swaps. The Fund also may purchase derivative investments that combine features of these instruments. The use of derivatives has risks, including high price volatility, government intervention, non-performance by the counterparty and the imperfect correlation between the value of such instruments and the underlying assets, the possible default of the other party to the transaction or illiquidity of the derivative investments. Furthermore, the ability to successfully use these techniques depends on Salient Capital Advisors, LLC’s ability to predict pertinent market movements, which cannot be assured. The use of derivatives may result in losses greater than if they had not been used, may require the Fund to sell or purchase portfolio securities at inopportune times or for prices other than current market values, may limit the amount of appreciation the Fund can realize on an investment or may cause the Fund to hold a security that the Fund might otherwise sell. In addition, amounts paid by the Fund as premiums and cash or other assets held in margin accounts with respect to derivative transactions are not otherwise available to the Fund for investment purposes.
Options Risk
The Fund currently expects to write covered call options on portfolio positions, in an amount up to 30% of the value of total assets in its portfolio, with the purpose of generating realized gains. The Fund also intends to write uncovered call options, in an amount up to 10% of the value of total assets in its portfolio, and purchase put options as part of its hedging strategy. As the writer of a covered call option, during the option’s life the Fund gives up the opportunity to profit from increases in the market value of the security covering the call option above the sum of the premium and the strike price of the call, but the Fund retains the risk of loss should the price of the underlying security decline. The seller of an uncovered call option assumes the risk of a theoretically unlimited loss as a result of an increase in the market price of the underlying security above the exercise price of the option. The buyer of a put or call option assumes the risk of losing its entire premium invested in the option.
Short Sales Risk
A short sale creates the risk of an unlimited loss, in that the price of the underlying security could theoretically increase without limit, thus increasing the cost of buying the securities that were sold short to cover the short position. There can be no assurance that the securities necessary to cover a short position will be available for purchase. The Fund intends to limit its use of short sales to 30% of the value of total assets in the portfolio.
Use of Leverage
Under normal market conditions, the Fund intends to leverage instruments in an amount that represents approximately 25% of its total assets (which represents approximately 33% of net assets), including proceeds from such leverage instruments. However, as market conditions develop, the Fund may use leverage instruments in amounts that represent greater than 25% leverage to the extent permitted by the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”). Any subsidiary C corporations used by the Fund will comply with the 1940 Act restrictions on borrowing and will be included in the Fund’s leverage calculations. Leverage instruments will have seniority over the common shares and may be secured by the assets of the Fund. The Fund currently anticipates leveraging its assets through borrowings from banks and other financial institutions. The Fund currently anticipates that it will enter into at least one credit facility in an amount up to 33 1/3% of total assets. Although the use of leverage by the Fund may create an opportunity for increased return for common shareholders, it also results in additional risks and can magnify the effect of any losses. There is no assurance that the Fund’s use of leverage will be successful.
Delay in Use of Proceeds
Although the Fund currently intends to invest the proceeds from the sale of the common shares within three months after the closing of this offering, such investments may be delayed if suitable investments are unavailable at the time. The trading market and volumes for the Midstream Companies and MLPs in which the Fund intends to invest may at times be less liquid than the market for other securities.
Cash Flow Risk
A substantial portion of the cash flow received by the Fund is derived from its investment in equity securities of Midstream Companies and MLPs. The amount of cash that any such company has available to pay its equity holders in the form of distributions/dividends depends on the amount of cash flow generated from such company’s operations.
Interest Rate Risk
The yields for equity securities of MLPs and certain Midstream MLPs and Midstream Companies are susceptible to fluctuations in interest rates, and the prices of such equity securities may decline when interest rates rise. Rising interest rates could adversely impact the financial performance of energy companies by increasing their cost of capital. Interest rates are at or near historic lows, and as a result they are likely to rise over time.
Capital Markets Risk
Global financial markets and economic conditions have been, and continue to be, volatile due to a variety of factors. As a result, the cost of raising capital in the debt and equity capital markets has increased while the ability to raise capital from those markets has diminished. If funding is not available when needed, or is available only on unfavorable terms, Midstream Companies and MLPs may not be able to meet their obligations as they come due. Moreover, without adequate funding, Midstream Companies and MLPs may be unable to execute their growth strategies, complete future acquisitions, take advantage of other business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures, any of which could have a material adverse effect on their revenues and results of operations.
Equity Securities Risk
Equity securities are sensitive to general movements in the stock market and a drop in the stock market may depress the price of securities to which the Fund has exposure.
Debt Securities Risk
Debt securities in which the Fund invests are subject to many of the risks described elsewhere in this section. In addition, they are subject to credit risk, interest rate risk, prepayment risk and, depending on their quality, other special risks.
Risks Associated with an Investment in Initial Public Offerings (“IPOs’)
Securities purchased in IPOs are often subject to the general risks associated with investments in companies with small market capitalizations, and typically to a heightened degree. Securities issued in IPOs have no trading history, and information about the companies may be available for very limited periods. In addition, the prices of securities sold in an IPO may be highly volatile.
Privately Held Company Risk
Privately held companies are not subject to SEC reporting requirements, are not required to maintain their accounting records in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and are not required to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting. As a result, Salient Capital Advisors, LLC may not have timely or accurate information about the business, financial condition and results of operations of the privately held companies in which the Fund invests. In addition, the securities of privately held companies are generally illiquid, and entail the risks described under—“Liquidity Risk” below.
Liquidity Risk
Securities with limited trading volumes may display volatile or erratic price movements. Therefore, it may be more difficult for the Fund to buy and sell significant amounts of such securities without an unfavorable impact on prevailing market prices.
Interest Rate Hedging Risk
Interest rate transactions that the Fund may use for hedging purposes will expose the Fund to certain risks that differ from the risks associated with its portfolio holdings. The Fund’s success in using hedging instruments is subject to Salient Capital Advisors, LLC’s ability to predict correctly changes in the relationships of such hedging instruments to its interest rate risk, and there can be no assurance that Salient Capital Advisors, LLC’s judgment in this respect will be accurate.
Concentration Risk
The focus of the Fund’s portfolio on companies within the Midstream Sector may present more risks than if its portfolio were broadly diversified over numerous sectors of the economy.
Inflation Risk
Inflation risk is the risk that the value of assets or income from investment will be worth less in the future as inflation decreases the value of money. As inflation increases, the real value of the common shares and distributions can decline.
Portfolio Turnover Risk
The Fund anticipates that its annual portfolio turnover rate will range between 30% and 50%, excluding the turnover from its hedging program, but the rate may vary greatly from year to year. A higher portfolio turnover rate results in correspondingly greater brokerage commissions and other transactional expenses that are borne by the Fund.
Management Risk; Dependence on Key Personnel of Salient Capital Advisors, LLC
The Fund’s portfolio is subject to management risk because it is actively managed. Salient Capital Advisors, LLC applies investment techniques and risk analyses in making investment decisions for us, but there can be no guarantee that they will produce the desired results. The Fund depends upon Salient Capital Advisors, LLC’s key personnel for its future success and upon their access to certain individuals and investments in the Midstream Sector. The departure of any of Salient Capital Advisors, LLC’s portfolio managers or the senior management of Salient Capital Advisors, LLC could have a material adverse effect on Salient Capital Advisors, LLC’s ability to achieve the Fund’s investment objective. In addition, the Fund can offer no assurance that Salient Capital Advisors, LLC will remain its investment adviser or that the Fund will continue to have access to Salient Capital Advisors, LLC’s industry contacts and deal flow.
Conflicts of Interest of Salient Capital Advisors, LLC
Conflicts of interest may arise because Salient Capital Advisors, LLC and its affiliates generally carry on substantial investment activities for other clients in which the Fund will have no interest. Salient Capital Advisors, LLC or its affiliates may have financial incentives to favor certain of such accounts over the Fund. Any of their proprietary accounts and other customer accounts may compete with the Fund for specific trades.
Risk of Owning Securities of Affiliates
From time to time, the Fund may “control” or may be an “affiliate” of one or more of its portfolio companies which, depending on Securities and Exchange Commission interpretations, may result in restrictions being imposed on the size of positions that may be taken for the Fund or on the type of investments that the Fund could make.
Competition Risk
There are a limited number of other companies, including other publicly traded investment companies and private funds, which may serve as alternatives to the Fund for investment in a portfolio of companies in the Midstream Sector.
Valuation Risk
Market prices may not be readily available for any restricted or unregistered investments in public companies or investments in private companies made by the Fund. Due to the difficulty in valuing these securities and the absence of an active trading market for these investments, the Fund may not be able to realize these securities’ carrying value or may have to delay their sale in order to do so.
Restricted Securities
The Fund may invest in unregistered or otherwise restricted securities. Restricted securities may be more difficult to value and the Fund may have difficulty disposing of such assets either in a timely manner or for a reasonable price.
Non-Diversified Status
Overall risk can be reduced by investing in securities from a diversified pool of issuers, while overall risk is increased by investing in securities of a small number of issuers. Credit, market and other risks associated with its investment strategies or techniques may be more pronounced for the Fund than for a fund that is more “diversified.”
Anti-Takeover Provisions
Provisions of the Declaration of Trust and Bylaws could have the effect of discouraging, delaying, deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in control that might otherwise be in the best interests of the Fund’s common shareholders. As a result, these provisions may deprive the Fund’s common shareholders of opportunities to sell common shares at a premium over the then current market price of common shares.
Market Discount Risk
Shares of closed-end management investment companies frequently trade at prices lower than their net asset value, which is commonly referred to as “trading at a discount.” The risk of loss due to this discount may be greater for initial investors expecting to sell their shares in a relatively short period after completion of the offering. An investment in the Fund is not appropriate for all investors and is not designed to be a complete investment program. The Fund is designed to be a long-term investment and not as a trading vehicle.
Legal and Regulatory Risk
Legal and regulatory changes may materially adversely affect the Fund. The regulation of the U.S. and non-U.S. securities and futures markets and investment funds such as the Fund has undergone substantial change in recent years and such change may continue.
Tax Risks
The Fund’s ability to meet its investment objective will depend, in part, on the level of taxable income and distributions the Fund receives from the equity securities in which the Fund invests, a factor over which the Fund has no control. If an MLP were treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, such MLP would be obligated to pay U.S. federal income tax on its income at the corporate tax rate. The amount of cash available for distribution by the MLP would be reduced and distributions received by the Fund would be taxed under U.S. federal income tax laws applicable to corporate dividends (as dividend income, return of capital, or capital gain).
