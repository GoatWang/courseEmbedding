Results for the 2017 first quarter and the comparable period in 2016 include certain significant transaction-related charges associated with the company's recently completed acquisitions, as well as other non-cash income or loss from associated companies and other investments held at fair value, net of taxes, which are allocated by segment.

NEW YORK and LOS GATOS, Calif., March 25, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Steel Partners Holdings L.P. (NYSE: SPLP) ("SPLP") and CoSine Communications (Other OTC: COSN) today announced that the cash tender offer by Cedar 2015 Limited ("Cedar"), an indirect United Kingdom ("UK") subsidiary of SPLP and a wholly-owned subsidiary of CoSine, to acquire all of the issued and to be issued ordinary shares of API Group plc (LN:API) not already owned by Cedar for 60 pence per share (the "Offer") closed at 1:00 pm London time on March 19, 2015.  
The terms of the Offer were initially announced by Cedar on January 22, 2015.  As of the close of the Offer on March 19, 2015, Cedar's own holdings of shares of API, when combined with tendered API shares, exceeded a total of over 97% of the entire existing issued share capital in API.  As Cedar has received acceptances of the Offer in excess of 90% of the API shares to which the Offer related, including the respective voting rights thereof, Cedar intends to exercise its rights in accordance with applicable UK law to acquire compulsorily any remaining API shares to which the Offer relates on the same terms as the Offer. Cedar expects this compulsory acquisition process to be completed about mid-May 2015. 
On March 16, 2015, Cedar, having then received sufficient acceptances under the Offer when combined with Cedar's own holdings of shares of API to assure that Cedar would hold at least in excess of 75% of the voting rights of API, had formally requested that API cancel its admission to trading on the AiM market of the London Stock Exchange. In accordance with the AiM rules, it is anticipated that such cancellation will take effect no earlier than 20 business days from the date of such request.

              BRIEF HISTORY

Steel Partners was founded in February 1990 as a private investment firm by Warren G. Lichtenstein. Since that time we have invested in the United States, and a dozen countries throughout Europe and Asia. We have also launched several successful private investment partnerships, including Steel Partners L.P., Steel Partners II, L.P., Steel Systems L.P., Steel Partners Japan Strategic Fund L.P., Steel Partners China Access I L.P., as well as certain co-investment partnerships.
In December 2008, in order to preserve an investment strategy that successfully served both the company and its investors since its inception, Steel Partners restructured its business. The result was the creation of Steel Partners Holdings L.P., a global diversified holding company that owns and operates businesses in a variety of industries through majority owned subsidiaries, associated companies and other interests.
On April 10, 2012, after fulfilling stringent regulatory and financial reporting requirements, the company became listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE: SPLP).
As long-term investors, Steel Partners Holdings L.P. has focused on enhancing value through the implementation of operational excellence and corporate strategic restructuring programs, including the Steel Partners Operational Excellence Programs, the Steel Partners Purchasing Council, and Steel Partners Corporate Services.
Today, our consolidated holdings have more than 13,400 employees in 115 plants and facilities – totaling approximately 13 million square feet across 20 countries around the globe. Furthermore, according to each of our holdings’ most recent year-end financial reports, the combined revenue would be in excess of $3.6 billion, with substantial profits and cash flow.
