Product Reviews
From Blue Sheepdog:
“Gungenics has recently released their patent-pending Quik-Change System gun cleaning kit. The Quik-Change system is designed with a quick attach, quick disconnect locking mechanism on each of the cleaning components. Contrary to traditional threaded components, the Gungenics Quik-Change System is a simple push/pull on and off design. Gungenics was at SHOT Show 2016 and have sent us a pistol cleaning kit for us to review.”
…Read More
From 2017 SHOT Show All Outdoors:
“One of the more interesting firearms accessories I saw at the 2017 SHOT Show was the line of firearms cleaning kits by Gungenics. These cleaning rods incorporate several innovate features designed to make gun cleaning easier, including color coded rods made of glass-reinforced nylon. I was especially impressed by their .22 rimfire cleaning rod and brush that was noticeably easier to push through the bore than a traditional cleaning kit.”
…Read More
From The Arms Guide:
“Gungenics has come out with a Quik-Change gun cleaning system that will simplify your life, at least when it comes to cleaning your guns. Most of us who have been shooting for awhile have a cleaning box filled with a rats nest of rods and brushes in a mess that makes finding the right size equipment a challenge. Throw that mess out and replace it with caliber color coded goodness that cleans great and takes very little space.”
…Read More
From Double T.A.P.:

 
From GunsAmerica:
“Enter GunGenics. At first glance, I thought, “oh look, another gimmick for gun cleaning” – but on closer examination I became more than just a little interested. What caught my attention were two key elements of the GunGenics system: The rod and all non-brush parts are glass-reinforced nylon; and the shaft uses a quick-connect/disconnect or “Quick-Change” system for the brushes, jags, and other attachments. I like the nylon components because I hate to hear metal on metal when I’m cleaning my guns. Even when it is brass or aluminum, which I know is softer than the case hardened steel of the pistol, it still irritates me to hear them scrape. The idea of the quick-change system means I don’t have to fumble around with screw-in parts with oily or grimy fingers.” …Read More
From American Handgunner:
“The Gungenics system is brand new. It’s basically a “quick change” cleaning rod and brushes and jags color coded to match different calibers. You clean the gun using the cleaners you like, but the bayonet-type quick change mount of the Gungenics accessories allows you to bop back and forth between brushes and jags in a snap. The glass-reinforced nylon construction won’t harm your gun either. It all actually works great!” …Read More
From All Outdoor:
“The Gungenics cleaning system should go a long way towards alleviating these woes. Each of their attachments connects to their cleaning rod without using threads and can be quickly and easily inserted or removed. Just align the attachment properly and shove it into the rod, and you’re done. To remove it, press a little lever on the rod and the attachment will come right out.
Another nice touch: Color matched calibers. You need a bore brush and a patch jag for each caliber, and Gungenics uses the same color polymer for that job. For instance, both the 9mm/357/38 brush and jag have blue stems.” …Read More
From Armed and Feminine:

About





Gungenics Quik-Change Cleaning System was developed to replace the time consuming threading on and off of current gun cleaning brushes, mops, and jags. We all have had to deal with screwing adapters on and off our cleaning rods, and when cleaning multiple caliber guns, the time spent changing adapters increases exponentially. We are committed to providing jobs in the USA so all manufacturing, packaging, printing and production is done right here is the US. Gungenics is a LLC located in central Ohio.





All Gungenics products are made in the USA and recycleable with your household recycling.

BRINGING YOU THE
NEWEST INNOVATION
IN GUN CLEANING TECHNOLOGY






  









Gungenics patent pending gun cleaning system just made cleaning your guns as easy as shooting them.  Our patent pending quik-change rods and adapters will have you cleaning your gun in less time and with less effort than any other gun cleaning kit.










  




 
You have never experienced gun cleaning this easy! It is as simple as 1,2,3.





  




1




Pick the adapter you want to use and insert it into the end of the cleaning rod.






Brushes, and jags are color coded by caliber so picking the correct caliber is easy.
No more destroying brushes because you grabbed the wrong caliber by mistake.









2




Push the adapter shaft into the rod where it will lock into place.






Adapter shafts are extra long to help prevent fingers from being pierced by the bronze brushes.









3




Clean the barrel of your firearm.






Currently available calibers are shown above.
Brush, jag and rods are made of nylon infused
glass making them very durable.






  





Be sure you push the brush completely through the bore. This will ensure you won’t damage the bristles or the quick release latch.





  





When you are ready to change adapters it is once again as easy as 1, 2, 3.





  




1




Press in on the locking lever and pull the brush out.









2




Insert the new adapter.









3




Swab out the bore with the jag.






Currently available calibers are shown above.
Green is for 44/45 caliber firearms.
Blue, is for 9mm, 38, 380 and 357 caliber firearms.
Red is for 40/41 and 10mm caliber firearms.

Gungenics Quik Disconnect Gun Cleaning System Announces New .22/.223 Micro SuperBrush
                      (Feb 08, 2017)
                    
Gungenics is changing the way America cleans guns. With the patent-pending Quik Disconnect system, cleaning has never been so painless. The color-coded brushes make it quick and easy to select the correct caliber adapter and the Quik Disconnect system makes changing adapters lightening fast. Gungenics is also proud to announce the completely reengineered .22/.223 bore brush. We call it the EZ Glide Micro SuperBrushbrush and there’s nothing like it out there today. It slides through the bore like a knife through butter. If you see nothing else at the show, come see this revolutionary new brush. Visit us in booth 5215

“There is nothing like the Gungenics Quik-Change Gun Cleaning Kit on the market. This kit is so revolutionary that retailers are selling it to people who already have the old fashioned cleaning kit, but are looking for a faster way to get past the drudgery of cleaning and spend more time shooting, “ said Gungenics CEO Claire Marvin.

What makes Gungenics so different? 

Gungenics Quik-Change system allows you to switch from brush to jag with the push of a button.
All adapters are color coded and stamped by caliber.
Improved jag tip holds your patch securely in place.
All parts are made from glass-reinforced nylon that will not scratch or damage your firearm.
The Gungenics handle is elongated to prevent smashing your fingers on the barrel when cleaning.
We have re-engineered the .22/.223 caliber-brush. Our Micro SuperBrush not only contains four times as many bristles as a standard .22 caliber brush, but these bristles are also twice as long. This re-engineered design allows the brush to slide through the bore smoother and easier than any other .22 brush.


 Gungenics products are currently available in the common handgun sizes of 9mm/38/357/380, 40/41, and 44/45, with .22 and rifle calibers of .22 and .223 coming in April of 2017.

Ordering is now available online at www.gungenics.com. For more information or for dealer pricing, please contact info@gungenics.com. Gungenics offers a limited lifetime guarantee on all parts except brushes (which will wear out naturally over time).

Invented, owned and operated by a US Marine Corps veteran, all products are proudly made in the USA.

New Website Design and Launch – Gungenics

Check out our newest website design and launch, Gungenics!


Gungenics Quik-Change Cleaning System was developed to replace the time consuming threading on and off of current gun cleaning brushes, mops, and jags. We all have had to deal with screwing adapters on and off our cleaning rods, and when cleaning multiple caliber guns, the time spent changing adapters increases exponentially. We are committed to providing jobs in the USA so all manufacturing, packaging, printing and production is done right here is the US. Gungenics is a LLC located in central Ohio.




All Gungenics products are made in the USA and recycleable with your household recycling.
