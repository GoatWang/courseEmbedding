Insurance and reinsurance specialist investment manager Hudson Structured Capital Management is allocating to a novel third-party liability, or casualty risk, transaction that has been arranged by MultiStrat Advisors Ltd., enabling it to access the returns of workers’ compensation insurance risks.

The underlying transaction sees $35.3 million of seasoned workers’ compensation liabilities being assumed by a MultiStrat owned reinsurance vehicle which will issue preference shares into which Hudson Structured Capital Management, the ILS, re/insurance and transportation finance investment firm established by ex-Goldman Sachs structured finance head Mike Millette, will be investing $20.1 million.
MultiStrat Advisors Ltd., part of the MultiStrat Re total-return focused reinsurance underwriter and servicing company, and its affiliate the Annapolis Consulting Group, arranged and provided the necessary due-diligence for this transaction and will also act as its ongoing servicer.
Hudson Structured, operating as HSCM Bermuda, worked alongside MultiStrat and the cedant the risk was sourced from, to structure the transaction. The arrangement is designed to provide the cedant with full run-off management of its liabilities and collateral, while Hudson Structured aims to benefit from the portfolios insurance-linked returns.
At the same time, and what makes this casualty ILS transaction particularly interesting, the loss fund will be actively managed by one of the largest private asset managers in the United States, Payden & Rygel, in order to generate an enhanced return on the assets, as well as benefit from the liability risk returns.
Payden & Rygel, an asset manager with around $110 billion under management, will look after the portfolios assets using an asset-liability management strategy, in order to minimise the asset risk while generating investment returns.
This is particularly interesting as it brings together the ILS strategy of collateralizing the underlying insurance risks, alongside the total-return strategy of generating an enhanced investment return as well. This strategy can not only help to enhance the returns that the portfolio of risk can generate, it also enables an ILS investor to work alongside an asset manager, which of course could be the same entity in many cases.
That could be a very attractive proposition to some asset managers, who understand the opportunities ILS can present but are also attracted to the premium assets as well. Through the segregation of the liabilities and investment assets, these novel transactions can be structured that enable asset managers to benefit on both risk and investment side of a longer-tailed insurance or reinsurance linked deal.
HSCM Bermuda likes to allocate its capital across the risk and return spectrum in all instruments and sectors of insurance and reinsurance. The investment manager has already been active in the legacy casualty reinsurance, which is an area we do not see crop up that often in ILS.
HSCM Bermuda tends to collaborate with established platforms for this kind of transaction and says it was “pleased to work with MultiStrat on this deal.”
MultiStrat specialises in launching reinsurance companies for asset managers and institutional investors, and delivering attractive opportunities to those seeking access to reinsurance related risks. Annapolis Consulting Group, which is a part of MultiStrat, provides run-off finality solutions, including acquisitions for captives, Qualified Self-Insured’s, RRGs and other risk assuming entities.
Rachel Bardon, Managing Director of HSCM Bermuda, commented on the deal; “We are delighted to complete this transaction in this legacy block of business.”
Tim Tetlow, Partner of HSCM Bermuda, also said; “This transaction allows the cedant to move forward and focus on its future.”
Michael Millette, Managing Partner of Hudson Structured, stated; “We are pleased to collaborate with MultiStrat in this transaction. We have studied a series of opportunities together and expect that this will be the first of many that we complete.”
Sean Logan, CEO of ACG, said; “By consulting with the client on their requirements for collateral management and adverse development protection, we structured a solution that met the client’s requirements and HSCM’s return expectations.”
Jim Robinson, CEO of MultiStrat Advisors, added; “This investment represents the continued expansion of alternative capital through “Casualty Linked Accounts,” allowing segregation of liabilities and direct investment of assets for investors like HSCM.
Bob Forness, CEO of MultiStrat, commented: “The combination of the HSCM Bermuda team’s expertise and our efforts over many months produced an attractive transaction and a template for the future. We look forward to working more with HSCM going forward.”
Firms that assissted with this transaction included StormHarbour Securities LP acting as placement agent for this casualty ILS deal, reinsurance brokers Preferred Reinsurance Intermediaries Inc. (South Carolina) and RFIB (Bermuda) Ltd., and rent-a-captive facility Uberrimae Fidei Insurance Company Ltd.
It’s encouraging to see evidence of the ILS markets’ gradual expansion into longer-tailed, casualty lines of risk. By finding a structure that enables the asset side of the portfolio to be put to work as well, this type of transaction could open the way for other ILS investment managers to get more involved in casualty lines.

Wright or Wrong? - Hudson Structured Capital Management

14 Dec 2015    

Wright or Wrong?


The speech that David Andrews gave at the Airline Economics conference in Dublin, January 2016.
My new office is in Stamford, Connecticut but I live in New Hampshire a distance of over 200 miles/420 km. Depending on traffic, the drive can take between 5 and 6 hours, which is not only a colossal waste of time but also really boring. To fill the void, I have discovered the benefits of books on tape. When I read, I prefer nonfiction such as history, finance or personal biographies. But while driving, I usually listen to novels. Listening is harder for me than reading so I need a simple plot with only a few characters. But recently, I made an exception. It was David McCulloch’s biography of the Wright Brothers. And I was absolutely riveted.
Two key aspects to the Wrights achievement I found most compelling. First, how two brothers operating a bicycle shop in Toledo, were able to figure out what the top scientists of the day couldn’t? Their greatest competitor, Samuel Pierpont Langley – an American astronomer, physicist, Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution and founder of the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory – received a substantial government grant to produce a flying machine. Despite better credentials and funding, every attempt by Langley to convert his experimental models into a manned machine was a monumental flop. Meanwhile, the brothers in the words of David McCulloch “had no college education, no formal technical training, no experience working with anyone other than themselves, no friends in high places, no financial backers, no government subsidies and little money of their own” and yet somehow despite the odds succeeded where others failed. How did they do it?
The Wright Brothers story is as much about entrepreneurship as it is about aviation.
The second aspect I found extremely compelling, which I least expected, was to discover that the Wright Brothers story is as much about entrepreneurship as it is about aviation. This strikes a particularly resonant chord with me because I am embarking on my own entrepreneurial venture, along with Michael Millette and a handful of others, to create a new asset manager called Hudson Structured Capital Management. And the more I learned about how the Wrights accomplished their incredible feat the more evident it became that their overall approach, even though dating more than 100 years ago, offers important lessons for, not just entrepreneurs, but all types of investors today. In my view, the Wrights were successful for three key reasons:
1. Single minded dedication to a goal
2. A strong work ethic and
3. A process designed to find workable solutions while managing risk.
The brothers were obsessed with the idea of flight from an early age and dedicated their time and financial resources to studying the endeavor. They also inherited a strong work ethic from their father, a Bishop in the Brethren church. Hard work and dedicated focus are key attributes that remain important to success today, whether you are an entrepreneur, an investor or both. But these attributes, while important, were not the Wrights distinguishing characteristic. The Wrights competitors also exhibited dedication towards a goal and a strong work ethic. Langley, for example, certainly had a strong work ethic and was intently focused on achieving his goal. But yet, he never even came close to achieving manned flight.
It was the third key reason for success that I find most interesting and relevant today that set the Wrights apart allowing them to significantly outperform their competitors. That is, the process and structure the brothers used to discover the hidden truths behind manned flight. Today, documentaries often depict the brothers leaving their bicycle shop in Toledo and seemingly a week later successfully launching the first flying machine in Kitty Hawk. That is not how it happened. Rather, the first successful flight was the culmination of a lifetime of dedicated research and testing, with many failures and challenges along the way. In short, it was a long and disciplined process.
Applied to investing today I would argue, the Wright Process (right with a W) can pay high dividends to those who follow it well and consistently.
WHAT CAN WE LEARN FROM THE WRIGHT BROTHERS PROCESS?
The two critical goals Wilbur and Orville believed were necessary to solve the problem of developing a flying machine were knowledge and skill. While the Wright Brothers never formally described how they developed knowledge and skill as a “process”, they, in fact, did have one and it had definite structure and guiding principles. These included:
1. Debating issues and problems to better understand and define pathways to solutions
2. Break a problem into manageable components
3. Independence of thought and research
4. Apply ideas and focus on what works and is verifiable 5. Manage risks
Lets review each one in detail.
WRIGHT PROCESS PRINCIPLE 1 – DEBATE TO IMPROVE KNOWLEDGE
Even though Wilbur was the older by several years, he and Orville carried on debates over the issues facing them throughout their lives. Often spirited, they always kept their minds open. Mr. McCulloch cites one relative who related that after a particularly heated debate the night before, Wilbur came down the next morning and said that he thought about Orville’s argument and decided Orville was probably right. A few minutes later, Orville descended and said he thought about Wilbur’s arguments and decided Wilbur was probably right. This demonstrates an honest endeavor to find truth rather than a competitive contest just to win the argument.
Starting a new business also requires a constructive process of finding solutions to problems. Mike and I spent the first few months refining our strategy and focus, often debating the pros and cons of particular structures, diversification strategies and portfolio composition. All in the spirit of finding a value proposition that works for both issuers and investors. We brought in experts to assist with our deliberations to ensure fresh perspectives. We considered focusing solely on aviation finance. But the one constant in investing is change. What is true today may no longer be true tomorrow. Consequently, through our deliberations, we ended up deciding to focus our investment strategy across Transport with a heavy emphasis on aviation. This provides diversification and a hedge against missed opportunities in other sectors when yields meet our criteria.
At Hudson Structured, we have an Investment Committee process that vets new transactions proposed to be included in the portfolio.
Individual deal decision-making also benefits greatly from dispassionate discussion and debate over the merits and forecasts of future performance. Often information is incomplete and imperfect. Discussion helps define what is known, what is not and what can be inferred to dimension the range of the unknown. Many of the most successful investors have used debate forums as a critical part of their investment vetting process. For example, Ray Dalio of Bridgewater emphasizes the use of debate with smart people to stress test opinions to find out where he might be wrong. An honest endeavor to assess investment proposals is greatly enhanced through discussion and debate. The Wrights had a brotherly bond that may have helped them avoid the pitfalls of pride or humiliation of appearing publicly in the wrong that often hampers participants from accepting other viewpoints despite overwhelming supporting evidence or stronger logic.
At Hudson Structured, we have an Investment Committee process that vets new transactions proposed to be included in the portfolio. While more formalized than the Wrights, like theirs, our debates are geared toward challenging assumptions, precepts and even sometimes facts to ensure that we are understanding and planning, as best we can, for risks inherent to any transaction proposal.
WRIGHT PROCESS PRINCIPLE 2 – BREAK A PROBLEM INTO MANAGEABLE COMPONENTS
Early on, the Wrights separated the problem of manned flight into component parts, which they attacked one by one. The brothers quickly discovered it was quite easy to become aloft, not much more difficult than flying a kite. The real problem was how to control yourself once in the air and then safely land. And they further broke this problem into three components. Pitch (nose up, nose down), roll (up or down of wing) and yaw (turning right or left). To help them, they first studied birds. In Kitty Hawk, they spent hours watching and analyzing bird flight behavior. The locals thought them a bit daft chasing gulls for hours on end and running through the dunes imitating their wing movements with their arms and hands.
But these studies proved extremely instructive. Some birds were very good at soaring and used dihedral angles to help them ride wind currents or turn. Other birds with level wings were faster but required more wing flapping to keep themselves aloft. And, they noticed, bird wings appeared as a relatively thin line when moving away from you but were broader when moving towards you. Through these observations they discovered the importance of the angle of attack and camber in wing design critical to lift. They also discovered the importance of wing warping that birds use to turn right or left. And finally, they noticed that moving the center of resistance was more important than moving the center of lift to balance fore and aft.
Gaining knowledge by observing is directly applicable to investing today and an important tool we use to determine what works, what doesn’t and why. By observing aviation transactions that resulted in losses and analyzing the accuracy of assumptions we can gain useful insights to avoid future pitfalls. At Hudson Transport, we have spent a lot of time looking through aviation ABS transactions for clues as to why some performed well while others struggle. Probably the two most common issues are over optimistic assumptions about collateral valuation and misalignment of interests. Structure plays a role but sometimes making a bad situation worse (such as onerous restrictions on selling assets) rather than as the main culprit and other times providing benefits such as rapid amortization triggers for debt holders in cases where cash flows are falling short of expectations.
THE WRIGHT PROCESS PRINCIPLE 3 – INDEPENDENT RESEARCH
The Wright brothers were independent minded, partly out of disposition and partly out of necessity. They wrote to leading aviators of the day for as much research and information they could find but little of what came back was of much use. This led them to conclude, “If we worked on the assumption that what is accepted as true really is true, then there would be little hope for advance.” To move forward, they would have to conduct their own experiments. This they did. They built their own gliders with their own wing designs, developed the idea of a movable rudder, created their own lightweight engine, designed and built their own wind tunnel and designed their first propeller. All without the help of any leading engineers of the day. The one time they relied on someone else it led them astray. Specifically, a number of experts recommend using data from Lilienthal for their lift drag calculations. His was the only known source for such information at the time. After repeated disappointments using Lilienthal’s estimates (which exaggerated the predicted lift) the Wrights conducted their own lift drag tests producing much different results that were much more successful (and in line with those used by Langley).
Independent research and thought are just as important to investing as to developing innovative scientific breakthroughs.
The most recent financial crisis provides several valuable examples of independent thought. Those who invested with Bernie Madoff could only base their decision on the reputation of Madoff himself rather than on transparent strategies and historical returns much to the detriment of their net worth.
Those who questioned the premise that the real estate market was local and national recessions did not happen were amply rewarded when this became obviously untrue. Conventional wisdom said that consumers would first default on credit card debt, then auto debt and only after all resources were expended would they risk defaulting on their mortgage since that risked losing the roof over their heads. In actual fact, mortgages were defaulted on first in many cases well before auto and credit card debt. Just as the data produced by Lilienthal was calculated under specific conditions and based on a certain set of assumptions that were no longer true or relevant to the problem facing the Wrights, the data that led investors to assume mortgage debt would be the last to default were basing their assumptions on an outdated legal structure and a financing framework with very different behavioral incentives that led to vastly different outcomes.
THE WRIGHT PROCESS PRINCIPLE 4 – TESTING IN THE REAL WORLD
The Wrights were engineers. They loved to apply theories and test them in real world situations. In the words of Wilbur Wright “It is possible to fly without motors, but not without knowledge and skill.” The application and testing of their machine was all about developing the skills for man to control his machine while in the air. From the beginning, they used what they observed from birds to apply theories to a mechanical device that would replicate flight. Each aspect or theory was tested and if found wanting would be re-thought and re-tested until a successful solution was found. Being able to maintain equilibrium flying in a straight line was attempted first before attempting to figure out how to turn. It took repeated trials to find out that merely shifting ones weight was insufficient to turn a glider. Multiple trial and errors were required to finally determine that wing and rudder angles are critical aspects to the secret of turning under control. Interestingly, Octave Chanute, considered an authority on aviation in the early 1900s, never advanced the science of aviation because he never actually flew a glider to test his designs.
Investment acumen and skill are developed through experience. Another precept of Ray Dalio is that an accurate understanding of reality is essential to producing good investment outcomes. Corporate Financial theory states that priority of payment determines the recovery outcome of different securities within a particular capital structure and therefore those with the highest priority are “safer”. But in actual practice and outside of bankruptcy, this does not always hold true. For example, it often occurs that subordinated debt is paid ahead of senior debt because the higher interest costs is a heavier burden on equity returns providing greater incentive to refinance or repay them first. Another example is when the same holders of subordinated holding company bonds also hold large amounts of senior operating company bank loans resulting in senior lenders approving amendments that benefit holding company sub note holders which is contrary to what one would normally expect.
Another Corporate Finance theory is that creditors and equity have converging interests during periods of financial distress. Not always so in our era of derivatives and hedge fund arbitrage.
Another Corporate Finance theory is that creditors and equity have converging interests during periods of financial distress. Not always so in our era of derivatives and hedge fund arbitrage. Often hedge funds own subordinated bonds and hedge the position by shorting the equity. Sometimes, the result is their indifference to helping the issuer avoid a default and bankruptcy filing; in this case, the tail is wagging the dog. The lesson of knowing whom you are getting in bed with is important and only becomes clear by testing, learning and developing skill and experience over time.
THE WRIGHT PROCESS PRINCIPLE 5 – MANAGING RISK
Early aviation was a dangerous sport. In 1896, Otto Lilienthal lost control of his glider and fell to his death. Percy Pilcher, a well-known aviator at the time, did the same in 1899. This reinforced to the brothers the importance of managing risks. In addition, a severe hockey accident that laid Wilbur up for months in his early teens probably contributed to his healthy respect for physical danger. Moreover, it is certainly understandable that one would be circumspect about launching in the air before being certain of the ability to control oneself.
Careful risk management allowed the brothers to learn the ways of the wind and how to master control over flight without losing their lives. In the words of Wilbur, “carelessness and overconfidence are more dangerous than deliberately accepted risks.”
Risk management by the brothers is evident throughout the process. They spent weeks studying the mechanics of bird flight before venturing into the air to test their theories. And when they did begin to attempt flight they first started with unmanned gliders with strings attached so that they could try controlling the apparatus safely from the ground. Only when they completed enough tests that provided confidence they could control themselves did they then attempt to build and fly manned gliders. Even then, they tested from the least dangerous terrain over short distances and never higher than about 20 feet. Kitty Hawk was perfect. It had dunes from which to launch and wide beaches for soft landings. Only after many tests with gliders and only until they were confident of their ability to maintain equilibrium during flight did the brothers then try to fly with an engine.
Risk management is fundamental in the investment world. Investors begin with small investments and watch results before committing to larger exposures. Only after due diligence and monitoring of track records are investors willing to increase their investments. Portfolio managers control risks through allocations and sector limits. Financial issuers control risk through asset liability matching. As with the Wrights, those investors who focus on risk management live to enjoy the success of their efforts.
Now that we have reviewed the 5 principles of the Wright Process, let me spend a few moments talking about what we are up to at our new entrepreneurial venture, Hudson Structured.
HUDSON STRUCTURED CAPITAL MANAGEMENT
Hudson Structured Capital Management is an alternative asset manager focused on mezzanine level risk in Transportation and Re/Insurance. Our transportation group is called Hudson Transport. Mezzanine risk we define as subordinated debt or E-notes in ABS transactions, mezzanine bank loans or senior debt financing. We focus on assets requiring domain knowledge to understand or that cannot be financed efficiently in the debt capital markets. We use thought leadership and team experience as the building blocks of our competitive advantage.
At Hudson Transport, we work with senior bank lenders, lessors and operators to finance equipment in aviation, maritime, rail, container and mobile equipment subsectors. Our team has expertise in structuring, analyzing and distributing financing solutions. Moreover, we have an excellent Advisory Board with deep operating experience providing valuable insight during our internal deliberations. We do our own independent analysis. A large percentage of our transactions are expected to be private, not relying on credit ratings. Advance rates and structure are very important to us.
At Hudson Structured, we prefer not to follow the crowd. As we view the market today, there are a large number of providers of senior debt at the top of the capital structure.
Just like the Wright Brothers, we manage risk through knowledge and skill. On a quarterly basis, we will manage portfolio risk by carefully monitoring relative value across transport sectors and debating the implications of trends in each sector adjusting subsector allocations accordingly.
We manage transaction risk through advance rates and structure that de-levers in line with or ahead of asset depreciation. We also manage transaction risks by in-depth modeling of cash flows to provide a roadmap for debt repayment or equity returns of capital. We optimize opportunities by studying the relative positions of different debt and equity classes within a transaction to see which offers the best risk/return tradeoffs.
At Hudson Structured, we prefer not to follow the crowd. As we view the market today, there are a large number of providers of senior debt at the top of the capital structure. There are also a large number of providers of equity at the bottom of the capital structure. But few capital providers are focused on the middle, mezzanine debt. This is our target market.
Similar to the Wrights, Hudson Structured is small and nimble. All of its intellectual talent is applied to transaction problems, risk assessment and sourcing. In contrast, a significant portion of intellectual talent within larger organizations, generally with many layers of management, is devoted to managing others or through others. What knowledge and skill we have is brought to bear on just about every problem. Those with deep industry knowledge drive our investment decisions. We not only invest for others, we put our own money on the line. We are firm believers in alignment of interests.
With increasing regulatory constraints and industry complexity, we see opportunities to fill market voids. The success of the aviation industry rests on the solid foundation laid by the Wrights. Like them, we at Hudson Structured are entrepreneurs funding our dreams from our own resources and using knowledge and skill to lay a solid foundation for the future.
OUTLOOK FOR AVIATION FINANCE
Speaking of the future, I would like to next provide a few comments on our outlook for aviation finance since it is our largest subsector allocation.
We are firm believers that to understand investment trends in aviation finance you should start with the overall macro landscape. Lets start with quick recap of the last 6 months.
Stocks – S&P down 11% in the 2H15 and down 7% in first two weeks of 2016.
Credit Markets – HY Bonds were down 7.5% in 2H15 and the downward pressure continued during the first two weeks of 2016. Note the 7.5% decline in the second half was the worst on record aside from 2008/09. – Bond default rate forecasts for 2016 are already rising with JP Morgan estimating that their previous 3.0% forecast is more likely going to be 6.0% if oil stays in the low 30s. – The % of bonds trading at distressed levels has doubled to 8.8% up from 2.0% this time last year.
Two key culprits creating market stress – commodities and China – are interrelated.
Commodities – Brendt over the past 6 months has fallen almost in half to $34 from $61 – Many other commodities such as iron ore and coal have followed suit – These downdrafts are driving much of the higher default and HY distressed trading percentages.
China – PBOC cut rates 6 times over the past year – China implemented the first F/X devaluation in 23 years – Capital flight is evident in appetite for foreign assets – Reserve requirements have been cut to 2008 levels – Government actions to halt stock declines with circuit breakers failed requiring a ban on large stock sales for 30 days.
In our view, China is burdened by a legacy of uneconomic investment projects. The developed world is providing less export fuel to drive its economic engine. Domestic demand is looked to as a new source of fuel but it seems to be developing slowly and is undermined by capital flight. We believe China’s overall growth is slowing and will continue to do so. We believe, this slowdown will ripple throughout both Asia and the emerging markets in general. We have seen this happen in 2015 and we expect it will continue in 2016.
Which brings us to what this all means to aviation finance. We see 3 key impacts.

Cost of financing in aviation will be higher than over the past two years. IG and HY bond spreads are wider by over 100 bps. Aviation financing has held in well but has not been immune to the overall risk-off environment. We expect spreads to remain high and volatile throughout 2016.
Aircraft values are likely to depreciate faster over the next 5 years than they did over the last 5 years. The confluence deliveries of replacement aircraft ramping up at the same time that EM economies are faltering suggest to us demand and therefore aircraft prices are likely to be lower. We also believe that financing newer aircraft is not necessarily safer than financing older ones. New deliveries of aircraft with older generation technology, or even newer for that matter, are likely to disappoint those who finance them under the same terms as those when replacement deliveries were not looming so near.
Widebodies look more vulnerable to price erosion than narrowbodies given the high percentage of widebodies in the order book destined for Asian and Middle Eastern markets. Stories from lessors of the challenges of remarketing certain widebody types, gives us pause for serious reflection.

We are not predicting markets will shut down because of these issues. Rather, there must be adjustments to spreads, to advance rates, and to re-lease and residual value assumptions. Volatility and change speak to a world where knowledge and skill will be critical to navigating choppy waters. We at Hudson Transport cannot wait to get started.
