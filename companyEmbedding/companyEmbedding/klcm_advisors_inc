About






Overview
Why We Are Different
Equity
Fixed







KLCM is an independent, registered investment advisory firm located in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
Collectively, our lead investment principals have over sixty years of experience working with individuals, corporate sponsors, and institutions in building balanced and equity portfolios that meet specific needs.
Our expertise revolves around faithfully executing our value investing philosophy, with a focus on preservation of capital as well as earning attractive returns.
Company Objectives

To be responsive to the needs of our clients and provide the highest level of customer service.
To protect client capital.
To achieve real growth of capital.
To outperform the major market indices over full market cycles through strong relative performance in weak markets and participation in strong markets.





KLCM Value Investing

Continuity and Consistency — Investment principals have been working together, as a team, for over twenty five years.
Fiduciary Approach — Will accumulate cash when attractive investment options are limited. We do not look to mirror the market or an index.
Proven investment process and results.
Focus — A single equity investment style. Will drift relative to market capitalization, and are proud of that.
Long term investors — We do not focus on ‘the next quarter’.
Uniquely positioned — Small enough in size to effectively take advantage of market opportunities. Large enough to have access to management teams and research resources.
Owner operated.





Equity Investment Philosophy & Process


We are bottom up stock pickers

We focus on out of favor and neglected companies
Cash flow is critical for shareholders and valuation
We look for limited downside
We need a catalyst to drive earnings and to realize value



Driven by intensive research

Understanding of company and industry drivers
Clear and achievable management objectives
Favorable risk/reward supported by valuation disciplines



Concentrated Portfolios

25 to 30 stocks
Take full advantage of our best ideas
Add to and trim positions to take advantage of market volatility and to manage risk








	KLCM Fixed Income Value Add


Client centric. Risk tolerance, age, tax situation and income needs vary among clients and portfolio construction needs to reflect those distinctions. Market opportunities will also vary dramatically over time and are reflected in portfolio construction.

Not benchmark driven. Opportunistic across sub-classes of fixed income to find best risk/reward characteristics. Flexibility to own or not own municipals, corporates, preferreds, agencies, and/or Treasuries.

Strong credit analysis, based on a fusion of equity and fixed income analytical work, allows the use of a wide range of credits and meaningful enhancement to portfolio yield, particularly early in the credit cycle.

Cycle awareness is critical in understanding when compensation is adequate for owning lower than investment grade credits, extending duration, or owning smaller issues. We have lived through numerous economic cycles, seen the dramatic conclusion of a 30 year fixed income bear market and now the conclusion of a 33 year bull market (1981-2014)!


	KLCM Fixed Income Summary


		Proven Style and Process

		Client Focused

		Opportunistic

		The net result is a portfolio that optimizes income generation in the context of:
		

				Client objectives

				Protection of principal

				Recurring liquidity

				Stability of income

				Well researched credits

April, 2017

	 

Reality

	 

	If recent developments in Washington haven't made you a bit uneasy, you are extremely successful at tuning out the noise. In our last essay we wrote "given our cynicism of government, especially in Washington, we expect some challenges in policy implementation as the New Year begins. These challenges, in our opinion, will provide real opportunities for investor sentiment to change course..." This reality is upon us.

	 

	While beltway politics have been "challenging" (as expected), our view that market volatility would follow has been completely wrong... so far. We have just experienced one of the least volatile periods in recent equity market history. There were 110 consecutive trading days without a 1% decline in the market; the longest streak since 1995. This run finally ended March 21st. Needless to say, the tranquility has been surprising.

	 

	While Washington's difficulties suggest more political uncertainty, one should keep the events in context. Economic data in the US continues to improve, and all of the top global economies are expanding in unison for the first time in a decade. We believe that strong US economic fundamentals remain intact (multiyear highs in consumer and business sentiment, tightening labor markets, increasing demand for housing, strong consumer balance sheets). Add a pro-business policy agenda and a reasonable backdrop for sustainable economic growth takes shape. Longer term, these fundamentals will drive the market.

	 

	While we expect that the economy will grow in the coming year, we continue to gird ourselves for increased volatility and the potential for a market pullback. We are entering the later stages of a long economic expansion; volatility tends to be elevated in the 2nd half of a business cycle. To that end, our portfolios are more conservatively positioned. We continue to keep some cash on hand, and seek out larger, higher quality businesses, illustrated via two of our more recent purchases.

	 

Merck (MRK)

	Large pharmaceutical companies historically go through long periods of time where one company is viewed as the leader in drug technology. This position manifests itself in higher growth rates than peers and an accompanying higher valuation from investors. For the past decade Bristol Myers has held this position with its leadership in an emerging class of cancer therapies: Immuno-oncology drugs.

	Late last summer a highly anticipated Immuno-oncology drug trial conducted by Bristol-Myers failed. This catapulted Merck into the leading position in this space. We believe the successful trials Merck has conducted on their I/O drug, Keytruda, will change the landscape and leadership in cancer treatment. The shift away from radiation and chemo towards I/O has begun to take mindshare at leading medical institutions.

	 

	This can be seen by Massachusetts General adopting Keytruda's biomarker testing in select cancer treatments as their new standard of care.

	 

	We believe we are at the forefront of change in leadership within the pharma sector. As Keytruda starts to flow through Merck's operating results they will be able to grow earnings faster than their peers and should be rewarded with a premium multiple. While we wait for this scenario to play out, we own a great global franchise trading at lower than market valuation and we will collect a nearly 3% dividend yield.

	 

Occidental Petroleum (OXY)

	Depending on how you categorize the industry, Occidental is either the smallest major or the largest non-major integrated oil exploration and production (E&P) company. Either way, the integrated business that only scale players possess offers unique advantages in the energy space. One benefit is the ability to invest throughout the commodity price cycle. Occidental spent $2.6 billion in growth project capital over the past three years. Due to their integrated business model and historically conservative approach to capital allocation, the company was able to do this while also raising the dividend 19% and maintaining a single "A" balance sheet.

	 

	Having completed this spending, the company is now in the enviable position of harvesting a return on this sizable investment. Completion of these projects allows the company to focus on deploying their growth capital towards the Permian basin. Here the company has a 650,000 acre core position where they have identified over 2500 drilling locations that are profitable with oil below $50. After doubling their current activity level, this will still represent more than 10 years of drilling inventory.

	 

	With most investors having thrown in the towel on energy companies after a difficult three year stretch, the stock has found no takers. In fact, despite crude nearly doubling, the stock is up only a few dollars from where it was last February when oil was $28/barrel. We believe as the price of oil stabilizes and true investors return to the energy industry, Occidental will be rewarded with a higher share price. In the meantime we will happily collect the generous, safe, and growing 4.7% dividend.

	 

	These are two examples where we were able to find companies that we believe have better than average business prospects, but whose stocks are selling at a discount to their peers. If our work is correct, these companies should be able to increase their free cash flow as they reap the rewards of past investment. If the economy or market should weaken, then the relatively low valuations, strong balance sheets, and meaningful dividend yields should help limit our downside.

	 

	Thank you for your confidence and enjoy spring!

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year
