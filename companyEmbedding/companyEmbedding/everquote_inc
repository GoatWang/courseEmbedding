CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Feb. 22, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- EverQuote, Inc., the leading online insurance marketplace in the U.S., is pleased to announce the appointment of Mira Wilczek to its Board of Directors. Mira is the President and CEO of venture incubator Cogo Labs, which has spawned 15 companies. Mira brings an impressive background as a technologist, entrepreneur, and startup advisor.








"We are excited to welcome Mira Wilczek to our board and appreciate the invaluable insight she will bring to our rapidly growing marketplace," said CEO Seth Birnbaum. "Mira comes to us from the same incubator EverQuote sprung from and understands how we operate and where we are headed as a company."
This announcement follows EverQuote's $36M Series B funding round. The company received investments from Stratim Capital, Savano Capital Partners, Oceanic Partners, T Capital Partners, SecondAlpha and Link Ventures. Those new funds will be used to rapidly accelerate EverQuote's growth into the leading personal risk marketplace. Since the funding was announced, the company increased its workforce to over 200 employees and opened a second office in Woburn, MA. EverQuote will look to hire another eighty employees by 2018 and expand its presence in home and life insurance. 
"EverQuote is one of the fastest growing startups in Boston history with a culture that is famous for being productive and fun at the same time," said Mira Wilczek. "It's a great fit for my view of a well managed high tech startup and I'm grateful for the opportunity to help it accelerate further."
Mira Wilczek is a big data and machine learning expert and a Senior Partner at Link Ventures. Prior to Cogo Labs she was Founder and CEO at Red Panda Security, Principal Investigator under the DARPA CFT program, and Director of Business Development at Lyric Semiconductor, where she garnered industry recognition including TR50, Silicon 60, and an EE Times ACE Award and led the successful sale of the company to Analog Devices. 
Mira also holds patents both granted and pending in the fields of cyber security and sensor data fusion. She has an S.B. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from MIT and an MBA from MIT Sloan. She will replace Dr. Jonathan Shapiro, who joined EverQuote in the position of Chief Scientific Officer.

BBB Accreditation



        Everquote, Inc. has maintained 6 years 5 months of continuous BBB Accreditation.
    

                BBB Accredited Since 02/09/2011
            

                BBB has determined that Everquote, Inc. meets Standards of BBB Accreditation, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            

                BBB accreditation does not mean that the business's products or services have been evaluated or endorsed by BBB, or that BBB has made a determination as to the business's product quality or competency in performing services.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB: 
1. meet all applicable standards within this Code of Business Practices

                            2. cooperate with BBB's activities and efforts to promote voluntary self- regulation within the business' industry

4. Cooperate with BBB self-regulatory programs for the resolution of advertising disputes.
5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

                    6. Avoid misleading customers by creating the false impression of sponsorship, endorsement, popularity, trustworthiness, product quality or business size through the misuse of logos, trustmarks, pictures, testimonials, or other means
                







Tell the Truth

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Upon request, provide BBB with all information required to evaluate compliance with BBB standards. This may include, but is not limited to business name, address and contact information; names and background of principles; business and banking references; licensing and/or professional accreditation; and a complete description of the nature of the business.

5. the business' return/refund policy

                            6. any recurring commitment into which the customer may be entering, including information on how future billing will occur

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Promptly respond to all complaints forwarded by BBB by: 
1. Resolving the complaint directly with the complainant and notifying BBB, or

                            2. Providing BBB with a response that BBB determines: 

                                    1. is professional,
                                
2. addresses all of the issues raised by the complainant,
3. includes appropriate evidence and documents supporting the business' position, and

                                    4. explains why any relief sought by the complainant cannot or should not be granted.
                                





                    2. Make a good faith effort to resolve disputes, which includes mediation if requested by BBB. Other dispute resolution options, including arbitration, may be recommended by BBB when other efforts to resolve a dispute have failed. BBB may consider a business' willingness to participate in recommended dispute resolution options in determining compliance with these standards.
                

                    3. Comply with any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process.
                

                    4. Cooperate with BBB in efforts to eliminate the underlying cause of patterns of customer complaints that are identified by BBB.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

                        The Customer Review Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive,
                        neutral, and negative reviews posted.

Composite Score:





                        Everquote, Inc. has received 2.8 out of 5 stars based on 117 Customer Reviews and a BBB Rating of B.
                        






                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.

EverQuote Closes $23 Million Series B Funding



























EverQuote Closes $23 Million Series B Funding To Rapidly Scale Personal Risk Marketplace










Funds will accelerate sales expansion and product development 
Cambridge, MA, October 20, 2016 - EverQuote, Inc., the leading insurance marketplace, today announced that it closed a $23 million dollar Series B investment led by Maryland-based Savano Capital Partners, with participation from Stratim Capital, Oceanic Partners and T Capital Partners. EverQuote will use the funding to further accelerate growth by increasing its investment in sales and product development. It will also afford the company greater flexibility to continue development of its personal risk marketplace. 
Founded in 2011, EverQuote utilizes proprietary technology and data to match, advise and connect insurance shoppers with carriers and agents, both online and offline. EverQuote’s customer base includes many of the largest U.S. underwriters, and over 5,000 insurance agencies. Since inception, EverQuote has grown to 5 million consumer visits per month and made over 50 million referrals resulting in over $3 billion of premiums for carriers and agents and an estimated $500 million in savings for consumers. 
In a fiercely competitive market, insurance carriers and agents are shifting advertising spend away from broad-based media to measurable online channels. EverQuote’s intelligent technology engages active shoppers best matching carrier and agents’ underwriting strengths, reducing the cost of consumer acquisition. For consumers, EverQuote is the most efficient tool to shop and save on insurance with the most complete set of product options. 
In 2016, EverQuote launched EverDrive, a free iOS and Android safe driving app for social insurance engagement. EverDrive helps consumers identify and correct their potentially costly, and deadly, driving habits. At scale, EverDrive will create a safer driving population resulting in fewer claims and losses, and ultimately lower cost insurance for consumers. EverDrive represents the first step in EverQuote’s development of a personal risk marketplace to make consumers safer while saving money. 
"We’re incredibly excited about EverQuote and the opportunity to partner with Seth and his team. EverQuote is the premier online marketplace partner for insurers,” said Tom Smith, Managing Director of Savano Capital Partners. “Its proprietary technology and targeted approach create a compelling value proposition for carriers, agents and consumers in a notoriously inefficient market. We’re confident that EverQuote is poised for many years of continued growth and look forward to serving as the company’s investment and capital partner along the way." 
“We have experienced tremendous growth the past three years, and this funding will help EverQuote continue to grow quickly while we develop a unique personal risk marketplace for consumers and insurance providers,” said EverQuote CEO, Seth Birnbaum. “There’s a vast opportunity in unifying our proprietary technology and data with information from increasingly connected consumers to become the trusted source for risk related products and services online.” "We are very excited to make one of Stratim's largest investments to date in EverQuote,” said Zach Abrams, Managing Partner at Stratim Capital. “We focus on investments in market leading growth-stage companies and EverQuote’s market leading technology platform, customer analytics and experienced management team are perfect for the Stratim Growth Fund."
About EverQuote
