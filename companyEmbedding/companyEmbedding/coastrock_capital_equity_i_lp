PRESS RELEASE
NEW FUND LAUNCH
COASTROCK CAPITAL EQUITY
I, LP
 
January 1, 2016 10:00 AM Eastern Time
 
NEW
YORK, New York – January 1, 2016 – CoastRock Capital Management, LP announced
the launch of its first hedge fund offering – CoastRock Capital Equity I, LP. CoastRock’s
current investment program is a largely systematic and quantitatively driven
long/short equity strategy that focuses on maximizing risk adjusted returns
while remaining market neutral. The firm aims to generate additional alpha by
supplementing its long/short strategy with an options component for special situations
and during certain cycles of the calendar year. CoastRock actively manages both
portfolio and operational risk in several ways including risk budgeting and
hedging when appropriate. 
 
CoastRock,
founded by Peter Hamamji, began the development of its investment strategy in 2013
and is continuously creating and improving new and existing models. CoastRock’s
strategy focuses on leveraging software, data, and quantitative analysis to
attempt to predict future price movements of the stock market. Quantitative
models are developed in-house and range from fundamental and technical analysis
to machine-learning algorithms.
 
The manager is currently focusing on
generating a strong track record and expects to raise additional capital once
the fund completes its first year. While CoastRock has a limited track record, its
investment strategy and models have been thoroughly tested through several
market environments. Given the fund’s quantitative nature, a walk-forward
analysis was done to simulate the returns associated with the investment strategy.
The simulations suggest that the fund will meet its objective of producing large
expected returns that exhibit low beta and relatively low risk. Please see the fund’s
marketing materials for more information regarding the offering.

achieve any particular result. CoastRock Capital
Management, L.P., disclaims any duty to provide updates or changes to the
information contained in this press release. Past performance does not
necessarily indicate future results. This press release is not a legally
binding document nor does it serve as a substitute for the confidential private
