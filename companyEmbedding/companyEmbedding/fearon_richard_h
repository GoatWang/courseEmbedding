Leadership


Eaton Corporation plc Leadership Structure Our governance structure follows a successful leadership model under which the Chief Executive Officer of Eaton Corporation also serves as Chairman of the Board of the Company. Recognizing that different leadership models may work well for other companies at different times depending upon individual circumstances, we believe that our Company has been well served by the combined Chief Executive Officer and Chairman leadership structure, and that this approach has continued to be highly effective with the addition of a Lead Director. We believe we have greatly benefited from having a Chairman who sets the tone and direction for the Company while also having the primary responsibility as Chief Executive Officer for managing day-to-day operations of Eaton Corporation and its subsidiaries, and allowing the Board to carry out its strategic, governance, oversight and decision-making responsibilities with the equal involvement of each director.  Our Board is composed exclusively of independent directors, except for our Chairman, President and Chief Operating Officer and our Vice Chairman and Chief Financial and Planning Officer. Of our 11 non-employee directors, four are currently serving or have served as a chief executive officer of a publicly traded company. The Audit, Compensation and Organization, Finance and Governance Committees are all chaired by independent directors. Our Chairman has benefited from the extensive leadership experience represented on our Board of Directors.  The Board evaluates the leadership structure annually, and it will continue to do so as circumstances change, including when a new Chief Executive Officer is elected. In its February 2015 annual evaluation, the Board concluded that the current leadership structure — under which the Chief Executive Officer of Eaton Corporation serves as Chairman of the Board of the Company, our Board committees are chaired by independent directors, and a Lead Director assumes specific responsibilities on behalf of the independent directors — remains the optimal board leadership structure for our Company and our shareholders at the present time.  Lead Director — Ned C. Lautenbach, who has served on Eaton’s Board since 1997, was first elected Lead Director by our independent directors in 2010. The Lead Director has specific responsibilities, including chairing meetings of the Board at which the Chairman is not present (including Executive Sessions of the Board), approving the agenda and schedule for Board meetings on behalf of the independent directors, approving information sent to the Board, serving as liaison between the Chairman and the independent directors, and being available for consultation and direct communications with shareholders and other Company stakeholders. The Lead Director has the authority to call meetings of the independent directors, and to retain outside advisors who report directly to the Board of Directors. The Lead Director’s performance is assessed annually by the Board in a process led by the Chair of the Governance Committee, and the position of Lead Director is elected annually by our independent directors.

					RICHARD H. FEARON
				


This story was changed on Oct. 16 to correct the headquarters location of PolyOne Corp. and Mr. Fearon's chairmanship of a Hawken School committee.Richard Fearon is a busy guy. For one, he's not just CFO at Eaton, a giant manufacturer of products that regulate power. He also provides leadership for all sorts of functions at Eaton, ranging from accounting and information systems to internal auditing and investor relations. He plays a big role in the overall strategic planning process at Eaton.  That's no small task, especially these days: Eaton has acquired 60 companies since he was named executive vice president and chief financial and planning officer in 2002.  Mr. Fearon — who moved from executive vice president to vice chairman in January 2009 — has been “a key leader” in those deals, the nomination said. That includes the pending acquisition of electrical equipment supplier Cooper Industries plc of Dublin, Ireland, an $11.8 billion deal that when closed will be the largest acquisition in Eaton's 101-year history. The two companies had sales totaling $21.5 billion in 2011. He has developed an organization that “functions globally and is capable of handling multiple complex deals simultaneously,” the nomination said. He's always on the lookout to make sure acquisition targets are up to snuff. “Due to his nearly 30 years of international senior finance and strategic corporate development experience, Rick has been a key  adviser to the CEO and Board on key acquisitions that have contributed to Eaton's global growth,” the nomination said. “Rick works tirelessly to ensure each deal meets or exceeds all performance metrics,” the nomination continued. Mr. Fearon played a key part in helping Eaton get through the recession. He and the rest of the company's management team quickly cut costs and re-engineered some business processes when the economy went south, which helped Eaton maintain its profitability. They did so, however, while still investing in research and development, which they considered key to helping the company rebound from the recession. He does a lot of work outside of Eaton, too: He serves on the board of directors at PolyOne Corp. of Avon Lake and for several years has served on the Ohio Third Frontier Commission, which oversees a large economic development program designed to stimulate the state's economy through investments in technology.  In addition to other involvement, he's on the board of the Cleveland Museum of Art, the PlayhouseSquare Foundation and Hawken School. He's chairman of the  finance committee at the museum and PlayhouseSquare, and he chairs the investment committee at Hawken. Mr. Fearon also served as co-chairman of the 2007 Pacesetter Committee for the United Way of Greater Cleveland. “While Rick was honored with (CFO of the Year honors) in 2007, his accomplishments since then have continued to be stellar for Eaton, the nomination said. “Rick is a dedicated finance leader who, through his counsel and performance, has earned the respect and confidence of the Eaton Board of Directors and of company senior management.”

June 16, 2015 08:15 AM Eastern Daylight Time



DUBLIN--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The Board of Directors of power management company Eaton (NYSE:ETN) 
      today announced a number of senior leadership appointments in 
      anticipation of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Alexander M. 
      “Sandy” Cutler’s retirement at the end of May 2016. The appointments are 
      the result of the Board’s multi-year succession management process to 
      continue the evolution of Eaton’s strategy and performance capabilities 
      and to sustain the company’s values-based culture.
    


      Craig Arnold, 55, has been appointed president and chief operating 
      officer of Eaton and a member of the board of directors, effective Sept. 
      1, 2015. Arnold will be appointed chairman and chief executive officer 
      of Eaton on June 1, 2016. Cutler, who has been Eaton’s chairman and 
      chief executive officer since August 2000, will retire on May 31, 2016, 
      having reached Eaton’s mandatory CEO retirement age of 65.
    

      “Our entire board wishes to congratulate Craig on his promotion and to 
      thank Sandy for his ongoing outstanding leadership and strategic 
      vision,” said Ned C. Lautenbach, the lead director of Eaton’s board of 
      directors. “We have had the opportunity to work closely with Craig and 
      admire his keen intellect and impressive record of accomplishments.”
    

      Cutler added, “We are fortunate to have an extraordinary leader in Craig 
      Arnold, who has a rich history of experience and achievement at Eaton. 
      He is uniquely qualified to lead our company to continued success as a 
      global power management company.”
    

      Arnold has been vice chairman, president and chief operating officer of 
      the Industrial Sector since 2009, with additional leadership 
      responsibility for the Asia Pacific and Latin America regions. He joined 
      Eaton in 2000 as senior vice president and group executive of the Fluid 
      Power Group. Prior to that, Arnold held multiple senior leadership 
      positions with General Electric in the United States, Europe and Asia.
    

      Arnold has a master’s degree in business administration from Pepperdine 
      University and a bachelor’s degree from California State University. He 
      serves as a board member of Medtronic plc and several community 
      organizations, including University Hospitals of Cleveland and the 
      Salvation Army of Greater Cleveland. His prior board service includes 
      the boards of Unocal Corporation and Covidien plc.
    

      The Board also announced that Richard H. Fearon has been appointed a 
      member of Eaton’s board of directors, effective Sept. 1, 2015. He will 
      continue to serve as chief financial and planning officer, a position he 
      has held since 2002, and as vice chairman of Eaton.
    

      “Rick’s understanding of global financial markets and his close 
      connection to our shareholders and investors continue to serve Eaton 
      well,” Cutler said. “His strategic leadership and business development 
      expertise have been key to our transformation into a global power 
      management company.”
    

      Fearon has held senior leadership positions at Transamerica, NatSteel, 
      The Walt Disney Company and consulting firms Booz Allen Hamilton and the 
      Boston Consulting Group. Fearon has a master’s in business 
      administration from the Harvard Business School, a Juris Doctor from 
      Harvard Law School, and a bachelor’s degree in economics from Stanford 
      University. He also serves on the board of PolyOne Corp. and several 
      community organizations, including Playhouse Square and the Cleveland 
      Museum of Art.
    

      Eaton also announced that, in keeping with his long-time personal plans, 
      Thomas S. Gross, vice chairman, president and chief operating officer of 
      the Electrical Sector, will retire from the company Aug. 31, 2015.
    

      “Tom has done an extraordinary job leading our Electrical Sector and 
      integrating Cooper Industries, the largest acquisition in our history,” 
      Cutler said. “From his earliest assignment as our first vice president 
      of the Eaton Business System to his most recent assignment leading the 
      Electrical Sector and the EMEA region, Tom has been a force in 
      propelling Eaton’s growth. We wish him a long and healthy retirement.”
    

      Revathi Advaithi, currently president, Electrical Americas region, has 
      been appointed chief operating officer, Electrical Sector, succeeding 
      Gross, effective Sept. 1, 2015. She will also have corporate 
      responsibility for the EMEA region.
    

      Advaithi joined Eaton in 1995 as a manufacturing supervisor at the 
      Shawnee, Oklahoma facility and then held several roles in the United 
      States and Europe. She left Eaton in 2002 and rejoined the company in 
      2008 as vice president and general manager of the Electrical Components 
      Division and was later promoted to president of Eaton’s Electrical 
      Sector’s Asia Pacific region. She has a bachelor’s degree in mechanical 
      engineering from the Birla Institute of Technology and Science in 
      Pilani, India, and a master's in international business from Thunderbird 
      – Garvin School of International Business in Glendale, Arizona.
    

      Uday Yadav, currently president, Aerospace Group, has been appointed 
      chief operating officer, Industrial Sector, succeeding Arnold, effective 
      Sept. 1. He will also have corporate responsibility for the Asia Pacific 
      and Latin America regions.
    

      Yadav joined Eaton in 1994 and has served as executive vice president, 
      Eaton Business System, president of the Asia Pacific region for the 
      Eaton Hydraulics Group, and vice president, Supply Chain Management of 
      the Fluid Power Group, director and general manager of Eaton’s Global 
      Hose Division and local managing director for Eaton in India. Prior to 
      joining Eaton, Yadav worked with Lucas Engineering and Systems and 
      Aeroquip Vickers. Yadav holds a double degree with honors in engineering 
      and business from Nottingham Trent University in the United Kingdom.
    

      Cutler said, “I am enormously proud of our Eaton team and these 
      announcements reflect the outstanding breadth and depth of capability 
      that we have in our leadership team.”
    

      Eaton is a power management company with 2014 sales of $22.6 billion. 
      Eaton provides energy-efficient solutions that help our customers 
      effectively manage electrical, hydraulic and mechanical power more

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/23/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

As with all your investments through Fidelity, you must make your own determination whether an investment is appropriate for you.  Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.  Foreign securities are subject to interest-rate, currency-exchange-rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.  Illiquidity is an inherent risk associated with investing in real estate and REITs.  There is no guarantee the issuer of a REIT will maintain the secondary market for its shares and redemptions may be at a price which is more or less than the original price paid.  Closed-end funds can trade at a discount to their NAV.  Shareholders of Master Limited Partnerships may be treated as partners for tax purposes.  Partnerships issue a Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) rather than a Form 1099 form for tax purposes. It lists the partner's share of income, deductions, credits, etc.  Speak with your tax advisor to determine how this may affect you.  A royalty trust is a type of corporation, mostly in the United States or Canada, usually involved in oil and gas production or mining.  Royalty trusts may have special tax treatment, so you should consult a tax advisor on the potential tax consequences of investing in them.News, commentary and events are from third-party sources unaffiliated with Fidelity.
