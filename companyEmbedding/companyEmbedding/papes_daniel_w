Theodore Constantine Papes, Jr.

Monday, January 11, 2010
by Daniel W. Papes
Theodore Constantine Papes, Jr., 81, died peacefully in his sleep on January 8, 2010 .  He will be forever known as a loving husband, father, grandfather, philanthropist, and executive.






My father was the founding President and CEO of Prodigy Services Company, which began as a joint venture of IBM, Sears, and CBS in 1988.  He began his career as an IBM salesman in 1952, and ultimately became a Senior Vice-President and Group Executive, Director General of IBM Europe/Middle East/Africa and President of the Systems Product Division.  
Born in Gary, Indiana, “Ted” was the son of Theodore Constantine and Mary Di Paola Papes, immigrants from Greece and Italy, respectively.  Ted served in the U.S. Navy as an aviation electronics technician after graduating from Horace Mann High School in Gary. He then enrolled in his alma mater, the University of Michigan, on the GI Bill where he graduated Phi Beta Kappa in 1952 with a BA in economics.  He was an avid member of the Alpha Delta Phi fraternity and became Sports Editor for the “Michigan Daily.”  
His memory and legacy will be kept alive by his adored wife of 54 years, Centes Morrill Papes, his children Matthew (Deborah) Papes, Thaddeus (Valita) Papes, Daniel (Christina) Papes and Karin (Cyril) Cabral, ten grandchildren, and many dear friends.  Ted will be remembered as a compassionate leader, mentor, and coach.  His greatest loves were his wife Centes, his family, the Michigan Wolverines, his Catholic faith, photography, the Adirondack mountains, barbershop and choral singing, and fishing and skiing with his wife and children. 
Visitation will be at Beecher Funeral Home, (914) 769-0001, at 418 Bedford Road in Pleasantville, on Tuesday 2:00 - 4:00 p.m. and 7:00 - 9:00 p.m.  
The funeral service will be held at the Church of St. John and St. Mary, in Chappaqua, on Wednesday at 11:00 a.m. 
In lieu of flowers the family requests that donations be made to San Miguel Academy of Newburgh, 241 Liberty Street, Newburgh, NY 12550, The Boys and Girls Club of Northern Westchester, 351 Main Street, Mount Kisco, NY 10549 and The Northern Westchester Hospital Center, 400 East Main Street, Mt. Kisco, NY 10549.
