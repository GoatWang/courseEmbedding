 NASA Gemini 
Missions


The National Aeronautics and 
Space Administration announced December 7, 1961, a plan to extend the existing 
manned space flight program by development of a two-man spacecraft. The program 
was officially designated Gemini on January 3, 1962. It was named after the 
third constellation of the zodiac, featuring the twin stars Castor and Pollux. 
The program was operationally completed with the Gemini XII flight. The Gemini 
program was managed by the Manned Spacecraft Center, Houston, Texas, under 
direction of the Office of Manned Space Flight, NASA Headquarters, Washington, 
D.C, Dr. George E. Mueller, Associate Administrator of NASA for Manned Space 
Flight, served as acting director of the Gemini program. William C. Schneider, 
Deputy Director of Manned Space Flight for Mission Operations, served as Mission 
Director on all Gemini flights beginning with Gemini V. The Manned Spacecraft 
Center Gemini effort was headed by Dr. Robert R. Gilruth, director of the 
Center, and Charles W. Matthews, Gemini Program Manager. 

PROGRAM 
OBJECTIVES 
The Gemini Program was conceived 
after it became evident to NASA officials that an intermediate step was required 
between Project Mercury and the Apollo Program. The major objectives assigned to 
Gemini were: To subject two men and supporting equipment to long duration 
flights -- a requirement for projected later trips to the moon or deeper space. 
To effect rendezvous and docking with other orbiting vehicles, and to maneuver 
the docked vehicles in space, using the propulsion system of the target vehicle 
for such maneuvers. To perfect methods of reentry and landing the spacecraft at 
a pre-selected land-landing point. To gain additional information concerning the 
effects of weightlessness on crew members and to record the physiological 
reactions of crew members during long duration flights. A brief summary of the 
Gemini flight results reveals how successful the Gemini Program was. All of the 
major objectives were met as well as many other objectives assigned to each 
mission, with the exception of land landing which was canceled from the Gemini 
Program in 1964. However, the precision control necessary to achieve the land 
landing objective was demonstrated.
Gemini Goals

The second U.S. manned space program was announced in January 1962.
Its two-man crew gave it its name, Gemini, for the third constellation of the
Zodiac and its twin stars, Castor and Pollux. Gemini involved 12 flights,
including two unmanned flight tests of the equipment. Like Mercury's, its major 
objectives were clear-cut:

To subject man and equipment 
  to space flight up to two weeks in duration.
To rendezvous and dock with 
  orbiting vehicles and to maneuver the docked combination by using the target 
  vehicle's propulsion system;
To perfect methods of entering 
  the atmosphere and landing at a preselected point on land. Its goals were also 
  met, with the exception of a land landing, which was cancelled in 1964.

 
THE SPACECRAFT 


The spacecraft was an enlargement 
of the familiar Mercury capsule--5.8m (19 ft) long, 3m (10 ft) in diameter, and 
about 3810 kilograms (8400 pounds) in weight. Engineering changes simplified 
maintenance and made it more maneuverable for the pilots. The Titan II rocket, 
more powerful than the Redstone, placed the larger spacecraft into orbit. 
Sometimes referred to as Gemini-Titan for the craft and its launch vehicle, each 
flight was designated by a Roman numeral. Only the first capsule was nicknamed; 
Command Pilot Virgil Grissom called it the MOLLY BROWN in reference to his 
Mercury spacecraft that sank.

due to weather conditions and problems with loading cryogenic fuel for the fuel 
cell.


Orbit:
Altitude: 349.8 km
Inclination: 32.61 degrees
Orbits: 120
Duration: 7 Days, 22 hours, 55 min, 14 seconds
Distance: km
Landing:
August 29, 1965. Landing was at 29deg44min North and 69deg 45min West. Miss 
distance was 170.3km (92nm). Navy divers from the backup recovery ship USS 
DuPont (DD-941) recovered the crew and transfered them via helicopter to the USS 
Lake Champlain (crew onboard in 89 min).
Mission Highlights:
During the mission, problems developed with the fuel cell that precluded 
rendezvous with the radar evaluation pod (REP). Primary rendezvous G&N system 
with REP objective was not achieved. REP rendezvous was not attempted due to a 
decision to power down fuel cells.
Secondary objective to 
demonstrate controlled reentry guidance was not achieved due to incorrect 
navigation coordinates transmitted to the spacecraft computer from the ground. 
This caused an 89mile overshoot of the landing zone. Experiment D-2, Nearby 
Object Photography was not conducted when REP rendezvous was canceled.

experiments. Spacecraft weight: 3788kg. GATV-5003 Weight: 8097.
Launch:
March 16, 1966. 11:41:02.389. There was a one day delay in launching the 
spacecraft due to minor problems with the spacecraft and launch vehicle 
hardware.
Orbit:
Altitude: 298.7km (161.3 nm)
Inclination: 28.91 degrees
Orbits: 7
Duration: 0 Days, 10 hours, 41 min, 26 seconds
Distance: km
Landing:
March 17, 1966. Landing was at 25deg 13.8min North and 136deg 0min East. Pacific 
Ocean. Recovered by the USS Mason (crew onboard in 3 hours).
Mission Highlights:
Gemini-VIII successfully docked with Gemini Agena target vehicle GATV-6 hours 34 
min after liftoff. Because of problems with the spacecraft control system, the 
crew was forced to undock after approximately 30 min. The spacecraft-target 
vehicle combination had begun to encounter increasing yaw and roll rates. The 
crew regained control of their spacecraft by using the reentry control system, 
which prompted an early landing in a secondary landing area in the Pacific. No 
EVA was performed.
The failure was caused by an electrical short in control system. Docking and 
re-rendezvous secondary objectives were not achieved due to the shortened 
mission.
