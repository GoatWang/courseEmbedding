VERMYLEN--Paul Anthony, of Saddle River, NJ and Shoreham, NY, died peacefully on Saturday, October 31, 2015, at age 96.

At Georgetown University (1941), he excelled on the debate and tennis teams, graduated cum laude and most importantly, met Nancy Barr. His legal education at Columbia Law School was interrupted by WWII, during which he served as a combat infantry officer in North Africa and Italy. In 1946, he married Nancy Barr and began a 60 year career at his family's business, A. Zerega's Sons, Inc., the first pasta company in the United States, founded by his great-grandfather in 1848. During his career, he grew the business before transitioning it to the fifth and now sixth generations of family management. He was a Past Chairman of the Board of the National Pasta Association, President of the Upper Ridgewood Tennis Club, Saddle River Borough Councilman and active in many community organizations. Paul was a long-time parishioner of St. Gabriel's Church in Saddle River. Funeral services are being made through Feeney Funeral Home, Ridgewood, NJ. www.feeneyfuneral home.com.
