About Steven J. Tomesko
Senior Litigation Attorney
Hi, I am Steven Tomesko, a proud Central Florida resident for 15 years, a husband of 11 years and a very proud father of two boys. I have not always lived in the Sunshine State; I was born and raised in a small blue collar community, Pompton Lakes, New Jersey.
As a young man I learned a lot about hard work and the importance of helping people in need. I saw how trial lawyers helped people in need, taking cases to trial and from that moment forward, the law has been my passion.
Following graduation from high school and the University of Tampa, I entered St. Thomas University, School of Law, located in Miami, Florida. In my second year of law school, I received the high honor of being selected to serve on the St. Thomas Law School Law Review, where I served as The Notes and Comments Editor. In addition, I was also fortunate enough to be selected to study one semester of law in Rome, Italy, which was an amazing experience.
In 1996, following law school, I accepted a position with an insurance defense firm and began my career as a trial attorney. In 1998, I continued my practice as a trial attorney and accepted a position with Travelers Insurance Company. I proudly represented Travelers Insurance Company and their clients for over thirteen years as a trial attorney handling thousands of cases in both State and Federal court, predominately in the areas of car accident litigation, wrongful death litigation, tractor-trailer litigation, slip and fall litigation, product design and safety litigation and dangerous construction litigation. Most recently, before accepting a position with the Law Offices of Dan Newlin and Partners, I was nominated in October, and again in November, for outstanding success as a Travelers trial attorney. I was awarded the Bronze Medal in 2006 through 2010 from the Florida Supreme Court for pro bono work on behalf of the Orange County Legal Aide Society.
Today, I am proud to bring all of my experience and expertise to you! I am passionate, informative and relentless in my representation of all of my clients. If you should have any questions, please do not hesitate to email me directly.

Search results are sorted by a combination of factors to give you a set of choices in response to your search criteria. These factors are similar to those you might use to determine which business to select from a local Yellow Pages directory, including proximity to where you are searching, expertise in the specific services or products you need, and comprehensive business information to help evaluate a business's suitability for you. “Preferred” listings, or those with featured website buttons, indicate YP advertisers who directly provide information about their businesses to help consumers make more informed buying decisions. YP advertisers receive higher placement in the default ordering of search results and may appear in sponsored listings on the top, side, or bottom of the search results page.Sort:DefaultDefaultDistanceRatingName (A - Z)Sponsored LinksAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection1. Zucker, Steve J300 S Orange AveOrlando, FL 32801(407) 423-3200AttorneysAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection2. Knox Stephen J20 N Orange AveOrlando, FL 32801(407) 420-6953Civil Litigation & Trial Law AttorneysWebsiteServicesAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection3. Steven J.

Natasha, Oklahoma
Nursing Student
"My daughter recently went out for soccer. I decided it would be a good idea to run another player’s father through BeenVerified. Turns out this guy had been charged with indecent exposure and was on parole."


Maryann, New Jersey
Analyst
"I used BeenVerified to check into a guy that I had met online. It turns out he had lied to me about where he lived and his family. Needless to say, thanks to BV I severed contact with him and have not heard from him since. Thank you BV!"


Bob M, New Jersey
Retired Detective
"I am retired and have a ministry helping the dying and sick. I found a son and the mother was dying of cancer. She held on waiting for her son who had not been in touch for years."


Rhonda, Missouri
