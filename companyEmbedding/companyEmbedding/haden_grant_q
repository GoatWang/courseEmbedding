Obituary
Condolences

































 Grant Q. HadenGrant Q. Haden, beloved son, husband, brother, father and friend left home to join his Heavenly Father on Thanksgiving Day, November 24, 2016, surrounded by family. He was deeply loved by many and will be greatly missed by all.Grant was born in Ava, Missouri on May 7, 1954, to Quentin and Irmgard Haden. He completed his undergraduate education at Drury College, where he was a devoted Sigma Nu, and went on to study Law at UMKC. While a young lawyer he met and married CeCe Lumpe of Springfield, Missouri. Together they had three children. In 1990, he and his family moved to Springfield, where they have resided ever since. There, Grant practiced law for almost 25 years, the latter part of that time as a partner with Haden, Cowherd, and Bullock.Grant was a very accomplished lawyer, but his greatest pride and joy was his family and contributions to the community. He served as president of the Ozarks Trails Council of the Boy Scouts of America, as an elder at First and Calvary Presbyterian Church, and on the boards of Cox Hospital and Great Southern Bank.He loved the outdoors- floating and camping on the Buffalo River and Bryant Creek, spending time at Table Rock Lake with his family, and hunting and fishing with his sons. He approached everything in life with passion, love and persistence. His wisdom, faith, grace and love for his fellow man were qualities admired by many. Grant will be remembered as a great man, a devoted husband and father, a fiercely loyal friend, a wonderful speaker and storyteller, and an inspiration to all who knew him. He lived a full life; full of adoring family, cherished friends, and most importantly, full of love.He was preceded in death by his beloved parents, Quentin and Irmgard Haden, his uncle Carl Koch, and his father-in-law Jerry Lumpe.He is survived by CeCe, his loving wife of 35 years; son Jonathan, son Ben and his wife Lauren and their daughter June; daughter Emily; sister H. Haden Yelin, sister Mary Ann Haden and sister Carola Rayburn; as well as many loved nieces, and nephews.In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to the Ozarks Trails Council of the Boy Scouts of America, or the Cox Foundation.
