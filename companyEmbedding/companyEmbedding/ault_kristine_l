Consistent with their investment purpose, the Reporting Persons may, subject to applicable law and the terms of any confidentiality agreement with the Issuer, engage in communications regarding such matters with members of management and the Board of Directors of the Issuer, other current or prospective shareholders, industry analysts, existing or potential strategic partners or competitors, investment and financing professionals, sources of credit and other investors.

By way of example only, if the number of Preferred Shares owned by the Reporting Persons represents 20% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock and Preferred Shares (as determined on an as converted basis), the Reporting Persons shall, through their ownership of Preferred Shares, have the right to designate one director of a five member board. The Reporting Persons’ percentage to designate a number of directors shall be determined each time the Reporting Persons make a purchase of Preferred Shares and cannot be decreased unless the Reporting Persons convert or sell all or part of their Preferred Shares, in which case the number of directors that the Reporting Persons may designate will be re-calculated.
