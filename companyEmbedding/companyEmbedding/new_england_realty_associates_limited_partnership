Partnership Holdings
New England Realty Associates Limited Partnership ("NERA" or "the Partnership") and its 23 Subsidiary Partnerships ("the Subsidiary Partnerships"), headquartered in Allston, Massachusetts, are engaged in the business of acquiring, developing, holding for investment, operating, and selling residential and commercial real estate in the New England area. NERA has also made investments in other real estate partnerships and has participated in other real estate-related activities. To date, the partnership (and subsidary partnerships) own 2,269 apartments and 110,816 SF. of commercial space.

The General Partner ("General Partner") for NERA is NewReal, Inc., a corporation wholly owned by Harold Brown and Ronald Brown. Harold Brown and Ronald Brown are officers and directors of the General Partner. The Partnerships' properties are managed by The Hamilton Company, Inc. ("The Hamilton Company"), which is wholly owned by Harold Brown.
Ownership Philosophy
The long-term goals of the Partnership are to manage, rent and improve its properties and, as suitable opportunities arise, to acquire additional properties with income and capital appreciation potential. When appropriate, the Partnership may sell or refinance selected properties with low debt-to-equity ratios. Proceeds from any such sales or refinancing will be reinvested in acquisitions of other properties, distributed to the partners, or used for operating expenses or reserves, as determined by the General Partner. It has paid continuous and increasing dividends to the shareholders for 33 years.
Public Trading Market 
There are three classes of Partnership interests in NERA: Class A Partnership Units ("Class A Unit"), Class B Partnership Units ("Class B Units"), and General Partnership Units. In August 1987, NERA established a public trading market for the benefit of its Limited Partners and entered into a Deposit Agreement with The First National Bank of Boston as Depositary (Computershare Trust Company, N.A. is now the Depositary). Under this agreement, holders of Class A Units may exchange their Class A Units for Depositary Receipts ("Receipts"). The Class B Units and General Partnership Units are not publicly traded, and are 100% owned by the General Partner. There are 1,301,700 Class A & B Units issued and outstanding.

The Receipts, each representing one-tenth of a Class A Unit, are listed on The NYSE Amex Exchange (AMEX®) System under the symbol NEN. Receipts may be purchased and sold at any time through a personal securities broker and Computershare. The Receipts, unlike the Class B and General Partnership Units, are freely transferable, except as restricted by the Partnership Agreement and the Deposit Agreement.

Zacks Rank:



 




Style Scores:



NA Value | NA Growth | NA Momentum | NA VGM                


The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.


Value Score
A


Growth Score
A


Momentum Score
A


VGM Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
