PRESS RELEASE
Sankaty Advisors, LLC, the independently managed credit affiliate of Bain Capital, today announced the signing of a definitive agreement to acquire a portfolio of loans and other securities from J.P. Morgan’s Global Special Opportunities Group. The portfolio contains mezzanine loans in North America and Europe, as well as loans and related special situations investments in Australia and across Asia, with an aggregate value of approximately $1.3 billion.
This acquisition follows Sankaty Advisors’ other recent purchases of loan portfolios from Irish Bank Resolution Capital, Lloyds Banking Group and CapitalSource.
“This is another attractive addition to our platform as we continue to identify portfolios around the world where we can be a provider of patient capital and a helpful, value-added lender to and investor in high quality companies,” said Jonathan S. Lavine, Managing Partner and Chief Investment Officer of Sankaty Advisors. “We are continuing to see significant opportunities to invest by leveraging the skills of our global credit team to diligence portfolios by geography, by industry and by borrower resulting in a diverse array of investment opportunities.”
“We are confident Sankaty Advisors will be a good steward of these assets as Sankaty has a successful track record of acquiring global investment portfolios and acting as partners to borrowers,” said Chris Nicholas, head of J.P. Morgan’s Global Special Opportunities Group. “Their global reach, scale, reputation and track record were important attributes as we evaluated potential buyers.”
The transaction, which is expected to close by the end of 2014, is subject to borrower and regulatory approvals. Kirkland & Ellis, LLP served as legal counsel to Sankaty Advisors. J.P. Morgan advised on the sale and Davis Polk & Wardwell, LLP served as legal counsel to JPMorgan Chase.
This transaction is not expected to have a material impact on JPMorgan Chase’s earnings.

Sankaty Advisors Acquires J.P. Morgan's Global Special Opportunities Group Investment Portfolio
BOSTON - July 28, 2014 - Sankaty Advisors, LLC, the independently managed credit affiliate of Bain Capital, today announced the signing of a definitive agreement to acquire a portfolio of loans and other securities from J.P. Morgan's Global Special Opportunities Group. The portfolio contains mezzanine loans in North America and Europe, as well as loans and related special situations investments in Australia and across Asia, with an aggregate value of approximately $1.3 billion.
This acquisition follows Sankaty Advisors' other recent purchases of loan portfolios from Irish Bank Resolution Capital, Lloyds Banking Group and CapitalSource. 
"This is another attractive addition to our platform as we continue to identify portfolios around the world where we can be a provider of patient capital and a helpful, value-added lender to and investor in high quality companies," said Jonathan S. Lavine, Managing Partner and Chief Investment Officer of Sankaty Advisors. "We are continuing to see significant opportunities to invest by leveraging the skills of our global credit team to diligence portfolios by geography, by industry and by borrower resulting in a diverse array of investment opportunities." 
"We are confident Sankaty Advisors will be a good steward of these assets as Sankaty has a successful track record of acquiring global investment portfolios and acting as partners to borrowers," said Chris Nicholas, head of J.P. Morgan's Global Special Opportunities Group. "Their global reach, scale, reputation and track record were important attributes as we evaluated potential buyers." 
The transaction, which is expected to close by the end of 2014, is subject to borrower and regulatory approvals. Kirkland & Ellis, LLP served as legal counsel to Sankaty Advisors. J.P. Morgan advised on the sale and Davis Polk & Wardwell, LLP served as legal counsel to JPMorgan Chase. 
This transaction is not expected to have a material impact on JPMorgan Chase's earnings.
