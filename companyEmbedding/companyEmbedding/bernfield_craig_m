The worst thing about Aviv REIT chairman and CEO Craig Bernfield is he's a Cubs fan. (Just kidding, we are too.) That discipline, perseverance, and incredible resolve have translated into a hugely successful 24 years investing in healthcare real estate. (104 years for the Cubbies and still waiting.)
After U of I undergrad, UChicago law, and a stint in real estate law, Craig jumped onto the business side with Aviv co-founder Zev Karkomi in the late '80s. The focus: investing in NNN-leased skilled nursing facilities. Over decades, Aviv has consolidated and built solid relationships with operators. Big moves leading up to this year's IPO: a rollup of predecessor businesses in '05, creating a platform to raise capital; holding off on an offering in '09 because business was booming and the market was murky; raising nearly $400M in '10-'12 (from a private equity sponsor) to continue growth; then putting feelers back out last year after a growth spurt. (You have to make the house look presentable before you have guests.)
Aviv's now been public for almost 17 weeks (its stock is up over 25% since the IPO). Current portfolio: 262 properties leased to 36 different operators in 29 states, including eight in Illinois. Skilled nursing facilities continue to be a fragmented space for public REITs (about 10% of the $100B market is publicly owned, meaning REITs wouldn't bump into each other while buying up the 14,000 remaining facilities). While healthcare reform headlines sound ominous, Craig tells us skilled nursing facilities' need-driven, low-cost nature put them on the right side of the solution—not to mention 65-plus and 85-plus populations are growing quicker than you can say "When I was your age..."
We snapped Craig with CFO Jim Lyman, managing director David Smith, and president Steve Insoft. One trend: hospitals discharging someone to a skilled nursing facility for short-term rehab. And the government continues to provide funding for care of the elderly; Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements are up by an annual compounded growth rate of 4% over the last 10 years, Craig says. Healthcare will continue to be more local in delivery, and with cost and quality as primary drivers, these cycle-impervious facilities stand to benefit. Aviv's acquired over $550M of property in the past five years and reinvests over time to ensure top-notch facilities (including many they bought back in the '80s, when they had radically different haircuts and said "radical" more often).
Craig's post-IPO life is certainly more public, including speaking engagements like REIT Week and Mad Money with Jim Cramer. Craig in three words: family, sports, business. He'll never get a Facebook page, he loves to laugh, and you might hear him quote cult classics like Office Space in a staff meeting. Fingers crossed he'll soon be laughing at all the Cubs haters who said we didn't have another one in us.






Fundraising's Fierce Competition

The capital markets are the lifeblood of commercial real estate, and all players involved (Bisnow included) are watching them for signs of this recovery's trajectory. We're holding an Investment Summit on July 25 to hear from leading experts on lending and raising capital, including Incubation Capital Partners managing principal Jonathan Glick. Incucap is a capital raising platform and merchant bank focused on global, entrepreneurial investment managers—and raising capital is marathon these days, not a sprint (Jonathan demonstrates above in his best Forrest Gump impression). Breaking into the private equity fund business is harder than ever, he says, meaning investment managers willing to think creatively about alternative structures and sources of capital are more likely to succeed in raising funds.






DRESL Weekly Roundup

Can you believe the regular season ends next week? DRESL's playoff picture is taking shape and there could be a war out there as three teams duke it out for that last playoff spot. Here's what happened last week:
Field 1 (early game): JLL #1 6, DTZ 3
With veteran future Hall-of-Famer Michael Burns on the hill for JLL #1, all they needed was Josh Vervack at short and Phil Geiger at first. They held the suddenly punchless DTZers to their second game scoring four runs or less.
Field 1: Klein's Corporate 14, Golub 4
Klein's pounded lumps on the Dolls, with the first eight hitters reaching home safely and ending with 11 runs in the 1st. Big guns for Klein's included Johnny "Cocktail" Gaines going a clutch 4-4, scoring two runs and a ribbie.
Field 2: Mid-America 11, JF McKinney 5
The retailers took advantage of JFM being short five starters, suffering on defense. Mid-Am put runs across in each of the first few innings and kept JFM from a big inning by playing great D, including the somersaulting Steve Ansani in center field.
Field 3: Colliers 4, MB Real Estate 3
Jordan Kaufman, on the hill for Colliers, kept MB off balance all game but MB had a secret weapon all their own in Jeff Laski tossing BBs at Colliers' big hitters. Colliers knotted it up in the 4th and a three-base error by MB allowed a walk-off victory.
Field 4: Cushman & Wakefield 9, Bradford Allen 2
CW ran its winning streak to seven, dominating the BA boys. Rob Becker and Brett Abrams each went 3-3 for C&W, but it was the defense of Matt Cowie, Jeff Skender, and John Kinsella that kept BA at bay.
Field 5: Inland 12, JLL #2 8
Inland scorched JLL #2 with nine runs in the first two innings, with Dave Tombers and Jeff Anderson swinging the heavy lumber, each going 3-3. JLL #2 mounted a spirited comeback but fell short, leaving the bases loaded in the bottom of the 7th.
Field 6: CTK Chicago Partners 6, Tishman Speyer 5
Great pitching and defense held up through regulation and extended into the 8th. Bright spots for TSP were Ian Goldberg's long distance shot and Jack Wold on the hill, following in Casey's footsteps. TSP needs a miracle to make the playoffs.
Field 7: CBRE 17, Transwestern 2
Mark "Flo Motion" Floersch hit a three-run bomb and Paul "The Razor" Reaumond had a bases-loaded triple to highlight CBRE's hitting attack. Transwestern hired Theo Epstein to explain the rebuilding effort needed to get them back on track.






Ice-Cold Logic

This one stumped a bunch of you. Does ice melting in a glass of water add to the amount of water, decrease it, or remain unchanged? Freeborn & Peters' Ian Turvill was the first to correctly respond that the water will remain unchanged. Not following? He'll break it down for you. "Before the ice melts, it displaces its own weight in water—this is based on Archimedes' Principle of Buoyancy. Thus, when the ice cube does melt, and it is converted into water, it takes up the space of an equivalent weight of water, and therefore the water level neither increases nor decreases." Congrats to Ian, who'll be attending Bisnow's Schmoozapalooza gratis on July 31.
A man leaves home, turns left three times, then returns home and there's another man with a mask on. What does he do? The first person to email marissa.oberlander@bisnow.com with the correct answer wins a free ticket to our Investment Summit!
