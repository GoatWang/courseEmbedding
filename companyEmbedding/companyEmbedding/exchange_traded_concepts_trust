Exchange Traded Concepts, US Bancorp In Deal 

February 22, 2012 




 
Alex Ulam 





 



  



Exchange Traded Concepts takes its 'ETF in a Box' concept to a whole new level.

 

Exchange Traded Concepts (ETC), the firm that puts ETFs into registration for third parties, has gained access to mutual fund companies interested in bringing ETFs to market through an agreement with U.S. Bancorp that could represent a quantum leap in potential business development for ETC.
The ETC-U.S. Bancorp partnership involves the creation of a new “multiple series trust” that will enable mutual fund clients, hedge fund clients, and registered investment advisors that already offer funds and investments through U.S. Bancorp to begin offering ETFs as well. The new trust’s name, ETF Series Solutions, is already on a filing to market three funds under the new arrangement.
ETC already has its own multiple series trust, or MST, the Exchange Traded Concepts Trust, under which a number of ETFs have been registered. But the new MST, by virtue of the partnership with U.S Bancorp and the bank’s association with more than $500 billion in mutual fund assets, is a totally different animal.
“This is a big game changer for us and the industry,” ETC Chief Executive Officer Garrett Stevens said in a telephone interview. “This is the first fund service provider to launch their own ETF multiple series trust,” Stevens said.
Again, the basic service ETC is offering is the same one it already offers individual investment managers that want to bring ETFs to market; namely, the marketing to third parties of its regulatory right to market ETFs. But the new MST will allow companies that want to launch their own ETFs do so in a more cost-effective manner by sharing a whole range of costs, such as trust level insurance and board expenses. 
“U.S. Bancorp is focused on the servicing of the product, ETC brings their exemptive relief and their advisory services,” Bob Kern, director of business development at U.S. Bancorp, said in a telephone interview. He said his company hasn’t filed for exemptive relief and stressed that using ETC’s relief is an efficient way to bring ETFs to market.
Stevens at ETC said that the multiple series MST model should appeal to niche funds that want to lower their overhead on specialty products such as hedge fund ETFs.
“The typical customer is not going to want to launch a competitor to an iShares or an SPDR ultra-low-cost product,” Stevens said.
Getting Into ETFs, Quickly
It’s useful to think of ETC’s original line of business as angling with single fishing poles, snagging clients fund by fund, whereas the U.S. Bancorp partnership is akin to the company baiting countless hooks on a long line that ETC is then dropping into waters teeming with fish.
The fact that ETC was able to snag such a big partner speaks to the growing importance of ETFs in the U.S. money-management industry, as well as a trend in ETF industry towards lowering costs, including expense ratios.
In short, it’s become amply clear that more and more asset and investment managers want into the ETF industry before the market becomes saturated.
Total U.S. ETF assets are fast-approaching $1.2 trillion, and if the $28 billion that flowed into U.S.-listed ETFs in January is any indication about how the rest of the year will shake out, last year’s asset gathering of $119 billion will easily be eclipsed in 2012.
While large and storied mutual fund firms such as Fidelity, Alliance Bernstein, Janus and Dreyfus are lining up to win “exemptive relief” at the Securities and Exchange Commission, it appears that a company such as Milwaukee-based U.S. Bancorp has chosen to offer its mutual fund partners a shortcut to offer ETFs.
 

 
Indeed, while gaining the exemptive relief at the SEC necessary to marketing ETFs can take from one to three years and cost upwards of a million dollars, Oklahoma City-based ETC claims it can bring an ETF to market for a client in about 75 days.
Stevens said that his company is in negotiations with other companies interested in joining the ESS Trust, but that it would take about 90 days before they are able to add any more funds.
“It’s been a trend in the open-end space—many, many managers are looking to that structure, Kern of U.S. Bancorp said, referring to MSTs. “They want to manage the assets, not deal with all the administrative infrastructure,” he said.
The First Three Funds
The first three funds that ETC put into registration using the new trust on Feb. 17 are:

AlphaClone Alternative Alpha ETF, a hedge fund replication strategy that will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange’s electronic trading platform with the trading symbol “ALFA.” ETC will serve as investment manager of the fund, while AlphaClone LLC will provide the AlphaClone Hedge Fund Long/Short Index on which ALFA will be based. The fund will have an annual expense ratio of 0.95 percent
Zacks Sustainable Dividend ETF, a fund targeting 100 U.S. companies that pay dividends at least annually. It will be listed on the Nasdaq under the ticker “ZDIV.” ETC will be the investment advisor, and Zacks, a financial research firm, will provide the Zacks Sustainable Dividend Index on which the ETF will be based. It will come with an annual expense ratio of 0.70 percent.
Zacks MLP ETF, a fund targeting 25-50 U.S.-listed master limited partnerships that will be listed on the Nasdaq with the symbol “ZMLP.” ETC will serve as investment advisor, and Zacks will provide the Zack MLP Index on which the ETF will be based. ZMLP will come with an annual expense ratio of 0.75 percent.

 
Using the ETF Series Solutions multiple series trust with ETC, U.S. Bancorp will provide fund accounting and regulatory administration as well as distribution services through its Quasar Distributors unit.
Each fund brought to market will be responsible for “fund-specific expenses,” U.S. Bancorp said in a press release.
ETC is rumored to charge a flat fee for bringing an ETF to market, and also draws a small ongoing annual fee that is a function of assets under management.
It calls its service “ETF In a Box.”

Exchange Traded Concepts Trust(NASDAQ:ROBO): The Future Is Now | ETF Daily News

































 






























































Why All Investors Should Have Some Robotics Exposure


 April 5, 2017 7:57am  NASDAQ:ROBO  



 




From Tony Sagami: I’m showing my age, but one of my favorite TV shows during my youth was Lost in Space. I was particularly fond of the robot, which would regularly shout out warning phrases such as this favorite, “Danger, Will Robinson!”




I’ll admit I also had a huge crush on Judy Robinson, played by Norway-born Marta Kristen. But that’s beside the point.
My point is that robots may have been futuristic science fiction in the 1960s, but they are rapidly becoming a crucial member in global commerce and manufacturing.
In fact, robots are about to take an even more prominent role in our everyday lives. How so?
“With government driving up the cost of labor, it’s driving down the number of jobs. You’re going to see automation not just in airports and grocery stores, but in restaurants.”
-Greg Creed, CEO of Yum Brands
Nineteen states — including California, New York, Washington, Massachusetts and Arizona — have recently raised their minimum wage to as high as $11.50 per hour.

As a result, businesses are replacing human labor with machines to reduce labor costs.

Wendy’s says it will install self-serve ordering kiosks in 1,000 of its restaurants by the end of this year.


About 50% of Panera Bread’s company-owned stores are already equipped with automated ordering kiosks. And the remaining locations expect to have kiosks in place by the end of the year. McDonald’s is rolling out an army of “Create Your Taste” touchscreen kiosks.


Andy Puzder, CEO of Hardee’s and Carl’s Jr., said that robots are “always polite, they always upsell, they never take a vacation, they never show up late, there’s never a slip-and-fall, or an age, sex, or race discrimination case.”
Indeed, automation — including robots — is going to affect a lot more than just your hamburgers and French fries.
Last week, BlackRock, the largest global investment management firm in the world, announced it will increase its reliance on computers to pick stocks. The firm will combine its traditional analysis with computerized stock selection.
As a result, BlackRock will lay off 40 employees, including some portfolio managers!
The biggest market for robotics is manufacturing. According to the International Federation of Robotics, unit sales of industrial robots grew 15% in 2015, while revenues increased 9% to $11 billion. In just North America alone, robotic sales increased by 14% to $1.8 billion.

But that’s just the tip of the iceberg. Barclays Bank predicts that robotic sales will increase by more than 1,000% between now and 2020 and that the value of that market will hit $82 billion!
So if you’re really serious about keeping up with the robotic industry, you should regularly visit the International Federation of Robotics (IFR); especially during the last month of each quarter (March, June, September, and December) when the IFR releases its President’s Report.

How can you invest in robotics? The biggest players include ABB Ltd. (ABB), Fanuc Corp. (FANUY), iRobot Corp. (IRBT), Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd. (KWHIY), Rockwell Automation Inc. (ROK), and KUKA AG (KU2.DE).
Fanuc, for example, is the world’s largest maker of industrial robots. And chances are you own a product built by one of its machines. Fanuc robots build cars for Ford and Tesla and even parts of Apple iPhones.
Bottom line: Robotics may be one of the most profitable places to invest your money. And any investor who overlooks this dynamic industry will be sorry.
However, that doesn’t mean you should rush out and invest in them tomorrow morning. As always, timing is everything.
The ROBO Global Robotics and Automation Index ETF (NASDAQ:ROBO) was unchanged in premarket trading Wednesday. Year-to-date, ROBO has gained 11.38%, versus a 5.35% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.
ROBO currently has an ETF Daily News SMART Grade of A (Strong Buy), and is ranked #20 of 54 ETFs in the Technology Equities ETFs category.

Future-Proof Your Portfolio With This Robotics-Focused ETF


 March 1, 2017 9:02am  NASDAQ:ROBO  



 




From Grant Wasylik: The 1989 movie “Back to the Future Part II” predicted we would have personal drones, mobile payment technology, hands-free gaming consoles, video phones and hoverboards by 2015.




Since then, we’ve undergone a revolution in robotics and automation.
We’re sure that Marty McFly and Doc Brown would be proud: Each of these predictions has come true.
But, robotics and automation started way before 1989.
Recently, the robotics industry celebrated its 50-year anniversary. We have used robots for over five decades to empower people to do things that are typically dirty, dull or dangerous.






This week, Boston Dynamics unveiled ‘Handle.’ This 6.5-foot hybrid robot has two wheels and four legs. It can jump 4 feet vertically, travel at 9 mph and lift 100 pounds.



You might remember just a few of the many advances in robotics over the past 50-some years …
The world’s first industrial robot went to work on a General Motors assembly line in 1961 …
The Sojourner Rover, a robot on wheels, explored Mars and snapped 550 photos over a three-month period in 1993 …
IBM’s Deep Blue supercomputer beat Gary Kasparov in a chess match in 1997. (The first time a machine beat a grand champion chess player.) …
Honda launched its humanoid robot ASIMO that stood, walked and ran like a human in 2000 …
And in 2006, a robot surgeon performed an unassisted, 50-minute surgical procedure on a 34-year-old man’s heart.
Through the gradual availability of inexpensive computing, user interfaces and sensors, it is now possible to build robot systems that were unimaginable before.
For example, check out some more recent robotics milestones (2011- ‘16):
  2011: Siri is introduced as a built-in feature for the Apple iPhone. This “intelligent assistant” enables users to speak natural-language voice commands to operate their mobile device and its apps.
  2012: The Nevada DMV issues its first license for a robotic, self-driven car. (A Toyota Prius with technology developed by Google.)
  2013: A 3-finger robotic arm rings the Nasdaq closing bell. (The first time a non-human conducted the task.)
  2015: International Federation of Robotics reports record-breaking sales of 240,000 industrial robots.
  2016: 7-Eleven, Just Eat, Amazon and UPS deliver packages by drone.
We have seen tremendous progress in robot technology across manufacturing, healthcare applications, autonomous cars and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).
But, we also observed technological improvements in camera systems, communication systems, displays and basic computing.
Robotic technology is currently being deployed in these expanding fields:

Recent developments in robotics, artificial intelligence and machine learning have put us on the cusp of a new automation age.
Robotics is a key transformative technology that can revolutionize manufacturing. American workers no longer aspire to low-level factory jobs, and the cost of U.S. workers has been slowly rising due to insurance and healthcare costs.
Even when workers are affordable, they are still human. That means they have limitations when it comes to adaptability, precision and reliability.
This can be problematic for companies that keep dreaming up the next generations of miniaturized, complex products.
Many of these products will only have a short life-cycle. But they will serve as the stepping stone to those “products of the future” that are coming to the present day sooner than many think.
As William Studebaker, president and CIO of ROBO Global, told me:
“The next manufacturing revolution is here and it’s being driven by robotics and automation. Robotics touches all industries and has the ability to be as transformative as the internet. It is a foundational technology being applied to all industries, all markets and all geographies. And it is happening now!
We’re in a situation right now where robotics and automation are going to be as ubiquitous as computers. Basically, we’re in the first inning of a baseball game where the team is still in the locker room putting on their cleats.
Investors need to “Future-Proof” their portfolios to position themselves for this Mega Trend.”
Chances are, most investors aren’t positioned for the rising integration and demand for robotics in various industries. For example, the ROBO Global U.S. Index has just 1.78% overlap with the S&P 500 Index and only 1.80% overlap with the MSCI World Index.
Investors miss out on mega-trends like this because they want to call them “niches.” Biotech was once a niche … the internet was once a niche … cyber security was once a niche … and so on.
Everything that’s new is considered a niche. The easy answer is to just dismiss it.
Amateur and professional investors are constantly chasing the stuff that everyone else owns. This follow-the-herd mentality results in a lot of overcrowding. That’s precisely why it doesn’t work.
The magic bullet in investing is to get there before everyone else.
One easy way to attain diversified exposure to global companies engaged in the business of robotics-related or automation-related industries is the ROBO Global Robotics & Automation Index ETF (ROBO).
The team at ROBO Global is credited with as the first group to define the robotics universe. Before their team did it, no one else had.
Related story: Remember that 2013 milestone we listed earlier, with a robotic arm ringing the Nasdaq’s closing bell? This was done to celebrate ROBO’s launch!
The team that created — and makes modifications to — the leading benchmark for robotics has an all-star line-up. Aside from the management team at ROBO Global, the following experts are advisers to the index committee:

The full committee took the better part of a year to scrub data and put together the ROBO Global U.S. Index. The index launched about four years ago. Its debut was untimely with a 3D printing sell-off, collapse in oil prices and negative currency headwinds. So, performance was lackluster in the early going.
However, despite all those events, the index has generated a positive return.
And recently, it’s caught solid momentum.
Last year, the ROBO Global U.S. Index returned +18.78%, while the S&P 500 Index returned +11.96%.
And this year, through almost two months, ROBO is up +10.09% vs. the SPY’s (SPDR S&P 500 ETF) +5.91%.

The index — and corresponding ETF — provides access to robotics and automation companies through 13 sub-sectors that fall under either technology or applications.
 Technology captures companies that enable robots to sense, process, actuate, compute and integrate.
  And applications highlight companies that incorporate multiple robotic and automation technologies into their product or manufacturing process to improve efficiency.
This results in holdings from manufacturing, 3D printing, logistics automation, agriculture, security surveillance, energy, healthcare and consumer products.







According to ROBO Global’s index methodology:
The index is made up of “bellwether” (40%) and “non-bellwether” (60%) companies. Bellwether companies (BWs) are well-established leading players, whose core business is directly related to robotics & automation. Non-bellwether companies (NBWs) have a distinct portion of their business and revenue in robotics & automation and have the potential to grow through innovation and/or market adoption of their products and/or services.
Within BW and NBW each constituent is equally weighted. The 40/60 weighting results in each BW having roughly twice the weight of each NBW.
At each quarterly rebalance the Index constituents are reweighted and any additions or deletions are made as determined by the Advisory Index Committee at ROBO Global.
Here are ROBO’s top 10 holdings:

The growth curve for robotics and automation looks to be massive:

In closing, Studebaker articulated:
“ROBO Global is steadfast in our belief that were in the early days of a disruptive and transformational change brought about by robotics. We’d encourage investors to do their own due diligence on this industry and begin to position themselves for the expected growth.”
ROBO Global has mindfully created this globally diversified exposure for the average investor. It’s clear that the ROBO ETF is the best risk-averse way to play the robotics trend.
