Dan Burns
Chief Executive Officer

In this role he is responsible for the development and implementation of high-level strategies and direction of the company’s growth. Being able to provide clear insight into navigating the complex information security landscape is a priority for Burns. His philosophy is to focus on building long-term relationships with clients, working with them to simplify their lives and becoming a trusted information security partner rather than a reseller or outside consultant.
From 2002 when he co-founded Accuvant, until 2012 when he assumed his position as the company’s first CEO, Burns served as senior vice president of Accuvant’s sales organization. In that role, he was responsible for strategic planning, sales growth and problem resolution. Burns co-developed and helped to successfully execute on Accuvant’s initial vision – to build a company with the breadth, depth and capabilities to address the information security needs of organizations worldwide. He launched the sales force and grew it to a national powerhouse organization within a 10-year period, conducting business with nearly half of the Fortune 500, and driving $740 million in revenue in 2014.
Prior to his achievements with Accuvant, Burns was the regional vice president of sales for the western region of OneSecure. He played an integral role in transitioning the organization from a managed security services (MSS) provider to a product company, delivering to the marketplace the first intrusion prevention system (IPS) and generating $40 million in product sales in the first year.
Previously, as the western region vice president for Exault, an integrator, consulting organization and reseller, Burns secured some of the largest enterprise clients in the Rocky Mountain region and helped grow revenues to nearly $150 million in two years. He also held positions at Access Graphics, Arrowpoint, and Netrex where he supported some of the largest telecommunication companies in building their information security programs, implementing technology and taking advantage of Netrex’s world-class MSS.
Burns earned a bachelor’s degree in economics from San Jose State University.

History[edit]
On November 5, 2014, security firms Accuvant and FishNet Security announced that they would join forces to create a new, yet to be named company.[1] The merger would create a roughly $1.5 billion information security giant with solutions covering nearly every aspect of cyberdefense.[2]
The merger was completed on February 2, 2015 when the company announced that the previously announced transaction had closed.[3] The new company was owned primarily by the Blackstone Group, a private equity firm that acquired a majority stake of Accuvant in March 2014.[4]
On April 21, 2015, Accuvant and FishNet Security announced plans to launch their new, combined corporate name and brand, and to begin conducting business as Optiv Security in summer 2015.[5]
During the Black Hat USA 2015 conference, on August 5, 2015 Accuvant and FishNet Security announced that it had completed its transformation merger and was now conducting business as Optiv Security.[6] It also launched its new brand at the conference.
On February 1, 2017, Optiv announced that it was acquired by the global investment firm KKR.[7]

Optiv Security Hires Industry Veterans to Expand Offerings; Help 
      Clients Better Achieve Measurable Results




-- Former Leaders from PwC, Symantec, Dell SecureWorks and the 
      Department of Defense to Spearhead Optiv’s Partner Solutions and 
      Security Services Teams --






June 13, 2017 11:16 AM Eastern Daylight Time



DENVER--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Optiv 
      Security, a market-leading provider of end-to-end cyber security 
      solutions, today announced the appointment of three industry veterans to 
      lead its partner solutions, risk and compliance services, and managed 
      security services (MSS) functions. These moves further Optiv’s larger 
      strategy of providing organizations with holistic cyber security 
      solutions comprised of the right products and services to achieve 
      measurable results.
    


      Anirban (Oni) Chakravartti joins Optiv as senior vice president of 
      worldwide partner solutions; Michael Lines will serve as vice president 
      of strategy, risk and compliance advisory services; and Doug Steelman 
      will be vice president of MSS. These new leaders bring extensive 
      business management, cyber security and threat intelligence expertise 
      and experience working in the public and private sectors. The hires 
      follow the recent addition of David Castignola, who was appointed 
      executive vice president of worldwide sales in April.
    

      “We are experiencing a rapid acceleration of organizations looking to 
      partner with one solution provider that has the ability to address the 
      full spectrum of security challenges,” said Tim Hoffman, executive vice 
      president of worldwide partner solutions for Optiv. “Optiv has a 
      seasoned, dedicated team of experts delivering a comprehensive suite of 
      cyber security services and solutions to meet the ever-changing needs of 
      organizations. We are thrilled to have Oni, Michael and Doug bring their 
      exceptional expertise and experience that will enable Optiv to better 
      serve our clients around the world.”
    

      Chakravartti is a visionary and analytical thinker with strong 
      operational leadership and a track record for building high performance 
      teams. As a member of Optiv’s executive leadership team, he leads the 
      strategy, development and management of Optiv’s partnerships with 
      leading security technology manufacturers. His charter also entails 
      Optiv’s network to include leading technology providers in key areas 
      such as cloud. Prior to joining the company, he was global head of 
      strategic partners for Symantec, where he was responsible for defining 
      and driving strategic partner business for the company worldwide. He 
      drove double digit growth with key partners during this period and 
      scaled business with net new wins globally. Chakravartti also served in 
      various sales leadership, marketing and business development roles at 
      Cisco, AMD and HP/Compaq. During his 20-year career, he managed channel 
      partners and various business units on a global scale and was 
      instrumental in launching major brands and products with AMD and HP 
      worldwide.
    

      Lines is a highly skilled business executive with more than 40 years of 
      security and technology industry experience. He is responsible for 
      leading Optiv’s security experts in helping clients develop and run the 
      security programs that meet their business, risk and compliance needs. 
      Before joining Optiv, Lines held numerous executive roles with leading 
      technology and internet companies, most recently chief information 
      security officer for D+H, where he created new corporate departments for 
      corporate security policy and risk, threat intelligence, incident 
      response and security architecture. Prior to that, he was the global 
      chief information security officer at PwC, where he was part of the 
      company’s information risk and review committee, and evaluated global 
      technology initiatives for information security, privacy and 
      legal/regulatory risks. He also served as chief security officer for 
      TransUnion, chief information security officer for Fair Isaac Corp. and 
      chief information officer for Narex Corp. Lines also founded and led a 
      popular web services portal for project managers, which he later sold to 
      the International Institute of Learning, Inc.
    

      Steelman brings to Optiv more than 26 years of MSS and threat analysis 
      experience working in the public and private sectors. At Optiv, he will 
      play a key role in driving the strategy and expansion of the company’s 
      MSS capabilities and offerings and will manage and oversee the MSS 
      organization, operations and delivery. Steelman previously spent five 
      years as chief security officer at Dell SecureWorks. He served as the 
      cyber command director of the Department of Defense’s (DoD) dynamic 
      network defense operations, where he was responsible for synchronizing, 
      integrating and directing cyber capabilities to defend the critical 
      missions that DoD networks support. Steelman also was the director of 
      DoD network defense for the joint task force-global network operations 
      and pentagon network assurance division chief. Instrumental in 
      establishing the framework for vulnerability and threat prioritization 
      for DoD cyber operations and execution, Steelman was awarded an army 
      commendation for his accomplishments. He began his career serving in the 
      U.S. Air Force.
    

Supporting Quotes:



“It has become increasingly difficult for organizations to 
        determine how to mitigate business risk due to the constantly 
        challenging cyber threat landscape. Optiv’s unique perspective from 
        working with its extensive network of technology manufacturers 
        provides insight into what combination of solutions and services will 
        map to each client’s needs and help them achieve real results. I look 
        forward to building on Optiv’s exceptional partner community to even 
        better serve the company’s global clients.”– Anirban 
        Chakravartti, senior vice president of worldwide partner solutions
      



“To be successful in today’s competitive global marketplace, 
        organizations need to develop and execute on a security strategy that 
        takes into account the plethora of regulatory, cultural and business 
        challenges that exist in a multinational environment. I am excited to 
        use my experience leading global security and risk organizations to 
        benefit Optiv’s clients trying to achieve security success in this 
        increasingly complex and dynamic business climate.”– Michael 
        Lines, vice president of strategy, risk and compliance advisory 
        services
      



“Today’s businesses and governments have very unique cyber security 
        problems that require specific expertise and resources to solve. Yet 
        finding and retaining experienced individuals who have the ability to 
        monitor for potential threats to the organization and know how to 
        respond to them appropriately has become increasingly difficult. I am 
        thrilled to be a part of Optiv’s work that fills that critical need 
        for clients who require ongoing support of their security programs. 
        The company is well-positioned to continue bringing new, innovative 
        solutions to market.”– Doug Steelman, vice president of 
        managed security services

      In 2014, Accuvant realized gross revenue of nearly $734 million with a 
      three-year growth rate of 114 percent, while FishNet Security realized 
      $779 million in revenue with an 85 percent three-year growth rate.
    

      ”Cyber security is a serious corporate risk affecting companies of all 
      sizes and all industries. Most companies don’t have enough skilled cyber 
      experts on staff and are challenged to find the right resources to help 
      them adequately address their unique security concerns,” said Optiv 
      chief executive officer Dan Burns. “This recognition underscores 
      Accuvant’s and FishNet Security’s long and successful histories, which 
      were built on innovation and putting clients first. Together, as Optiv, 
      we have the combined strength to even better serve our clients at a time 
      when our services have never been more needed. Our unique ability to 
      deliver security programs that combine products and services, people, 
      processes, strategies and tactics allows us to tightly partner with our 
      clients, assemble the right solution for their specific needs, and apply 
      it to their business priorities.”
    

      "The story of this year’s Inc. 5000 is the story of great leadership. In 
      an incredibly competitive business landscape, it takes something 
      extraordinary to take your company to the top,” said Inc. 
      president and editor-in-chief Eric Schurenberg.
    

Methodology


      The 2015 Inc. 5000 is ranked according to percentage revenue growth when 
      comparing 2011 to 2014. To qualify, companies must have been founded and 
      generating revenue by March 31, 2011. They had to be U.S.-based, 
      privately held, for profit, and independent--not subsidiaries or 
      divisions of other companies--as of December 31, 2014. (Since then, a 
      number of companies on the list have gone public or been acquired.) The 
      minimum revenue required for 2011 is $100,000; the minimum for 2014 is 
      $2 million.
