 Educational Background



Graduate Degree 


New York University

                  Founded in 1831, New York University is now one of the largest private universities in the United States. Of the more than 3,000 colleges and universities in America, New York University is one of only 60 member institutions of the distinguished Association of American Universities.

From a student body of 158 during NYU's very first semester, enrollment has grown to more than 40,000 students attending 18 schools and colleges at five major centers in Manhattan and in sites in Africa, Asia, Europe, and South America. Today, students come from every state in the union and from 133 foreign countries. The faculty, which initially consisted of fourteen professors and lecturers (among them artist and inventor Samuel F. B. Morse), now totals over 3,100 full-time members whose research and teaching encompasses the humanities, the sciences, and the social sciences; the law; medicine; business; education; the fine arts, studio art, and the performing and cinematic arts; music; social work; public administration; the ancient world; and continuing and professional studies. With more than 2,500 courses offered, the University awards more than 25 different degrees.  Although overall the University is large, the individuals schools and colleges are small- to moderate-sized units—each with its own traditions, programs, and faculty – and there are many communities to be found within the NYU community based on interests, activities, and shared experiences.

The center of NYU is its Washington Square campus in the heart of Greenwich Village. One of the city's most creative and energetic communities, the Village is a historic neighborhood that has attracted generations of writers, musicians, artists, and intellectuals. NYU, in keeping with its founder’s vision, is “in and of the city”: the University – which has no walls and no gates – is deeply intertwined with New York City, drawing inspiration from its vitality.

In addition to its Manhattan locations, the University is also formally affiliated the Polytechnic Institute of NYU in Brooklyn, the second oldest school of engineering and technology in the country, and has research facilities, notably the Nelson Institute of Environmental Medicine,  in Sterling Forest, near Tuxedo, New York.

And NYU has established itself as the first global network university, with a comprehensive liberal arts campus in Abu Dhabi – the first to be operated abroad by a major U.S. research university – and other sites for study and research in Accra, Ghana; Berlin, Germany; Buenos Aires, Argentina; Florence, Italy; London, England; Madrid, Spain; Paris, France; Prague, the Czech Republic; Shanghai, China; and Tel Aviv, Israel, among other locations.

Demos Parneros (AMP78, 2010), who had been working as Barnes & Noble’s COO for the last five months, has been named the booksellers new CEO. A story in the New York Times details the company’s recent struggles, which includes everything from executive turnover to sagging revenues. “The biggest challenge is the sales performance; that’s no secret,” Parneros told the Times. “We’ve got to figure out ways to change things up a little bit and increase traffic.”
Parneros told the Times that he sees strengths in the company’s expansion in educational products and in its new concept stores that feature full-service restaurants. The changes are in reaction to a market that, as the Times notes, is in flux:
After decades of decline, independent bookstores have rebounded. The American Booksellers Association counted 1,775 member stores in 2016, up from 1,410 in 2010. And Amazon has made an ambitious push into physical retail, with six new stores around the country and six more scheduled to open this year.
James McQuivey, an analyst at Forrester, said Barnes & Noble needed to innovate to survive, and quickly. “You’re never going to be that mass brand in every mall anymore because malls are gone,” he said.
Parneros comes to the job with a long career in retail:
Born in Cyprus, Mr. Parneros moved to New York City when he was in elementary school and spoke no English when he arrived. He attended New York University and joined Staples, the office supplies company, in 1987, when it had just four stores. He rose to president of Staples North American Stores and online, overseeing 1,800 stores and the web business.
Before he joined Barnes & Noble in November, he visited dozens of stores around the country to get a feel for the company.

Demos Parneros, who had acted as chief operating officer, is set to become Barnes & Noble’s fourth chief executive since 2013.

Eight months after the bookstore chain Barnes & Noble ousted its chief executive, Ronald Boire, ending a brief, tumultuous tenure, it has hired a successor from its own ranks.Demos Parneros, 55, who has acted as chief operating officer for the last five months, will take the top post, Barnes & Noble was to announce on Thursday.Mr. Boire was abruptly ousted in August, after less than a year on the job, when board members decided he was “not a good fit for the company.” Since then, the executive chairman, Leonard Riggio, who bought the company in 1971 and built it into a national chain, has acted as chief executive, delaying his retirement.Mr. Parneros, who joined Barnes & Noble from a top executive position at Staples, is taking over at a challenging time. The company is still scrambling to compete with Amazon and recover from steep losses from its digital Nook business. And despite some encouraging signs that the physical bookstore market has stabilized, Barnes & Noble has struggled to reverse sales and revenue declines.

In an earnings report in March for its third quarter, the company reported an 8 percent decline in sales, to $1.3 billion, compared with the previous year. Sales of digital content and devices fell nearly 26 percent, to $38.4 million. The company, which is based in New York, closed seven stores, shrinking to 634 stores, down from 720 in 2010.

“The biggest challenge is the sales performance; that’s no secret,” Mr. Parneros said, adding, “We’ve got to figure out ways to change things up a little bit and increase traffic.”He was optimistic about other aspects of the business, including the loyalty of its customer base and the possibility of increasing sales and traffic by expanding further into educational games, toys and gifts.He was also enthusiastic about the company’s new concept stores. In an attempt to update the look and feel of its stores and experiment with new ways of attracting customers, Barnes & Noble has opened three concept stores — in Minnesota, California and New York — that are sleeker and brighter and have full-service restaurants that serve wine and beer. Two more such stores are in development, in Virginia and Texas.

At the same time, the company is facing competition in the physical store market. After decades of decline, independent bookstores have rebounded. The American Booksellers Association counted 1,775 member stores in 2016, up from 1,410 in 2010. And Amazon has made an ambitious push into physical retail, with six new stores around the country and six more scheduled to open this year.James McQuivey, an analyst at Forrester, said Barnes & Noble needed to innovate to survive, and quickly. “You’re never going to be that mass brand in every mall anymore because malls are gone,” he said.Investors, analysts and publishing executives will be watching Mr. Parneros’s performance closely. He is the chain’s fourth chief executive since 2013, after Mr. Boire, who received  $4.8 million in a separation agreement; Michael P. Huseby, who resigned in July 2015, became executive chairman of Barnes & Noble Education and left with a $10.5 million severance payment; and William Lynch, who stepped down in July 2013 after pioneering the company’s disastrous digital strategy, with a severance package of $3.65 million in cash and several million dollars in stock.Mr. Parneros has virtually no experience in book sales, and he said he had undertaken a crash course in the business in the last few months.Born in Cyprus, Mr. Parneros moved to New York City when he was in elementary school and spoke no English when he arrived. He attended New York University and joined Staples, the office supplies company, in 1987, when it had just four stores. He rose to president of Staples North American Stores and online, overseeing 1,800 stores and the web business.Before he joined Barnes & Noble in November, he visited dozens of stores around the country to get a feel for the company. In his five months as chief operating officer, he spent a lot of time with Mr. Riggio, he said.

Mr. Riggio, who has been heavily involved in designing the concept stores and reorienting the company since Mr. Boire’s departure, will stay on as chairman.
