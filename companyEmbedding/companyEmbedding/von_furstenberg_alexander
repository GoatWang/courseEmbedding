Early life and education[edit]
He is the son of fashion designers Diane von Fürstenberg (née Halfin) and Prince Egon von Fürstenberg. His mother is from a Belgian Jewish family, originally from present-day Moldova and Greece;[1] and his father was half German and half Italian, the son of the German Prince Tassilo zu Fürstenberg of the House of Fürstenberg and his Italian first wife, Clara Agnelli, the elder sister of the chairman of FIAT, Gianni Agnelli. His parents divorced in 1972.
Prince Alexander and his sister Princess Tatiana von Fürstenberg were raised in New York City. Alex attended Brown University, where he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1993.[1]
Work[edit]
Alexander von Fürstenberg began his career in 1993 as a trader on the Risk Arbitrage Desk of Allen and Company. He is now the Chief Investment Officer of Ranger Global Advisors, LLC, a family company he founded which focuses on opportunistic value-based investing. Previously, he was the Co-Managing Member and Chief Investment Officer of Arrow Capital Management, LLC, a private investment firm focused on global public equities. Since 2001, he has acted as Chief Investment Officer of Arrow Investments, Inc., a private investment office that serves the Diller-von Furstenberg family.
Fürstenberg led the restructuring of Diane von Fürstenberg Studio, LP, a global luxury lifestyle brand, taking it from $1 million in annual revenue to more than $2 million. He remains a partner and director in the company and also serves on the Board of Directors of IAC, a U.S.-based internet conglomerate, and on the Board of W.P.

The Diller–von Furstenberg Family Foundation is involved in a number of charitable pursuits in education, community reform, environmental advocacy, disease research, childcare, arts and humanities and human rights. The foundation is also responsible for two significant endowments to the High Line, a New York City park built on the foundations of a decommissioned high line railway.

Personal life[edit]
As a teen he lived in the Carlyle Hotel, two floors below duty-free shops owner Robert Warren Miller and his family; it was there he met Miller's youngest daughter Alexandra, who was three years his junior.[2] They married on October 28, 1995, at the Church of St. Ignatius Loyola in New York City.[3] They had two children, Princess Talita Natasha (b. May 7, 1999) and Prince Tassilo Egon Maximilian (b. August 26, 2001), who is named for his paternal great-grandfather. In 2002, they separated and were later divorced.

About Diane von Furstenberg

Diane von Furstenberg first arrived in the fashion world in 1972 with her iconic wrap dress, the seed of what is today a full fashion house. By 1976, Diane had sold millions of her dresses, coming to symbolize female power and freedom to an entire generation. In 1997, after a hiatus from fashion, Diane reemerged on the New York fashion scene with the re-launch of the dress that had started it all and began transforming her company into the global luxury lifestyle brand it is today.

Alexandra von Furstenberg






(310) 777-0253 


Designer Alexandra von Furstenberg attended Parsons School of Design and Brown University, where she studied costume design and art history. In 1995, Alexandra joined the design team of her mother-in-law, American fashion icon Diane von Furstenberg. During her ten year career at DVF as Creative Director and later as Director of Image, Alexandra was instrumental in the re-launch of the iconic wrap dress as well as reinforcing the relevance of this American brand.  After relocating to Los Angeles > MORE in 2006, Alexandra focused on designing exclusively for the home. A synthesis of art, home furnishings and fashion, the collection consists of signed, limited edition pieces made out of acrylic - a nod to the 1970s when acrylic was widely regarded as the material of the future.  Beginning with a sleek 8-piece collection ranging from side tables to an oversized dining table, the designs were named in honor of their inspiration - diamonds (i.e. “Brilliant,” “Trillion”). The gem-like collection is illuminated with neon colors.  Alexandra’s second collection “Voltage,” debuting in March 2009, is made of mirror and smoke-colored acrylic. The 9-piece collection (in addition to an expanded range of accessories) is sultry, bold, and strong. For Alexandra, choosing a darker, smokier palette for her sophomore collection was a natural evolution from the bright, pop aesthetic she embraced in 2008.  Alexandra’s collection is available at her eponymous showroom in West Hollywood, California.^ LESS

About This Designer





Diane von Furstenberg first entered the fashion world in 1970 with a suitcase full of jersey dresses. Four years later, she created the wrap dress, which came to symbolize power and independence for an entire generation of women. By 1976, she had sold over a million of the dresses and was featured on the cover of Newsweek. In 1997, after a hiatus from fashion, Diane re-launched the iconic dress that started it all, reestablishing her company as the global luxury lifestyle brand that it is today. DVF has expanded to a full collection of ready-to-wear and accessories including shoes, handbags, small leather goods, scarves, and jewelry. The company also offers luggage, eyewear, and home furnishings. DVF is now sold in over 55 countries, including 132 DVF owned and partnered stores throughout North and South America, Europe, the Middle East and Asia Pacific.

In 2005, Diane received the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA) for her impact on fashion, and one year later was elected the CFDA’s President. In this significant role, she has dedicated herself to fostering emerging talent and helping to establish the Design Piracy Prohibition Act, which protects designers from counterfeit reproductions of their work. In 2015, Diane was named Chairman of the organization.

Diane's commitment to empowering women is expressed not only through fashion but also philanthropy and mentorship. She sits on the board of Vital Voices, a non-governmental organization that supports female leaders and entrepreneurs around the world. In 2010, with the Diller-von Furstenberg Family Foundation, Diane established the DVF Awards to honor and provide grants to women who have displayed leadership, strength and courage in their commitment to their causes. In 2014, Diane published a memoir, The Woman I Wanted to Be. In 2015, she was named one of the TIME 100 Most Influential People.

With her corporate headquarters in New York's Meatpacking District, Diane has long been a vocal member of the local community and was actively involved in the campaign to save the historic High Line railway and to develop The High Line into what it is today. She also serves on the board of Culture Shed, the new center for artistic and cultural innovation in New York City.

Diane von Furstenberg first entered the fashion world in 1970 with a suitcase full of jersey dresses. Four years later, she created the wrap dress, which came to symbolize power and independence for an entire generation of women. By 1976, she had sold over a million of the dresses and was featured on the cover of Newsweek. In 1997, after a hiatus from fashion, Diane re-launched the iconic dress that started it all, reestablishing her company as the global luxury lifestyle brand that it is today. DVF has expanded to a full collection of ready-to-wear and accessories including shoes, handbags, small leather goods, scarves, and jewelry. The company also offers luggage, eyewear, and home furnishings. DVF is now sold in over 55 countries, including 132 DVF owned and partnered stores throughout North and South America, Europe, the Middle East and Asia Pacific.

In 2005, Diane received the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA) for her impact on fashion, and one year later was elected the CFDA’s President. In this significant role, she has dedicated herself to fostering emerging talent and helping to establish the Design Piracy Prohibition Act, which protects designers from counterfeit reproductions of their work. In 2015, Diane was named Chairman of the organization.

Diane's commitment to empowering women is expressed not only through fashion but also philanthropy and mentorship. She sits on the board of Vital Voices, a non-governmental organization that supports female leaders and entrepreneurs around the world. In 2010, with the Diller-von Furstenberg Family Foundation, Diane established the DVF Awards to honor and provide grants to women who have displayed leadership, strength and courage in their commitment to their causes. In 2014, Diane published a memoir, The Woman I Wanted to Be. In 2015, she was named one of the TIME 100 Most Influential People.

With her corporate headquarters in New York's Meatpacking District, Diane has long been a vocal member of the local community and was actively involved in the campaign to save the historic High Line railway and to develop The High Line into what it is today. She also serves on the board of Culture Shed, the new center for artistic and cultural innovation in New York City.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
