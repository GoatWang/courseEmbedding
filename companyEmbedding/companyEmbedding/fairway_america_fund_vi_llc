Fairway America Creates Breakthrough for Investors to Use Traditional Investment Accounts to Invest in Alternatives



Share Article


















Fairway America, LLC (“Fairway”) announced today that it has received approval from the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (“DTCC”), the largest provider of clearing and settlement services to financial markets in the world, for both of its flagship funds, Fairway America Fund VI, LLC and Fairway America Fund VII, LP (collectively the “Fairway Funds”) on DTCC’s Alternative Investment Product Services (“AIP”) platform.







Fairway America Creates Breakthrough for Investors to Use Traditional Investment Accounts to Invest in Alternatives

Being listed on the AIP is a major step for us to be able to raise capital more effectively from high net worth investors and Registered Investment Advisors, said Fairway’s CEO Matthew Burk.


Portland, OR (PRWEB)
May 03, 2016
 Fairway America, LLC (“Fairway”) announced today that it has received approval from the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (“DTCC”), the largest provider of clearing and settlement services to financial markets in the world, for both of its flagship funds, Fairway America Fund VI, LLC and Fairway America Fund VII, LP (collectively the “Fairway Funds”) on DTCC’s Alternative Investment Product Services (“AIP”) platform. Addition on the AIP allows the Funds to be listed on all the major custodial platforms in the United States, such as Charles Schwab, TD Ameritrade, Pershing, etc. and enables investors with investment accounts at these custodians to invest directly into the Funds using their existing accounts. 
“Being listed on the AIP is a major step for us to be able to raise capital more effectively from high net worth investors and Registered Investment Advisors”, said Fairway’s CEO Matthew Burk. “It makes it so much easier for investors to use their existing accounts to gain access to the types of alternative investments, such as our funds, that many of them are looking for but do not know where to find.” 
Until recently, investors were hamstrung with respect to which investment accounts would “accept” or “hold” alternative investments such as the Fairway Funds. Most small balance real estate (“SBRE”) fund investments around the United States are not on the AIP and thus are not accessible by investors and advisors using traditional investment accounts. Instead, investors would typically have to move the money out of the account altogether, or if they have adequate “qualified” or pre-tax, investment accounts, move money into a self-directed IRA, in order to invest in SBRE funds or other alternative investments. Having to open a new accounts, liquidate assets, transfer funds to the new account, pay the fees associated with it, and then not be able to have the new investment reported on their statements meant that most investors and advisors simply do not pursue the often attractive returns available in alternatives. 
“When an investor who is using a financial advisor asks to divest investment dollars outside of that advisor’s platform and have those assets ‘held away’ in an investment that cannot be reported on that advisor’s statement, that advisor may recommend against it,” said Burk. “Now any investment such as our Funds that is listed on AIP can be made straight through the investor’s existing account and the reporting is the same as traditional accounts. It gives investors and advisors much more confidence and eases their administrative burdens tremendously.” 
DTCC settles the vast majority of securities transactions in the United States, settling more than a quadrillion dollars annually, making it by far the highest financial value processor in the world. Their AIP platform links global market participants including broker-dealers, fund managers, fund administrators, and custodians together to provide one standard, efficient end-to-end process for alternative investments such as hedge funds, private equity, non-traded real estate investment trusts (REITs), and 506 Regulation D funds such as the Fairway Funds and other funds in the SBRE space. Fairway America engaged Ryan Lodes, a specialist in the AIP arena, to assist it in piloting the challenging process of gaining approval on the AIP platform. 
“It is not the easiest process in the world to navigate,” said Lodes, “but once I realized what being on the AIP platform meant in terms of the benefits it brings to investors and advisors, I was committed to figuring it out and helping other alternative investment managers do the same.” For investors to be able to use their existing traditional investment accounts to invest in an alternative investment, the investment must first be approved on the AIP platform and then must provide the AIP issuer number to the various custodial platforms (e.g. Schwab, Fidelity, Ameriprise, TD Ameritrade, etc.) and work with them to submit the reporting information necessary on an ongoing basis. Now that the Fairway Funds have completed the AIP process, other funds in the SBRE community are becoming aware of the benefits of doing the same, according to Lodes.
“I am a huge believer in the alternative investment space,” said Lodes. “The AIP platform helps make alternative investments more available to people who really would like greater involvement in that arena but who don’t want to deal with all the hassles they had to manage previously. The bottom line is that AIP is truly helping to make alternatives more widely accessible to investors and investment advisors who would previously have shied away from them largely due to administrative reasons.” 
Fairway America also has an extensive fund administration practice for its fund manager clients in the SBRE industry and expects to be able to make it even easier for these clients than it was for Fairway to become approved on AIP. “Our fund administration clients can also benefit from AIP approval”, said Burk, “and we help them to make it easy.”

Fairway America Announces Launch of WESTLAND APARTMENT FUND LLC, a New $20,000,000 Fund To List on Fairway’s Crowdfunding Marketplace, SBREfunds.com



Share Article

















Fairway America plays leading role in the architecture, creation, and launch of the Westland Apartment Fund, LLC’s first pooled investment fund; Westland Management Group plans to attend Fairway’s Small Balance Real Estate Investment Summit in Dallas, October 15th through 17th.







“Working with Fairway to access the SBREfunds.com platform seemed like an easy decision to gain exposure for our Fund in the SBRE investor community,” said Alexandre Audié, Partner of Westland Apartment Investors.


Portland, OR (PRWEB)
August 21, 2015
 Fairway America (“Fairway”) (http://fairwayamerica.com/), the nation's leading authority on small balance real estate (“SBRE”) pooled investment funds, announced today the launch of the Westland Apartment Fund LLC (the “Fund”) out of Portland, Oregon to managed by its client Westland Management Group, LLC (“WMG”). Westland Apartment Investors (“Westland”) was formed in 1974 and specializes in investing in multifamily properties throughout the Pacific Northwest and the rest of the Western United States.  Fairway also announced today that the Fund will be listed on Fairway’s SBREFunds.com, (http://sbrefunds.com), a crowdfunding marketplace focusing exclusively on quality products and information in the pooled real estate asset based investment space. Westland opted to list the Fund on SBREfunds.com to help create immediate exposure to investors looking for opportunities in SBRE pooled investment funds such as the Fund. Westland has a raise goal of up to $20 million during the life of their closed-ended Fund.
“When training, history of performance, and concentration are all directed toward finding specific niche opportunities, we believe people can recognize these opportunities more often and sooner than others,” said Alexandre Audié, Partner of Westland Apartment Investors. “This applies to us in our value-add apartment niche and also to Fairway when helping us through the fund creation engagement.”  The Fund’s strategy will be to produce attractive risk adjusted returns investing in off market, multifamily assets. The Fund expects to locate and purchase value add properties typically needing substantial upgrades and/or improved management and which WMG believes contains significant upside.  It will focus on properties located in the Western region of the U.S., with an initial focus on Oregon, Washington, California, Arizona and Idaho, in primary and secondary markets.  Westland’s team of SBRE industry professionals have over 40 years of business and real estate experience and together, with their investors, currently owns and manages more than $200 million of multifamily real estate.
Meanwhile, Fairway, through its SBREfunds.com platform, is building the world’s leading community of SBRE fund managers who can access high net worth investors interested in the space. Investors have a private and secure environment to check out a variety of SBRE strategies and deals all around the U.S. and are able to review and select investment opportunities they find interesting inside the marketplace and contact the managers directly. Audié feels that listing the Fund on SBREfunds.com will give Westland the opportunity to get greater exposure to qualified investors as the Fund launches and help raise capital more efficiently and effectively. “Working with Fairway to access the SBREfunds.com platform seemed like an easy decision to gain exposure for our Fund in the SBRE investor community,” said Audié.  
Fairway launched SBREfunds.com this past January and has quickly grown the site to include more than 15 funds with total offerings of nearly $2,000,000,000. “SBREfunds.com is still the only crowdfunding portal focused primarily on the unique landscape of the SBRE pooled investment space,” said Matt Burk, CEO of Fairway America.  “We continue to grow and foster the community of investors, entrepreneurs, and fund managers by taking into account the various segments’ needs and opportunities.  We are proud to add Westland’s Fund on our site, and doing so continues to increase the number of quality offerings being brought to the marketplace.”
Westland Management Group, LLC is also planning to be in attendance at Fairway's Small Balance Real Estate Investment Summit at the Hilton Anatole Hotel in Dallas, October 15th-17th, 2015. This premier, invitation-only event is open to fund managers and accredited investors interested in learning more about the SBRE pooled investment fund space and meeting one another.

Darris Cassidy
CRO





Darris grew up in the real estate finance business, literally, as the son of a successful 35-year + commercial mortgage banker. A Portland area native, Darris graduated from Gonzaga University with a BA in Finance. He began his career with HomeStreet Bank in Seattle and then Bank of the West, and swiftly became one of the top producers at the bank.  Having more of an entrepreneurial itch than most bankers, took a position as CFO of one of his large bank clients, a sizable regional home builder. He took the lead role in working with the firm’s banks, lenders and investors both as the company grew rapidly up until 2008 and during the downturn afterward as the firm experienced many of the challenges prevailing in real estate at the time.
Darris Cassidy joined Fairway America in 2012.  Darris’ combination of natural gregariousness, financial acumen, and lifelong love of real estate have made him an extremely versatile and valuable member of Fairway’s team. As Managing Director of Fairway’s proprietary pooled investment funds, Darris’ primary role at the company is working with high net worth investors and raising capital for the funds. Darris is a principal of Fairway America and sits on Fairway’s investment committee.




Lance Pederson
COO





Lance Pederson has been with Fairway America since its inception in 2008 as the successor to Fairway Commercial Mortgage. As COO, as well as a principal of the Company, Lance brings an extensive background in leadership, administration, financial management, IT, and operations.
Prior to joining Fairway, he was co-founder and CEO of Convergence Networks, a cutting-edge IT managed services provider which was recognized as one of the fastest-growing and best places to work in Oregon. In growing this startup company to several million dollars in revenue, Lance learned many critical lessons in running and growing a business and how to operate a successful company. From financial modeling to project management to hiring and managing the right people, he was deeply involved in all aspects of the growth of Convergence prior to his successful exit. He is a passionate learner and teacher, enjoying articles, books, and discussions on management, marketing, and operational excellence with peers and colleagues.
Lance has an in-depth knowledge of lean principles, Six Sigma, and other business process improvement frameworks. He is also a dedicated practitioner of a “finance-centric” approach to business management and continually cultivates automated systems to provide real time feedback to assist in company (and client) strategic decision making. These strengths along with a deep understanding of technology make him a vital member of Fairway’s leadership team and an outstanding and unique resource to our mortgage pool Fund clients’ business operations.
From 2005 to 2012, Lance was actively involved in the Entrepreneurs’ Organization (EO), the world’s most influential community of entrepreneurs. He served on the chapter board as the Communications Chair, Accelerator Chair, and was the President in 2008-2009.




Jay Zollinger
General Counsel





Jay Zollinger, who has worked with Fairway America and its management team for several years, serves as Fairway’s General Counsel, and oversees the company’s legal affairs. Jay is a practical, business minded lawyer who leverages skills honed over years of practicing law at the highest levels to help his clients achieve and exceed their business goals. Through his law firm, Outside General Counsel Services, P.C., Jay provides Fairway and other growth-stage companies in various industries experienced corporate legal advice and business counsel using a model of dedicated, part-time General Counsel services.
Before opening his own firm, Jay was General Counsel to Saber Software, Inc. — one of Oregon’s most successful companies, and the Portland Business Journal’s fastest growing company in 2007. At Saber, Jay developed a deep understanding of how to address a company’s legal needs without detracting from its business goals. Jay left Saber and started his current law practice in 2009 after successfully completing the sale of Saber to EDS and facilitating the post-sale integration of the two businesses.
Prior to joining Saber, Jay was a partner at Perkins Coie, the largest law firm in the Pacific Northwest. At Perkins, Jay had a complex business litigation practice. While the primary focus of his practice was business and contract disputes, he also gained extensive experience in product liability, corporate governance, securities regulation, and employment law—experience that Jay now uses to help Fairway and his other clients avoid liability while focusing on growing their businesses.
Jay joined Perkins Coie in 1997 after graduating from Boalt Hall School of Law at the University of California, Berkeley. He also has a Master’s degree in American Political Thought from the University of Utah and a Bachelor’s degree in Political Science, Philosophy, and Film Studies from Boston University.




Kellen Stevens

Darris Cassidy
CRO





Darris grew up in the real estate finance business, literally, as the son of a successful 35-year + commercial mortgage banker. A Portland area native, Darris graduated from Gonzaga University with a BA in Finance. He began his career with HomeStreet Bank in Seattle and then Bank of the West, and swiftly became one of the top producers at the bank.  Having more of an entrepreneurial itch than most bankers, took a position as CFO of one of his large bank clients, a sizable regional home builder. He took the lead role in working with the firm’s banks, lenders and investors both as the company grew rapidly up until 2008 and during the downturn afterward as the firm experienced many of the challenges prevailing in real estate at the time.
Darris Cassidy joined Fairway America in 2012.  Darris’ combination of natural gregariousness, financial acumen, and lifelong love of real estate have made him an extremely versatile and valuable member of Fairway’s team. As Managing Director of Fairway’s proprietary pooled investment funds, Darris’ primary role at the company is working with high net worth investors and raising capital for the funds. Darris is a principal of Fairway America and sits on Fairway’s investment committee.




Lance Pederson
COO





Lance Pederson has been with Fairway America since its inception in 2008 as the successor to Fairway Commercial Mortgage. As COO, as well as a principal of the Company, Lance brings an extensive background in leadership, administration, financial management, IT, and operations.
Prior to joining Fairway, he was co-founder and CEO of Convergence Networks, a cutting-edge IT managed services provider which was recognized as one of the fastest-growing and best places to work in Oregon. In growing this startup company to several million dollars in revenue, Lance learned many critical lessons in running and growing a business and how to operate a successful company. From financial modeling to project management to hiring and managing the right people, he was deeply involved in all aspects of the growth of Convergence prior to his successful exit. He is a passionate learner and teacher, enjoying articles, books, and discussions on management, marketing, and operational excellence with peers and colleagues.
Lance has an in-depth knowledge of lean principles, Six Sigma, and other business process improvement frameworks. He is also a dedicated practitioner of a “finance-centric” approach to business management and continually cultivates automated systems to provide real time feedback to assist in company (and client) strategic decision making. These strengths along with a deep understanding of technology make him a vital member of Fairway’s leadership team and an outstanding and unique resource to our mortgage pool Fund clients’ business operations.
From 2005 to 2012, Lance was actively involved in the Entrepreneurs’ Organization (EO), the world’s most influential community of entrepreneurs. He served on the chapter board as the Communications Chair, Accelerator Chair, and was the President in 2008-2009.

Through his law firm, Outside General Counsel Services, P.C., Jay provides Fairway and other growth-stage companies in various industries experienced corporate legal advice and business counsel using a model of dedicated, part-time General Counsel services.
Before opening his own firm, Jay was General Counsel to Saber Software, Inc. — one of Oregon’s most successful companies, and the Portland Business Journal’s fastest growing company in 2007. At Saber, Jay developed a deep understanding of how to address a company’s legal needs without detracting from its business goals. Jay left Saber and started his current law practice in 2009 after successfully completing the sale of Saber to EDS and facilitating the post-sale integration of the two businesses.
Prior to joining Saber, Jay was a partner at Perkins Coie, the largest law firm in the Pacific Northwest. At Perkins, Jay had a complex business litigation practice. While the primary focus of his practice was business and contract disputes, he also gained extensive experience in product liability, corporate governance, securities regulation, and employment law—experience that Jay now uses to help Fairway and his other clients avoid liability while focusing on growing their businesses.
Jay joined Perkins Coie in 1997 after graduating from Boalt Hall School of Law at the University of California, Berkeley. He also has a Master’s degree in American Political Thought from the University of Utah and a Bachelor’s degree in Political Science, Philosophy, and Film Studies from Boston University.
