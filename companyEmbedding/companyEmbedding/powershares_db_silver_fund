During the weekend of August 22/23, our third-party Administrator (The Bank of New York Mellon – BNYM) experienced a technical malfunction resulting in it being unable to calculate timely NAVs for its mutual funds and ETF clients, including the PowerShares ETFs. As we disclosed to you last week, we experienced a delay in the dissemination of the NAV. PowerShares worked aggressively with BNYM to resolve the issue. We are pleased to report that the malfunction has been corrected by the Administrator and that the system is back to normal. The NAV that is being disseminated today is the most recent NAV for the Funds (as of Thursday, September 3).
For primary market participants, please note that, in accordance with the Prospectus and the SAI for each PowerShares ETF, orders received before the cut-off time on any given day were processed at the NAV that was calculated by the Administrator for that day. Given the delay in the calculation and dissemination of the NAV by the Administrator, we expect that most of the orders that the Administrator received last week will settle in the normal settlement cycle. Certain orders may experience (or have experienced) a  delay in settlement. Secondary market transactions were not affected by the delay and  are anticipated to settle in ordinary course.
See detailed list of last week's NAVs  
For additional information please contact PowerShares at 1-800-983-0903.

	PSMM  
		- PowerShares Moderately Conservative Multi-Asset Allocation Portfolio
	
	

Balanced - Target Risk




Product Details
The PowerShares Moderately Conservative Multi-Asset Allocation Portfolio (the "Fund") is an actively managed exchange-traded fund (ETF) that seeks to provide current income and some capital appreciation by allocating through a moderately conservative investment style that seeks to maximize diversification potential. The Fund is a "fund of funds," meaning that it invests its assets in the shares of other exchange-traded funds, rather than in securities of individual companies.  The Fund's target allocation of total assets:  50% to 80% in fixed income ETFs, 20% to 50% in equity ETFs and 5% to 15% in underlying ETFs that invest in foreign stocks and bonds as well as American depositary receipts (ADRs) and global depositary receipts (GDRs). Invesco Advisers Inc., the sub-adviser to the Fund (Sub-Adviser), selects investments based on quantitative and qualitative criteria to strategically allocate across broad asset classes and factors within those classes.

This is a new Fund and has no full-year Fund performance to report as of most recent quarter end.  

Market returns are based on the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4 p.m. ET and do not represent the returns an investor would receive if shares were traded at other times. Performance data quoted represents past performance, which is not a guarantee of future results. Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate, and shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be higher or lower than performance data quoted. After-tax returns reflect the highest federal income tax rate but exclude state and local taxes. Fund performance reflects applicable fee waivers, absent which, performance data quoted would have been lower. After Tax Held and After Tax Sold are based on NAV. Returns less than one year are cumulative.

Distribution Information



Fund Distributions

Dividends from net investment income, if any, are declared and paid either quarterly or monthly, depending on the Fund. For Funds on a quarterly dividend payment cycle, the dividend ex-date is generally the third Friday of each March, June, September and December, payable the last business day of the month. For Funds on a monthly dividend payment cycle, the dividend ex-date is generally the 15th of each month, payable the last business day of the month. 
The fund distributes its net realized capital gains, if any, to shareholders annually. Prior to paying a distribution of net investment income, the fund has the ability to invest cash generated from investment income into additional securities or money market instruments.
Distributions in cash may be reinvested automatically in additional whole shares of the fund only if the broker through whom you purchased shares makes such option available. Shareholders of the fund may contact their broker to determine the availability and costs of the service and the details of participation. Brokers may require shareholders to adhere to specific procedures and timetables. If this service is available and used, dividend distributions of both income and realized gains will be automatically reinvested in additional whole shares of the fund purchased in the secondary market. 
Taxes on Distributions
In general, your distributions are subject to federal income tax when they are paid, whether you take them in cash or reinvest them in the Fund. Dividends paid out of the Fund’s income and net short-term gains, if any, are taxable as ordinary income. Distributions of net long-term capital gains, if any, in excess of net short-term capital losses are taxable as long-term capital gains, regardless of how long you have held the Shares. Dividends from net investment income, if any, are declared and paid quarterly. The Fund may also pay a special distribution at the end of the calendar year to comply with federal tax requirements. 
Under the provisions of the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 (the “2003 Tax Act”), long-term capital gains tax rates have generally been reduced for individuals to a maximum of 15% for taxable years beginning before January 1, 2009. In addition, some ordinary dividends declared and paid by the Fund to individual shareholders may qualify for taxation at the lower reduced tax rates applicable to long-term capital gains, provided that holding period and other requirements are met by the Fund and the shareholder. 
Distributions in excess of the Fund’s current and accumulated earnings and profits are treated as a tax-free return of capital to the extent of your basis in the Shares, and as capital gain thereafter. A distribution will reduce the Fund’s net asset value per Share and may be taxable to you as ordinary income or capital gain even though, from an investment standpoint, the distribution may constitute a return of capital. 
By law, the Fund must withhold a percentage of your distributions and proceeds if you have not provided a taxpayer identification number or social security number. The backup withholding rate is currently 28%.

Shareholders may pay more than net asset value when they buy Fund shares and receive less than net asset value when they sell those shares, because shares are bought and sold at current market prices. Performance data quoted represents past performance, which is not a guarantee of future results.

 Risk & Other Information 
 
The Custom PowerShares Moderately Conservative Allocation Index consists of 40% MSCI All Country World Index and 60% Bloomberg Barclays US Aggregate Index. An investment cannot be made in an index.
The MSCI All Country World Index (MSCI ACWI) is a free float-adjusted market capitalization index that is designed to measure equity market performance of developed and emerging markets. The index is computed using the net return, which withholds applicable taxes for non-resident investors.
The Bloomberg Barclays US Aggregate Index is an unmanaged index considered representative of the US investment-grade, fixed-rate bond market.
There are risks involved with investing in ETFs, including possible loss of money. Actively managed ETFs do not necessarily seek to replicate the performance of a specified index. Actively managed ETFs are subject to risks similar to stocks, including those related to short selling and margin maintenance. Ordinary brokerage commissions apply. The Fund's return may not match the return of the Index. The Fund is subject to certain other risks. Please see the current prospectus for more information regarding the risk associated with an investment in the Fund.
The Fund is subject to the risks of the underlying funds. Market fluctuations may change the target weightings in the underlying funds and certain factors may cause the Fund to withdraw its investments therein at a disadvantageous time.
The investment techniques and risk analysis used by the portfolio managers may not produce the desired results.
The Fund typically will hold a small number of positions (approximately 10-20 Underlying ETFs). To the extent that a significant portion of the Fund’s total assets is invested in a limited number of holdings, the appreciation or depreciation of any one Underlying ETF may have a greater impact on the Fund’s NAV than it would if the Fund held a greater number of constituents.
The Fund is non-diversified and may experience greater volatility than a more diversified investment. 
Debt securities are affected by changing interest rates and changes in their effective maturities and credit quality.

During the weekend of August 22/23, our third-party Administrator (The Bank of New York Mellon – BNYM) experienced a technical malfunction resulting in it being unable to calculate timely NAVs for its mutual funds and ETF clients, including the PowerShares ETFs. As we disclosed to you last week, we experienced a delay in the dissemination of the NAV. PowerShares worked aggressively with BNYM to resolve the issue. We are pleased to report that the malfunction has been corrected by the Administrator and that the system is back to normal. The NAV that is being disseminated today is the most recent NAV for the Funds (as of Thursday, September 3).
For primary market participants, please note that, in accordance with the Prospectus and the SAI for each PowerShares ETF, orders received before the cut-off time on any given day were processed at the NAV that was calculated by the Administrator for that day. Given the delay in the calculation and dissemination of the NAV by the Administrator, we expect that most of the orders that the Administrator received last week will settle in the normal settlement cycle. Certain orders may experience (or have experienced) a  delay in settlement. Secondary market transactions were not affected by the delay and  are anticipated to settle in ordinary course.
See detailed list of last week's NAVs  
For additional information please contact PowerShares at 1-800-983-0903.

	PIE  
		- PowerShares DWA Emerging Markets Momentum Portfolio
	
	

Equity - International and Global Equity




Product Details
The PowerShares DWA Emerging Markets Momentum Portfolio (Fund) is based on the Dorsey Wright® Emerging Markets Technical Leaders Index (DWA Emerging Markets Technical Leaders Index). The Fund will normally invest at least 90% of its total assets in securities of emerging economies within Dorsey Wright & Associates' classification definition, as well as American depositary receipts (ADRs) and global depositary receipts (GDRs) based on securities in the Index. The Index includes approximately 100 companies from the NASDAQ Emerging Markets Index that possess powerful relative strength characteristics and are domiciled in emerging market countries including, but not limited to Brazil, Chile, China, India, Indonesia, Philippines, South Africa, Thailand and Turkey. The Index excludes US companies listed on a US stock exchange. The Index is computed using the net return, which withholds applicable taxes for non-resident investors. The Fund and the Index are rebalanced and reconstituted quarterly.

Market returns are based on the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4 p.m. ET and do not represent the returns an investor would receive if shares were traded at other times. Performance data quoted represents past performance, which is not a guarantee of future results. Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate, and shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be higher or lower than performance data quoted. After-tax returns reflect the highest federal income tax rate but exclude state and local taxes. Fund performance reflects applicable fee waivers, absent which, performance data quoted would have been lower. After Tax Held and After Tax Sold are based on NAV. Returns less than one year are cumulative.

Distribution Information



Fund Distributions

Dividends from net investment income, if any, are declared and paid either quarterly or monthly, depending on the Fund. For Funds on a quarterly dividend payment cycle, the dividend ex-date is generally the third Friday of each March, June, September and December, payable the last business day of the month. For Funds on a monthly dividend payment cycle, the dividend ex-date is generally the 15th of each month, payable the last business day of the month. 
The fund distributes its net realized capital gains, if any, to shareholders annually. Prior to paying a distribution of net investment income, the fund has the ability to invest cash generated from investment income into additional securities or money market instruments.
Distributions in cash may be reinvested automatically in additional whole shares of the fund only if the broker through whom you purchased shares makes such option available. Shareholders of the fund may contact their broker to determine the availability and costs of the service and the details of participation. Brokers may require shareholders to adhere to specific procedures and timetables. If this service is available and used, dividend distributions of both income and realized gains will be automatically reinvested in additional whole shares of the fund purchased in the secondary market. 
Taxes on Distributions
In general, your distributions are subject to federal income tax when they are paid, whether you take them in cash or reinvest them in the Fund. Dividends paid out of the Fund’s income and net short-term gains, if any, are taxable as ordinary income. Distributions of net long-term capital gains, if any, in excess of net short-term capital losses are taxable as long-term capital gains, regardless of how long you have held the Shares. Dividends from net investment income, if any, are declared and paid quarterly. The Fund may also pay a special distribution at the end of the calendar year to comply with federal tax requirements. 
Under the provisions of the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 (the “2003 Tax Act”), long-term capital gains tax rates have generally been reduced for individuals to a maximum of 15% for taxable years beginning before January 1, 2009. In addition, some ordinary dividends declared and paid by the Fund to individual shareholders may qualify for taxation at the lower reduced tax rates applicable to long-term capital gains, provided that holding period and other requirements are met by the Fund and the shareholder. 
Distributions in excess of the Fund’s current and accumulated earnings and profits are treated as a tax-free return of capital to the extent of your basis in the Shares, and as capital gain thereafter. A distribution will reduce the Fund’s net asset value per Share and may be taxable to you as ordinary income or capital gain even though, from an investment standpoint, the distribution may constitute a return of capital. 
By law, the Fund must withhold a percentage of your distributions and proceeds if you have not provided a taxpayer identification number or social security number. The backup withholding rate is currently 28%.

				Fund Inception:

Shareholders may pay more than net asset value when they buy Fund shares and receive less than net asset value when they sell those shares, because shares are bought and sold at current market prices. Performance data quoted represents past performance, which is not a guarantee of future results.

 GTL- PowerShares Smart Beta Investing: The Case for GTL 
 









 Risk & Other Information 
 
Typically, security classifications used in calculating allocation tables are as of the last trading day of the previous month.  There are risks involved with investing in ETFs, including possible loss of money. Shares are not actively managed and are subject to risks similar to those of stocks, including those regarding short selling and margin maintenance requirements. Ordinary brokerage commissions apply. The Fund's return may not match the return of the Underlying Index. The Fund is subject to certain other risks. Please see the current prospectus for more information regarding the risk associated with an investment in the Fund. Investments focused in a particular industry or sector are subject to greater risk, and are more greatly impacted by market volatility, than more diversified investments. The Fund may engage in frequent trading of its portfolio securities in connection with the rebalancing or adjustment of the Underlying Index. The risks of investing in securities of foreign issuers, including emerging market issuers, can include fluctuations in foreign currencies, political and economic instability, and foreign taxation issues. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index is an unmanaged index considered representative of stocks of developing countries. The index is computed using the net return, which withholds applicable taxes for non-resident investors. The NASDAQ Emerging Markets Index is a subset of the comprehensive NASDAQ Global Index FamilySM, which provides a transparent, rules-based global equity benchmark for institutional investors.  The Global Industry Classification Standard was developed by and is the exclusive property and a service mark of MSCI, Inc. and Standard & Poor's. There is no relationship between Dorsey, Wright & Associates, LLC ("Dorsey Wright") and PowerShares by Invesco ("PowerShares") other than a license by Dorsey Wright to PowerShares of certain Dorsey Wright trademarks, tradenames, investment models, and indexes (the "DWA IP"). DWA IP has been created and developed by Dorsey Wright without regard to and independently of PowerShares, and/or any prospective investor. The licensing of any DWA IP is not an offer to purchase or sell, or a solicitation of an offer to buy any securities. A determination that any portion of an investor's portfolio should be devoted to any ETF product developed by PowerShares or investment model developed by Dorsey Wright is a determination made solely by the investment advisor serving the investor or the investor himself, not Dorsey Wright. Beta is a measure of risk representing how a security is expected to respond to general market movements. Smart Beta represents an alternative and selection index based methodology that seeks to outperform a benchmark or reduce portfolio risk, or both. Smart beta funds may underperform cap-weighted benchmarks and increase portfolio risk.

During the weekend of August 22/23, our third-party Administrator (The Bank of New York Mellon – BNYM) experienced a technical malfunction resulting in it being unable to calculate timely NAVs for its mutual funds and ETF clients, including the PowerShares ETFs. As we disclosed to you last week, we experienced a delay in the dissemination of the NAV. PowerShares worked aggressively with BNYM to resolve the issue. We are pleased to report that the malfunction has been corrected by the Administrator and that the system is back to normal. The NAV that is being disseminated today is the most recent NAV for the Funds (as of Thursday, September 3).
For primary market participants, please note that, in accordance with the Prospectus and the SAI for each PowerShares ETF, orders received before the cut-off time on any given day were processed at the NAV that was calculated by the Administrator for that day. Given the delay in the calculation and dissemination of the NAV by the Administrator, we expect that most of the orders that the Administrator received last week will settle in the normal settlement cycle. Certain orders may experience (or have experienced) a  delay in settlement. Secondary market transactions were not affected by the delay and  are anticipated to settle in ordinary course.
See detailed list of last week's NAVs  
For additional information please contact PowerShares at 1-800-983-0903.

Access Commodities

Institutional Caliber Exposure to Commodities and Currencies
PowerShares by Invesco continues to lead the intelligent ETF revolution by providing institutional caliber products that seek to replicate enhanced indexes. PowerShares DB commodity and currency funds provide investors cost-effective and convenient access to the global commodity and currency markets through rules-based commodity and currency indexes.1
An Industry Leader
Since entering the commodity ETF market in 2006, PowerShares and DB have been industry leaders launching the first broad-based commodity ETF (DBC) and the first long/short currency ETF (DBV).
An Intelligent Roll Methodology: Optimum Yield
Generally, commodity futures-based ETFs sell their current contracts before they expire and automatically buy into the next month. This process is called "rolling" futures contracts forward.
Instead of automatically rolling into the next month contract, the PowerShares DB Commodity ETFs use the Optimum Yield Roll™ process which analyzes the next 13 months and selects the contract that aims to generate the best possible roll yield.

Strategy & Benefits

Key Benefits
You know that TRADING is different than investing. But the opportunity to take advantage of short-term trends is only won, if you get the direction right.
Whether you’re a bull or a bear, Direxion is with you. Our leveraged ETFs are powerful tools built to help you:

Magnify your short-term perspective with daily 2X leverage
Go where there’s opportunity – with bull and bear funds for both sides of the trade
Stay agile – with liquidity to trade through rapidly changing markets

Leveraged and inverse ETFs pursue daily leveraged investment objectives which means they are riskier than alternatives which do not use leverage. They seek daily goals and should not be expected to track the underlying index over periods longer than one day. They are not suitable for all investors and should be utilized only by investors who understand leverage risk and who actively manage their investments.







Target Index

The Solactive Global Silver Miners Index (SOLGLOSI) is designed to measure broad based equity market performance of companies involved in the silver mining industry, as defined by Structured Solutions AG. The Index includes a minimum of 20 and a maximum of 40 stocks of US and foreign companies active in exploration, mining and/or refining of silver, including stocks of small- and medium- capitalization companies. One cannot directly invest in an Index. bi>

* The Net Expense Ratio includes management fees, other operating expenses and Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses. If Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses were excluded, the Net Expense Ratio would be 0.80%.  The Funds’ Adviser, Rafferty Asset Management, LLC (“Rafferty”) has entered into an Operating Expense Limitation Agreement with each Fund, under which Rafferty has contractually agreed to cap all or a portion of its management fee and/or reimburse each Fund for Other Expenses through September 1, 2018, to the extent that the Fund’s Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses exceed 0.80% of the Fund’s daily net assets other than the following:  taxes, swap financing and related costs, acquired fund fees and expenses, dividends or interest on short positions, other interest expenses, brokerage commissions and extraordinary expenses. If these expenses were included, the expense ratio would be higher.
The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. For the most recent month-end performance please visit the funds website at direxioninvestments.com.
Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus.
