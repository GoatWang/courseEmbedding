But thank you again and good afternoon to all who are joining us today to discuss our first quarter results. We are pleased to report another strong quarter, and start to 2017. Revenue increased 29% over prior year to $50.8 million. Gross profit margin increased 300 basis points over prior year to 31% and adjusted EBITDA increased 111% over prior year, to $5 million.
I would like to highlight two overarching industry trends that we believe will drive demand for our products and solutions, for the foreseeable future. First, as I have mentioned previously, there has been an explosive proliferation of data over the years from developments and technology, such as mobile, ecommerce, and social.
Businesses and governments are inundated with disparate data, both structured and unstructured, and continue to struggle to glean intelligence in order to maximize efficiency and to increase [indiscernible]. Those that do this successfully will thrive. Those that don’t, will not. This challenge knows no bounds, affecting businesses of all sizes and in all industries. Cogint’s products and solutions play right into this trend, where we seek to serve this massive market by delivering clarity that organizations need for their decision making prophecies. Utilizing our technology, our data assets and our analytical capabilities, we are delivering intelligence applications to our customers, to enable better and faster decisions.
The second overarching trend is the powerful movement of offline to digital, with respect to consumer consumption of content and purchasing. As you know, you cannot go about your day without observing the repercussions of this seismic shift. Just pick up a newspaper, or watch TV, or go to the mall, and you will see the impact of mobile and ecommerce. Lone standing prominently branded retail stores are shuttering in mass, while consumers are enjoying the benefits of priced shopping and purchasing on their mobile devices, while sitting in their living room.
Marketers know that they must commit resources to digital marketing, and they will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. Especially devoting resources where they can obtain measurable results. Our unique ability to develop custom audience data and to activate it against an increasing amount of addressable media is a fundamental driver of our continued success and traction within the digital market [technical difficulty] drives our business as we roll out new products, further enhance existing products, and enter new markets. We see continued strong demands for our products. We know this multiple ways. Upon that first call by the sales team, we are increasingly seeing awareness by the prospect of who we are and our capabilities.
We are receiving inbound interest from and are establishing key integrations with various industries specific platforms that offer a suite of third party products, including those of our more established competitors to their customers. By way of example, we announce the integration of the fluent acquisition application with the oracle marketing cloud. We have built out our sales team, traveling and visiting prospects around the country, where we are receiving significant interest in the products, excellent customer service and cost efficiencies that we can deliver.
And we are seeing an increase in not only those customers that want to deploy our products more broadly across their organization, but also the scale of customer as we move up from smaller, early adopters to those customers that demand greater functionality to execute their daily workflow.

In fact, today we now have 47 customers that spend over $1 million per year with us. There is heightened anticipation with regard to our product roadmap, and as a result we continue to see increased interest and uptake in our subscription products. Our team of data scientists and developers is working aggressively to meet this demand by executing upon a robust product roadmap that will take us well into the future. Our information services segment revenue increased 49% over prior year to $16.4 million. Our performance marketing segment revenue increased 21% over prior year to $34.4 million.
Within our information services segment, healthcare revenue increased 85% over prior year to $2.7 million. Financial services revenue increased 40% over prior year to $2.6 million dollars. Media and entertainment revenue increased 98% over prior year to $1.8 million. 
Within our performance marketing segment, strategic growth verticals continued to show increasing demand and strong profitability, with continued focus on activation of our unique first party database across new channels. Mobile app revenue increased 517% over prior year to $7.5 million. Career and education revenue increased 74% over prior year to $2.5 million. And market research revenue increased 319% over prior year to $1.4 million. 
Now, I will turn it over to Dan who will discuss the financials.
Dan MacLachlan
Thank you Derek and good afternoon. The year has start well for us. I am pleased with our strong execution in the first quarter. While investing across the business, enhancing our technology platforms, operating infrastructure, and fully integrating the queue interactive business onto our marketing services platform, we were able to deliver strong revenue growth on expanded profitability.
Our first quarter results, again, reaffirm the execution of our business model and pave the way for what we expect to be a very successful year for Cogint. Moving onto our first quarter results, revenues were $50.8 million, a 29% increase over first quarter 2016, driven by strong growth across both our segments.
Adjusted EBITDA was $5 million, a 111% increase over first quarter 2016. Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 385 basis points, to 10% at compare to first quarter of 2016. Continuing to the details of our PNL, as mentioned, revenues were $50.8 million for the first quarter.
Our information services revenue increased 49% to 16.4 million, led to strong growth from our healthcare, financial services, and media and entertainment verticals. Our performance marketing revenue increased 21% to $34.4 million, driven by our strategic growth verticals of mobile app, career and education and market research. Cost of revenues were $35.2 million compared to $28.5 million for the first quarter 2016. A result of increased data and media costs associated with the increase in revenue, partially offset by savings attributed to the optimization of our consumer traffic through more efficient media lines.
Gross margin was 31% for the first quarter 2017, A 300 basis point increase over first quarter 2016. SG&A was $19 million. A 15% increase over first quarter 2016, driven primarily by increased investment in the expansion of our sales, operation, infrastructure and technology teams. Partially offset by lower professional fees.
The $19 million in SG&A for the first quarter consisted primarily of $7.3 million of non cash share based compensation. $6.9 million dollars in employee’s salaries and benefits, $1.1 million in accounting, legal and other professional fees, and $.7 million in restructuring costs related to the integration of the Q Interactive business.
Depreciation and amortization was $3.4 million in the first quarter 2017, a 31% increase over first quarter 2016. The increase was primarily the result of the amortization of tangible assets from the acquisition of Q Interactive in the second quarter of 2016. As a result of the Q Interactive integration, we wrote off a total of $3.6 million in long lived assets for certain intangible and fixed assets, including trade names and proprietary technology acquired in the Q interactive acquisition.

Net loss was $12.7 million for the quarter, largely a result of non cash share based payments of $7.3 million and the onetime non cash write off of long lived assets I just discussed. New loss for the quarter 2016 was $6.7 million, inclusive a tax benefit of $3.5 million.
For the first quarter 2017, we recognize a full valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets, and as a result did not book nay tax benefit in the period. We expect to be in a full allowance position for the remainder of the year and do not expect to book a tax benefit in 2017. We reported a loss of $0.24 cents per share for the first quarter, based on a weighted average share count of 53.8 million shares.
Moving on to the balance sheet; cash and cash equivalent were 22.1 million at March 31, 2017 compared to 10.1 million at December 31, 2016. Total debt, including the current portion of long term debt, which was used to finance a portion of the fluid acquisition, was 63 million at March 31, 2017, an increase of $13 million from December 31, 2016 a result of a conditional incremental term loan. Current assets were $52.4 million at March 31, 2017, compared to $43.1 million at December 31, 2016. Current liabilities exclusive of the current portion of long term debt were $19 million at March 31, 2017 compared to $22 million at December 31, 2016.
Moving on to the statement of cash flows for the quarter ending March 31, 2017, cash provided by operating activities was $2.2 million compared to $0.5 million for the same period 2016. The $2.2 million provided by operating activities was primarily the result of generating current income of $2.3 million after adjustments for non cash items totaling $15.1 million.
Cash used in investing activities was $2.3 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 mainly the result of $2.1 million used for software developed for internal use. Cash provided by financing activities was $12.1 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017, a result of $14 million in net proceeds from the incremental term loan, partially offset by the repayment of $1.8 million in long term debt.
For the trailing 12 months ending March 31, 2017, our leverage ratio was 2.3 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA. As we discussed, our [indiscernible] allocation strategy during our last call and our ability to extract tremendous operating leverage from the execution of our business model. We wanted to position the company in a manner so as to seize upon the abundance of opportunities we have on our product road map should we choose to from time to time.
In that regard, we secured a $15 million term loan from our lending partner in the first quarter of 2017 on substantially the same terms as our existing debt. With our expanding margins and continued strong cash flows, we expect the leveraging throughout the year continuing to focus on strong organic growth.
Also on our last earnings call or learning’s call, I took some time to reflect on and discuss our strategic acquisition of Q Interactive in 2016. Q Interactive provided an excellent strategic acquisition opportunity that allowed us to expand out data assets, customer base and thought leadership.
After analyzing the synergies and identifying the capabilities that drive the greatest ROI within our marketing business, we commenced and completed in the first quarter 2017, the integration of the Q Interactive business. Leveraging the best capabilities across the organization and realizing cost, technology and resource synergy that will translate into material profitability.
We expect little or no customer or revenue attrition associated with the integration. Incurred restructuring cost included in SG&A in the amount of $.7 million as a result of the integration during the period. Beginning in the second quarter 2017, we expect to realize approximately $4.5 million in annualized saving and SG&A as a result of the post integration cost synergies. \

I will now turn it over to Derek to conclude our prepared remarks.
Derek Dubner
Thanks Dan. In closing we are off to a great start to the year. We have demonstrated over the last couple of years that we are building a company for the long term. With a strong foundation comprised of next generation cloud based platforms, a massive data repository containing holistic views of over 95% of the U.S. consumer population, Intelligent applications and analytical applications, to drive products well into the future. We are driven by innovation and our customers. We are focused on AI implementation or artificial intelligence. Layering our platforms with machine learning, so as to extract knowledge otherwise unobtainable. And combined with the over-all themes that we discussed, we have tremendous opportunities that lie ahead. We are very well positioned for the rest of 2017 and thereafter. 
Our operator will now open the line for Q&A.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Jim McIlree with Chardan. Your line is now open.
Jim McIlree
Derek, I think in your remarks you talked about three verticals within both the performance marketing and information services businesses. And I’m curious, were those three just the largest three verticals in each of those groups or the ones with the greatest growth rate? Or the ones that you’re focusing on going forward? Or some or all or some combination of that?
Derek Dubner
Those are the verticals we’re focused on right now. As I mentioned on the last call, where we’re devoting our resources where we see we can get kind of exponential gain; those that we can make the most traction in and that we’re very excited about. And that’s why we’ve chosen those verticals to highlight. And of course, because of the progress in those verticals it’s because of the attention we’re giving them.
Jim McIlree
And as far as the size of those verticals relative to anything else? They could be random or they’re some of the bigger ones?
Dan MacLachlan
So when we looked at these verticals, we’ve called them out on the performance marketing side over the past few quarters. These are those strategic growth verticals where we see the most amount of strategic leverage if you will going into the next few quarters. We’ve put a lot of resource into growing these verticals. So as it relates to kind of historical growth, these are the verticals we see growing over the next few quarters. Relative to size of some of the other verticals, they’re more of the emerging side that are growing quickly. The other verticals are relatively stable in regards to kind of historical revenue.
Jim McIlree
And, Dan, every time we speak I think I ask you about seasonality so I don’t want to disappoint you this time. Was Q1 a seasonally weak quarter for information services and performance marketing? Or both?
Dan MacLachlan
So I would expect nothing less than to get the seasonality question. So we’ve discussed previously that the marketing side of the business performs well on the fourth and first calendar quarters and the risk management side of the business really performs well the first through third calendar quarters. Looking at the overall business, if the marketing business represents a substantial portion of our revenue we do still expect seasonal pressure as the result. However, we’re layered on multiple strategic growth initiatives into our business model, both on the performance and information services side, and fully expect to leverage that growth over the next two quarters.
Jim McIlree
And the last one; at the very end, Dan, you threw in a $4.5 million in annual SG&A savings beginning in Q2. I just want to make sure I’m understanding that correctly; so if I look at extra write off - let’s just do a SG&A and sales and marketing extra the write off. So you’re at, what, $19 million right now? So is it [fair] to say then, a year from now it will be $19 million less the $4.5 million plus whatever growth is required to support the business? Is my math kind of right?

Dan MacLachlan
Yes, that’s [the] way to look at it. As a growth company, we’ll continue to invest in the infrastructure, sales and technology teams from a headcount perspective. But [the] way to look over the normalized SG&A is to take out the $4.5 million on an annualized basis. So looking at where we’re at today at $19 million in SG&A, you can expect over the next year that $4.5 million would be removed from that number, offset by some initiatives to grow the business.
Operator 
Our next is from Jim Goss with Barrington Research. Your line is open. 
Jim Goss
Following up a little bit on Mr. McIlree’s first question; the information services categories you highlighted don’t really match up with the areas I’d think you’d be going into with IDI CORE. So I gather they would relate more to the Fluent sort of a spin off, is you will. Is that correct or are some of the financial services areas primarily related to the IDI CORE operations?
Dan MacLachlan
Yes, when you look at the product suite and solutions that we have on the risk management side of the business, you’re going to see a tremendous amount of those solutions fall into the financial services bucket. You’ll also see a good portion of the solutions fall into healthcare. When you call out the media and entertainment as it sits today, a good portion of the marketing business will fall into that bucket.
Jim Goss
Can you provide any update on the IDI CORE progress to this point? I know it was a smaller category, but a promising one. So where does that stand right now?
Derek Dubner
We’re doing great in that business. But, as I’ve mentioned previously and believe me I with could give more transparency than I am. It’s just highly competitive. And we know our competition feels us, we are testing head to head with them with customers and winning tests on our data and we’re growing the business. So I can’t give any metrics of on boarded users or customer adoption. But as I can tell you, that I mentioned in my notes, that we’re seeing continued growth in the subscription products; meaning the contractual revenue versus transactional.
And again, just to highlight for you and anyone else who is unaware from previous calls; that’s a reverse of what we’ve experience in the industry given where we are in the early stages of development. We are getting customers that understand where we’re going in this product road map. And they’re wanting to lock-in in long term subscription contracts in order to lock in price and take advantage of the efficiencies that we’re bringing to them today. We are, I can say, in fact winning larger customers than we were in the smaller early adopters. And we’re very excited by that and we continue to make progress.
As I mentioned in my notes, we built out our outside sales team and those are really a bit of a longer sales cycle but they’re knocking on doors of the bigger, larger companies. Again, it takes a little time to get that traction as opposed to a small business, but we’re very excited about that. And we’re not integrating with many of the platforms that are out there. By way of example, in the collections market there are platforms that offer their customers access to a variety of products and they might be competitive products, of course. But now when we get that phone call from them saying, "I’m being told by my customers they want access to you on my platform, so let’s bring you onboard," that tells us that we’re making traction in the market. And so that’s just one of those indicators that we follow and we’re very encouraged.
Jim Goss
And with the groupings in the performance marketing segment, can you talk about which of those aggregate more to the traditional Fluent business versus the Q Interactive business? Or was there a lot overlap in each of those?

Dan MacLachlan
So when we look at the Q Interactive business, one of the things we looked at when we talked about kind of strategic acquisitions and we talked a little bit about it last quarter. It is from an acquisitions stand point we really looked at the opportunistically inquisitive, looking for those assets that ever have misplaced or underappreciated and that can synergistically expand our capabilities and exploit our business model, all while having an acquisition cost that is significantly lower than the targets extrinsic value.
So when we looked at Q Interactive, we knew that we were one of the few potentially only strategic that could extract meaningful value from that asset. And as you know, Q Interactive revenue has been declining for several years, however, we saw tremendous value in the client relationships, data, and thought leadership, because of the already superior platform we had with the [indiscernible] asset.
As we integrated the business, shared clients, and grew the customer base, we lost visibility in to the segregation if you will of the [Indiscernible] Q business verses the current overall business. However, what I will say is the growth of our marketing business came off the growth of our fluent platform. I would say very little growth, in those verticals, would be attributed to the Legacy Q Interactive business.
Jim Goss
Okay, maybe that lastly are there any other small acquisitions you could make that would either be along the same lines or maybe adjacent to it so that it might extend that traditional business?
Dan MacLachlan
So Jim, we’ve made a policy on not to comment on any acquisitions in the likes. But I will reiterate my comment, that I have made many times, we are very intently focused on creating shareholder value and we will always be looking for opportunities if that expands the customer base, if that expands our technologies, or advances the road map. And we are especially interested in assets like you, where they might be mispriced or misunderstood, where we can make that acquisition that we know it significantly increases shareholder value and is synergistic with the business. So I will leave it at that.
Operator
Our next question is from Monish Bahl with MHB Capital. Your line is now open.
Monish Bahl
Thank you, and congratulations. Just a couple quick questions, with regard to the long term debt of the sequential basis its spiked up $15 million dollars, will you talk about that quickly?
Dan MacLachlan
Sure, so again, we talked a little bit about it on our last call but what we’ve seen over the last few quarters as we have initiated some of these strategic initiatives, is we saw a tremendous amount of opportunity in our products road map and our pipeline. And at any given time, we want to position ourselves well to basically act upon, when necessary, on those initiatives, to really drive the business.
As a result of that, we reached out to our lending partner and in the first quarter of 2017, brought in an additional net proceeds of $14 million dollars from an additional term loan on substantially the same terms as our current debt.
Monish Bahl
Okay, got it. And then back to the health care vertical that showed very robust growth, can you talk about what is driving that growth and what sustainable growth rate you could achieve within that vertical? Thank you.
Dan MacLachlan
Sure, and we talk about these growth verticals either where we’re really putting our strategic initiative and see a tremendous amount of ability to leverage not only the data assets that we have on the information services side, but also leverage or ability to build custom audience on the marketing side so what that health care vertical really includes is hospitals and medical facilities that look for data validation, due diligence on the risk management side.

We’ll also see on the marketing side, vitamin and health supplement marketing companies, durable medical equipment buyers, pharmacy saving cards and etcetera. I can think that market has plenty of room and opportunity for growth. We feel that is one of our potential strategic growth verticals. We initiated that in the third quarter of this past year and have seen a tremendous amount of capability to grow that vertical and see that to continue throughout 17 in to 18, leveraging our ability to build custom audiences that target the need of this particular vertical.
Operator
Our next question is from Sam Schaefer with Global Value Research. Your line is now open.
Sam Schaefer
Derek, in the prepared remarks, you mentioned the product roadmap over the next several quarters. I was hoping you could expand on this and really when we’ll start to see this evolve.
Derek Dubner
Sure, Sam. Thanks for the question. What I can tell you today is that it is already evolving quite significantly. It has been over the last few quarters. We have these product enhancements within various solutions that we believe differentiate us from the market place quite significantly.
And those are [indiscernible] well in to ‘18, where we have defined objectives that we are very excited about, that we will cross off one at a time, making our products better and better. So we have significant initiatives that we will roll out in the next two quarters, that we believe will have a very meaningful impact on revenue, and so that excites us. And then again, we have sort of these aspirations I’ll say but you know, aspirations makes me sound as if we will not accomplish, and we will, but their objectives, let’s say, that are better than what we see in the market and we are very excited about executing upon those, later in the year, after these first parts of the list are taken out.
Sam Schaefer
All right, you cut out part of the ways through there so I hope I’ll be able to read the answer in the transcripts become available.
Derek Dubner
Sure, no, I apologize Sam. I mean in a nutshell, I guess I can tell you is that we’ve been executing for the last couple of quarters on that road map. Well we have been for a long time but we’ve really upped the technology team and our other developers and other locales have been executed upon that plan. We have released many of the initiatives. They are enhancements within our products that our customers are loving, in a nutshell, and we will continue to roll out very meaningful initiatives over the next couple of quarters that we believe with have a direct impact on revenue.
Sam Schaefer
Great, and I know in the past, you were keeping fluent data separated from IDI, I believe in the last call that you mentioned that really the integration of Fluent date into IDI Core was going to start duly providing update on that integration.
Derek Dubner
Sure, I can tell you that fluent data is fully integrated in to IDI Core. And we are very excited about that. And our customers are all ...
Sam Schaefer
I’m hoping to get an update on the multiple [trans] lawsuits. I believe the one was finalized. I was curious if we have provided them with the source code or if we’re still in possession of that.
Derek Dubner
Yeah, Sam, you know, I would point you to our legal proceeding section in the 10-Q that we just filed. I think that can give you all the [color] that you need and therefore I’m probably not going to address it today.

Sponsor Spotlight: IDI, Inc.

If you are a PI News Roundup subscriber you've probably been introduced to a product called idiBASIC. idiBASIC is a quality verification and location information product available to investigators. In our latest Sponsor Spotlight, Derek Dubner, Co-CEO of IDI, Inc. takes our Q&A and shares details about the company, its foundation, products, and future.
1. Who is IDI?
DD: IDI (an acronym for “Interactive Data Intelligence”) is an information solutions provider focused on the data fusion industry. Our founders and management were instrumental in building the leading products in the industry today, Accurint and TLOxp. Ole Poulsen, our Chief Science Officer, was the primary systems architect of Seisint (with its product Accurint) and TLO (product TLOxp) prior to their being acquired by Reed Elsevier’s LexisNexis and TransUnion, respectively. During the past 15 years, I had the pleasure of working with Hank Asher in his two previous ventures, Seisint and TLO, and I watched his passion for creating great investigative products for the PI industry. We at IDI have assembled a world-class team to continue that mission.
2. Can you give us a short summary of the current products you have available to private investigators and what they offer?
DD: Private investigators may not know that IDI, through its subsidiary Interactive Data, LLC, has served as an information solutions provider for over a decade, centered primarily in the Collections industry. We are now devoting time and resources to expand our offerings to serve the investigative markets.
Leveraging our expertise and long history in the verification and location of individuals for debt collection purposes, we recently added massive new data sets and released idiBASIC™, a simple, intuitive and cost-effective location and verification product. This was a very deliberate offering, resulting from extensive feedback from several industries, including private investigators.
As you know, investigators have many cases that require only verification, location, or skip trace-related data. Legacy providers continue to raise prices on already high fees by packaging skip tracing data with additional, unnecessary information. At $0.50 per hit, idiBASIC is meant to give investigators only what they need for simple skip tracing, through an easy to use interface, at a price point that makes sense.
3. What products and resources do you see IDI offering in the future?
DD: While idiBASIC serves the simplest of use cases, our full investigative system, idiCORE™, is currently in development and set for release in stages throughout the remainder of 2015. With proprietary linking technology and an advanced systems architecture, we believe idiCORE will quickly become the system of choice for private investigators seeking comprehensive views of (and the connections between), people, businesses, and assets. We are not building just “another system,” but truly what we believe to be the next-generation investigative platform.
4. From your experience in the data industry, where are other products failing in areas that IDI is going to excel?
DD: It is our view that many of the difficulties surrounding legacy systems today are related to when they were developed, the supporting infrastructure, and the business philosophies of organizations.
Previous systems were built as early as 2000. That is a lifetime ago when speaking about technology. Programming, hardware, and infrastructure have changed dramatically over the years; thus, the landscape has changed. Linking algorithms can become outdated due to the enormous growth in the volume of available data and evolving uses of this data. In this changing environment, rigid rules or static software will lead to extinction. If these legacy systems don’t evolve with these fundamental industry changes, there can be actual degradation of the quality of results produced by data fusion systems. IDI is attacking this problem by using modern data science techniques – a great example of this is machine learning – to develop a system that constantly adapts and gets smarter as time goes on.
Further, it’s very difficult to consistently offer cost-effective services when a company has invested in, and must maintain, a vast, capital-intensive infrastructure necessary to support the processing of these massive data sets. This used to entail investing tens of millions of dollars building a massive data room, acquiring thousands of servers, and maintaining the personnel to support it. Once such a capital intensive commitment has been made, it is problematic, and in some instances impossible, to modify the system to take advantage of advancements in today’s technology. Today’s massive migration by companies of all sizes to cloud-based infrastructures is a perfect example. By designing this next-generation system from inception, IDI benefits from the structural changes in data processing and storage that have taken place in recent years, resulting in our ability to offer more cost-effective services to our customers.
Lastly, due to the evolution of this industry, current offerings are now run by very large organizations. While IDI is a publicly-traded company, our primary focus will always be the customer. Our management team and board of directors understand that constant innovation is the key to properly serving the investigative industry. We are committed to developing great products at a great price.
5. You touched on key team members having a background in the data space. Would you walk us through some core team members and their backgrounds, as well as how this sets IDI apart from the competition?
DD: As I mentioned, on the technology side, we are extremely pleased to have Ole Poulsen as our Chief Science Officer. Ole served as the primary systems architect of both the Accurint and TLOxp systems, and is one of the few individuals in this field to have unique knowledge of how these systems work and, more importantly, how to design the next-generation system for today’s uses. Additionally, Ole handpicked a world-class team of data scientists and engineers from top organizations such as Microsoft, Disney and Boeing, all based in our Seattle office, that are knowledgeable, experienced, and dedicated to creating powerful solutions for the industries we serve. On the business side, we have several members of the team that have lived and breathed the data fusion and investigative industries for years.
6. How do you see IDI continuing to provide value to the private investigation customers in the future?
DD: The investigative market is extremely important to us. Many of the key features included in today’s investigative systems are a direct result of input from this industry. We are dedicated to listening to our customers, as well as forging alliances within the industry, to better understand trends, needs, and concerns that can be addressed. We are committed to advancing our technology, enhancing functionality of our systems, and continually increasing the breadth of our data.
7. Is there anything you would like to add about your products, what’s coming, or what’s next for the data world from IDI?
DD: The platform we are building today will be cross-functional, so that our powerful systems can drive data analytics across end user databases. In other words, end users from both the public and private sectors will be able to layer our systems over their massive, disparate data sets to glean unattainable insights. We will deliver this massive search engine to their door step. But, I guess this topic is for another day…

About Derek Dubner, Co-CEO of IDI, Inc.

Derek Dubner is the co-chief executive officer of IDI, Inc. For the last 15 years, Mr. Dubner worked closely with the late Hank Asher, the creator of market leaders Seisint and TLO and often referred to as “the father of data fusion”. Most recently, Mr. Dubner served as general counsel of TLO from inception through the sale of substantially all of the assets of TLO to TransUnion in December of 2013. Prior roles include vice president and associate group counsel at Equifax, general counsel and chief compliance officer at Naviant (acquired by Equifax), and corporate counsel at Seisint (acquired by Reed Elsevier’s LexisNexis).

Stock quotes in this article: idi, cocp, yhoo, efx


(This column is about a small-cap stock with market capitalization below $100 million. Small-cap trading ideas are highly risky, but present an opportunity for significant payoff if they work. Such ideas are sometimes characterized as "lottery tickets" and are for only the most risk-tolerant investors, as the potential for 100% loss is high.)
Short sellers play an important role in any public equity market.
That said, as a recent New Yorker article correctly points out: "short sellers are often wrong."
And, according to IDI (IDI) Chairman Michael Brauser, CEO Derek Dubner and largest shareholder Dr. Phillip Frost, an article published yesterday by an anonymous blogger about IDI is not only wrong BUT is completely devoid of facts.
Rather than attacking the anonymous blogger, management chose to address the article's main points.
Here's our conversation from last night:
E: Hi Mike.
IDI Chairman Mike BRAUSER: Derek Dubner (CEO of IDI) is also on the line.
E: Great.
Why don't we just address the summary points of the article?
BRAUSER: Sure.
E: (Quoting summary points from anonymous blog post) "Frost mixed up with 'the wrong crowd' as Barry Honig and Michael Brauser have spun a tiny struggling debt collections business, acquired with $5.7m cash, into temporarily inflated ~$200m shell."
How do you respond to that?
BRAUSER: I can't judge myself as the "wrong crowd" and I'm not exactly sure what that means. So that's difficult for me to address.
E: And Dr. Frost has been a partner of yours for a long time?
BRAUSER: Dr. Frost has been a partner of mine for 6-7 years. We've worked together we've socialized together and we've had multiple successful deals together.
We've also had deals that have either been his legacy deals or others that we've worked with and have turned them around into successful companies.
E: Any examples you can provide?
BRAUSER: Yes.
By way of example, Dr. Frost introduced me to BioZone which is mentioned in the body of the article.
BioZone had some technology he was interested in.
We closed on the company and bought it.
And as we dove further into the company we found that the founder had misrepresented tremendous amounts about the company, including a lot of liabilities, the ownership of the technology and his position within the company.
He was eventually removed from the company, was quite bitter about that and started to throw out multiple lawsuits, throwing out allegations against Dr. Frost and everyone associated with him.
The long and short of it is we ended up in federal court where he lost his claims, he was bought out of his stock at a nominal amount and had no further claims to pursue against the company.
So, from my position he lost because he sued for 10s of millions of dollars and ended up walking away with something less than a millions dollars.
E: And none of the allegations proved true?
BRAUSER: None of the allegations.
He went to every investigative body he could trying to stir up as much trouble.
He then tried to sue everyone associated with it.
In fact, he attempted to blackmail Dr. Frost and myself by having a friend of his who's a writer for a very well-known magazine threaten to publish a negative article.
I was able to get him to put that in writing that he would kibosh that article if we'd pay him a certain amount of money.
I showed that to the federal judge in court in SF and really set him back quite a bit and got him into a bit of trouble.
Further to that, the company BioZone has now become a company called Cocrystal (COCP).
It has a large market-cap. The stock rose from $0.15 to $1.15. It trades with good volume and they have significant science and scientists involved with it.
So, there was a story that this author of this article (anonymous blog) tries to show that we were bad guys and stole the company and did all these horrible things.
In fact, we saved the company and created significant shareholder value.
So, that's just one example.
I've been working with Dr. Frost for a long time. He's obviously a man of very significant character.
E: He's not going to work with just anybody.
BRAUSER: No. He wouldn't. And I'm proud to be associated with him.
From my own view, I'd never do anything that would hurt or harm that relationship because I do cherish it.
E: Did you speak to him recently?
BRAUSER: I did. I spoke to him today.
He's very supportive.
I know that he's a very significant shareholder.
And I look forward to him participating in the activity of the stock in the short term.
E: So nothing has changed from Dr. Frost?
BRAUSER: No.
Nothing has changed. He's fully supportive of the company.
I can tell you that we have very significant plans TOGETHER for the company's future.
I want to emphasize that.
Dr. Frost and I have significant plans that we've been working on together that will be transformational to the success of this company.
E: And in his mind the allegations are ... he's known you for a long time, he knows your history, you've partnered on deals ...
BRAUSER: Sure.
And I can go one step further.
In the body of the article, the author claims that I was a mere board member of InterClick. In fact, I happen to be one of the founders of InterClick -- myself AND Barry Honig were founders and I was chairman of the board, not just a board member.
That was one of the first deals I did with Dr. Frost. And I brought him into the company where he had a tremendous return on his investment.
The author of the article seems to be misleading on the stock price and where we ended up selling the company.
We sold the company at its all-time high. There were no shareholders that could have lost any money on this sale.
And I will say even further to that I was personally responsible and personally handled the transaction with Yahoo! (YHOO) and dealt with them with the smallest of details to the closing of the transaction. 
I was intimately involved in every step of the way. I was very proactive as chairman of the board in the success of the company as well as the sale.
E: And what can you say about Barry Honig?
BRAUSER: Barry Honig was instrumental as well in the success of the company.
Barry was very supportive, was able to raise substantial capital for the company from significant investors, helped us execute the vision and build the company.
When Barry and I founded...
E: Barry is one of your partners?
BRAUSER: Yes.
In a variety of deals, Barry Honig and I are investors and partners.
We co-invest in some deals.
E: And Dr. Frost knows him well as well?
BRAUSER: Yes, he does.
Barry was co-chairman of the company for some period of time as well.
BRAUSER: For the record, when we founded the company it was doing $50,000 a month. When we sold, it was doing $15 million.
E: The one you sold to Yahoo!?
BRAUSER: Yes. InterClick, which the author claims I had nothing to do with.
The next bullet point (quoting from the article): Chairman Brauser's biography has "interesting" omissions including bankruptcy, wipeout, and fraud lawsuits, with Equifax suing him alleging "fraudulent misrepresentations" with Softbank lawsuit alleging "various frauds."
I think this deserves significant attention.
I have never had a bankruptcy in my life.
I've never been part of any bankruptcy.
I've never taken a company bankrupt.
So I don't know where he creates these false claims and allegations.
They are false and can't be substantiated whereby I was a party to any bankruptcy anywhere.
I don't know what the term "wipeout" means.
I've wiped out on a set of skis.
I've probably wiped out on a bicycle here and there and even on a surfboard.
But I've never wiped out a company.
As far as "fraud lawsuits," it needs to be very clear.
I did sell a company to Equifax (EFX). It was a very successful company.
After I left the company, the management did not do as good as a job as I did and the company declined.
Its revenues and its profits declined.
Equifax did sue me and I did go through a long drawn out litigation with them.
At the end of the day, I ended up winning the lawsuit. 
They received no compensation from me whatsoever and I was paid by the funds such as Softbank -- where (the author of the blog) claims that I misrepresented. I was paid a significant settlement.
I, Michael Brauser was paid by them. I didn't pay them anything.
So, if I were guilty of anything it would be very strange for them to pay to settle with me.
Next bullet point (quoting from the blog): "IDI stock temporarily inflated from extensive Yahoo message board stock-pumping scheme, touting IDI across dozens of boards with interconnected aliases, similar to halted and bankrupt FNRG."
E: There's not a lot of discussion that happens on Yahoo's IDI message board.
BRAUSER: I can't help what people talk about.
But the fact of the matter is they should be very excited about this company because this is the company that's going to have significant impact.
E: And any knowledgeable person knows you don't rely on information that's posted on Yahoo Finance message boards.
BRAUSER: Correct.
Nor do I ever go on them myself. So I can't comment on that.
Now this is the most interesting one (referring to the bullet point in the article): IDI's Transunion lawsuit could mean instant $0 for stock as IDI future apparently based on IP they don't own, which TransUnion acquired when IDI CSO Poulsen's last company went bankrupt.
The author claims if we were to lose the lawsuit ...
This deserves discussion.
Our IP is NOT the IP that TransUnion is using.
We're developing now our own proprietary intellectual property (IP) and software that will drive our products.
We're building it with our Chief Scientific Officer Ole Poulsen.
Ole Poulsen works for our company AND Ole Poulsen has claimed ownership and in fact developed the IP that TransUnion is now using for their TLO branch.
Ole Poulsen never sold that to TLO, never gave them source codes.
Our company IDI did buy that technology from Ole.
We're not using it.
What we've done is we alerted TransUnion that they're in fact using our IP and that we may be entitled to royalties from their use of our IP.
TransUnion then went to the bankruptcy court and asked them to rule on the fact that they owned the IP.
The bankruptcy court could not make that ruling.
The bankruptcy court, in fact, has opened this up for discovery.
As it seems to me today, we believe we're the rightful owners of that IP and that TransUnion is at risk of losing either the rights to use it or the potential to have to pay us royalties.
But in no way, shape or form ...
If we were to lose our claim that we don't own that IP, it would not cause any damage or deter our company from building our products we're building today. It would not affect the future of our business.
So, this author's claim that it would mean an instant $0 is absurd, it's not based on facts, and I would highly recommend that if he were to read the court records he would find that we're sitting in a very good position and we're very comfortable that we have a good shot at winning this case, which would only benefit us additionally but would not hurt us.
E: And this is exactly what you told me when I interviewed you a few weeks ago.
BRAUSER: Correct.
That being said, the rest of the article is based on false claims.
Our valuation today is based on the fact that we have THE team that has created a multi-billion dollar industry working for us.
The software and IP that was created for Accurant and Reed Elsevier, THAT team is working for us.
The software that is working for TransUnion's TLO division, that team is working for us.
We feel we're in a very strong position.
We feel our company has a tremendous future and we're very excited about it.
Today's stock action is a snapshot in a very long movie. It's just one frame.
In my opinion, it's the author's (of the article) ability to make some money by shorting this stock as he states in the opening of his article and he got away with it.
E: Of course there's a place for shorts in the market, assuming they have their facts straight.
BRAUSER: In fact, I'm going to plagiarize a line from Dr Frost: "Shorts will turn out to be our best friends."
And that could be for more than one reason.
They may learn not to be short and go long.
And when they do have to buy back their stock because of our inevitable success it will only increase value to our shareholders, thereby they become a very good friend to the company.
E: And none of you guys did any selling today?
BRAUSER: No.
To be very clear, I, chairman of the board of IDI, I'm an insider, I'm chief principal officer as well, and I bought stock today because I find the stock price very compelling here.
E: And Dr. Frost didn't do any selling today?
BRAUSER: No. Dr. Frost did not sell any shares.
I suspect he may be an acquirer. but I have not confirmed that.
E: And none of the management sold today?
BRAUSER: I believe other management members including our CEO acquired stock today.
DEREK DUBNER, CEO of IDI: I can confirm that I did acquire stock today.
BRAUSER: So Derek Dubner the CEO acquired stock today.
There has been no insider selling that we're aware of -- certainly not today.
E: And Derek, nothing happened today or yesterday that would lead to the stock plummeting as it did. Correct?
DUBNER, CEO of IDI: Absolutely not.
There were no company events that led to this today.
E: And you're just as bullish on this company as you've always been?
DUBNER: Absolutely. Unequivocally.
E: And nothing you learned today about Mike Brauser concerns you?
DUBNER: No. Absolutely not.
BRAUSER: Every day that goes by the company gets a little bit better.
The company is better today than it was yesterday. Will be better tomorrow.
E: Because you're busy building the product.
BRAUSER: Exactly.
Every day we're once step closer to releasing a product that will change the industry.
E: And Derek, you support everything that Mike just said?
DUBNER: Yes. Absolutely.
E: Derek, I'm assuming you read the article. Is there anything you feel you need to respond to?
DUBNER: There isn't much to respond to other than our legacy purchase of Interactive Data was a very deliberate purchase. It was NOT to buy a debt collection business, some small nothing player.
It was a business that has been around for many years in the risk management industry.
It has very well established relationships with data suppliers ...
BRAUSER: I'm going to jump off the call and you can call me back. I have Dr. Frost and I need to speak to him.
E: Sure.
DUBNER, CEO of IDI: As I was saying, the legacy purchase of Interactive Data has long standing relationships with the data suppliers that are very important to being in the risk management industry.
And of utmost importance it has all the security certifications and infrastructure in place to manage and maintain sensitive consumer information.
It was a very intentional purchase.
These claims throughout the article that there's no R&D whatsoever is completely fabricated.
We have had our next generation systems since we formed the company and brought on our CSO Ole Poulsen. And our team today continues to build that next-generation system and we continue to invest in that. So that's false.
In any event, we're going to continue doing what we're doing, building a very big company here and we're very excited about the opportunity and everybody involved. Nothing has changed.
MIKE BRAUSER, Chairman of IDI: I'm back on the call.
I just got off the phone with Dr. Frost who's wildly supportive.
My suspicion is he'll be in the market acquiring shares.
He actually felt that the article was so off base and such a personal attack that he wanted to speak to counsel about potentially suing them for libel ... slander.
