Repair a Metal Roof



Professional from start to finish. Polite and professional onsite. At the end of each day you'd never know they were at our house. They more than met our expectations. No more painting those metal porch roofs ever again!

On two occasions I've needed to call Roberts to repair my older slate roof, which sits atop a three story home with a steeply pitched angle.  Frank, at the main office, has consistently been professional, kind, and responsive.

The men who've completed the work have been professional, efficient, and tidy.

Roberts is certainly not a "discount" roofer, so the cost of repairs can initially cause a person to consider second or third opinions.  However, I will NEVER look for those opinions because the cost of the repair and work is fair and deserved.  And so the question of "value for money" ends up being moot when one considers how important the roof of one's home is.

Provides very detailed estimates with pictures of the problems on the roof. Compared to another company, we felt more comfortable with Roberts. Did the work to our expectations, would def use them again in the future.

What is the screening process that Service Professionals go through in order to become members of the HomeAdvisor network?





Verify Trade License
            HomeAdvisor checks to see if the business carries the appropriate state-level license. 
Verify Insurance
            As a part of our screening process, we encourage professionals to carry general liability insurance. We require coverage for hundreds of services. 
Verification of State Business Filings
            For business types that require a Secretary of State filing, we confirm that the business is in good standing in the state in which it is located.
Criminal Records Search
            HomeAdvisor uses 3rd party data sources to conduct a criminal search for any relevant criminal activity associated with the owner/principal of the business.
Sex Offender Search
            We confirm that the owner/principal is not listed on the official state Sex Offender web site in the state in which the owner/principal of the company is located. 
Bankruptcy Search
            We use 3rd party data sources to check the history of the principal/owner of the business for bankruptcy filings by or against them.
Legal Search for Civil Judgments
            We use 3rd party data sources to check the principal/owner of the business for state level civil legal judgments entered against them.
Liens Search
            We use 3rd party data sources to check the principal/owner of the business for liens placed against them.
Identity Verification (SSN)
            HomeAdvisor verifies the social security number(s) of the owner/principal for identity check purposes. This check applies primarily to smaller business entities.
Identity Verification (Reverse Phone Lookup)
            We conduct a reverse business phone lookup to identify records matching the phone number information provided by the business.








NOTE: Member service professional information confirmed as described above may change or expire over time; while HomeAdvisor attempts to maintain accurate and up-to-date information, and confirms changes when notified, we cannot guarantee that profile and screening information is accurate. Therefore, we recommend that before working with a service professional you verify that information presented is still current and/or acceptable to you.

            HomeAdvisor's Terms and Conditions for a full description of how we screen Service Professionals


**Only for U.S. service professionals 
















            HomeAdvisor's Screening Process
         
HomeAdvisor uses the following criteria to screen service professionals at the time they apply for membership in our network:







Licensing
Applicants must carry required state-level licensing to perform work in the trade and service area for which they apply.




Sex Offender Search
We check the official sex offender website in the state in which the owner/principal of the company is located to confirm that there is not a match with the applicant.




Legal Search for Civil Judgments
We use third-party data sources to check the principal/owner of each business for bankruptcy filings and significant state-level civil legal judgments, in the state in which the owner/principal of the company is located, occurring within 12 months prior to application for membership in the HomeAdvisor network.






Criminal Records Search
HomeAdvisor uses third-party sources to conduct a criminal search, in the state in which the owner/principal of the company is located, for relevant criminal activity associated with the business owner/principal within three years prior to application.




State Business Filings
We confirm that service professionals applying as corporations or limited liability companies are in good standing in the state in which they are located.




Identity Verification (Social Security Number)
HomeAdvisor verifies the social security numbers of business owners/principals to confirm their identities. (This applies primarily to small businesses.)







            Notification to residents of AL, CO, DE, GA, ID, KS, KY, LA, ME, MA, MI, MS, MT, NE, NV, NH, NM, SD, UT, VA, VT, WY: HomeAdvisor uses a third party to screen professionals. The comprehensiveness of the records included in the national criminal database which our third party vendor uses varies by state. Please be aware that your state may be limited in its reporting. For more information click on the "Instant Database Searches" tab on the following webpage:

A Customer Writes:

To the folks at Robert Craig ~

I don't believe I've ever written to a company in praise of a product before. However, my experience with your hair color has finally prompted me to write.

I am 47 and have been coloring my hair since age 25, when I started getting my first grays. I've used highlights, semi-permanent, demi-permanent, and permanent hair colors and with a few exceptions, have always colored at home using "drugstore" products.

I found Robert Craig hair color online while looking for a less damaging alternative to traditional permanent hair colors. My hair was dry and fried from using drugstore products, and I was really tired of being dissatisfied with the condition of my hair. I began using Robert Craig hair color in November 2007 and have finally gotten to the point where my hair has grown out and been cut enough that all the previously colored (with drugstore colors) hair is gone. My hair is softer than it has been since I started coloring 22 years ago. The Robert Craig hair color looks so incredibly natural, my hair looks like it did in high school again. And the way it feels to the touch is completely different now. It is soft again, not fried.

Thank you so much -- I will never use another hair coloring product. Never!

Emily S. in North Carolina

HOUSTON and LONDON, Jan. 14, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- LyondellBasell (NYSE: LYB), one of the world's largest plastics, chemical and refining companies, today announced several senior leadership changes.
After four years with LyondellBasell, Timothy D. Roberts, executive vice president of global Olefins and Polyolefins has announced his decision to leave the company. Mr. Roberts will be succeeded by Daniel M. Coombs who joined LyondellBasell last year as executive vice president of global Intermediates and Derivatives, Technology and Procurement.  Mr. Coombs brings 30 years of experience in petrochemicals, including leadership roles in commercial, manufacturing and joint ventures in the Middle East.  
"We will miss Tim's leadership and energy. We thank him for his significant contributions and wish him all the best in his future endeavors," said Bob Patel, LyondellBasell's CEO. "I feel confident that our depth of talent and prior succession planning allows for a smooth transition and continued industry-leading performance."
James D. Guilfoyle, currently senior vice president, global Intermediates and Derivatives, will continue in his current role while assuming additional responsibilities for the company's supply chain activities. For the past year, Mr. Guilfoyle has worked closely with Mr. Coombs leading the company's global Intermediates and Derivatives business.
"As part of our strong leadership team, Dan and Jim have made a tremendous positive impact on our business," said Mr. Patel.

Mr. Coombs and Mr. Guilfoyle will report to Mr. Patel. 
As part of this transition, LyondellBasell will further expand its regional leadership by appointing Paul Augustowski as senior vice president of Olefins and Polyolefins in the Americas. Mr. Augustowski has over two decades of experience in Polyolefins, in the U.S. and Europe. Richard Roudeix will continue as the European Olefins and Polyolefins business leader. Mr. Augustowski and Mr. Roudeix will report to Mr. Coombs.

Photography: Imagery has never been more important. It’s been said that a picture is worth a thousand words. Now, more than ever, this is true. The viewer interprets a visual image far faster than the printed or spoken word. Our spectacular in house photography is available to create magic for your brand. Why? It’s simple. […]

PGA National Resort and Spa-A Revival
Established in 1981
5 golf courses, 339 guestrooms
Site of the 1983 Ryder Cup
Virtually untouched for more than twenty years. 
Marketing was virtually non-existent. 
The property had become irrelevant 
The ADR was shy of $100. The directive was obvious.
READ MORE

However, it had remained untouched for more than twenty years, and marketing was virtually non-existent. The property had become irrelevant and the ADR which should have been in the range of $200 was shy of $100. The directive was obvious.
Daniels + Roberts was engaged shortly after an asset acquisition and just prior to an initial $68 MM capital investment. D+R began with a guest history study, consisting of RFM analysis and geo-demographic cluster segmentation. While ownership and management believed the guest profile was middle- income, the PSYTE cluster segmentation revealed that the guest socio-economics were substantially higher than perceived. The highest income segment in the US indexed 5 times more likely to pursue this destination while middle income clusters indexed far below average.
A multivariate analysis was performed utilizing data appended from our behavioral and attitudinal databases to further enhance the target guest profile.
For group marketing, we identified key attributes and performed a discreet choice analysis directed at decision makers. At the same time, a qualitative study assisted us gaining a thorough knowledge of certain obstacles and pain points within each meeting planner present.. Creative executions were directed to enhance their self-worth and perceived importance with their existing corporate structure.
The anecdotal perceptions from ownership were local Florida and NE corridors were the feeder markets. This was consistent with omnibus studies and Florida market data. However, our analysis revealed a more educated, younger, geographically diverse guest than originally thought.
It was clear that this destination and client base could already support a rate increase as long as experience supported it and the message increased the perception. The brand possessed high consumer loyalty indicated by returning guests and bounce back strategies were utilized to drive sales during construction period and guaranteed a return visit to experience the NEW property.
Daniels + Roberts developed an integrated marketing plan which included on and offline programs directed at transient and group (incentive) markets inclusive of a high perceived value direct marketing initiative directed at the group market and experiential microsites portraying the NEW PGA National.
PGA National Resort and Spa profitably maintained operations throughout the entire renovation process, increased annualized ADR in excess of 100% and increased group and incentive sales resulting in increase of annualized occupancy by 32%.


 
Interesting headlines and beautiful visuals introduce the renovation in a unique way.

Retail: $16.00 Save 47%
($7.51)  5 Stars Out Of 5 3 Reviews 


Publisher's Description▼▲
How can the sixty-six books of the Bible have a single message for us today? What unites the vastly different accounts of God's work in the world? How do the various genres of the Bible work together? Vaughan Roberts believes that the Bible tells a single story for all time. He draws out the Bible's message of Jesus Christ and God's redemption through him in six big questions:  Who rules the world? What does it mean to be human? How should we view money? Is a perfect relationship possible? How does the Holy Spirit work in the world and in our lives? What is God's plan for the world?  This companion volume to Roberts's previous book, God's Big Picture, will not only help you answer these questions, but also give you tools to transform your own Bible study in light of the whole story of God.


Author Bio▼▲
Vaughan Roberts is rector of St. Ebbe's Church in Oxford, England, and author of  and  He is also a popular speaker at Spring Harvest and a founding member of "9:38" which encourages people to consider full-time gospel ministry.

about
DATA DRIVEN: DATA SPEAKS VOLUMES. IF YOU KNOW WHAT TO LISTEN FOR.Data is coming at us from every direction. Everyone seems to be collecting it, analyzing it, profiting from it and talking about it. Whether we’re talking about web analytics or consumer purchase history, demographic, psychographic or behavioral data, it’s all out there for the taking. But, determining what to do with it is what counts.  That’s where we step in. Unlocking the core truths of relevant data, we will develop a clear actionable plan to achieve your objectives.
CREATIVELY FUELED: TURNING DATA INTO DESIRE.
Utilizing data is one thing, converting it into prospects, customers, brand advocates, brand value and revenue is quite another. We combine the power of data with creativity to deliver rich, engaging brand experiences. By harnessing and embracing this combination, we can develop storytelling that is meaningful to your audience. In essence, turning data into desire.

Research: It’s the foundation of everything we do. Whether it’s to determine the prioritized attributes of a specific market segment in a decision making process, the emotional effects of a brand on a consumers’ psyche, statistically driven multivariate analysis to yield certainty levels in excess of 95% or simply the analysis of all existing literature and information globally available and competitive analysis — it’s the initial stage in truly predictive decision making.


Analytics: Marketing decisions should be founded in analytics and have a measurable outcome. Yet, decision making as a science is far from the norm. Marketing strategies are still widely developed instinctively as though they are something intuitively divined. Even marketing research driven decisions are often based on questionable methodologies and made with less than acceptable levels of confidence. With Daniel + Roberts, every decision or recommendation is based on verifiable statistical research. We don’t divine or intuit anything. We remove the words “assume” and “believe” from your vocabulary. We actually make predictive analytics happen.


Strategy: Whether the objective is generating sales, building brands or changing social behavior, we start with a substructure of understanding who the customers is. Not just a segmentation study but our  proprietary segmentation study. Your marketing strategy utilizes those segments along with our available 20,000 databases consisting of behavioral, attitudinal and dedicated media consumption statistics. We then develop an approach that is statistically valid, easy to communicate and makes sense.


Brand Planning: Successful brands know what they stand for and have an understanding of where they fit into the culture at large. It’s no longer just about making a good product and the sales will follow. This is especially true in a social media landscape that is dynamic and fluid. Consumers expect companies to make good products, but they expect more: social responsibility, corporate citizenship and relevance. We can help you be a part of the conversation of consumers by creating brand platforms that create bonds between you and your customers. And those are the bonds that build business.


Creative: Writers, artists, technologists, editors and thinkers all come together here. Sometimes their ideas are big and bold, sometimes they are subtle and nimble, but they must always be inspired. Making something, relevant, fun, joyful and emotional is the job of the creative. These folks are a little different. They think differently and look at the world in unique ways. But then again, what epic idea ever came from looking at things the same old way?


Digital:  Computers, smartphones, tablets, smart TVs and of course wearable technologies, the digital world has opened up unprecedented new ways to reach out and connect with your clients and customers. With our understanding of data utilization, creative development and technology implementation, we have the know-how to develop targeted and influential multi-channel programs that connect people with your brand experience, product or service through digital, social, mobile and eCommerce.


Media Planning and Buying: There is no one way to reach an audience. Media choices multiply daily, some burning out before they get started, others changing the landscape forever. Print, digital, social, sweepstakes, promotions are options, or, a combination of all. Wherever your audience is, we reach them.


Social Influence: To be an effective brand you must be part of the social conversation. Our storytellers, digital strategists, content developers and relationship experts will help you manage your story. The new economy is the economy of social influence and we offer a full range of solutions and ideas to make you a positive part of the social dialogue.


Photography: Imagery has never been more important. It’s been said that a picture is worth a thousand words. Now, more than ever, this is true. The viewer interprets a visual image far faster than the printed or spoken word. Our spectacular in house photography is available to create magic for your brand. Why? It’s simple. We believe it offers us more control, is efficient, cost effective and provides for yet another touchpoint that is absolutely unique and yours alone.
