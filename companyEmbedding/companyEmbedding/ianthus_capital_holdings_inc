iAnthus Capital Holdings, Inc. Details Accomplishments in 2016 and Progress in 2017
With US$19.1 million Invested in Five Cannabis Operations Since the Beginning of 2016, iAnthus Continues to Grow and Diversify its Investments in 2017
TORONTO, ON and NEW YORK, NY — (Marketwired) — 05/02/17 —
iAnthus Capital Holdings, Inc. (“iAnthus” or “the Company”), (CSE: IAN)(OTCQB: ITHUF), a provider of capital investment and management services to licensed cannabis cultivators, processors and dispensaries throughout the United States, is pleased to release its 2016 audited financial statements and provide a year in review.
2016 was a transformational year for iAnthus as it became the first public company listed in Canada to provide broad investor exposure to licensed United States cannabis operations. The Company currently has five active investments in four states across the United States. We are pleased to provide a recap of accomplishments in 2016 and iAnthus’ year to date progress of 2017.
Hadley Ford, Chief Executive Officer of iAnthus
“The cannabis industry in the U.S. has flourished in the last five years, with twenty-nine (29) states currently having adopted full-strength medical cannabis programs and eight (8) of those states permitting adult-use sales as well. We are also encouraged by the multiple marijuana-related bills that have been introduced in the U.S. Congress, which demonstrate support from legislators on both sides of the aisle to provide a national regulatory framework and favorable business climate for the industry,” said Randy Maslow, President of iAnthus.
iAnthus has built a unique platform and footprint across the U.S. In the short term, we plan to convert several of our loans to majority control equity positions to provide investors additional transparency into the operating results of our investment. We look forward to making additional investments in greenfield states as well as acquiring assets that have strong track-records of revenue growth and cash flow generation.
Julius Kalcevich, CFO of iAnthus

New Legislation to Improve Vermont's Medical Cannabis Program


iAnthus and Grassroots Vermont weigh in on new legislation in Vermont that significantly expands the state's medical marijuana program
TORONTO, ON and NEW YORK, NY--(Marketwired - July 17, 2017) -  iAnthus Capital Holdings, Inc. ("iAnthus" or "the Company"), (CSE: IAN) (CSE: IAN.CN) (CNSX: IAN) (OTCQB: ITHUF), which owns, operates, and partners with licensed cannabis operations throughout the United States, provides the following update on the completion of the 2017 Vermont legislative session and the passage into law of S.16, a bill that significantly expands the state's medical cannabis program. As the sole provider of financing and management services to Grassroots Vermont ("Grassroots"), one of the four non-profit entities currently licensed to dispense medical cannabis to patients across the state, iAnthus views Governor Scott's recent signing of S.16 as a significant stepping stone for the expansion of the state's legal cannabis market. S.16 adds Crohn's Disease, Parkinson's Disease, and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder to Vermont's list of qualifying conditions. The new law also provides Grassroots with the ability to expand its operations by opening an additional dispensary location, in addition to its existing dispensary in Brandon. "We support the efforts made by the state to make the medical cannabis program more accessible to Vermont's qualified patients," says Alex Ford, Executive Director of Grassroots. "We look forward to securing our second dispensary location so that we can provide more patients with the highest quality, affordable medical cannabis."Grassroots is currently upgrading its cultivation facility in Brandon, Vermont. The improvements are expected to increase yields, support consistent harvest cycles, and improve product quality year-round, and is expected to be completed in Q3 2017. This infrastructure, combined with operational expertise provided by iAnthus, has laid the foundation for ample production capacity to serve a significantly larger patient population from the new medical expansion if required.During Vermont's 2017 legislative session, lawmakers also considered the legalization of cannabis for adult use. While an adult use bill was passed by both the Vermont House and Senate, the bill was vetoed by the Governor, who nevertheless indicated a willingness to support adult use legislation in the future provided that certain concerns were addressed to his satisfaction. With the legalization of adult use in Massachusetts and Maine this past November, it is expected that an amended version of the 2017 bill will be considered during the next legislative session. If passed, Vermont's adult use cannabis market could exceed US$100 million, according to the 2015 "Considering Marijuana Legalization -- Insights for Vermont and Other Jurisdictions" report from the RAND Corporation. "While it is impossible to be certain that the state will revisit legalization of cannabis for adult use in the 2018 legislative session, Governor Scott has certainly expressed his willingness to work with lawmakers on this initiative, and I believe we are likely to see another adult use bill proposed in the next legislative session," said Randy Maslow, President of iAnthus.S.16 also allows existing license holders to convert from a non-profit organization into a for-profit entity, an opportunity that Grassroots is currently exploring with iAnthus. As of June 30, 2017, iAnthus has provided Grassroots with a credit facility of US$775,000.About iAnthus Capital Holdings, Inc.iAnthus Capital Holdings, Inc. provides investors diversified exposure to best-in-class licensed cannabis cultivators, processors and dispensaries throughout the United States.

September 7, 2016 (Source) — iAnthus Capital Holdings, Inc. (“iAnthus” or the “Company”) (CSE: IAN), which delivers a comprehensive solution for financing and managing licensed cannabis cultivators, processors and dispensaries throughout the United States, today announced that its common shares will being trading on the Canadian Securities Exchange (the “CSE”) on September 7, 2016 under the ticker symbol “IAN”.
“We believe there is a significant opportunity to provide financing to the U.S. cannabis industry right now,” said Hadley Ford, CEO of iAnthus. “This is an existing $50 billion industry moving from a shadow economy to a legalized, highly-regulated business opportunity governed by individual state laws and regulatory systems. There is a serious lack of investment capital currently available to fund this industry transition. iAnthus is poised to fill that gap by sourcing capital through the Canadian public markets, thereby offering the opportunity to participate in the industry’s growth to the investment community as well.”
iAnthus Capital Management, LLC, iAnthus’ wholly-owned subsidiary, was formed in September 2014 to capitalize on the rapidly growing U.S. regulated cannabis (marijuana) market and the unique opportunity that exists for providing capital investment and expert management services to licensed cultivators, product manufacturers and dispensaries. iAnthus previously announced the closing of a US$6.7 million private placement in May, 2016. Funds from the private placement will be used to invest in its existing partners in Massachusetts, New Mexico and Vermont.
Additional information about iAnthus may be accessed on the Company’s website at www.ianthuscapital.com and under the Company’s SEDAR profile at www.sedar.com.

iAnthus Capital upbeat on new Vermont bill, which expands medical pot program

If passed, Vermont's adult use cannabis market could potentially exceed US$100 million, according to one report.


 

The medical pot program has been expanded in Vermont with the S.16 bill








	Cannabis-focused financier iAnthus Capital Holdings Inc (CSE:IAN, OTCQB:ITHUF) has welcomed latest legal changes in the state of Vermont, USA, which expands its medical marijuana program.

	One Governor Scott has recently signed S.16 into law, which adds Crohn's Disease, Parkinson's Disease, and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder to Vermont's list of qualifying conditions in the legalised market.

	"While it is impossible to be certain that the state will revisit legalization of cannabis for adult use in the 2018 legislative session, Governor Scott has certainly expressed his willingness to work with lawmakers on this initiative, and I believe we are likely to see another adult use bill proposed in the next legislative session," Randy Maslow, the president of iAnthus, told investors.

	If passed, Vermont's adult use cannabis market could potentially exceed US$100 million, according to  a report in 2015.

	IAnthus is the sole provider of financing and management services to Grassroots Vermont - one of the four non-profit entities currently licensed to dispense medical cannabis to patients across the state. 

	It has provided it with a credit facility of US$775,000.

	This new law also allows Grassroots to expand its operations by opening an additional dispensary location, in addition to its existing one in Brandon.

	"We support the efforts made by the state to make the medical cannabis program more accessible to Vermont's qualified patients," says Alex Ford, Executive Director of Grassroots.

	"We look forward to securing our second dispensary location so that we can provide more patients with the highest quality, affordable medical cannabis."

	During Vermont's 2017 legislative session, lawmakers also considered the legalization of cannabis for adult use.

	While an adult use bill was passed by both the Vermont House and Senate, the bill was vetoed by the Governor, who nevertheless indicated a willingness to support adult use legislation in the future provided that certain concerns were addressed.

	Shares eased 2.52% to $3.10.

If passed, Vermont's adult use cannabis market could potentially exceed US$100 million, according to one report.


 

The medical pot program has been expanded in Vermont with the S.16 bill








	Cannabis-focused financier iAnthus Capital Holdings Inc (CSE:IAN, OTCQB:ITHUF) has welcomed latest legal changes in the state of Vermont, USA, which expands its medical marijuana program.

	One Governor Scott has recently signed S.16 into law, which adds Crohn's Disease, Parkinson's Disease, and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder to Vermont's list of qualifying conditions in the legalised market.

	"While it is impossible to be certain that the state will revisit legalization of cannabis for adult use in the 2018 legislative session, Governor Scott has certainly expressed his willingness to work with lawmakers on this initiative, and I believe we are likely to see another adult use bill proposed in the next legislative session," Randy Maslow, the president of iAnthus, told investors.

	If passed, Vermont's adult use cannabis market could potentially exceed US$100 million, according to  a report in 2015.

	IAnthus is the sole provider of financing and management services to Grassroots Vermont - one of the four non-profit entities currently licensed to dispense medical cannabis to patients across the state. 

	It has provided it with a credit facility of US$775,000.

	This new law also allows Grassroots to expand its operations by opening an additional dispensary location, in addition to its existing one in Brandon.

	"We support the efforts made by the state to make the medical cannabis program more accessible to Vermont's qualified patients," says Alex Ford, Executive Director of Grassroots.

	"We look forward to securing our second dispensary location so that we can provide more patients with the highest quality, affordable medical cannabis."

	During Vermont's 2017 legislative session, lawmakers also considered the legalization of cannabis for adult use.

	While an adult use bill was passed by both the Vermont House and Senate, the bill was vetoed by the Governor, who nevertheless indicated a willingness to support adult use legislation in the future provided that certain concerns were addressed.

	Shares eased 2.52% to $3.10.

Our careers span investment banking and corporate finance, healthcare operations, facilities management, regulatory compliance, public policy advocacy and patient and physician outreach. As a result, our insights are hard won and grounded in real-world experience.
 Strategic Alliances
The cannabis industry is complex and increasingly competitive.

To equip our partners to confidently address these matters, iAnthus has developed strategic partnerships with best-in-class industry-sector leaders in dispensary operations, commercial-scale cannabis cultivation, regulatory law, and the science of cannabis product formulation and testing.

Expanding exponentially, legalized cannabis is the fastest growing industry in the U.S. today and an exceptional opportunity for investors. Half of the American states have legalized full-strength cannabis for either medical or adult use. Direct legal cannabis sales in the U.S. are estimated at $6.7 billion in 2016 and projected to grow to $21.8 billion annually by 2020. iAnthus provides a diversified investment opportunity in licensed operations across multiple favorable U.S. cannabis markets, managed by an experienced team.
