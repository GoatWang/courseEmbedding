Capture Growth In An Emerging Market Consumer Spending ETF









































































                        The emerging market consumer story may not be a new one, but it is certainly a compelling one. Would it surprise you to learn, however,
                        that some of the leading indexes focused on emerging market consumers do not typically incorporate valuation measures? We believe this may expose
                        investors to undue risk. The WisdomTree Emerging Markets Consumer Growth Fund, EMCG, seeks to help investors more fully capitalize on the
                        emerging market consumer growth trends, while maintaining a sensitivity to valuation.

                                    There are risks associated with investing, including possible loss of principal.  Foreign investing involves special risks, such as risk of loss from currency fluctuation or political or economic uncertainty.  Funds focusing on a single sector and/or smaller companies generally experience greater price volatility.  Investments in emerging, offshore or frontier markets are generally less liquid and less efficient than investments in developed markets and are subject to additional risks, such as risks of adverse governmental regulation, intervention and political developments.  Due to the investment strategy of this Fund it may make higher capital gain distributions than other ETFs.  Please read the Fund’s prospectus for specific details regarding the Fund’s risk profile.

					Opalesque Industry Update - Monsoon Capital said it would launch its new India fundamental long/short equity fund, Monsoon India Dynamic Alpha Fund (MIDAS), on November 1, 2016.  Both the Delaware limited partnership (for US taxable investors) and the offshore fund (for non-US investors and tax-exempts) are now open for monthly subscriptions.  We are offering discounted fees for early investors.

Monsoon Capital is a $200 million alternatives manager focused on India.  "We have over 12 years of experience investing in the Indian capital markets with a 20+ person team based in Mumbai and Washington, DC.  We believe that India provides attractive investment opportunities as one of the fastest growing major economies in the world," said Gautam Prakash.

He added, "Having invested in India through multiple market cycles, we developed the MIDAS strategy by combining a fundamental long-only stock selection process with an active dynamic hedging model to manage both equity market and currency risks.  So, in rising markets MIDAS will tend to have high net exposures (+75% to +90% net long) while in falling markets MIDAS will tend to have low net exposures (0% to +45% net long), all the while maintaining a long-term portfolio of high quality, high growth stocks."

 Similarly, when the Rupee is depreciating, MIDAS will typically be currency hedged whereas when the Rupee is appreciating, MIDAS will typicall be unhedged on the currency.  This dynamic approach enables MIDAS to generate attractive gains in bull markets while controlling losses in bear markets.

Alpha
A measure of the difference between a fund's actual returns and its expected performance, given its level of risk as measured by beta. 
A positive alpha figure indicates the fund has performed better than its beta would predict. In contrast, a negative alpha indicates the fund's underperformance, given the expectations established by the fund's beta. 
All MPT statistics (alpha, beta, and R-squared) are based on a least-squares regression of the fund's return over Treasury bills (called excess return) and the excess returns of the fund's benchmark index. 
Alpha can be used to directly measure the value added or subtracted by a fund's manager. 
Alpha depends on two factors: 
1) the assumption that market risk, as measured by beta, is the only risk measure necessary  
2) the strength of the linear relationship between the fund and the index, as it has been measured by R-squared. 
In addition, a negative alpha can sometimes result from the expenses that are present in a fund's returns, but not in the returns of the comparison index. 
Example: A fund has an alpha of 0.86, a beta of 0.96 and an R-squared of 97. The high R-squared lends further credibility to the accuracy of the fund's alpha and beta. The alpha of 0.86 indicates that the fund produced a return 0.86% higher than its beta would predict.

Capture Growth In An Emerging Market Consumer Spending ETF









































































                        The emerging market consumer story may not be a new one, but it is certainly a compelling one. Would it surprise you to learn, however,
                        that some of the leading indexes focused on emerging market consumers do not typically incorporate valuation measures? We believe this may expose
                        investors to undue risk. The WisdomTree Emerging Markets Consumer Growth Fund, EMCG, seeks to help investors more fully capitalize on the
                        emerging market consumer growth trends, while maintaining a sensitivity to valuation.

Investors should carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Funds before investing. To obtain a prospectus containing this and other important information, please call 1-866-909-WISE (9473) or click here to download a prospectus online. Read the prospectus carefully before you invest.

                                    There are risks associated with investing, including possible loss of principal.  Foreign investing involves special risks, such as risk of loss from currency fluctuation or political or economic uncertainty.  Funds focusing on a single sector and/or smaller companies generally experience greater price volatility.  Investments in emerging, offshore or frontier markets are generally less liquid and less efficient than investments in developed markets and are subject to additional risks, such as risks of adverse governmental regulation, intervention and political developments.  Due to the investment strategy of this Fund it may make higher capital gain distributions than other ETFs.  Please read the Fund’s prospectus for specific details regarding the Fund’s risk profile.
