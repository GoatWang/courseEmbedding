August Home Inc Partners with HomeAway, Inc to Deliver Simple Secure Access Via Smart Keypad Pin Code
Apr 18 17
August Home Inc. is partnering HomeAway Inc. Now it’s easier for hosts to give guests secure, keyless access to their listing using an August Smart Lock and August Smart Keypad. After making a reservation for a vacation rental with August Home products, HomeAway guests automatically receive a secure PIN code for their stay through the HomeAway app they used to make their reservation there’s nothing else for them to do or download. The vacation rental market continues to grow, fueled by tech innovation including smart home technology, which delivers a better, more secure and convenient experience for both hosts and guests, according to the August Home study, Short-term Rentals: Smarter Hosting with Smart Home Technology. Guests indicate not worrying about being locked out (53%), not having to coordinate with hosts when arriving or departing a property (48%), providing an easier system for checking-in and checking-out (46%) and a carefree, key-free stay would make the rental experience less stressful for them. For hosts, stress-relievers include not having to worry about guests forgetting to lock the door (66%) and no more hiding keys where someone besides the guest might find them (34%). Any reservation changes or cancellations automatically change the access times and days for the property. These changes are also reflected inside the HomeAway Traveler app and HomeAway Owner Dashboard. Once the reservation ends, access to the property automatically ends. Providing secure PIN code access to a property with an August Smart Keypad requires an August Smart Lock. Remotely provisioning a Smart Keypad PIN code requires the August Connect Wi-Fi Bridge.


HomeAway Faces Lawsuit over Alleged Trademark Infringement
Feb 19 16
Omni Hotels Management Corp. is suing HomeAway Inc. for alleged trademark violation. In the suit, filed on February 17, 2016 in the federal Northern District of Texas court, Dallas-based Omni argues that some listings on the company’s website infringe on trademarks for its La Costa Resort and Spa in Carlsbad, California and for the Rancho Las Palmas Resort and Spa in Rancho Mirage, California, as well as for the Omni brand in general. In the suit, Omni highlights several vacation rentals on the company’s site that either mention their proximity to or location within those resorts or include photographs that depict resort signage or logos.
