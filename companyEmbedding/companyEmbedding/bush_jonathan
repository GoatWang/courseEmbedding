Bush Furniture
Bush Furniture is a true market leader in the manufacturing of affordable furniture solutions that will stand the test of time. With over 50 years of market experience, they have put themselves ahead of the pack by adhering to self-imposed safety standards that are well above the market standard. Bush has come a long way from its small beginnings as a small company who specialized in making flat-packed hampers. The hampers were a great success and that lead them to create a line of snap-together TV stands in 1972. Since then, the company has experienced international success. They are still headquartered today in Jamestown, NY with manufacturing plants in Pennsylvania, New York, Germany and China. Trust Bush for exceptional quality and style.Read More
Bush Series A
Series A is a no-frills collection of office furniture that's destined to be the workhorse of your office – whether big or small. But just this version of "basic" doesn't cut any corners. Series A is a totally modular system, which means that it's easy to incorporate into any work environment.  A variety of shapes and configurations are available so that you can custom tailor Series A to your workspace. Clever storage is integrated into the desks and the optional hutches. Use a lateral file for your important documents or a corner overhead shelving unit to make the most of your space. Bush Series A is available in a range of colors and finishes so that your new system will coordinate with your space.
All Bush products offer commercial grade quality to withstand the test of time. Durable thermally-fused laminate surfaces are over 1" thick and have been specially designed to withstand the rigors of a 40+ hour work week. All surfaces are glare, stain and scratch resistant. Grommets and wire management systems have been incorporated to keep your work space tidy.

                                                    This product is perfect for our use. My old work station was nothing like this one, because it lacked storage space. What's grea
                                                    
                                                        t about this work station is the printer shelf on top for easy access and a CD rack at arm's length. The only thing that's not great is the lack of a draw, but you really don't need it. it's great for personal use.

Bush Furniture
Bush Furniture is a true market leader in the manufacturing of affordable furniture solutions that will stand the test of time. With over 50 years of market experience, they have put themselves ahead of the pack by adhering to self-imposed safety standards that are well above the market standard. Bush has come a long way from its small beginnings as a small company who specialized in making flat-packed hampers. The hampers were a great success and that lead them to create a line of snap-together TV stands in 1972. Since then, the company has experienced international success. They are still headquartered today in Jamestown, NY with manufacturing plants in Pennsylvania, New York, Germany and China. Trust Bush for exceptional quality and style.Read More
Bush Series A
Series A is a no-frills collection of office furniture that's destined to be the workhorse of your office – whether big or small. But just this version of "basic" doesn't cut any corners. Series A is a totally modular system, which means that it's easy to incorporate into any work environment.  A variety of shapes and configurations are available so that you can custom tailor Series A to your workspace. Clever storage is integrated into the desks and the optional hutches. Use a lateral file for your important documents or a corner overhead shelving unit to make the most of your space. Bush Series A is available in a range of colors and finishes so that your new system will coordinate with your space.
All Bush products offer commercial grade quality to withstand the test of time. Durable thermally-fused laminate surfaces are over 1" thick and have been specially designed to withstand the rigors of a 40+ hour work week. All surfaces are glare, stain and scratch resistant. Grommets and wire management systems have been incorporated to keep your work space tidy.

MACRA & MIPS FAQs



What is MACRA?



MACRA stands for the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015. The act was signed into law in early 2015 and makes substantial changes to the government’s health care payment system. The significant portions include permanently repealing the Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR) formula for determining provider payments and changing the Medicare physician fee schedule by establishing two new tracks for reimbursement: the Merit Based Incentive Payment System (MIPS) and Alternate Payment Models (APMs).






What is the purpose of MACRA?



CMS’s goal for MACRA is to reward providers for better, lower-cost, patient-centered care.
 
CMS continues to promote the shift away from fee-for-service payments to adopting alternative payment models (APMs) to hit industry goals of having 50% of Medicare payments made through APMs, and having 90% of remaining fee-for-service payments tied to quality and value by the end of 2018.






What is the timeline for MACRA?



The first performance year began on January 1, 2017 and will impact payments adjustments in 2019.






What providers are affected by MACRA?



MACRA, and the Quality Payment Programs that come out of it, will impact most providers across the country. Check CMS’s website to see if you must participate qpp.cms.gov

4.0 out of 5 starsThe Book of JoeByRichda  D. McNutton April 14, 2017Tropper has the ability to create unlikable, failed characters with whom you (eventually) connect and feel a great deal of sympathy for.  And he can wallop you with sentences that pierce straight to the heart.  I've read three of his books (This is Where I Leave You, One Last Thing Before I Go, and this one), and I have liked all of them - very much.  His books deal with sad subjects (and people), and they're not what I would call 'inspirational,' but they're also not depressing.  They make you realize that most people can be given a second chance at any time in their lives if they will look at themselves honestly, face what's holding them back, forgive what needs forgiving, and move beyond what can't be forgotten.

2.0 out of 5 starsCouldn't Suspend My Disbelief for the AIDS characterByRick R. Reedon September 18, 2013First off, this was a difficult book to rate. On the plus side, it made me laugh; it made me cry. I was caught up in the character's lives and cared about them. The author has a winning and simple way with prose. The negatives are what made me downrate it so much. Aside from the main character's intense self-pity that we're hammered over the head with, I had trouble suspending my disbelief for his best friend, Wayne, who deserved a much fresher and more thoughtful approach. Wayne is one of two gay characters in the book; the other dies as a teenage suicide. And, of course, Wayne himself is dying of AIDS, KS, wasting, the whole nine yards. The problem with this, and the place where the author loses credibility for me, is that Wayne's full-blown AIDS occurs in 2004. In 2004, a whole array of live-saving and health-maintaining drug cocktails were on the market to treat HIV. As someone very familiar with the HIV/AIDS landscape, I had trouble believing Wayne. His character would have been more believable in the early 90s, when such cases were much more common. In 2004, it was much rarer to find someone with full-blown AIDS, especially in a relatively affluent part of the US. I'm not saying people still don't die from AIDS (or didn't in 2004), I'm just saying it's rarer. The author, at the very least, should have had a conversation wherein Wayne laments that none of the cocktails worked for him. It happens. But the way it is now, I just think the author was ignorant about gay people and the disease and that made it hard for me to enjoy what otherwise was an enjoyable book. Even better, though, would have been not to saddle the gay main character with something as stereotypical as AIDS, but something like Stage 4 cancer. The same results could have been achieved without resorting to the cliche.

And for someone who majored in literature for 3 degrees, that says something. Of course, I'm not comparing this to any of the books in the canon, but even then I think it would stand on it's own.Joe stopped developing (emotionally) when a very bad thing occurred during his senior year of high school. 17 yrs later, he returns to his hometown as a celebrity with whom everyone in town is rather disgusted. His book is thrown at him repeatedly, in a somewhat humorous way. He develops a fun and interesting relationship with his nephew. He discovers his brother does not live the perfect life he had previously assumed. And much much more. In short, he grows up and sees the people around him as full-fledged humans, as people with flaws and beauty and mistakes and profound love. His coming of age story will literally make you laugh, cry, and refuse to put the book down until you reach the end.I HIGHLY recommend this book to anyone who reads.22 comments|

There was a problem loading comments right now. Please try again later.5.0 out of 5 starsWhen the book ended I felt like I was leaving good friends behind.ByWilliam Heathon February 25, 2015Format: Kindle Edition|Verified PurchaseAmazingly well-written, the ability of the story to grab the reader and hold on is similar to the late "This is Where I Leave You."The characters are compelling. Joe is a one-hit wonder of an author. His best-selling book savaged and ravaged his home town, where high school basketball has been made into a religion, with the high school coach its high priest. Joe's father - whose death brings Joe back to town - was a star fifty years earlier. His older brother, with whom he has a strained relationship on the best of days, was a star twenty years ago. His best friend was a star 17 years ago, but left town suddenly after his greatest game. His friend has also returned to town - to die.The town could have been treated as a parody of small-town America, but it was not. Despite a token unreformed high school bully and a predictable rural sheriff's deputy, the town works as a locale for the tale. As with several other Tropper novels, The Book of Joe deals with bruised and broken relationships and characters overcome by dynamic periods in their history. Some characters grow, some revert to type, others change without growing. By the closing pages no character is the same one first encountered in the story - especially the high priest (coach).When the book ended I felt like I was leaving good friends behind.0Comment|

There was a problem loading comments right now. Please try again later.5.0 out of 5 starsJonathan Tropper - my favorite new (to me) authorByJustin Jeromeon May 9, 2017Format: Paperback|Verified PurchaseFirst, just wanted to say Jonathan Tropper is my favorite new (to me) author and I don't think I could pick a fave book of his if you tied me up and tried to make me, but I read this one first, so I'll review it :)  His plots and characters are right up my alley.  This was a pretty quick read and I'm a notoriously slow reader.I've been a bookworm all my life.  I used to almost only read horror/thriller (read: Stephen King and Dean Koontz), especially after college when I started working full time, as with our modern, fast paced society and the internet taking up all our time, I only had time to read my favorite authors and genres.  However, as I began my 30s, after some career difficulties, I was suddenly "lucky" enough to have more free time.  Plus the fact that I was at a crossroads in my life, re-evaluating who I was and what I wanted out of life, it was the perfect storm that got me to check out more authors and genres.  And got me into the genre of quirky, indie "dramedy" films.  I related to the characters and plots so much as it was exactly what I was going through in my life.  And who I always had been, but had been brainwashed by our capitalist, Type A society into thinking you had to only be (or at least want to be) a certain type of person.  One who acts like they've got it all figured out, while the rest of us just feel alienated and lost.  The characters in these movies felt way more real than most Hollywood stuff and it was like a new world had been opened up to me.  Suddenly it felt ok to be who I am.So it was only a matter of time before I'd check out the "book versions" of these films.  After reading the amazing We're All Damaged by Matthew Norman, I had to find more just like it.  So I tried this book after seeing it recommended to me here.  I instantly related to Joe - his struggles and his quirks.  I only wish I could be as quick witted and funny as him :)  So it troubles me when I read reviews where people call characters like this a "loser", "whiny", "boring", "milquetoast", "no backbone", "unlikeable", "pathetic", etc, since more often than not, its these type of characters I not only relate to, but also aspire to be more like - kind of my "ideal self".  So it makes me wonder what these reviewers would think of me - maybe I shouldn't ask, haha.  Yikes.  But yes, their criticisms seem to show a disturbing lack of empathy since we're all damaged.  All human and flawed but just doing our best in our own messed up way to survive this world and make sense of things.  And since when do all characters have to be "likeable"?  So yes, as a 40 year old who's still trying to figure things out in life, that's what I relate to and want to read about these days - deeply flawed but basically good hearted characters.  These are my people.  Sue me.It also disturbs me when people say "nothing happens" in these books.  Well, first I'd argue Seinfeld was also technically "about nothing" and a ton of people loved that (myself included).  I'd also say that's just this genre - "dramedy" (mix of comedy and drama).  Its not a "Hollywood blockbuster" (or whatever the book version of that is).  Its just about people being people.  Relationships.  Humanity.  If that's not your genre, fine, move on, lots of genres I don't care for either, but let us enjoy it who do appreciate the genre.  Also bothers me when they say Joe shows no real growth over the course of the book.  But isn't that just like life?  People don't always magically "grow", become "better people", etc.  We are who we are.  And for some of us, that's enough.I just wish Joe had been the older brother, since in the book the older brother is the success and Joe (younger) is the "mess".  I just wish more books defied that trope and flipped the script and made the older brother the "mess".  Then Joe would be even more relateable to me.  And wish there'd been more resolution with the bully character storyline (spoilers).  Really wanted him to get his, but that whole storyline seemed unresolved.  But then again, I guess that's just like life?  Not everyone gets their just desserts.  Sometimes the bad guys don't pay and good people suffer.  Tragic, but it is what it is.I also don't like how this genre, Tropper in particular (though I guess I should have seen it coming due to his being heavily involved creatively with the Banshee TV show), tends to glorify the macho, "alpha male", "guy's guy" type dudes.  Not sure if these writers have a "Hemingway Complex" or what, but one of the reasons I read this genre is actually to AVOID that type of thing, since there's enough of that both in the real world and in fiction as it is.  That whole "grow up", "man up", "be a man" ideology can be really toxic for some of us who understand that we actually are different from the norm.  How about more books where the male protagonist "grows" by learning he doesn't have to be that type of guy like society expects and he learns to be ok with himself, flaws and all.  Now there's a book I want to read.  Maybe I'll have to write it myself, haha.  But I love the theme in a lot of these books about family coming together and learning to accept each other, flaws and all.  Makes me wish my family could do the same for me - accept and understand me not despite, but because of my flaws, quirks, and unique needs.Bottom line: 5 stars all the way.  Great book by a great author.  As I think others have said, I think this book would make a great movie for its genre, just as This Is Where I Leave You was (though the book was definitely better, cliche but true).  All his books are great.  Just wish he'd write more, preferably more like this than Banshee, though I'd hate to see him inhibit his creativity.If you like this book, I'd also recommend the authors: Matthew Norman, Richard Russo, Nick Hornby, Tom Perrotta, Owen King, Adam Wilson, and Marshall Boswell.  I also hope to check out the work of Jessica Anya-Blau soon (unfortunately her books are not at my local libraries and I'm low on cash at the moment).  Any authors you'd recommend for me?  Thanks for reading my review and, if you agree with anything I wrote, you can mostly catch me these days at twitter dot com/ShyLivesMatter Peace :)0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuseCommentInsert product linkPaste the product's web address below:Product not found.

I was enthralled with that book, but this one I honestly believe is so much better! This book should be made into a movie as well, and I can vividly imagine Jason Bateman again starring, this time sardonically as Joe.0Comment|

He's brilliant in the way he depicts his characters, they're all well-rounded (even the minor characters are fully fleshed out) and his stories all have a similar arc, but they don't get repetitive or boring. That, to me, is the sign of a true novelist. His protagonist always resembles everyone's idea of the "every man" whose life is about to be, or in some cases just has been, colossally wrecked and he is picking up the pieces. You'd think that would make for boring books, but he finds a way to make the formula work time and time again. He's just an amazing author. There are moments where you fight back tears, when you laugh out loud, and when you just sit in awe of the brilliance of this writer. Jonathan Tropper is the best. If you haven't read my favorite of his, "This Is Where I Leave You" I implore you to. Then, watch the movie they made of it.

                                                        I would like to see the finish in grafite black to match the filing cabinet.  Overall, good quality for the price.

                                                         that the veneer on the top of the desk is delicate on the edges and there are three pieces of so called "wood" on the front that can beak easily.  The one that is near your foot is broken on mine.  Slot above the two side drawers is handy. Love the colors.

Bush Furniture
Bush Furniture is a true market leader in the manufacturing of affordable furniture solutions that will stand the test of time. With over 50 years of market experience, they have put themselves ahead of the pack by adhering to self-imposed safety standards that are well above the market standard. Bush has come a long way from its small beginnings as a small company who specialized in making flat-packed hampers. The hampers were a great success and that lead them to create a line of snap-together TV stands in 1972. Since then, the company has experienced international success. They are still headquartered today in Jamestown, NY with manufacturing plants in Pennsylvania, New York, Germany and China. Trust Bush for exceptional quality and style.Read More
Bush Series A
Series A is a no-frills collection of office furniture that's destined to be the workhorse of your office – whether big or small. But just this version of "basic" doesn't cut any corners. Series A is a totally modular system, which means that it's easy to incorporate into any work environment.  A variety of shapes and configurations are available so that you can custom tailor Series A to your workspace. Clever storage is integrated into the desks and the optional hutches. Use a lateral file for your important documents or a corner overhead shelving unit to make the most of your space. Bush Series A is available in a range of colors and finishes so that your new system will coordinate with your space.
All Bush products offer commercial grade quality to withstand the test of time. Durable thermally-fused laminate surfaces are over 1" thick and have been specially designed to withstand the rigors of a 40+ hour work week. All surfaces are glare, stain and scratch resistant. Grommets and wire management systems have been incorporated to keep your work space tidy.

Bush Furniture
Bush Furniture is a true market leader in the manufacturing of affordable furniture solutions that will stand the test of time. With over 50 years of market experience, they have put themselves ahead of the pack by adhering to self-imposed safety standards that are well above the market standard. Bush has come a long way from its small beginnings as a small company who specialized in making flat-packed hampers. The hampers were a great success and that lead them to create a line of snap-together TV stands in 1972. Since then, the company has experienced international success. They are still headquartered today in Jamestown, NY with manufacturing plants in Pennsylvania, New York, Germany and China. Trust Bush for exceptional quality and style.Read More
Bush Series A
Series A is a no-frills collection of office furniture that's destined to be the workhorse of your office – whether big or small. But just this version of "basic" doesn't cut any corners. Series A is a totally modular system, which means that it's easy to incorporate into any work environment.  A variety of shapes and configurations are available so that you can custom tailor Series A to your workspace. Clever storage is integrated into the desks and the optional hutches. Use a lateral file for your important documents or a corner overhead shelving unit to make the most of your space. Bush Series A is available in a range of colors and finishes so that your new system will coordinate with your space.
All Bush products offer commercial grade quality to withstand the test of time. Durable thermally-fused laminate surfaces are over 1" thick and have been specially designed to withstand the rigors of a 40+ hour work week. All surfaces are glare, stain and scratch resistant. Grommets and wire management systems have been incorporated to keep your work space tidy.

MACRA & MIPS FAQs



What is MACRA?



MACRA stands for the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015. The act was signed into law in early 2015 and makes substantial changes to the government’s health care payment system. The significant portions include permanently repealing the Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR) formula for determining provider payments and changing the Medicare physician fee schedule by establishing two new tracks for reimbursement: the Merit Based Incentive Payment System (MIPS) and Alternate Payment Models (APMs).






What is the purpose of MACRA?



CMS’s goal for MACRA is to reward providers for better, lower-cost, patient-centered care.
 
CMS continues to promote the shift away from fee-for-service payments to adopting alternative payment models (APMs) to hit industry goals of having 50% of Medicare payments made through APMs, and having 90% of remaining fee-for-service payments tied to quality and value by the end of 2018.






What is the timeline for MACRA?



The first performance year began on January 1, 2017 and will impact payments adjustments in 2019.






What providers are affected by MACRA?



MACRA, and the Quality Payment Programs that come out of it, will impact most providers across the country. Check CMS’s website to see if you must participate qpp.cms.gov
