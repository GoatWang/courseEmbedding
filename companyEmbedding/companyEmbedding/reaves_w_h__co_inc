Our History
Reaves Asset Management was founded in 1961. Founder, William H. Reaves, built on his experience and knowledge as head of electric utility research at Kidder Peabody to create the framework for our research-driven investment philosophy. In 1978, Reaves began managing its first institutional account focused exclusively on the utility and energy infrastructure sectors. 
Today, more than four decades later, the Reaves team remains committed to the principles of our founder as an employee-owned, research-based investment management company still specializing in key infrastructure-related industries such as utilities, energy, telecommunications and water. Client assets are managed by a team of professionals, led by Ronald J. Sorenson, who joined the firm in 1991, with a view of protecting capital, generating current income and providing long-term growth.  
The cornerstone of the Firm is our proprietary research. Reaves' team of analysts average over 20 years of industry experience.
