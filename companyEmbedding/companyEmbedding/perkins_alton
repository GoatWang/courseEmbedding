Dorothy Perkins Alton General Information:
Founded in 1909 under the name of H.P. Newman and changing the name to Dorothy Perkins a decade later, it is primarily a women’s fashion retailer. Their product line includes a large variety of women’s clothing including dresses, knitwear, coats, shoes, accessories and jewellery. They have worked with a variety of guest designers and celebrity specialists in the past, including the Kardashian’s, to develop unique ranges. As well as a well-stocked, intuitive online store, they can also be found on any high street, as they have stores in locations all over the world; from the United Kingdom to Croatia, from Saudi Arabia to the Philippines. Wherever you are, Dorothy Perkins is there for you, and they’ve got some bluses you would look just gorgeous in.
Customers at DP are able to take advantage of their account card and rewards schemes including vouchers that can be used on the customer’s birthday, and discounts on clothes ranges at certain dates throughout the year.
Dorothy Perkins are also a big supporter of The Woodland Trust, meaning your favourite fashion outlet is also a big environmental activist. They have often sold limited edition ranges of clothing in order to raise money. The money is then used to plant trees ” 100,000 of which have grown since their involvement with the trust began in May 2007. So wear your Dorothy Perkins with pride, and enjoy the forests!
