It is common to see David stay up late at night finishing his work and preparing for his next day tasks. In addition to being an independent and diligent worker, David is also a powerful leader who knits his team together with effective and open communication.  With the combination of these two excellent qualities, I would strongly recommend David as a manager who will lead any team and organization to success.See moreSee lessDavid Spencer has been the project manager for the Ariba Procure-to-Pay implementation at LPL Financial.  This implementation has been very successful, employing the full range of system features including catalogs, contracts, Ariba Network transactions (purchase requisitions, purchase orders and e-invoicing) and doing so with a very small project team of four.  The implementation has spanned three separate geographic locations with training effectively delivered to all the major stakeholders: requisitioners, approvers, accounts payable and suppliers.  The most remarkable part of the implementation is that LPL Financial has had a decentralized and unstructured purchasing activity. Despite the lack of an adequate foundation, the implementation has been very successful as measured by complete adoption of the system by the business groups enabled so far.See moreSee lessSign up to see who recommended DavidGroupsOracle Governance Risk and Compliance (GRC)Wholehearted LeadershipPMOIIBA (International Institute of Business Analysis)SROAUG Southwest Regional Oracle Applications Users GroupProject Manager Community - Best Group for Project ManagementAlumni LPL Financial ServicesSee 2 moreHarvard Business ReviewHealthcare 2.0See lessView David’s full profile to...See who you know in commonGet introducedContact David directlyView David’s Full ProfileNot the David you’re looking for?

 About Spencer David
Spencer David has been involved in Spiritualism for nearly 20 yrs now, he is a kind hearted, compassionate and understanding individual. Spencer also runs his own Spiritualist centre in Coventry called The Temple Of Angels, which has been up and running since 2010.
In June 2016 Rev. Spencer David became a Senior Principal Minister and Vice Chairman of the C.C.H.A for Central and Northern England, who works very closely alongside his dear friend and colleague International Medium and Chairman of central and Northern England Rev. Dennis Binks.
Rev Spencer David and Rev. Dennis Binks giving one of our fellow ministers a lifetime Achievement Award. – Swadlincote Spiritualist Church.
Spencer travels around holding demonstrations of mediumship in various other Spiritualist Churches around the country, from local areas of the Midlands, such as Birmingham, Leicester and Corby in Northampton. to as far as Newton Abbott in Devon, and has also worked in Lowestoft in front of an audience of over 300 people. He is now in the process of getting his name out further afield at this current time.
Spencer loves giving something back to his local community, of June 2015 Spencer ran his first half marathon to raise funds for Zoe’s Place in which he raised over £900 for his run, even with injuring his knee early in the run, he still manage to complete it in 2hrs 39 mins and also held a charity demonstration of mediumship at The Temple Of Angels, and raised a further £150.

Niayahs Fund
Spencer has also just completed a charity event and worked alongside International medium and dear friend Dennis Binks, raising over £600 for local Charity Niayahs Fund.
Spencer David is currently in the process in organising another event with Niayahs Fund on a much larger scale, again alongside International Medium Dennis Binks and other mediums in Corby, Northampton in front of an audience of 300+ which is expected to take place in 2016.
For more information about the above charities please click on their images, to take you to their website or Facebook page. Spencer would like to thank all those who helped raise the money for both of these very special causes, without the help of such selfless and good hearted people, these charities would not be able to survive.
**Please note….Zoe’s Place and Niayahs Fund are completely independent charities from each other, they are not connected to Spencer David and or The Temple Of Angels Spiritualist Group in any way.
A moment conferring with spirit – In Corby
Both charities received 100% of the money raised by Spencer David and/or The Temple Of Angels Spiritualist group, and they have not made any profits from the run or the events organised by Spencer David or The Temple Of Angels Spiritualist Group.
If anybody wishes to contact Spencer David in regards to fund raising for the chosen charity or the charity they volunteer for please do not hesitate to get in touch.
Thank you
Spencer David working with spirit.
A little more about Spencer David
Spencer’s first encounter with the Spirit World was when he was around 4 or 5 yrs old when he was contacted by a family friends son who died in a very tragic accident whilst on holiday.  Spencer described to his mother what happened, at the time his mother had not heard anything about the particular person. His mother spoke to the family on the phone and once the bad news was given to his mother, she shared Spencers experience and the information matched that of those who seen the aftermath of the accident.
Spencer lived a normal life growing up, and did not have another connection until he was around 20yrs old.
The best friend of Spencer took his own life when Spencer was 17yrs old, Spencer battled the emotional effects of grief from the loss of his friend for a couple of years, until a work friend suggested he sees a medium.
Spencer was sceptic but open minded and seeing a medium, but he knew he need peace of mind as to the regards of his friends tragic suicide.  Spencer got given great comfort from the first message from his friend and then he was given a great insight of the Spirit World properly for the first time.
After this reading Spencer decided to sit in an open circle and begin to learn the basics, and from that day forth Spencer has never looked back and is truly grateful of the Spirit World, and now feels every moment with them is a blessing from God.
Spencer feels, due to the circumstances of his friends passing, he has more of a connection and empathy to people who have suffered the same sort of loss as Spencer.
Spencer also feels he is now getting help from his friend in spirit as regards to this type of passing, to help bring comfort to others who choose to have messages from him, who have also lost someone in this way

“A medium does not stop the grieving, but helps ease the pain.”

                            A quote from Spencer’s own spirit guide Running Deer.
