Overview



In colonial America, tales about the capture of English settlers by Native American war parties and the captives' subsequent suffering and privations were wildly popular among readers. Despite their importance in the development of American literature, however, the origins of the captivity narrative have until now been largely unexplored.In Providence Tales and the Birth of American Literature, James Hartman uncovers the genesis of the captivity narrative in the English providence tale and its transformation in the seventeenth century. Exploring the cultural context in which both English providence tales and their American counterparts emergedfocusing in particular on the way in which the providence tale folded the religious spirit of inquiry and truth-seeking into the new science and empiricism of the seventeenth centuryHartman offers a provocative reassessment of the origins of American literature.

Editorial Reviews


Carla Mulford
"By elucidating the transatlantic literary conversation that took place between Britain and the North American colonies, Hartman has made a welcome addition to the growing body of scholarly writing that places issues in 'American' nation-formation not in the nineteenth century but squarely in the middle of the seventeenth- and eighteenth-century Anglo-American literary marketplace of ideas. This is an interesting and indeed splendid study in English colonial intellectual and literary history, and an important contribution to the study of American letters."

Frank Shuffelton
"Hartman's impressive grounding of the captivity stories in a well-established tradition of providential narratives revises interpretations that attempt to describe the writings of Mary Rowlandson and other early Indian captives as indigenous productions that reflect an exceptionalist frontier experience. An important contribution to our understanding of the early captivity narratives as well as to our knowledge of the imaginative world of late seventeenth-century England and New England."

American Literature  - Elizabeth Barnes
"Hartman has written an undeniably significant work that will be an invaluable source for those researching providential literature as well as for those seeking to understand the providential roots of the American novel... the scholarship is impeccable."

Modern Philology  - Christopher Castiglia
"There is a real wealth of information in this book, and Hartman provides several stimulating interpretive frameworks through which to approach a wide-ranging body of work."

Booknews
Analyzes the Indian captivity narratives which were a very popular literary genre in early America.  Hartman (literature, City U. of New York) places these narratives in the tradition of providence tales, a form imported from England, which presented purportedly true stories of miraculous redemption against impossible odds.  These tales were used by their readers both for entertainment and to provide quasi-scientific proof of the existence of God.  Both the European and American providence tales are placed in cultural context, demonstrating how they responded to religious, scientific, and literary developments of their historical period.

What People are Saying About This


David S. ReynoldsBaruch College and the City University of New York Graduate School
" Providence Tales and the Birth of American Literature establishes James Hartman as an authority on an important American genre, the Indian captivity narrative, and on its importance for early American literature. Written with wonderful clarity and directness, the book reveals the roots of the captivity narrative in the style and themes of the English providence tale. Hartman's work nicely complements the largely gender- and race-based discussions of the captivity narrative that have recently proliferated."
