The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) is an international financial institution that offers loans to middle-income developing countries. The IBRD is the first of five member institutions that compose the World Bank Group and is headquartered in Washington, D.C., United States. It was established in 1944 with the mission of financing the reconstruction of European nations devastated by World War II. The IBRD and its concessional lending arm, the International Development Association, are collectively known as the World Bank as they share the same leadership and staff.[1][2][3] Following the reconstruction of Europe, the Bank's mandate expanded to advancing worldwide economic development and eradicating poverty. The IBRD provides commercial-grade or concessional financing to sovereign states to fund projects that seek to improve transportation and infrastructure, education, domestic policy, environmental consciousness, energy investments, healthcare, access to food and potable water, and access to improved sanitation.
The IBRD is owned and governed by its member states, but has its own executive leadership and staff which conduct its normal business operations. The Bank's member governments are shareholders which contribute paid-in capital and have the right to vote on its matters. In addition to contributions from its member nations, the IBRD acquires most of its capital by borrowing on international capital markets through bond issues. In 2011, it raised $29 billion USD in capital from bond issues made in 26 different currencies. The Bank offers a number of financial services and products, including flexible loans, grants, risk guarantees, financial derivatives, and catastrophic risk financing. It reported lending commitments of $26.7 billion made to 132 projects in 2011.

History[edit]
The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and International Monetary Fund (IMF) were established by delegates at the Bretton Woods conference in 1944 and became operational in 1946.[4] The IBRD was established with the original mission of financing the reconstruction efforts of war-torn European nations following World War II, with goals shared by the later Marshall Plan. The Bank issued its inaugural loan of $250 million ($2.6 billion in 2012 dollars[5]) to France in 1947 to finance infrastructure projects. The institution also established its first field offices in Paris, France, Copenhagen, Denmark, and Prague in the former Czechoslovakia. Throughout the remainder of the 1940s and 1950s, the Bank financed projects seeking to dam rivers, generate electricity, and improve access to water and sanitation. It also invested in France, Belgium, and Luxembourg's steel industry. Following the reconstruction of Europe, the Bank's mandate has transitioned to eradicating poverty around the world. In 1960, the International Development Association (IDA) was established to serve as the Bank's concessional lending arm and provide low and no-cost finance and grants to the poorest of the developing countries as measured by gross national income per capita.[2][6]
Governance[edit]
The IBRD is governed by the World Bank's Board of Governors which meets annually and consists of one governor per member country (most often the country's finance minister or treasury secretary). The Board of Governors delegates most of its authority over daily matters such as lending and operations to the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors consists of 25 executive directors and is chaired by the President of the World Bank Group. The executive directors collectively represent all 189 member states of the World Bank. The president oversees the IBRD's overall direction and daily operations.[1][7] As of July 2012[update], Jim Yong Kim serves as the President of the World Bank Group.[8] The Bank and IDA operate with a staff of approximately 10,000 employees.[9]
Funding[edit]
Although members contribute capital to the IBRD, the Bank acquires funds primarily by borrowing on international capital markets by issuing bonds. The Bank raised $29 billion USD worth of capital in 2011 from bonds issued in 26 different currencies.[10] The IBRD has enjoyed a triple-A credit rating since 1959, which allows it to borrow capital at favorable rates.[11] It offers benchmark and global benchmark bonds, bonds denominated in non-hard currencies, structured notes with custom-tailored yields and currencies, discount notes in U.S. dollars and eurodollars.[12] In 2011, the IBRD sought an additional $86 billion USD (of which $5.1 billion would be paid-in capital) as part of a general capital increase to increase its lending capacity to middle-income countries.[13] The IBRD expressed in February 2012 its intent to sell kangaroo bonds (bonds denominated in Australian dollars issued by external firms) with maturities lasting until 2017 and 2022.[14]
Services[edit]




IBRD loans and IDA credits in 2005


The IBRD provides financial services as well as strategic coordination and information services to its borrowing member countries.[15] The Bank only finances sovereign governments directly, or projects backed by sovereign governments.[16] The World Bank Treasury is the division of the IBRD that manages the Bank's debt portfolio of over $100 billion and financial derivatives transactions of $20 billion.[17]
The Bank offers flexible loans with maturities as long as 30 years and custom-tailored repayment scheduling. The IBRD also offers loans in local currencies. Through a joint effort between the IBRD and the International Finance Corporation, the Bank offers financing to subnational entities either with or without sovereign guarantees. For borrowers needing quick financing for an unexpected change, the IBRD operates a Deferred Drawdown Option which serves as a line of credit with features similar to the Bank's flexible loan program.[18] Among the World Bank Group's credit enhancement and guarantee products, the IBRD offers policy-based guarantees to cover countries' sovereign default risk, partial credit guarantees to cover the credit risk of a sovereign government or subnational entity, and partial risk guarantees to private projects to cover a government's failure to meet its contractual obligations. The IBRD's Enclave Partial Risk Guarantee to cover private projects in member countries of the IDA against sovereign governments' failures to fulfill contractual obligations.[19] The Bank provides an array of financial risk management products including foreign exchange swaps, currency conversions, interest rate swaps, interest rate caps and floors, and commodity swaps.[20] To help borrowers protect against catastrophes and other special risks, the bank offers a Catastrophe Deferred Drawdown Option to provide financing after a natural disaster or declared state of emergency. It also issues catastrophe bonds which transfer catastrophic risks from borrowers to investors.[21] The IBRD reported $26.7 billion in lending commitments for 132 projects in fiscal year 2011, significantly less than its $44.2 billion in commitments during fiscal year 2010.[10]

The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) is an international financial institution that offers loans to middle-income developing countries. The IBRD is the first of five member institutions that compose the World Bank Group and is headquartered in Washington, D.C., United States. It was established in 1944 with the mission of financing the reconstruction of European nations devastated by World War II. The IBRD and its concessional lending arm, the International Development Association, are collectively known as the World Bank as they share the same leadership and staff.[1][2][3] Following the reconstruction of Europe, the Bank's mandate expanded to advancing worldwide economic development and eradicating poverty. The IBRD provides commercial-grade or concessional financing to sovereign states to fund projects that seek to improve transportation and infrastructure, education, domestic policy, environmental consciousness, energy investments, healthcare, access to food and potable water, and access to improved sanitation.
The IBRD is owned and governed by its member states, but has its own executive leadership and staff which conduct its normal business operations. The Bank's member governments are shareholders which contribute paid-in capital and have the right to vote on its matters. In addition to contributions from its member nations, the IBRD acquires most of its capital by borrowing on international capital markets through bond issues. In 2011, it raised $29 billion USD in capital from bond issues made in 26 different currencies. The Bank offers a number of financial services and products, including flexible loans, grants, risk guarantees, financial derivatives, and catastrophic risk financing. It reported lending commitments of $26.7 billion made to 132 projects in 2011.

History[edit]
The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and International Monetary Fund (IMF) were established by delegates at the Bretton Woods conference in 1944 and became operational in 1946.[4] The IBRD was established with the original mission of financing the reconstruction efforts of war-torn European nations following World War II, with goals shared by the later Marshall Plan. The Bank issued its inaugural loan of $250 million ($2.6 billion in 2012 dollars[5]) to France in 1947 to finance infrastructure projects. The institution also established its first field offices in Paris, France, Copenhagen, Denmark, and Prague in the former Czechoslovakia. Throughout the remainder of the 1940s and 1950s, the Bank financed projects seeking to dam rivers, generate electricity, and improve access to water and sanitation. It also invested in France, Belgium, and Luxembourg's steel industry. Following the reconstruction of Europe, the Bank's mandate has transitioned to eradicating poverty around the world. In 1960, the International Development Association (IDA) was established to serve as the Bank's concessional lending arm and provide low and no-cost finance and grants to the poorest of the developing countries as measured by gross national income per capita.[2][6]
Governance[edit]
The IBRD is governed by the World Bank's Board of Governors which meets annually and consists of one governor per member country (most often the country's finance minister or treasury secretary). The Board of Governors delegates most of its authority over daily matters such as lending and operations to the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors consists of 25 executive directors and is chaired by the President of the World Bank Group. The executive directors collectively represent all 189 member states of the World Bank. The president oversees the IBRD's overall direction and daily operations.[1][7] As of July 2012[update], Jim Yong Kim serves as the President of the World Bank Group.[8] The Bank and IDA operate with a staff of approximately 10,000 employees.[9]
Funding[edit]
Although members contribute capital to the IBRD, the Bank acquires funds primarily by borrowing on international capital markets by issuing bonds. The Bank raised $29 billion USD worth of capital in 2011 from bonds issued in 26 different currencies.[10] The IBRD has enjoyed a triple-A credit rating since 1959, which allows it to borrow capital at favorable rates.[11] It offers benchmark and global benchmark bonds, bonds denominated in non-hard currencies, structured notes with custom-tailored yields and currencies, discount notes in U.S. dollars and eurodollars.[12] In 2011, the IBRD sought an additional $86 billion USD (of which $5.1 billion would be paid-in capital) as part of a general capital increase to increase its lending capacity to middle-income countries.[13] The IBRD expressed in February 2012 its intent to sell kangaroo bonds (bonds denominated in Australian dollars issued by external firms) with maturities lasting until 2017 and 2022.[14]
Services[edit]




IBRD loans and IDA credits in 2005


The IBRD provides financial services as well as strategic coordination and information services to its borrowing member countries.[15] The Bank only finances sovereign governments directly, or projects backed by sovereign governments.[16] The World Bank Treasury is the division of the IBRD that manages the Bank's debt portfolio of over $100 billion and financial derivatives transactions of $20 billion.[17]
The Bank offers flexible loans with maturities as long as 30 years and custom-tailored repayment scheduling. The IBRD also offers loans in local currencies. Through a joint effort between the IBRD and the International Finance Corporation, the Bank offers financing to subnational entities either with or without sovereign guarantees. For borrowers needing quick financing for an unexpected change, the IBRD operates a Deferred Drawdown Option which serves as a line of credit with features similar to the Bank's flexible loan program.[18] Among the World Bank Group's credit enhancement and guarantee products, the IBRD offers policy-based guarantees to cover countries' sovereign default risk, partial credit guarantees to cover the credit risk of a sovereign government or subnational entity, and partial risk guarantees to private projects to cover a government's failure to meet its contractual obligations. The IBRD's Enclave Partial Risk Guarantee to cover private projects in member countries of the IDA against sovereign governments' failures to fulfill contractual obligations.[19] The Bank provides an array of financial risk management products including foreign exchange swaps, currency conversions, interest rate swaps, interest rate caps and floors, and commodity swaps.[20] To help borrowers protect against catastrophes and other special risks, the bank offers a Catastrophe Deferred Drawdown Option to provide financing after a natural disaster or declared state of emergency. It also issues catastrophe bonds which transfer catastrophic risks from borrowers to investors.[21] The IBRD reported $26.7 billion in lending commitments for 132 projects in fiscal year 2011, significantly less than its $44.2 billion in commitments during fiscal year 2010.[10]

The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) is an international financial institution that offers loans to middle-income developing countries. The IBRD is the first of five member institutions that compose the World Bank Group and is headquartered in Washington, D.C., United States. It was established in 1944 with the mission of financing the reconstruction of European nations devastated by World War II. The IBRD and its concessional lending arm, the International Development Association, are collectively known as the World Bank as they share the same leadership and staff.[1][2][3] Following the reconstruction of Europe, the Bank's mandate expanded to advancing worldwide economic development and eradicating poverty. The IBRD provides commercial-grade or concessional financing to sovereign states to fund projects that seek to improve transportation and infrastructure, education, domestic policy, environmental consciousness, energy investments, healthcare, access to food and potable water, and access to improved sanitation.
The IBRD is owned and governed by its member states, but has its own executive leadership and staff which conduct its normal business operations. The Bank's member governments are shareholders which contribute paid-in capital and have the right to vote on its matters. In addition to contributions from its member nations, the IBRD acquires most of its capital by borrowing on international capital markets through bond issues. In 2011, it raised $29 billion USD in capital from bond issues made in 26 different currencies. The Bank offers a number of financial services and products, including flexible loans, grants, risk guarantees, financial derivatives, and catastrophic risk financing. It reported lending commitments of $26.7 billion made to 132 projects in 2011.

History[edit]
The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and International Monetary Fund (IMF) were established by delegates at the Bretton Woods conference in 1944 and became operational in 1946.[4] The IBRD was established with the original mission of financing the reconstruction efforts of war-torn European nations following World War II, with goals shared by the later Marshall Plan. The Bank issued its inaugural loan of $250 million ($2.6 billion in 2012 dollars[5]) to France in 1947 to finance infrastructure projects. The institution also established its first field offices in Paris, France, Copenhagen, Denmark, and Prague in the former Czechoslovakia. Throughout the remainder of the 1940s and 1950s, the Bank financed projects seeking to dam rivers, generate electricity, and improve access to water and sanitation. It also invested in France, Belgium, and Luxembourg's steel industry. Following the reconstruction of Europe, the Bank's mandate has transitioned to eradicating poverty around the world. In 1960, the International Development Association (IDA) was established to serve as the Bank's concessional lending arm and provide low and no-cost finance and grants to the poorest of the developing countries as measured by gross national income per capita.[2][6]
Governance[edit]
The IBRD is governed by the World Bank's Board of Governors which meets annually and consists of one governor per member country (most often the country's finance minister or treasury secretary). The Board of Governors delegates most of its authority over daily matters such as lending and operations to the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors consists of 25 executive directors and is chaired by the President of the World Bank Group. The executive directors collectively represent all 189 member states of the World Bank. The president oversees the IBRD's overall direction and daily operations.[1][7] As of July 2012[update], Jim Yong Kim serves as the President of the World Bank Group.[8] The Bank and IDA operate with a staff of approximately 10,000 employees.[9]
Funding[edit]
Although members contribute capital to the IBRD, the Bank acquires funds primarily by borrowing on international capital markets by issuing bonds. The Bank raised $29 billion USD worth of capital in 2011 from bonds issued in 26 different currencies.[10] The IBRD has enjoyed a triple-A credit rating since 1959, which allows it to borrow capital at favorable rates.[11] It offers benchmark and global benchmark bonds, bonds denominated in non-hard currencies, structured notes with custom-tailored yields and currencies, discount notes in U.S. dollars and eurodollars.[12] In 2011, the IBRD sought an additional $86 billion USD (of which $5.1 billion would be paid-in capital) as part of a general capital increase to increase its lending capacity to middle-income countries.[13] The IBRD expressed in February 2012 its intent to sell kangaroo bonds (bonds denominated in Australian dollars issued by external firms) with maturities lasting until 2017 and 2022.[14]
Services[edit]




IBRD loans and IDA credits in 2005


The IBRD provides financial services as well as strategic coordination and information services to its borrowing member countries.[15] The Bank only finances sovereign governments directly, or projects backed by sovereign governments.[16] The World Bank Treasury is the division of the IBRD that manages the Bank's debt portfolio of over $100 billion and financial derivatives transactions of $20 billion.[17]
The Bank offers flexible loans with maturities as long as 30 years and custom-tailored repayment scheduling. The IBRD also offers loans in local currencies. Through a joint effort between the IBRD and the International Finance Corporation, the Bank offers financing to subnational entities either with or without sovereign guarantees. For borrowers needing quick financing for an unexpected change, the IBRD operates a Deferred Drawdown Option which serves as a line of credit with features similar to the Bank's flexible loan program.[18] Among the World Bank Group's credit enhancement and guarantee products, the IBRD offers policy-based guarantees to cover countries' sovereign default risk, partial credit guarantees to cover the credit risk of a sovereign government or subnational entity, and partial risk guarantees to private projects to cover a government's failure to meet its contractual obligations. The IBRD's Enclave Partial Risk Guarantee to cover private projects in member countries of the IDA against sovereign governments' failures to fulfill contractual obligations.[19] The Bank provides an array of financial risk management products including foreign exchange swaps, currency conversions, interest rate swaps, interest rate caps and floors, and commodity swaps.[20] To help borrowers protect against catastrophes and other special risks, the bank offers a Catastrophe Deferred Drawdown Option to provide financing after a natural disaster or declared state of emergency. It also issues catastrophe bonds which transfer catastrophic risks from borrowers to investors.[21] The IBRD reported $26.7 billion in lending commitments for 132 projects in fiscal year 2011, significantly less than its $44.2 billion in commitments during fiscal year 2010.[10]

      The World Bank Group - International bank for reconstruction and
      development (ibrd)
    










Photo by: Norebbo




        Background
      









        As early as February 1943, United States Undersecretary of State Sumner
        B. Welles urged preparatory consultation aimed at the establishment of
        agencies to finance reconstruction and development of the world economy
        after WWII. The US and the UK took leading roles in the negotiations
        that were to result in the formation of the IBRD and the IMF. The IBRD
        is the main lending organization of the World Bank Group and, like its
        sister institution, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), was born of
        the Allies' realization during World War II that tremendous
        difficulties in reconstruction and development would face them in the
        postwar transition period, necessitating international economic and
        financial cooperation on a vast scale. The IBRD, frequently called the
        "World Bank," was conceived in July 1944 at the United
        Nations Monetary and Financial Conference in Bretton Woods, New
        Hampshire, US.
      

        Purposes
      

        Although one of the Bank's early functions was to assist in
        bringing about a smooth transition from wartime to peaceful economies,
        economic development soon became the Bank's main object. Today,
        the goal of the World Bank is to promote economic development that
        benefits poor people in developing countries. Loans are provided to
        developing countries to help reduce poverty and to finance investments
        that contribute to economic growth. Investments include roads, power
        plants, schools, and irrigation networks, as well as activities like
        agricultural extension services, training for teachers, and
        nutrition-improvement programs for children and pregnant women. Some
        World Bank loans finance changes in the structure of countries'
        economies to make them more stable, efficient, and market oriented. The
        World Bank also provides technical assistance to help governments make
        specific sectors of their economies more efficient and more relevant to
        national development goals.
      

        Membership
      

        The Bank's founders envisioned a global institution, the
        membership of which would eventually comprise all nations. Membership in
        the IBRD rose gradually from 41 governments in 1946 to 184 as of July
        2002.
      

        A government may withdraw from membership at any time by giving notice
        of withdrawal. Membership also ceases for a member suspended by a
        majority of the governors for failure to fulfill an obligation, if that
        member has not been restored to good standing by a similar majority
        within a year after the suspension. Only a few countries have withdrawn
        their membership from the Bank, and all but Cuba (withdrew in 1960) have
        rejoined.
      

        Although the Soviet Union took part in the 1944 Bretton Woods
        Conference, and signed the final act establishing the IMF and the IBRD,
        it never ratified the Articles of Agreement or paid in the 20% of its
        subscribed capital that was due within 60 days after the Bank began
        operations. Had it joined, the Soviet Union would have been the
        Bank's third largest shareholder, after the United States and the
        United Kingdom. Over the next four decades, as the Bank grew in size and
        scope, it couldn't fulfill its founders' intentions of
        being a truly global institution due to the absence of the Soviet Union.
        Then, at the beginning of the 1990s, as political and economic change
        swept through the 15 republics of the USSR, the Soviet government
        indicated its interest in participating in the international financial
        system and sought membership in the IMF and World Bank. On 15 July 1991,
        Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev formally applied for membership for
        the USSR in the IBRD and its three affiliates (IFC, IDA and MIGA).
        However, by December 1991, the USSR had ceased to exist. During 1992,
        the Russian Federation and 15 former Soviet republics (including the
        Baltic states) applied for membership and were accepted. Eleven of them
        also applied to IDA, 14 to IFC and 15 to MIGA. To accommodate these
        countries, the total authorized capital of the bank was increased.
      

        A "graduating" country is one where lending is being
        phased out. As of 2002 there were 27 countries that had
        "graduated" from the IBRD. These include (with the fiscal
        year of their final loan): France (1947), Luxembourg (1948), Netherlands
        (1957), Belgium (1958), Australia (1962), Austria (1962), Denmark
        (1964), Malta (1964), Norway (1964), Italy (1965), Japan (1967), New
        Zealand (1972), Iraq (1973), Iceland (1974), Finland (1975), Israel
        (1975), Singapore (1975), Ireland (1976), Spain (1977), Greece (1979),
        Oman (1987), Bahamas (1989), Portugal (1989), Cyprus (1992), Barbados
        (1993), the Republic of Korea (1995), and China (1999).
      

        Structure
      

        Board of Governors
      

        All powers of the Bank are vested in its Board of Governors, composed of
        one governor and one alternate from each member state. Ministers of
        Finance, central bank presidents, or persons of comparable status
        usually represent member states on the Bank's Board of Governors.
        The board meets annually.
      

        The Bank is organized somewhat like a corporation. According to an
        agreed-upon formula, member countries subscribe to shares of the
        Bank's capital stock. Each governor is entitled to cast 250 votes
        plus 1 vote for each share of capital stock subscribed by his country.
      

        Executive Directors
      

        The Bank's Board of Governors has delegated most of its authority
        to 24 executive directors. According to the Articles of Agreement, each
        of the five largest shareholders—the United States, Japan,
        Germany, France and the United Kingdom—appoints one executive
        director. The other countries are grouped in 19 constituencies, each
        represented by an executive director who is elected by a group of
        countries. The number of countries each of these 19 directors represents
        varies widely. For example, the executive directors for China, the
        Russian Federation, and Saudi Arabia represent one country each, while
        one director speaks for 24 Francophone African countries and another
        director represents 22 mainly English-speaking African countries.
      

        President and Staff
      

        The president of the Bank, elected by the executive directors, is also
        their chairman, although he is not entitled to a vote, except in case of
        an equal division. Subject to their general direction, the president is
        responsible for the conduct of the ordinary business of the Bank. Action
        on Bank loans is initiated by the president and the staff of the Bank.
        The amount, terms, and conditions of a loan are recommended by the
        president to the executive directors, and the loan is made if his
        recommendation is approved by them.
      

        According to an informal agreement, the president of the Bank is a US
        national, and the managing director of the IMF is a European. The
        president's initial term is for five years; a second term can be
        five years or less. Past presidents of the Bank include Robert S.
        McNamara (1968–81), A. W. Clausen (1981–86), Barber B.
        Conable (1986–91), and Lewis T. Preston (1991–95). James
        D. Wolfensohn became president on 1 June 1995. On September 27, 1999,
        Mr. Wolfensohn was unanimously reappointed by the Bank's Board of
        Executive Directors to a second five-year term as president beginning
        June 1, 2000. He is the third president in World Bank history to serve a
        second term. He heads a staff of more than 8,000 persons from over 130
        countries.
      

        The IBRD's headquarters are at 1818 H Street, N.W., Washington,
        DC 20433.
      

        Budget
      

        A total administrative budget of 
        
          US
        
        $1,924 million was approved for fiscal year 2002.
      

        Activities
      

        A. FINANCIAL RESOURCES
      


          Authorized capital.
        
         At its establishment, the IBRD had an authorized capital of 
        
          US$
        
        10 billion. Countries subscribing shares were required to pay in only
        one-fifth of their subscription on joining, the remainder being
        available on call but only to meet the IBRD's liabilities if it
        got into difficulties. Moreover, not even the one-fifth had to be paid
        in hard cash at that time. The sole cash requirement was the payment in
        gold or US dollars of 2% of each country's subscription. A
        further 18% of the subscription was payable in the currency of the
        member country concerned, and although this sum was technically paid in,
        in the form of notes bearing no interest, it could not be used without
        the member's permission. In 1959, each member was given an
        opportunity to double its subscription without any payment. Thus, for
        countries joining the IBRD after the 1959 capital increase and for those
        subscribing to additional capital stock, the statutory provisions
        affecting the 2% and 18% portions have been applied to only one-half of
        their total subscriptions, so that 1% of each subscription that is
        freely usable in the IBRD's operations has been payable in gold
        or US dollars, and 9% that is usable only with the consent of the member
        is in the member's currency. The remaining 90% is not paid in but
        is subject to call by the IBRD.
      


          Financial Resources for Lending Purposes.
        
         The subscriptions of the IBRD's members constitute the basic
        element in the financial resources of the IBRD. Subscribed capital for
        fiscal year 2002 was about 
        
          US
        
        $121.6 billion. The Bank also draws money from borrowings in the market
        and from earnings. In 2002, the Bank's outstanding borrowings
        were 
        
          US
        
        $110.3 billion, raised in the capital markets of the world. The IBRD is
        able to raise large sums at interest rates little or no higher than are
        paid by governments because of confidence in the Bank engendered by its
        record of stablility since 1947 and the investors' knowledge that
        if the IBRD should ever be in difficulty, it can call in unpaid portions
        of member countries' subscriptions. In connection with its
        borrowing operations, the Bank also undertakes a substantial volume of
        currency and interest rate swap transactions. These swaps have enabled
        the IBRD to lower its fund-raising costs and to expand its direct
        borrowing transactions to markets and currencies in which it otherwise
        would not have borrowed.
      

        B. LENDING OPERATIONS
      

        The IBRD lends to member governments, or, with government guarantee, to
        political subdivisions, or to public or private enterprises.
      

        The IBRD's first loan, 
        
          US$
        
        250 million for postwar reconstruction, was made in the latter part of
        1947. Altogether, it lent 
        
          US$
        
        497 million for postwar reconstruction, all to European countries. The
        IBRD's first development loans were made in the first half of
        1948. As of 30 June 2002, the cumulative total of loans made by the Bank
        was over 
        
          US$
        
        371 billion.
      


          Loan Terms and Interest Rates.
        
         The IBRD normally makes long-term loans, with repayment commencing
        after a certain period. The length of the loan is generally related to
        the estimated useful life of the equipment or plant being financed.
        Since July 1982, IBRD loans have been made at variable rates. The
        lending rate on all loans made under the variable-rate system is
        adjusted semiannually, on 1 January and 1 July, by adding a spread
        of0.5% to the IBRD's weighted average cost during the prior six
        months of a "pool" of borrowings drawn down after 30 June
        1982. Since July 1989, only borrowings allocated to lending have been
        included in the cost of borrowings with respect to new loans and
        existing variable rate loans that are amended to apply the new cost
        basis. For interest periods beginning from 1 July 2002 through 31
        December 2002, the variable lending rate was 5.27%. Before July 1982,
        loans were made at fixed rates, and, accordingly, the semiannual
        interest-rate adjustments do not apply to payments made on these older
        loans.
      

        C. PURPOSES OF THE LOANS
      

        The main purpose of the Bank's operations is to lend to
        developing member countries for productive projects in such sectors as
        agriculture, energy, industry, and transportation and to help improve
        basic services considered essential for development. The main criterion
        for assistance is that it should be provided where it can be most
        effective in the context of the country's specific lending
        programs developed by the Bank in consultation with its borrowers. In
        the late 1980s, the World Bank came under criticism that its policies,
        intended to encourage developing countries to restructure their
        economies in order to render them more efficient, were actually imposing
        too heavy a burden on the world's poorest peoples. This, and
        charges by environmentalists that World Bank lending had underwritten
        projects that were severely detrimental to the environment of developing
        countries, led to a re-thinking of the Bank's policies in the
        1990s.
      


          Implementing the Bank's Poverty Reduction Strategy.
        
         The fundamental objective of the World Bank is sustainable poverty
        reduction. Underpinning this objective is a two-part strategy for
        reducing poverty that was proposed in the World Development Report 1990.
        The first element is to promote broad-based economic growth that makes
        efficient use of the poor's most abundant asset, labor. The
        second element involves ensuring widespread access to basic social
        services to improve the well being of the poor and to enable them to
        participate fully in the growth of the economy. Progress in implementing
        the poverty-reduction strategy is clearly visible in Bank-wide
        statistics on new lending. At the September 1999 annual meetings of the
        World Bank Group and IMF, ministers agreed to link debt relief to the
        establishment of a poverty reduction strategy for all countries
        receiving World Bank/IMF concessional assistance.
      


          Sector and Structural Adjustment Lending.
        
         Bank lending for sector adjustment and structural adjustment
        increasingly supports the establishment of social safety nets and the
        protection of public spending for basic social services.
      

        In its assistance to countries that are preparing adjustment programs,
        the Bank works with them to (a) design the phasing of programs to
        accommodate the needs of the poor, (b) give priority to relative price
        changes in favor of the poor early in the reform process, (c) secure
        adequate resources for the provision of basic social services aimed at
        the poor, and (d) design social safety nets into economic-reform
        programs. These efforts better position of the poor to be major
        beneficiaries of the economic growth and associated employment
        opportunities that are facilitated by the implementation of adjustment
        programs.
      


          Human Resource Development.
        
         Bank lending for human resource development has largely been committed
        for education, and its focus has been towards development of basic
        education. Lending for education increased from an average 
        
          US$
        
        700 million during the 1980s to an average 
        
          US$
        
        1,907 million during the first four years of the 1990s. In 1999 the
        amount climbed to 
        
          US
        
        $2,014 million.
      

        Bank lending for population, health, and nutrition has expanded even
        more rapidly. Average yearly lending to this sector during the 1980s was
        
        
          US$
        
        207 million, while lending during fiscal 1999 was 
        
          US$
        
        1,726 million.
      


          The Environment.
        
         The Bank has continued to support environmental protection efforts with
        loans totaling 
        
          US$
        
        978 million in fiscal 1999, compared to 
        
          US$
        
        404 million in fiscal 1990. But the full story cannot be told by
        stand-alone environmental projects. As of the late 1990s, half of all
        World Bank projects now have an environmental component of some kind.
      

        In fiscal 1993 the World Bank undertook structural changes to respond to
        growing borrower demand for Bank assistance in environmental issues, and
        to the need for internal strengthening of monitoring and implementation.
        A Vice Presidency for Environmentally and Socially Sustainable
        Development was established. Three departments were placed under this
        vice presidency—the Environment Department, the Agriculture and
        Natural Resources Department, and the Transport and Urban Development
        Department.
      

        The Global Environment Facility is a cooperative venture between the
        World Bank, the United Nations Development Programme, the United Nations
        Environment Programme, and national governments. The Facility provides
        grants to help developing countries deal with environmental problems
        that transcend boundaries, such as airborne pollution produced by
        smokestacks or hazardous waste dumped into rivers. The GEF gives
        priority to four objectives: limiting emissions of greenhouse gases;
        preserveing biodiversity; protecting international waters; and
        protecting the ozone layer.
      


          Private Sector Development.
        
         The promotion of private sector growth in developing member countries
        has always been central to the Bank's overall mission of
        fostering sustainable growth and reducing poverty. In December 1999, the
        Bank Group announced a restructuring to better align and expand its work
        related to the private sector. The reforms took effect 1 January 2000.
        The reorganization tightened the link between the Bank's public
        sector work and its private sector transactions in the developing world,
        which are made through the IFC. The World Bank helps governments to
        formulate policy frameworks that encourage a positive environment for
        business to function as the primary engine of growth while the IFC, the
        private sector arm of the Bank Group, provides advice and makes loans
        and equity investments in companies in developing countries. According
        to an IFC official the changes were in response to "one of the
        biggest challenges facing [the Bank's] client countries: How to
        create a favorable business environment and help finance small and
        medium enterprises." In addition to creating a new combined unit
        to coordinate Bank Group activities, help capitalize local financial
        institutions, and teach them the business of financing small and medium
        enterprises, the restructuring also involved the creation of joint World
        Bank-IFC departments, or product groups, for industries where there is a
        strong interface between public policy and private sector transactions.
        Three new industry groups, telecommunications/informatics,
        oil/gas/petrochemicals, and mining, include both policy and transaction
        capacity. Beyond the new industry groups, the principal advisory
        services focused on the private sector in both the World Bank and IFC
        are coordinated under single management.
      

        D. OTHER ACTIVITIES
      


          Technical Assistance.
        
         The Bank provides its members with a wide variety of technical
        assistance, much of it financed under its lending program. The volume of
        technical assistance in which the Bank is involved as lender, provider,
        or administrator rose sharply during the 1990s. In addition to loans and
        guarantees to developing countries, the World Bank carries out its
        mission by providing advice and assistance with telecommunications
        sector reform and national information infrastructure strategies.
        Special programs in this category include InfoDev and TechNet. The
        Information for Development Program (InfoDev) began in September 1995
        with the objective of addressing the obstacles facing developing
        countries in an increasingly information-driven world economy. It is a
        global grant program managed by the World Bank to promote innovative
        projects on the use of information and communication technologies (ICTs)
        for economic and social development, with a special emphasis on the
        needs of the poor in developing countries. In recognition of the
        critical role that science and technology play in promoting economic
        growth and social progress, in July 1999 TechNet was created as a
        cross-cutting thematic group to promote knowledge and education in the
        areas of science and technology and informatics. TechNet acts as a
        clearing-house and network for professionals inside and outside the
        Bank.
      


          Interagency Cooperation.
        
         The Bank's overarching purpose is helping to reduce global
        poverty. To this end, the institution encourages the involvement of
        other development agencies in preparing poverty assessments and works
        closely with other UN agencies in preparing proposals to improve the
        quality of poverty-related data. At the country level, the Bank is
        broadening its efforts to coordinate work with UNDP, UNICEF, and the
        International Fund for Agricultural Development in specific countries on
        preparing or following up poverty assessments and planned human
        development assessments.
      

        Coordination between the Bank and the UN system on poverty at the
        project level is extensive, particularly in the design of social funds
        and social action programs. Together with other UN agencies, the World
        Bank has taken the lead in mobilizing groups of donors, both
        multilateral and bilateral, to tackle specific areas of
        concern—for example, the Consultative Group on International
        Agricultural Research (CGIAR), which is cosponsored by the FAO, UNDP,
        and the World Bank. The Bank is an active partner in interagency
        activities which include the follow-up to the World Conference on
        Education for All and the World Summit for Children; the Safe Motherhood
        Inter-Agency Group; the Onchocerciasis (riverblindness) Control
        Programme; the Global Programme for AIDS; and the Task Force for Child
        Survival. The Bank also has links with the United Nations at the
        political and policy making level in the work of the General Assembly
        and its related committees, and the Economic and Social Council.
      

        The Economic Development Institute was the Bank's department
        responsible for such dissemination. Through seminars, workshops and
        courses, EDI enabled policy-makers to assess and use the lessons of
        development to benefit their own policies. On 10 March 1999, the World
        Bank unveiled the successor to the EDI, the World Bank Institute (WBI).
        The new learning entity also absorbed the World Bank's Learning
        and Leadership Center. The WBI drives the Bank's learning agenda,
        working in three main areas: training, policy services, and knowledge
        networks. WBI is located at World Bank headquarters in Washington, DC.
        Many of its activities are held in member countries in cooperation with
        regional and national development agencies and education and training
        institutions. The Institute's distance education unit conducts
        interactive courses via satellite links worldwide. While most of
        WBI's work is conducted in English, it also operates in Arabic,
        Chinese, French, Portuguese, Russian and Spanish.
      


          Economic Research and Studies.
        
         The Bank's economic and social research program, inaugurated in
        1972, is undertaken by the Bank's own research staff and is
        funded out of its administrative budget. The research program is shaped
        by the Bank's own needs, as a lending institution and as a source
        of policy advice to member governments, and by the needs of member
        countries. Its main purposes are to gain new insights into the
        development process and the policies affecting it; to introduce new
        techniques or methodologies into country, sectoral, and project
        analyses; to provide the analytical bases for major Bank documents, such
        as the World Development Report; and to help strengthen indigenous
        research capacity in developing countries.

 1 Mr Davis MwakitwangeJun 1, 2009 @ 11:11 amHi,

As I was going through the website I learned so many things which can be done by this organisation.

I have one question which I want to ask.

I am Tanzanian and I want to built Recycling plant in Tanzania due to the fact that there is none in Tanzanian cities. Rubbish is everywhere and I find this is dangerous and not acceptable. But I do not have funds/money for this project.
Is it possible to get funds/money as a loan or grant to facilitate my project?

Regards,

International Bank for Reconstruction and Development
The world’s largest development bank, IBRD provides financial products and policy advice to help countries reduce poverty and extend the benefits of sustainable growth to all of their people. 

















The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) is a global development cooperative owned by 189 member countries. As the largest development bank in the world, it supports the World Bank Group’s mission by providing loans, guarantees, risk management products, and advisory services to middle-income and creditworthy low-income countries, as well as by coordinating responses to regional and global challenges. 
Created in 1944 to help Europe rebuild after World War II, IBRD joins with IDA, our fund for the poorest countries, to form the World Bank.  They work closely with all institutions of the World Bank Group and the public and private sectors in developing countries to reduce poverty and build shared prosperity.

                For unemployed youth in Papua New Guinea, the World Bank and donor partners are helping build the skills and experience needed for long-term employment.






























A Partner to Middle-Income Countries
The World Bank Group engages with middle-income countries (MICs) both as clients and shareholders. These countries are major drivers of global growth, home to major infrastructure investments, and recipients of a large share of exports from advanced economies and poorer countries. Many are making rapid economic and social progress, and they play an ever larger role in finding solutions to global challenges.  
But MICs also have more than 70% of the world’s poor people, often in remote areas. And limited access to private finance makes these countries vulnerable to economic shocks and the crises that cross borders, including climate change, forced migration, and pandemics. The World Bank is an essential partner to MICs, which represent more than 60% of IBRD’s portfolio. 

We provide a combination of financial resources, knowledge, and technical services. 
Our strategic advice helps governments reform to improve services, encourage more private investment, and innovate and share solutions.  
We partner with countries as challenges emerge and evolve, through innovative financial products and a wide range of global forums. 

Above all, we help ensure that progress in reducing poverty and broadening prosperity can be sustained. We place special emphasis on supporting lower-middle-income countries as they move up the economic chain, graduating from IDA to become clients of IBRD. We are also expanding capacity to help countries dealing with fragility and conflict situations. And as a long-term partner, we step up our support to all MICs in times of crisis.
IBRD’s Services
Through our partnership with MICs and creditworthy poorer countries, IBRD offers innovative financial solutions, including financial products (loans, guarantees, and risk management products) and knowledge and advisory services (including on a reimbursable basis) to governments at the national and subnational levels.
IBRD finances investments across all sectors and provides technical support and expertise at each stage of a project.  IBRD’s resources not only supply borrowing countries with needed financing, but also serve as a vehicle for global knowledge transfer and technical assistance.  
Advisory services in public debt and asset management help governments, official sector institutions, and development organizations build institutional capacity to protect and expand financial resources.
IBRD supports government efforts to strengthen public financial management as well as improve the investment climate, address service delivery bottlenecks, and strengthen policies and institutions.
 



































Country Strategies




The Country Partnership Framework guides how IBRD and other World Bank Group institutions work with a client country to reach the twin goals of ending extreme poverty and increasing shared prosperity in a sustainable manner.

































Products & Services




IBRD lending and advice complement other World Bank Group efforts to help governments reduce poverty and spur sustainable growth.  In addition to middle-income countries, IBRD lends to creditworthy poorer countries that are also eligible for IDA support.

































Financing & Risk Management




IBRD and other World Bank Group institutions are innovating to offer a wide range of insurance, credit enhancement, and hedging products to help client countries manage financial risks as they tackle development challenges.























 
How IBRD Is Financed
IBRD raises most of its funds in the world's financial markets. This has allowed it to provide more than $500 billion in loans to alleviate poverty around the world since 1946, with its shareholder governments paying in about $14 billion in capital.
IBRD has maintained a triple-A rating since 1959. This high credit rating allows it to borrow at low cost and offer middle-income developing countries access to capital on favorable terms — helping ensure that development projects go forward in a more sustainable manner, while often complementing or catalyzing private financing.
IBRD earns income every year from the return on its equity and from the small margin it makes on lending. This pays for World Bank operating expenses, goes into reserves to strengthen the balance sheet, and provides an annual transfer of funds to IDA, the fund for the poorest countries.

The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) is an international financial institution that offers loans to middle-income developing countries. The IBRD is the first of five member institutions that compose the World Bank Group and is headquartered in Washington, D.C., United States. It was established in 1944 with the mission of financing the reconstruction of European nations devastated by World War II. The IBRD and its concessional lending arm, the International Development Association, are collectively known as the World Bank as they share the same leadership and staff.[1][2][3] Following the reconstruction of Europe, the Bank's mandate expanded to advancing worldwide economic development and eradicating poverty. The IBRD provides commercial-grade or concessional financing to sovereign states to fund projects that seek to improve transportation and infrastructure, education, domestic policy, environmental consciousness, energy investments, healthcare, access to food and potable water, and access to improved sanitation.
The IBRD is owned and governed by its member states, but has its own executive leadership and staff which conduct its normal business operations. The Bank's member governments are shareholders which contribute paid-in capital and have the right to vote on its matters. In addition to contributions from its member nations, the IBRD acquires most of its capital by borrowing on international capital markets through bond issues. In 2011, it raised $29 billion USD in capital from bond issues made in 26 different currencies. The Bank offers a number of financial services and products, including flexible loans, grants, risk guarantees, financial derivatives, and catastrophic risk financing. It reported lending commitments of $26.7 billion made to 132 projects in 2011.

History[edit]
The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and International Monetary Fund (IMF) were established by delegates at the Bretton Woods conference in 1944 and became operational in 1946.[4] The IBRD was established with the original mission of financing the reconstruction efforts of war-torn European nations following World War II, with goals shared by the later Marshall Plan. The Bank issued its inaugural loan of $250 million ($2.6 billion in 2012 dollars[5]) to France in 1947 to finance infrastructure projects. The institution also established its first field offices in Paris, France, Copenhagen, Denmark, and Prague in the former Czechoslovakia. Throughout the remainder of the 1940s and 1950s, the Bank financed projects seeking to dam rivers, generate electricity, and improve access to water and sanitation. It also invested in France, Belgium, and Luxembourg's steel industry. Following the reconstruction of Europe, the Bank's mandate has transitioned to eradicating poverty around the world. In 1960, the International Development Association (IDA) was established to serve as the Bank's concessional lending arm and provide low and no-cost finance and grants to the poorest of the developing countries as measured by gross national income per capita.[2][6]
Governance[edit]
The IBRD is governed by the World Bank's Board of Governors which meets annually and consists of one governor per member country (most often the country's finance minister or treasury secretary). The Board of Governors delegates most of its authority over daily matters such as lending and operations to the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors consists of 25 executive directors and is chaired by the President of the World Bank Group. The executive directors collectively represent all 189 member states of the World Bank. The president oversees the IBRD's overall direction and daily operations.[1][7] As of July 2012[update], Jim Yong Kim serves as the President of the World Bank Group.[8] The Bank and IDA operate with a staff of approximately 10,000 employees.[9]
Funding[edit]
Although members contribute capital to the IBRD, the Bank acquires funds primarily by borrowing on international capital markets by issuing bonds. The Bank raised $29 billion USD worth of capital in 2011 from bonds issued in 26 different currencies.[10] The IBRD has enjoyed a triple-A credit rating since 1959, which allows it to borrow capital at favorable rates.[11] It offers benchmark and global benchmark bonds, bonds denominated in non-hard currencies, structured notes with custom-tailored yields and currencies, discount notes in U.S. dollars and eurodollars.[12] In 2011, the IBRD sought an additional $86 billion USD (of which $5.1 billion would be paid-in capital) as part of a general capital increase to increase its lending capacity to middle-income countries.[13] The IBRD expressed in February 2012 its intent to sell kangaroo bonds (bonds denominated in Australian dollars issued by external firms) with maturities lasting until 2017 and 2022.[14]
Services[edit]




IBRD loans and IDA credits in 2005


The IBRD provides financial services as well as strategic coordination and information services to its borrowing member countries.[15] The Bank only finances sovereign governments directly, or projects backed by sovereign governments.[16] The World Bank Treasury is the division of the IBRD that manages the Bank's debt portfolio of over $100 billion and financial derivatives transactions of $20 billion.[17]
The Bank offers flexible loans with maturities as long as 30 years and custom-tailored repayment scheduling. The IBRD also offers loans in local currencies. Through a joint effort between the IBRD and the International Finance Corporation, the Bank offers financing to subnational entities either with or without sovereign guarantees. For borrowers needing quick financing for an unexpected change, the IBRD operates a Deferred Drawdown Option which serves as a line of credit with features similar to the Bank's flexible loan program.[18] Among the World Bank Group's credit enhancement and guarantee products, the IBRD offers policy-based guarantees to cover countries' sovereign default risk, partial credit guarantees to cover the credit risk of a sovereign government or subnational entity, and partial risk guarantees to private projects to cover a government's failure to meet its contractual obligations. The IBRD's Enclave Partial Risk Guarantee to cover private projects in member countries of the IDA against sovereign governments' failures to fulfill contractual obligations.[19] The Bank provides an array of financial risk management products including foreign exchange swaps, currency conversions, interest rate swaps, interest rate caps and floors, and commodity swaps.[20] To help borrowers protect against catastrophes and other special risks, the bank offers a Catastrophe Deferred Drawdown Option to provide financing after a natural disaster or declared state of emergency. It also issues catastrophe bonds which transfer catastrophic risks from borrowers to investors.[21] The IBRD reported $26.7 billion in lending commitments for 132 projects in fiscal year 2011, significantly less than its $44.2 billion in commitments during fiscal year 2010.[10]

The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) is an international financial institution that offers loans to middle-income developing countries. The IBRD is the first of five member institutions that compose the World Bank Group and is headquartered in Washington, D.C., United States. It was established in 1944 with the mission of financing the reconstruction of European nations devastated by World War II. The IBRD and its concessional lending arm, the International Development Association, are collectively known as the World Bank as they share the same leadership and staff.[1][2][3] Following the reconstruction of Europe, the Bank's mandate expanded to advancing worldwide economic development and eradicating poverty. The IBRD provides commercial-grade or concessional financing to sovereign states to fund projects that seek to improve transportation and infrastructure, education, domestic policy, environmental consciousness, energy investments, healthcare, access to food and potable water, and access to improved sanitation.
The IBRD is owned and governed by its member states, but has its own executive leadership and staff which conduct its normal business operations. The Bank's member governments are shareholders which contribute paid-in capital and have the right to vote on its matters. In addition to contributions from its member nations, the IBRD acquires most of its capital by borrowing on international capital markets through bond issues. In 2011, it raised $29 billion USD in capital from bond issues made in 26 different currencies. The Bank offers a number of financial services and products, including flexible loans, grants, risk guarantees, financial derivatives, and catastrophic risk financing. It reported lending commitments of $26.7 billion made to 132 projects in 2011.

History[edit]
The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and International Monetary Fund (IMF) were established by delegates at the Bretton Woods conference in 1944 and became operational in 1946.[4] The IBRD was established with the original mission of financing the reconstruction efforts of war-torn European nations following World War II, with goals shared by the later Marshall Plan. The Bank issued its inaugural loan of $250 million ($2.6 billion in 2012 dollars[5]) to France in 1947 to finance infrastructure projects. The institution also established its first field offices in Paris, France, Copenhagen, Denmark, and Prague in the former Czechoslovakia. Throughout the remainder of the 1940s and 1950s, the Bank financed projects seeking to dam rivers, generate electricity, and improve access to water and sanitation. It also invested in France, Belgium, and Luxembourg's steel industry. Following the reconstruction of Europe, the Bank's mandate has transitioned to eradicating poverty around the world. In 1960, the International Development Association (IDA) was established to serve as the Bank's concessional lending arm and provide low and no-cost finance and grants to the poorest of the developing countries as measured by gross national income per capita.[2][6]
Governance[edit]
The IBRD is governed by the World Bank's Board of Governors which meets annually and consists of one governor per member country (most often the country's finance minister or treasury secretary). The Board of Governors delegates most of its authority over daily matters such as lending and operations to the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors consists of 25 executive directors and is chaired by the President of the World Bank Group. The executive directors collectively represent all 189 member states of the World Bank. The president oversees the IBRD's overall direction and daily operations.[1][7] As of July 2012[update], Jim Yong Kim serves as the President of the World Bank Group.[8] The Bank and IDA operate with a staff of approximately 10,000 employees.[9]
Funding[edit]
Although members contribute capital to the IBRD, the Bank acquires funds primarily by borrowing on international capital markets by issuing bonds. The Bank raised $29 billion USD worth of capital in 2011 from bonds issued in 26 different currencies.[10] The IBRD has enjoyed a triple-A credit rating since 1959, which allows it to borrow capital at favorable rates.[11] It offers benchmark and global benchmark bonds, bonds denominated in non-hard currencies, structured notes with custom-tailored yields and currencies, discount notes in U.S. dollars and eurodollars.[12] In 2011, the IBRD sought an additional $86 billion USD (of which $5.1 billion would be paid-in capital) as part of a general capital increase to increase its lending capacity to middle-income countries.[13] The IBRD expressed in February 2012 its intent to sell kangaroo bonds (bonds denominated in Australian dollars issued by external firms) with maturities lasting until 2017 and 2022.[14]
Services[edit]




IBRD loans and IDA credits in 2005


The IBRD provides financial services as well as strategic coordination and information services to its borrowing member countries.[15] The Bank only finances sovereign governments directly, or projects backed by sovereign governments.[16] The World Bank Treasury is the division of the IBRD that manages the Bank's debt portfolio of over $100 billion and financial derivatives transactions of $20 billion.[17]
The Bank offers flexible loans with maturities as long as 30 years and custom-tailored repayment scheduling. The IBRD also offers loans in local currencies. Through a joint effort between the IBRD and the International Finance Corporation, the Bank offers financing to subnational entities either with or without sovereign guarantees. For borrowers needing quick financing for an unexpected change, the IBRD operates a Deferred Drawdown Option which serves as a line of credit with features similar to the Bank's flexible loan program.[18] Among the World Bank Group's credit enhancement and guarantee products, the IBRD offers policy-based guarantees to cover countries' sovereign default risk, partial credit guarantees to cover the credit risk of a sovereign government or subnational entity, and partial risk guarantees to private projects to cover a government's failure to meet its contractual obligations. The IBRD's Enclave Partial Risk Guarantee to cover private projects in member countries of the IDA against sovereign governments' failures to fulfill contractual obligations.[19] The Bank provides an array of financial risk management products including foreign exchange swaps, currency conversions, interest rate swaps, interest rate caps and floors, and commodity swaps.[20] To help borrowers protect against catastrophes and other special risks, the bank offers a Catastrophe Deferred Drawdown Option to provide financing after a natural disaster or declared state of emergency. It also issues catastrophe bonds which transfer catastrophic risks from borrowers to investors.[21] The IBRD reported $26.7 billion in lending commitments for 132 projects in fiscal year 2011, significantly less than its $44.2 billion in commitments during fiscal year 2010.[10]

International Bank for Reconstruction and Development
The world’s largest development bank, IBRD provides financial products and policy advice to help countries reduce poverty and extend the benefits of sustainable growth to all of their people. 

















The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) is a global development cooperative owned by 189 member countries. As the largest development bank in the world, it supports the World Bank Group’s mission by providing loans, guarantees, risk management products, and advisory services to middle-income and creditworthy low-income countries, as well as by coordinating responses to regional and global challenges. 
Created in 1944 to help Europe rebuild after World War II, IBRD joins with IDA, our fund for the poorest countries, to form the World Bank.  They work closely with all institutions of the World Bank Group and the public and private sectors in developing countries to reduce poverty and build shared prosperity.






















IBRD at Work

                In rural areas of Panama, a partnership with the World Bank provided 180,000 people a year with regular access to basic health services.

                In the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, the World Bank helped more than 16,500 low-income students further their education, providing cash in exchange for regular school attendance.

                For unemployed youth in Papua New Guinea, the World Bank and donor partners are helping build the skills and experience needed for long-term employment.






























A Partner to Middle-Income Countries
The World Bank Group engages with middle-income countries (MICs) both as clients and shareholders. These countries are major drivers of global growth, home to major infrastructure investments, and recipients of a large share of exports from advanced economies and poorer countries. Many are making rapid economic and social progress, and they play an ever larger role in finding solutions to global challenges.  
But MICs also have more than 70% of the world’s poor people, often in remote areas. And limited access to private finance makes these countries vulnerable to economic shocks and the crises that cross borders, including climate change, forced migration, and pandemics. The World Bank is an essential partner to MICs, which represent more than 60% of IBRD’s portfolio. 

We provide a combination of financial resources, knowledge, and technical services. 
Our strategic advice helps governments reform to improve services, encourage more private investment, and innovate and share solutions.  
We partner with countries as challenges emerge and evolve, through innovative financial products and a wide range of global forums. 

Above all, we help ensure that progress in reducing poverty and broadening prosperity can be sustained. We place special emphasis on supporting lower-middle-income countries as they move up the economic chain, graduating from IDA to become clients of IBRD. We are also expanding capacity to help countries dealing with fragility and conflict situations. And as a long-term partner, we step up our support to all MICs in times of crisis.
IBRD’s Services
Through our partnership with MICs and creditworthy poorer countries, IBRD offers innovative financial solutions, including financial products (loans, guarantees, and risk management products) and knowledge and advisory services (including on a reimbursable basis) to governments at the national and subnational levels.
IBRD finances investments across all sectors and provides technical support and expertise at each stage of a project.  IBRD’s resources not only supply borrowing countries with needed financing, but also serve as a vehicle for global knowledge transfer and technical assistance.  
Advisory services in public debt and asset management help governments, official sector institutions, and development organizations build institutional capacity to protect and expand financial resources.
IBRD supports government efforts to strengthen public financial management as well as improve the investment climate, address service delivery bottlenecks, and strengthen policies and institutions.
 



































Country Strategies




The Country Partnership Framework guides how IBRD and other World Bank Group institutions work with a client country to reach the twin goals of ending extreme poverty and increasing shared prosperity in a sustainable manner.

































Products & Services




IBRD lending and advice complement other World Bank Group efforts to help governments reduce poverty and spur sustainable growth.  In addition to middle-income countries, IBRD lends to creditworthy poorer countries that are also eligible for IDA support.

































Financing & Risk Management




IBRD and other World Bank Group institutions are innovating to offer a wide range of insurance, credit enhancement, and hedging products to help client countries manage financial risks as they tackle development challenges.























 
How IBRD Is Financed
IBRD raises most of its funds in the world's financial markets. This has allowed it to provide more than $500 billion in loans to alleviate poverty around the world since 1946, with its shareholder governments paying in about $14 billion in capital.
IBRD has maintained a triple-A rating since 1959. This high credit rating allows it to borrow at low cost and offer middle-income developing countries access to capital on favorable terms — helping ensure that development projects go forward in a more sustainable manner, while often complementing or catalyzing private financing.
IBRD earns income every year from the return on its equity and from the small margin it makes on lending. This pays for World Bank operating expenses, goes into reserves to strengthen the balance sheet, and provides an annual transfer of funds to IDA, the fund for the poorest countries.
