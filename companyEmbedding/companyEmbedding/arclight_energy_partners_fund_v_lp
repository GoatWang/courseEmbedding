ArcLight Closes Fund V at $3.3 Billion in Commitments

Nov 02, 2011, 11:06 ET

BOSTON, Nov. 2, 2011 /PRNewswire/ -- ArcLight Capital Partners, LLC ("ArcLight"), announced yesterday the successful final closing of its latest fund, ArcLight Energy Partners Fund V, L.P. (the "Fund" or "Fund V").  The Fund closed with $3.3 billion of investor commitments, significantly in excess of its $2 billion target for Fund V as well as the $2.1 billion in commitments for its predecessor fund.  The success of the fundraise reflects strong investor demand for ArcLight's proven North American energy infrastructure investment strategy.  ArcLight has now raised over $10 billion from investors globally since its inception in 2001.
"The successful closing of Fund V represents an important milestone in ArcLight's 10-year history.  We are pleased to have attracted some of the world's largest and most sophisticated investors, including many that are first time investors in ArcLight funds. We believe this is a strong, continued validation of our investment strategy, team and track record," said Daniel Revers, Managing Partner & Co-Founder of ArcLight.
"Energy infrastructure assets are the dominant component of the North American private infrastructure investment opportunity.  They also are the most complex, requiring highly specialized skills, capabilities and experience for success.  It has been gratifying to see the world's leading private investors come to the same conclusion, recognizing ArcLight's expertise and insight across the entire energy value chain," said Robb Turner, Senior Partner & Co-Founder of ArcLight.
