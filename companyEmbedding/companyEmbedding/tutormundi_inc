Overview


Description
Six compact discs complement the text and Anthology of Scores.  Produced by Naxos of America in close coordination with Prentice Hall, these recordings draw on the resources of many different recording labels and feature some of the most distinguished artists and ensembles of our time, such as the Gothic Voices, Anonymous 4, the Hilliard Ensemble, the Orlando Consort, Les Arts Florissants, the Concerto Italiano, the English Baroque Soloists, and the Quatuor Mosaiques.  Representative soloists include Paul O'Dette, Louis Bagger, Emily van Evera, Malcolm Bilsson, and Jessye Norman.  The discs are arranged chronologically and mirror the content and structure of the anthology.

 Six compact discs complement the text and Anthology of Scores.  Produced by Naxos of America in close coordination with Prentice Hall, these recordings draw on the resources of many different recording labels and feature some of the most distinguished artists and ensembles of our time, such as the Gothic Voices, Anonymous 4, the Hilliard Ensemble, the Orlando Consort, Les Arts Florissants, the Concerto Italiano, the English Baroque Soloists, and the Quatuor Mosaiques.  Representative soloists include Paul O'Dette, Louis Bagger, Emily van Evera, Malcolm Bilsson, and Jessye Norman.  The discs are arranged chronologically and mirror the content and structure of the anthology.   NEW!  New works-New selections illustrating 19th-century virtuosity, 19th-century nationalism, and 20th-century jazz have been added.   NEW!  Internal trackings-Most longer works now have internal trackings, cross-referenced in the anthology of scores.  This makes it easier for students to follow complex notation and to skip to specific structural movements in any given work, such as the beginning of the recapitulation in a sonata-form work or the beginning of a new text section in a vocal work.   NEW!  Alternative performances-For each historical era, at least one work is provided with an alternative performance, available on the supplement compact disc built into the textbook.  The frottola El grillo, ascribed to Josquin de Prez, for example, is performed in its notated version by four voices in Volume One of the Recorded Anthology; the Supplemental Disc offers an additional, very different realization of this same work by a solo singer accompanying herself on the lute.  Students are thereby encouraged to think about the many options available to them as performers for all music of all eras.
