Investments in bonds and other debt securities will change in value based on changes in interest rates. If rates rise, the value of these investments generally drops.
 
Diversification does not guarantee investment returns and does not eliminate the risk of loss. Diversification among investment options and asset classes may help to reduce overall volatility.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Diversification does not guarantee investment returns and does not eliminate the risk of loss.
Bonds are subject to interest rate risks. Bond prices generally fall when interest rates rise.
The price of equity securities may rise or fall because of changes in the broad market or changes in a company's financial condition, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably. Equity securities are subject to "stock market risk" meaning that stock prices in general may decline over short or extended periods of time.
International investing involves a greater degree of risk and increased volatility. Changes in currency exchange rates and differences in accounting and taxation policies outside the U.S. can raise or lower returns. Also, some overseas markets may not be as politically and economically stable as the United States and other nations. Investments in emerging markets can be more volatile.
Real estate investments may be subject to a higher degree of market risk because of concentration in a specific industry, sector or geographical sector. Real estate investments may be subject to risks including, but not limited to, declines in the value of real estate, risks related to general and economic conditions, changes in the value of the underlying property owned by the trust and defaults by borrower.
Investments in commodities may have greater volatility than investments in traditional securities, particularly if the instruments involve leverage. The value of commodity-linked derivative instruments may be affected by changes in overall market movements, commodity index volatility, changes in interest rates, or factors affecting a particular industry or commodity, such as drought, floods, weather, livestock disease, embargoes, tariffs and international economic, political and regulatory developments. Use of leveraged commodity-linked derivatives creates an opportunity for increased return but, at the same time, creates the possibility for greater loss. 
Derivatives may be riskier than other types of investments because they may be more sensitive to changes in economic or market conditions than other types of investments and could result in losses that significantly exceed the original investment. The use of derivatives may not be successful, resulting in investment losses, and the cost of such strategies may reduce investment returns.
There is no guarantee that the use of long and short positions will succeed in limiting an investor's exposure to domestic stock market movements, capitalization, sector swings or other risk factors. Investing using long and short selling strategies may have higher portfolio turnover rates. Short selling involves certain risks, including additional costs associated with covering short positions and a possibility of unlimited loss on certain short sale positions.

Accordingly, any discussion of U.S. tax matters contained herein (including any attachments) is not intended or written to be used, and cannot be used, in connection with the promotion, marketing or recommendation by anyone unaffiliated with JPMorgan Chase & Co. of any of the matters addressed herein or for the purpose of avoiding U.S. tax-related penalties.

PITTSBURGH, July 14, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Federated Premier Intermediate Municipal Income Fund (NYSE:    FPT) announced today that it commenced a tender offer for up to 20 percent of its outstanding common shares.  The fund's tender offer will expire on Aug. 11, 2017, at 5 p.m. EDT. The fund is offering to purchase its outstanding common shares at a price per share equal to 98 percent of its net asset value per share in U.S. dollars as determined as of the end of regular trading on the NYSE on Aug. 11, 2017.  








As described in the tender offer materials, if more than 20 percent of the fund's outstanding common shares are duly tendered (and not withdrawn) prior to the expiration date, the fund will repurchase 20 percent of its outstanding common shares on a pro rata basis (with appropriate adjustment to avoid purchase of fractional common shares) upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the tender offer.  Accordingly, there is no assurance that the fund will purchase all of a common shareholder's tendered common shares.  Additional terms and conditions of the tender offer are set forth in the fund's tender offer materials, which are being distributed to common shareholders.  There can be no assurance such terms and conditions will be satisfied. In addition, under certain circumstances, the fund may terminate or abandon the tender offer, as described in the tender offer materials, and there can be no assurance such circumstances will not arise.
The Board of Trustees of the fund, upon recommendation of the fund's investment advisor, Federated Investment Management Company, approved the tender offer.  The tender offer was considered as part of the Board's ongoing review of available options to enhance value for the fund's common shareholders, to address the discount at which the fund's common shares have traded and to provide liquidity.
If, at the fund's sole discretion, the tender offer is extended beyond Aug. 11, 2017, another press release will be issued to provide notification of the extension and the purchase price for tendered shares will be based on the net asset value per share in U.S. dollars as determined as of the end of regular trading on the NYSE on the last day of such extension.  Questions about the tender offer can be directed to Georgeson LLC, the fund's information agent for its tender offer, at toll free (866) 856-6388. 
This announcement is not a recommendation, an offer to purchase, or a solicitation of an offer to sell shares of the fund. Any tender offer will be made only by an offer to purchase, a related letter of transmittal, and other documents, which have been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as exhibits to the tender offer statement on Schedule TO and are available free of charge on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov. Common shareholders should read the offer to purchase and tender offer statement on Schedule TO and related exhibits for the fund as the documents contain important information about the fund's tender offer. The fund will also make available, without charge, the offer to purchase and the letter of transmittal.
Federated Investors, Inc. (NYSE:    FII) is one of the largest investment managers in the United States, managing $361.7 billion in assets as of March 31, 2017.  With 123 funds, as well as a variety of separately managed account options, Federated provides comprehensive investment management worldwide to more than 8,400 institutions and intermediaries including corporations, government entities, insurance companies, foundations and endowments, banks and broker/dealers.  For more information, visit FederatedInvestors.com.

Certain statements made in this press release, such as those related to the tender offer and it providing shareholder value, reducing discount and providing liquidity, are forward-looking statements. Actual future results or occurrences may differ significantly from those anticipated in any forward-looking statements due to numerous factors. These include, but are not limited to: market developments; legal and regulatory developments; and other additional risks and uncertainties. As a result, none of the investment advisor, the fund or any other person assumes responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of such statements in the future.

The fund is offering to purchase its outstanding common shares at a price per share equal to 98 percent of its net asset value per share in U.S. dollars as determined as of the end of regular trading on the NYSE on Aug. 11, 2017.  As described in the tender offer materials, if more than 20 percent of the fund's outstanding common shares are duly tendered (and not withdrawn) prior to the expiration date, the fund will repurchase 20 percent of its outstanding common shares on a pro rata basis (with appropriate adjustment to avoid purchase of fractional common shares) upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the tender offer.  Accordingly, there is no assurance that the fund will purchase all of a common shareholder's tendered common shares.  Additional terms and conditions of the tender offer are set forth in the fund's tender offer materials, which are being distributed to common shareholders.  There can be no assurance such terms and conditions will be satisfied. In addition, under certain circumstances, the fund may terminate or abandon the tender offer, as described in the tender offer materials, and there can be no assurance such circumstances will not arise. The Board of Trustees of the fund, upon recommendation of the fund's investment advisor, Federated Investment Management Company, approved the tender offer.  The tender offer was considered as part of the Board's ongoing review of available options to enhance value for the fund's common shareholders, to address the discount at which the fund's common shares have traded and to provide liquidity.

PITTSBURGH, July 14, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Federated Premier Intermediate Municipal Income Fund (NYSE:    FPT) announced today that it commenced a tender offer for up to 20 percent of its outstanding common shares.  The fund's tender offer will expire on Aug. 11, 2017, at 5 p.m. EDT. The fund is offering to purchase its outstanding common shares at a price per share equal to 98 percent of its net asset value per share in U.S. dollars as determined as of the end of regular trading on the NYSE on Aug. 11, 2017.  








As described in the tender offer materials, if more than 20 percent of the fund's outstanding common shares are duly tendered (and not withdrawn) prior to the expiration date, the fund will repurchase 20 percent of its outstanding common shares on a pro rata basis (with appropriate adjustment to avoid purchase of fractional common shares) upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the tender offer.  Accordingly, there is no assurance that the fund will purchase all of a common shareholder's tendered common shares.  Additional terms and conditions of the tender offer are set forth in the fund's tender offer materials, which are being distributed to common shareholders.  There can be no assurance such terms and conditions will be satisfied. In addition, under certain circumstances, the fund may terminate or abandon the tender offer, as described in the tender offer materials, and there can be no assurance such circumstances will not arise.
The Board of Trustees of the fund, upon recommendation of the fund's investment advisor, Federated Investment Management Company, approved the tender offer.  The tender offer was considered as part of the Board's ongoing review of available options to enhance value for the fund's common shareholders, to address the discount at which the fund's common shares have traded and to provide liquidity.
If, at the fund's sole discretion, the tender offer is extended beyond Aug. 11, 2017, another press release will be issued to provide notification of the extension and the purchase price for tendered shares will be based on the net asset value per share in U.S. dollars as determined as of the end of regular trading on the NYSE on the last day of such extension.  Questions about the tender offer can be directed to Georgeson LLC, the fund's information agent for its tender offer, at toll free (866) 856-6388. 
This announcement is not a recommendation, an offer to purchase, or a solicitation of an offer to sell shares of the fund. Any tender offer will be made only by an offer to purchase, a related letter of transmittal, and other documents, which have been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as exhibits to the tender offer statement on Schedule TO and are available free of charge on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov. Common shareholders should read the offer to purchase and tender offer statement on Schedule TO and related exhibits for the fund as the documents contain important information about the fund's tender offer. The fund will also make available, without charge, the offer to purchase and the letter of transmittal.
Federated Investors, Inc. (NYSE:    FII) is one of the largest investment managers in the United States, managing $361.7 billion in assets as of March 31, 2017.  With 123 funds, as well as a variety of separately managed account options, Federated provides comprehensive investment management worldwide to more than 8,400 institutions and intermediaries including corporations, government entities, insurance companies, foundations and endowments, banks and broker/dealers.  For more information, visit FederatedInvestors.com.

Certain statements made in this press release, such as those related to the tender offer and it providing shareholder value, reducing discount and providing liquidity, are forward-looking statements. Actual future results or occurrences may differ significantly from those anticipated in any forward-looking statements due to numerous factors. These include, but are not limited to: market developments; legal and regulatory developments; and other additional risks and uncertainties. As a result, none of the investment advisor, the fund or any other person assumes responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of such statements in the future.

Total Return at Market Price since inception includes a 4.5% commission paid at the fund's initial public offering. Fund performance changes over time and current performance may be lower or higher than what is stated. Investment return, price, yields, and NAV will fluctuate.   The fund is a closed-end fund. Unlike open-end funds, closed-end funds are not continually offered. There is a one-time public offering and once issued, shares of closed-end funds are bought and sold in the open market. Consequently, shares of closed-end funds may trade at, above or below their net asset values (“NAV”). If a closed-end fund’s shares trade at a price below their NAV, they are said to be trading at a “discount.” Conversely, if a closed-end fund's shares trade at a price above their NAV, they are said to be trading at a “premium.” Shares of closed-end funds frequently trade at a discount.   Common Shares are only available for purchase and sale on the New York Stock Exchange at the current market price. Common Shares may trade at a discount to NAV.   The fund has Common Shares and Preferred Shares. The Pricing, Yield, Dividends, Fund History, Total Return and Premium/Discount of Market Price to NAV information provided herein relates to Common Shares only. Unlike Preferred Shares, Common Shares are not rated.   The fund's issuance of Preferred Shares creates leverage risks for holders of Common Shares. Two major types of risks created by leverage include: (1) the likelihood of greater volatility of NAV and market price of Common Shares, because changes in the value of the fund's portfolio securities are borne entirely by holders of Common Shares; and (2) the possibility either that income available for Common Share dividends will fall if the Preferred Shares dividend rate rises, or that income available for Common Shares dividends will fluctuate because the Preferred Shares dividend rate varies.   The fund may invest up to 20% of its assets in non-investment grade securities that generally entail greater market, credit and liquidity risks than investment grade securities.   Income may be subject to state and local taxes.   Ratings are subject to change and do not remove market risk.   These pages include general information and have not been tailored for any specific recipient or recipients. Accordingly, these pages are not intended to cause Federated or any affiliate to become a fiduciary within the meaning of Section 3(21)(A)(ii) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended or Section 4975(e)(3)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.    Credit quality pertains only to the securities in the fund's portfolio and does not protect fund shares against market risk.   Moody’s and Fitch ratings are based on asset coverage and preferred share basic maintenance amount  tests, as well as the experience, procedures and capabilities of the asset manager. Ratings are subject to change and do not remove market risk.   For additional information, including definitions of related terms and indexes, see the Financial Glossary and Benchmark Index Glossary.

Federated Premier Intermediate Municipal Income Fund Commences Tender Offer For Common Shares









PR Newswire




Jul 14, 2017 4:15 PM EDT













 




























































  PITTSBURGH, July 14, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Federated Premier Intermediate Municipal Income Fund (NYSE: FPT) announced today that it commenced a tender offer for up to 20 percent of its outstanding common shares.  The fund's tender offer will expire on Aug. 11, 2017, at 5 p.m. EDT. The fund is offering to purchase its outstanding common shares at a price per share equal to 98 percent of its net asset value per share in U.S. dollars as determined as of the end of regular trading on the NYSE on Aug. 11, 2017.  As described in the tender offer materials, if more than 20 percent of the fund's outstanding common shares are duly tendered (and not withdrawn) prior to the expiration date, the fund will repurchase 20 percent of its outstanding common shares on a pro rata basis (with appropriate adjustment to avoid purchase of fractional common shares) upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the tender offer.  Accordingly, there is no assurance that the fund will purchase all of a common shareholder's tendered common shares.  Additional terms and conditions of the tender offer are set forth in the fund's tender offer materials, which are being distributed to common shareholders.  There can be no assurance such terms and conditions will be satisfied. In addition, under certain circumstances, the fund may terminate or abandon the tender offer, as described in the tender offer materials, and there can be no assurance such circumstances will not arise. The Board of Trustees of the fund, upon recommendation of the fund's investment advisor, Federated Investment Management Company, approved the tender offer.  The tender offer was considered as part of the Board's ongoing review of available options to enhance value for the fund's common shareholders, to address the discount at which the fund's common shares have traded and to provide liquidity.

Federated Premier Intermediate Municipal Income Fund Commences Tender Offer for Common Shares
PR Newswire






PITTSBURGH, July 14, 2017


 PITTSBURGH, July 14, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Federated Premier Intermediate Municipal Income Fund (NYSE: FPT) announced today that it commenced a tender offer for up to 20 percent of its outstanding common shares.  The fund's tender offer will expire on Aug. 11, 2017, at 5 p.m. EDT. The fund is offering to purchase its outstanding common shares at a price per share equal to 98 percent of its net asset value per share in U.S. dollars as determined as of the end of regular trading on the NYSE on Aug. 11, 2017.  
As described in the tender offer materials, if more than 20 percent of the fund's outstanding common shares are duly tendered (and not withdrawn) prior to the expiration date, the fund will repurchase 20 percent of its outstanding common shares on a pro rata basis (with appropriate adjustment to avoid purchase of fractional common shares) upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the tender offer.  Accordingly, there is no assurance that the fund will purchase all of a common shareholder's tendered common shares.  Additional terms and conditions of the tender offer are set forth in the fund's tender offer materials, which are being distributed to common shareholders.  There can be no assurance such terms and conditions will be satisfied. In addition, under certain circumstances, the fund may terminate or abandon the tender offer, as described in the tender offer materials, and there can be no assurance such circumstances will not arise.
The Board of Trustees of the fund, upon recommendation of the fund's investment advisor, Federated Investment Management Company, approved the tender offer.  The tender offer was considered as part of the Board's ongoing review of available options to enhance value for the fund's common shareholders, to address the discount at which the fund's common shares have traded and to provide liquidity.
If, at the fund's sole discretion, the tender offer is extended beyond Aug. 11, 2017, another press release will be issued to provide notification of the extension and the purchase price for tendered shares will be based on the net asset value per share in U.S. dollars as determined as of the end of regular trading on the NYSE on the last day of such extension.  Questions about the tender offer can be directed to Georgeson LLC, the fund's information agent for its tender offer, at toll free (866) 856-6388. 
This announcement is not a recommendation, an offer to purchase, or a solicitation of an offer to sell shares of the fund. Any tender offer will be made only by an offer to purchase, a related letter of transmittal, and other documents, which have been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as exhibits to the tender offer statement on Schedule TO and are available free of charge on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov. Common shareholders should read the offer to purchase and tender offer statement on Schedule TO and related exhibits for the fund as the documents contain important information about the fund's tender offer. The fund will also make available, without charge, the offer to purchase and the letter of transmittal.
Federated Investors, Inc. (NYSE: FII) is one of the largest investment managers in the United States, managing $361.7 billion in assets as of March 31, 2017.  With 123 funds, as well as a variety of separately managed account options, Federated provides comprehensive investment management worldwide to more than 8,400 institutions and intermediaries including corporations, government entities, insurance companies, foundations and endowments, banks and broker/dealers.  For more information, visit FederatedInvestors.com.
###
Certain statements made in this press release, such as those related to the tender offer and it providing shareholder value, reducing discount and providing liquidity, are forward-looking statements. Actual future results or occurrences may differ significantly from those anticipated in any forward-looking statements due to numerous factors. These include, but are not limited to: market developments; legal and regulatory developments; and other additional risks and uncertainties. As a result, none of the investment advisor, the fund or any other person assumes responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of such statements in the future.

Commentary

As of June 30, 2017

	Quarter in review


		The JPMorgan Municipal Income Fund (I Class Shares) underperformed its benchmark, the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. 1-15 Year Blend (1-17) Municipal Bond Index, for the quarter ended June 30, 2017.

		The Fund’s overweight to the outperforming Housing and IDR/PCR (industrial revenue/pollution control revenue) sectors helped as these sectors returned 1.91% and 1.95% in the index.

		The Fund’s significant overweight to the broad Revenue sectors versus the broad GO (general obligation) sector helped; revenue bonds outperformed GOs by 29 basis points (bps) in the index.

		An underweight to short-duration Prerefunded bonds contributed as this sector underperformed by 109 bps in the index.

		The Fund’s slightly shorter duration (4.6 years versus 4.9 years) hurt as rates mostly declined across the curve; yields rose 4 bps in two years, fell 20 bps in five years and 26 bps in 10 years and 30 years.

		In the index, Transportation and Hospital sectors outperformed the broad index by 20 and 28 bps, so our underweight hindered performance.

		An overweight to short relative duration AAA-rated bonds hurt. This rating bucket underperformed the broad index by 14 bps.


	Looking ahead


		We expect the Federal Reserve to raise rates in September and begin paring its balance sheet. Ten-year Treasury rates are expected to end the year at between 2.5% - 3.0%.  

		Fund flows have been positive and demand for separately managed accounts, especially in the short end, has been strong.

		Muni bond supply is down from last year and estimated at $325-$350 billion for the year. The uptick in new money issuance should continue for the balance of the year as state and local governments make needed investments in aging infrastructure, which had been de-prioritized since the recession.

Disclaimer1Please refer to the prospectus for additional information about cut-off times. Total return assumes reinvestment of income. The Fund's adviser and/or its affiliates have contractually agreed to waive fees and/or reimburse expenses to the extent Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses (excluding acquired fund fees and expenses, dividend and interest expenses related to short sales, interest, taxes, expenses related to litigation and potential litigation and extraordinary expenses) exceed 0.70% for A Shares, 1.25% for C Shares and 0.45% for I Shares of the average daily net assets. The Fund may invest in one or more money market funds advised by the adviser or its affiliates (affiliated money market funds). The Fund's adviser has contractually agreed to waive fees and/or reimburse expenses in an amount sufficient to offset the fees and expenses of the affiliated money market funds incurred by the Fund because of the Fund's investment in such money market funds. This waiver is in effect through 10/31/2018 for A Shares, 10/31/2018 for C Shares and 10/31/2018 for I Shares, at which time the adviser and/or its affiliates will determine whether to renew or revise it. The difference between net and gross fees includes all applicable fee waivers and expense reimbursements. The quoted performance of the Fund includes performance of a predecessor fund/share class prior to the Fund's commencement of operations. Please refer to the current prospectus for further information.  Mutual funds have fees that reduce their performance: indexes do not. You cannot invest directly in an index. The Bloomberg Barclays U.S. 1-15 Year Blend (1-17) Municipal Bond Index represents the performance of municipal bonds with maturities from 1 to 17 years. The performance of the Lipper Intermediate Municipal Debt Funds Index includes expenses associated with a mutual fund, such as investment management fees. These expenses are not identical to the expenses charged by the Fund. Total return figures (for the fund and any index quoted) assume payment of fees and reinvestment of dividends (after the highest applicable foreign withholding tax) and distributions. Without fee waivers, fund returns would have been lower. Due to rounding, some values may not total 100%. Â©2017, American Bankers Association, CUSIP Database provided by the Standard & Poor's CUSIP Service Bureau, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. All rights reserved.The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10- year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.Rankings do not take sales loads into account.The following risks could cause the fund to lose money or perform more poorly than other investments. For more complete risk information, see the prospectus. Investments in bonds and other debt securities will change in value based on changes in interest rates. If rates rise, the value of these investments generally drops. Some investors may be subject to the Federal Alternative Minimum Tax and to certain state and local taxes.Total return assumes reinvestment of income. The top 10 holdings listed reflect only the Fund's long-term investments. Short-term investments are excluded. Holdings are subject to change. The holdings listed should not be considered recommendations to purchase or sell a particular security. Each individual security is calculated as a percentage of the aggregate market value of the securities held in the Fund and does not include the use of derivative positions, where applicable. Duration: Measures price sensitivity of fixed income securities to interest rate changes. Average Life: The length of time the principal of a debt issue is expected to be outstanding.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Diversification does not guarantee investment returns and does not eliminate the risk of loss.
Bonds are subject to interest rate risks. Bond prices generally fall when interest rates rise.
The price of equity securities may rise or fall because of changes in the broad market or changes in a company's financial condition, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably. Equity securities are subject to "stock market risk" meaning that stock prices in general may decline over short or extended periods of time.
International investing involves a greater degree of risk and increased volatility. Changes in currency exchange rates and differences in accounting and taxation policies outside the U.S. can raise or lower returns. Also, some overseas markets may not be as politically and economically stable as the United States and other nations. Investments in emerging markets can be more volatile.
Real estate investments may be subject to a higher degree of market risk because of concentration in a specific industry, sector or geographical sector. Real estate investments may be subject to risks including, but not limited to, declines in the value of real estate, risks related to general and economic conditions, changes in the value of the underlying property owned by the trust and defaults by borrower.
Investments in commodities may have greater volatility than investments in traditional securities, particularly if the instruments involve leverage. The value of commodity-linked derivative instruments may be affected by changes in overall market movements, commodity index volatility, changes in interest rates, or factors affecting a particular industry or commodity, such as drought, floods, weather, livestock disease, embargoes, tariffs and international economic, political and regulatory developments. Use of leveraged commodity-linked derivatives creates an opportunity for increased return but, at the same time, creates the possibility for greater loss. 
Derivatives may be riskier than other types of investments because they may be more sensitive to changes in economic or market conditions than other types of investments and could result in losses that significantly exceed the original investment. The use of derivatives may not be successful, resulting in investment losses, and the cost of such strategies may reduce investment returns.
There is no guarantee that the use of long and short positions will succeed in limiting an investor's exposure to domestic stock market movements, capitalization, sector swings or other risk factors. Investing using long and short selling strategies may have higher portfolio turnover rates. Short selling involves certain risks, including additional costs associated with covering short positions and a possibility of unlimited loss on certain short sale positions.
