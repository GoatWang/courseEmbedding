E. I. DU PONT DE NEMOURS AND COMPANY Revenue and Financial Data


   E. I. du Pont de Nemours (aka DuPont) puts chemicals to work. A top US chemical maker (along with Dow and ExxonMobil Chemicals), the company consists of 7 businesses across six segments, each of which serves a diverse set of markets. Using its expertise in science-based development, it offers products, materials, and services that are applied in everything from agriculture, apparel, and construction, to electronics, nutrition, and safety. DuPont operates worldwide with most of its sales coming from outside of the US. In 2015 DuPont agreed to merge with Dow to create a group valued at $130 billion, but the complexity of the deal means as of mid-2017 it is yet to close.

Cautionary Statements About Forward-Looking Statements
This report contains forward-looking statements which may be identified by their
use of words like "plans," "expects," "will," "anticipates," "believes,"
"intends," "projects," "estimates" or other words of similar meaning. All
statements that address expectations or projections about the future, including
statements about the company's strategy for growth, product development,
regulatory approval, market position, anticipated benefits of recent
acquisitions, timing of anticipated benefits from restructuring actions, outcome
of contingencies, such as litigation and environmental matters, expenditures,
and financial results, forward-looking statements including statements about the
consummation of and expected benefits, including synergies, from the planned
merger with The Dow Chemical Company (Dow) (the Merger Transaction) and the
proposed separation of the combined company's (DowDuPont) agriculture business,
specialty products business and material science business through a series of
tax-efficient transactions (the Intended Business Separations), and the FMC
Transactions, as defined below, in which, among other things, FMC will acquire
the Divested Ag Business, as defined below and DuPont will acquire the Acquired
H&N Business, as defined below, and the anticipated benefits thereof. These and
other forward-looking statements, including the failure to consummate the Merger
Transaction or FMC Transactions or to make or take any filing or other action
required to consummate such transactions in a timely manner or at all, are not
guarantees of future results and are subject to risks, uncertainties and
assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from those
expressed in any forward-looking statements.

Forward-looking statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of
future events which may not be accurate or realized. Forward-looking statements
also involve risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond the company's
control. While the lists of factors presented here and in the Registration
Statement (as defined in Note 2 to the interim Consolidated Financial
Statements) are considered representative, no such list should be considered to
be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties. Unlisted
factors may present significant additional obstacles to the realization of
forward-looking statements. Consequences of material differences in results as
compared with those anticipated in the forward-looking statements could include,
among other things, business disruption, operational problems, financial loss,
legal liability to third parties and similar risks, any of which could have a
material adverse effect on DuPont's consolidated financial condition, results of
operations, credit rating or liquidity. Some of the important factors that could
cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in
any such forward-looking statements are:


•      Risks related to the DowDuPont Merger, the Intended Business Separations
       and the FMC Transactions including, but not limited to, (i) the completion
       of the Merger Transaction and the FMC Transactions on anticipated terms
       and timing, including obtaining regulatory approvals, anticipated tax
       treatment, unforeseen liabilities, future capital expenditures, revenues,
       expenses, earnings, synergies, economic performance, indebtedness,
       financial condition, losses, future prospects, business and management
       strategies for the management, expansion and growth of the new combined
       company's operations or the Acquired H&N Business and other conditions to
       the completion of the Merger Transaction and the FMC Transactions, (ii)
       the possibility that the Merger Transaction and the FMC Transactions may
       not close, including because the various approvals, authorizations and
       declarations of non-objections from certain regulatory and governmental
       authorities with respect to either the Merger Transaction, including
       receipt of approvals by certain regulators of the respective purchasers in
       relation to the FMC Transactions, EAA Transaction, defined below, and the
       Brazil Seeds Transaction, defined below, or the FMC Transactions may not
       be obtained, on a timely basis or otherwise, including that these
       regulatory or governmental authorities may not approve of FMC as an
       acceptable purchaser of the Divested Ag Business in connection with the
       FMC Transactions or may impose conditions on the granting of the various
       approvals, authorizations and declarations of non-objections, including
       requiring the respective Dow, DuPont and FMC businesses, including the
       Acquired H&N Business (in the case of DuPont) and the Divested Ag Business
       (in the case of FMC), to divest certain assets if necessary to obtain
       certain regulatory approvals or otherwise limiting the ability of the
       combined company to integrate parts of the Dow and DuPont businesses
       and/or the DuPont and Health and Nutrition businesses, (iii) the ability
       of DuPont to integrate the Acquired H&N Business successfully and to
       achieve anticipated synergies, (iv) potential litigation or regulatory
       actions relating to the Merger Transaction or the FMC Transactions that
       could be instituted against DuPont or its directors, (v) the risk that
       disruptions from the Merger Transaction or the FMC Transactions will harm
       DuPont's business, including current plans and operations, (vi) the
       ability of DuPont to retain and hire key personnel, (vii) potential
       adverse reactions or changes to business relationships resulting from the
       announcement or completion of the Merger Transaction or the FMC
       Transactions, (viii) uncertainty as to the long-term value of DowDuPont
       common stock, (ix) continued availability of capital and financing and
       rating agency actions, (x) legislative, regulatory and economic
       developments, (xi) potential business uncertainty, including changes to
       existing business relationships, during the pendency of the Merger
       Transaction or the FMC Transactions that could affect DuPont's financial
       performance, (xii) certain restrictions during the pendency of the Merger
       Transaction or the FMC Transactions that may impact DuPont's ability to
       pursue certain business opportunities or strategic transactions and (xiii)
       unpredictability and severity of catastrophic events, including, but not
       limited to, acts of terrorism or outbreak of war or hostilities, as well
       as management's response to any of the aforementioned factors. These
       risks, as well as other risks associated with the Merger Transaction

Recent Developments
DuPont Dow Merger of Equals
On December 11, 2015, DuPont and Dow announced entry into an Agreement and Plan
of Merger, as amended on March 31, 2017 (the Merger Agreement), under which the
companies will combine in an all-stock merger of equals (the Merger Transaction)
subject to satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including receipt of
regulatory approval. The combined company will be named DowDuPont Inc.
(DowDuPont). Following the consummation of the Merger Transaction, DuPont and
Dow intend to pursue, subject to the receipt of approval by the Board of
Directors of DowDuPont, the separation of the combined company's agriculture
business, specialty products business and material science business through a
series of tax-efficient transactions (collectively, the Intended Business
Separations).

On March 27, 2017, DuPont and Dow announced that the European Commission (EC)
granted conditional regulatory clearance in Europe for the Merger Transaction
conditional on DuPont and Dow fulfilling certain commitments. Dow is required to
divest its global Ethylene Acrylic Acid copolymers and ionomers business and has
entered into a definitive agreement with SK Global Chemical Co., LTD, (the EAA
Transaction) subject to the closing of the Merger Transaction in addition to
customary closing conditions, including regulatory approval.

DuPont is required to sell certain assets related to its Crop Protection
business and research and development (R&D) organization, specifically the
company's Cereal Broadleaf Herbicides and Chewing Insecticides portfolios,
including Rynaxypyr®, Cyazypyr® and Indoxacarb, as well as the Crop Protection
R&D pipeline and organization, excluding seed treatment, nematicides, and
late-stage R&D programs. The company will continue to develop and bring to
market its late-stage Crop Protection R&D programs and retain the personnel
needed to support the Crop Protection marketed products and R&D programs not
required to be divested per the EC's conditional approval.

On March 31, 2017, DuPont entered into a definitive agreement (the FMC
Transaction Agreement) with FMC Corporation (FMC). Under the FMC Transaction
Agreement, FMC will acquire the Crop Protection business and R&D assets that
DuPont is required to divest in order to obtain EC approval of the Merger
Transaction as described above, (the Divested Ag Business), and DuPont has
agreed to acquire certain assets relating to FMC's Health and Nutrition segment,
excluding its Omega-3 products, (the Acquired H&N Business) (collectively, the
FMC Transactions). Additionally, FMC will pay DuPont$1.2 billion in cash,
subject to certain adjustments as set forth in the FMC Transaction Agreement,
which reflects the difference in value between the Divested Ag Business and the
Acquired H&N Business. DuPont will retain accounts receivable and accounts
payable associated with the Divested Ag Business, with an expected net value of
$425 million at closing. The assets associated with the Divested Ag Business
generated revenues in 2016 of about $1.4 billion. The FMC Health and Nutrition
business being acquired, which includes texturants as food ingredients and
pharmaceutical excipients, generated approximately $700 million in revenues in
2016.

The divestiture will satisfy DuPont's commitments to the EC in connection with
its conditional regulatory clearance of the merger with Dow. The FMC Transaction
is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2017, subject to the closing of
the Merger Transaction, in addition to customary closing conditions, including
regulatory approval of the FMC Transactions.

In the second quarter 2017, Dow and DuPont obtained conditional approval for the
Merger Transaction from the antitrust regulatory authorities in the United
States, Brazil, Canada, and China, among others. The conditional approval was
granted based on the companies fulfilling their commitments to the EC and, in
the case of Brazil and China, certain local remedies. The local remedies in
Brazil include the divestiture of a select portion of Dow's corn seed business
in Brazil for which Dow has entered a definitive agreement with CITIC Henan
Agriculture Industrial Investment Fund, subject to the closing of the Merger
Transaction in addition to customary closing conditions, including regulatory
approval, (the Brazil Seeds Transaction). In China, DuPont and Dow have made
commitments related to the supply and distribution in China of certain herbicide
and insecticide ingredients and formulations for rice crops for five years after
the closing of the Merger Transaction.

To accommodate the transaction with FMC, DuPont and Dow have amended the Merger
Agreement to extend the "Outside Date" to August 31, 2017, and the companies
anticipate closing of the merger to occur no sooner than August 1, 2017, subject
to satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including receipt of regulatory
approvals. The companies still expect the Intended Business Separations, subject
to DowDuPont Board approval, to occur within 18 months after closing the Merger
Transaction. About $3 billion in aggregate cost synergies are currently expected
to be realized on a run-rate basis by the combined businesses within 24 months
after consummation of the Merger Transaction, with approximately $1.6 billion
from the material science business; approximately $1 billion from the
agriculture business; and approximately $0.4 billion from the specialty products
business.

Settlement of PFOA MDL
As previously reported, approximately 3,550 lawsuits have been filed in various
federal and state courts in Ohio and West Virginia alleging personal injury from
exposure to perfluorooctanoic acid and its salts, including the ammonium salt
(PFOA), in drinking water as a result of the historical manufacture or use of
PFOA at the Washington Works plant outside Parkersburg, West Virginia.  That
plant is now owned and/or operated by The Chemours Company (Chemours).  These
personal injury lawsuits were consolidated in multi-district litigation in the
United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio (the MDL). In
February 2017, DuPont and plaintiffs' counsel agreed to a settlement in
principle of the MDL; the parties executed the definitive settlement agreements
in March 2017. The total settlement amount is $670.7 million in cash, half of
which will be paid by Chemours and half paid by DuPont. In exchange for that
payment, DuPont and Chemours will receive a complete release of all claims by
the settling plaintiffs.  The settlement was entered into solely by way of
compromise and is not in any way an admission of liability or fault by DuPont or
Chemours. The company recorded a charge of $335 million ($214 million net of
tax) to income (loss) from discontinued operations after taxes in the company's
interim Consolidated Income Statement for the six months ended June 30, 2017 for
the remainder of the settlement not subject to indemnification by Chemours. See
Note 11 to the interim Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
information.

2017 Restructuring Program
In the first quarter 2017, DuPont committed to take actions to improve plant
productivity and better position its businesses for productivity and growth
before and after the anticipated closing of the Merger Transaction. In
connection with these actions, the company incurred pre-tax charges of $312
million, comprised of $279 million of asset-related charges and $33 million in
severance and related benefit costs (the 2017 restructuring program) during the
six months ended June 30, 2017. The charges, recognized in employee separation /
asset related charges, net, in the company's interim Consolidated Income
Statement, primarily relate to the second quarter closure of the Protection
Solutions segment's Cooper River manufacturing site located near Charleston,
South Carolina. The actions associated with this program are expected to be
substantially complete by the end of 2017. The company anticipates including
savings associated with these actions against the targeted $3 billion of cost
synergies associated with the Merger Transaction.

Net Sales
Net sales for the three months ended June 30, 2017 were $7.4 billion, up 5
percent versus $7.1 billion in the prior year reflecting 6 percent higher
volume, partly offset by 1 percent lower local prices. Sales grew 6 percent in
the U.S. and Canada driven by increased Agriculture volume, and increased 10

Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)
COGS for the second quarter 2017 increased 5 percent to $4.2 billion from $4.0
billion in the prior year. For the six months ended June 30, 2017, COGS
increased 4 percent to $8.6 billion versus $8.2 billion in the prior year. The
increase in both periods versus prior year is primarily related to higher sales
volume. COGS as a percentage of sales decreased to 56 percent for the three and
six months ended June 30, 2017 from 57 percent for the three and six months
ended June 30, 2016 primarily due to favorable mix.

Other Operating Charges
Other operating charges were $176 million for the second quarter of 2017 versus
$143 million in the prior year, an increase of $33 million, primarily due to the
absence of $30 million of insurance recoveries related to Imprelis® herbicide
claims in 2016.

For the six months ended June 30, 2017, other operating charges were $380
million versus $328 million in the prior year, an increase of $52 million,
principally due to the absence of $30 million of insurance recoveries and a $23
million reduction in the estimated liability related to the Imprelis® herbicide
claims in 2016.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses (SG&A)
SG&A expenses were $1.3 billion for the second quarter of 2017 versus $1.2
billion in the prior year, with the increase primarily driven by costs in
connection with the planned merger with Dow and related activities. During the
three months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, the company incurred $216 million and
$76 million, respectively, of transaction costs in connection with the planned
merger with Dow and the Intended Business Separations, including costs relating
to integration and separation planning. SG&A was approximately 18 percent and 17
percent of net sales for the three months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016.

SG&A expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2017 were $2.6 billion versus
$2.3 billion in the prior year, primarily due to increase in costs associated
with the planned merger with Dow and related activities and increases in
commission expense, partially offset by cost savings. During the six months
ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, the company incurred $386 million and $100
million, respectively of transaction costs in connection with the planned merger
with Dow and related activities. SG&A was approximately 17 percent and 16
percent of net sales for the six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016.

Research and Development Expense (R&D)
R&D expense totaled $441 million and $432 million for the second quarter 2017
and 2016, respectively. Year-to-date R&D expense totaled $857 million and $850
million for the six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The
increase in both periods primarily related to increased spend in the Agriculture
segment. R&D was approximately 6 percent of net sales for the three and six
months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

Other (Loss) Income, Net
Other (loss) income, net totaled $(21) million for the second quarter of 2017
compared to $51 million in the prior year, a decrease of $72 million, primarily
due to an increase in net exchange losses. This was partially offset by the
absence of prior year losses related to available-for-sale securities and
increased licensing income.

For the six months ended June 30, 2017, other (loss) income, net, was $285
million compared to $423 million in the prior year, a decrease of $138 million,
primarily due to the change in net gains on sales of business and other assets
period over period and an increase in net exchange losses. This was partially
offset by the reversal of accrued interest related to unrecognized tax benefits
in 2017, absence of prior year losses related to available-for-sale securities
and increased licensing income. The six months ended June 30, 2017 included a
pre-tax gain of $162 million associated with the sale of the global food safety
diagnostic business. The six months ended June 30, 2016 included a pre-tax gain
of $369 million associated with the sale of DuPont (Shenzhen) Manufacturing
Limited entity.


See Note 5 to the interim Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
information.


Interest Expense
Interest expense totaled $99 million in the second quarter 2017 as compared to
$93 million in the prior year. The $6 million increase was due primarily to
higher debt balances.

For the six months ended June 30, 2017, interest expense was $183 million versus
$185 million in the prior year. The $2 million decrease was due primarily to
lower interest on long-term debt prior to the May 2017 Debt Offering, partially
offset by higher interest on commercial paper.

Employee Separation / Asset Related Charges, Net
Employee separation / asset related charges, net totaled $160 million for the
second quarter 2017 versus a $90 million benefit in the prior year. The charges
in the second quarter 2017 relate to the closure of the Protection Solutions
segment's Cooper River manufacturing site located near Charleston, South
Carolina as part of the 2017 restructuring program. The benefit in the second
quarter 2016 relates to a reduction in severance and related benefit costs in
the 2016 global cost savings and restructuring plan driven by the elimination of
positions at a lower cost than expected as a result of redeployments and
attrition, as well as lower than estimated individual severance costs.

Employee separation / asset related charges, net totaled $312 million for the
six months ended 2017 versus a $13 million benefit in the prior year. The $312
million charge relates to the 2017 restructuring program. The six months ended
June 30, 2016 included an $88 million benefit primarily driven by a reduction in
severance and related benefit costs in the 2016 global cost savings and
restructuring plan, offset by a $75 million charge in the first quarter related
to the decision not to restart the insecticide manufacturing facility at the La
Porte site located in La Porte, Texas.


See Note 4 to the interim Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
information.


Provision for Income Taxes on Continuing Operations
The company's effective tax rate for the second quarter 2017 was 13.0 percent as
compared to 23.0 percent in 2016. The lower effective tax rate is primarily
driven by certain net exchange gains recognized on the re-measurement of the net
monetary asset positions which were not taxable in their local jurisdictions,
increased tax benefits on employee separation / asset related charges, as well
as the impact of costs associated with the planned merger with Dow and related
activities. These impacts were partially offset by a tax charge of $29 million
related to the elimination of a tax benefit recorded in 2016 due to a second
quarter 2017 U.S. discretionary pension contribution.

The company's effective tax rate for the six months ended June 30, 2017 was 13.8
percent as compared to 24.0 percent in 2016. The lower effective tax rate is
primarily driven by certain net exchange gains recognized on the re-measurement
of the net monetary asset positions which were not taxable in their local
jurisdictions. Other factors contributing to the lower effective tax rate
include the absence of unfavorable tax consequences of a gain on the sale of an
entity in the first quarter 2016, tax benefits related to a reduction in the
company's unrecognized tax benefits due to the closure of various tax statutes
of limitations, increased tax benefits on employee separation / asset related
charges, as well as the impact of costs associated with the planned merger with
Dow and related activities. These impacts were partially offset by the
unfavorable tax consequences of non-deductible goodwill associated with the gain
on the sale of the company's global food safety diagnostic business in the first
quarter 2017.

Segment Reviews
Summarized below are comments on individual segment net sales and operating
earnings for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 compared with the same
period in 2016. Segment operating earnings is defined as income (loss) from
continuing operations before income taxes excluding significant pre-tax benefits
(charges), non-operating pension and other post employment employee benefit
costs, exchange gains (losses), corporate expenses and interest. Non-operating
pension and other post employment benefit costs includes all of the components
of net periodic benefit costs from continuing operations with the exception of
the service cost component. See Note 15 to the interim Consolidated Financial
Statements for details related to significant pre-tax benefits (charges)
excluded from segment operating earnings. All references to prices are based on
local price unless otherwise specified.


A reconciliation of segment operating earnings to income from continuing
operations before income taxes for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017
and 2016 is included in Note 15 to the interim Consolidated Financial

Agriculture - Second quarter 2017 segment net sales of $3,446 million increased
$228 million, or 7 percent, on volume growth, partially offset by declines in
local price. Volume growth was due to increased insecticide and fungicide sales,
a benefit from the southern U.S. route-to-market change, and higher soybean
sales in North America driven by increased soybean area. Reductions in local
price were due to price declines in crop protection due to competitive pressure
in Latin America and Asia. Operating earnings of $963 million increased $98
million, or 11 percent, on volume growth, partially offset by declines in local
price and increased product costs, primarily driven by higher soybean royalties.
Year-to-date segment net sales of $7,374 million increased $370 million, or 5
percent, on growth in volume and local price, partially offset by portfolio
changes. Volume growth was driven by a change in the timing of seed deliveries,
including the southern U.S. route-to-market change, increased insecticide and
fungicide sales, higher soybean sales in North America, and increased sunflower
and corn sales in Europe. The change in timing of seed deliveries benefited
year-to-date segment net sales by approximately $200 million. These increases
were partially offset by lower North America corn seed volumes impacted by an
expected decrease in corn area. Pricing growth was realized by double-digit
increases in Brazil driven by the continued expansion of Pioneer® brand hybrids
with Leptra® insect protection and increases in sunflower seed pricing in
Europe, partially offset by price declines in crop protection due to competitive
pressure in Latin America and Asia. Operating earnings of $2,199 million
increased $233 million, or 12 percent, on growth in volume and local price.

  Table of Contents


Electronics & Communications - Second quarter 2017 segment net sales of $546
million increased $52 million, or 11 percent, as volume growth more than offset
a decline in local price, and a negative impact from currency. Volume growth was
due to increased demand in consumer electronics and semiconductor markets, as
well as stronger photovoltaic material sales. Operating earnings of $116 million
increased $23 million, or 25 percent, as volume growth more than offset declines
in local price.

Year-to-date segment net sales of $1,056 million increased $110 million, or 12
percent, on volume growth, partially offset by a decline in local price and a
negative impact from currency. Volume growth was due to increased demand in
consumer electronics and semiconductor markets, as well as stronger photovoltaic
material sales. Operating earnings of $205 million increased $53 million, or 35
percent, primarily on volume growth and the absence of a $16 million prior year
litigation expense, partially offset by lower local price. Operating earnings
included a gain on the sale of a business offset by costs associated with a
legal matter.
Industrial Biosciences - Second quarter 2017 segment net sales $395 million
increased $40 million, or 11 percent, as growth in volume and local price was
partially offset by a negative impact from currency. Broad-based volume growth
was driven by increased demand for biomaterials in apparel and carpeting,
bioactives in the grain processing market, and clean technologies. Growth in
local price was due to biomaterials in carpeting. Operating earnings of $76
million increased $14 million, or 23 percent, on volume growth and mix
enrichment, partially offset by higher costs.

Year-to-date segment net sales of $763 million, increased $56 million, or 8
percent, as volume growth and local price gains were partially offset by a
negative impact from currency. Volume growth was driven by increased demand for
biomaterials in apparel and carpeting and, bioactives in the grain processing
market. Local price gains were due to biomaterials in carpeting. Operating
earnings of $151 million increased $26 million, or 21 percent, on volume growth
and mix enrichment, partially offset by higher costs.

Nutrition & Health - Second quarter 2017 segment net sales of $818 million
decreased $17 million, or 2 percent, as portfolio changes, lower local price and
a negative impact from currency, were partially offset by volume growth. The
negative impact from portfolio changes was due to the absence of sales related
to the global food safety diagnostic business sold in February 2017. Increased
demand in probiotics was partially offset by declines in protein solutions and
systems and texturants. Operating earnings of $135 million increased $5 million,
or 4 percent, on volume growth.

Year-to-date segment net sales of $1,607 million decreased $29 million, or 2
percent on portfolio changes and the negative impact from currency. Volume
growth in probiotics was offset by declines in systems and texturants and
protein solutions. The unfavorable portfolio impact was due to the absence of
sales related to the global food safety diagnostic business sold in February
2017. Operating earnings of $256 million increased $22 million, or 9 percent, on
plant productivity, mix enrichment and cost savings, partially offset by
portfolio changes.

Performance Materials - Second quarter 2017 segment net sales of $1,381 million
increased $46 million, or 3 percent, as increases in local price and volume were
partially offset by a negative impact from currency. Higher local price for
polymers was driven by price increases to mitigate higher raw material costs.
Increased demand for polymers in automotive markets and increased demand for
high-performance parts in semi-conductor and aerospace markets drove increased
volumes, partially offset by lower ethylene sales due to the planned turnaround
of the ethylene cracker in the second quarter. Operating earnings of $329
million increased $4 million, or 1 percent, as increases in volume and local
price, and the absence of costs associated with a contractual claim, were
largely offset by higher raw material costs.

Year-to-date segment net sales of $2,749 million increased $165 million, or 6
percent, as growth in volume and local price was partially offset by a negative
impact from currency. Increased demand for polymers in automotive markets and
increased demand for high-performance parts in semi-conductor and aerospace
markets drove increased volumes, partially offset by lower ethylene sales due to
the planned turnaround of the ethylene cracker in the second quarter. Operating
earnings of $684 million increased $86 million, or 14 percent, driven by volume
growth, cost savings, and the absence of costs associated with a contractual
claim, partially offset by higher raw material costs.

Protection Solutions - Second quarter 2017 segment net sales of $801 million
increased $15 million, or 2 percent, as volume growth was partially offset by
lower local price, unfavorable mix and the negative impact from currency.
Broad-based volume growth was led by improved demand for Tyvek® protective
material in medical packaging and protective apparel and Nomex®
thermal-resistant fiber in oil and gas markets. Volume growth was partially
offset by unfavorable mix in Nomex® and Kevlar®, and lower local price in
surfaces due to competitive pressure. Operating earnings of $191 million
increased $3 million, or 2 percent, as volume growth more than offset
unfavorable mix, lower local price and higher raw material costs.

Liquidity & Capital Resources
Information related to the company's liquidity and capital resources can be
found in the company's 2016 Annual Report, Part II, Item 7. Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,
Liquidity and Capital Resources. Discussion below provides the updates to this
information for the six months ended June 30, 2017.
(Dollars in millions)                                    June 30, 2017     December 31, 2016
Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities       $         6,228   $             5,967
Total debt                                                      13,559                 8,536



The company's cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at June 30, 2017
and December 31, 2016 are $6.2 billion and $6.0 billion, respectively.


Total debt as of June 30, 2017 was $13.6 billion, a $5.0 billion increase from
December 31, 2016. This increase was due primarily to the May 2017 Debt Offering
as well as increased borrowings from commercial paper and the Repurchase
Facility used primarily to fund seasonal working capital requirements.

In May 2017, the company completed an underwritten public offering of $1.25
billion of the company's 2.20 percent Notes due 2020 and $750 million of the
company's Floating Rate Notes due 2020 (the May 2017 Debt Offering). The
proceeds of this offering were used to make a discretionary pension contribution
to the company's principal U.S. pension plan, as discussed below. The company
will be required to redeem all of the Notes associated with the May 2017 Debt
Offering at a redemption price equal to 100 percent of the aggregate principal
amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest upon the announcement of the record
date for the separation of either the agriculture or specialty products
business, or the entry into an agreement to sell all or substantially all of the
assets of either business to a third party.

In March 2016, the company entered into a credit agreement that provides for a
three-year, senior unsecured term loan facility in the aggregate principal
amount of $4.5 billion (as amended from time to time, the Term Loan Facility).
In the first quarter of 2017, the Term Loan Facility was amended to extend the
date on which the commitment to lend terminates. As a result, DuPont may make up
to seven term loan borrowings through July 27, 2018; amounts repaid or prepaid
are not available for subsequent borrowings. The Term Loan Facility matures in
March 2019 at which time all outstanding borrowings, including accrued but
unpaid interest, become immediately due and payable. As of June 30, 2017, the
company had borrowed $500 million and had unused commitments of $4.0 billion
under the Term Loan Facility. DuPont may elect to borrow under the Term Loan
Facility to meet its short-term liquidity needs.

The Term Loan Facility and the amended revolving credit facility contain
customary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants,
and events of default that are typical for companies with similar credit ratings
and generally consistent with those applicable to DuPont's long-term public
debt. The Term Loan Facility and the amended revolving credit facility contain a
financial covenant requiring that the ratio of Total Indebtedness to Total
Capitalization for DuPont and its consolidated subsidiaries not exceed 0.6667.
At June 30, 2017, the company was in compliance with this financial covenant.

In January 2017, in line with seasonal agricultural working capital
requirements, the company entered into a committed receivable repurchase
agreement of up to $1.3 billion (the Repurchase Facility) that expires on
November 30, 2017. Under the Repurchase Facility, the company may sell a
portfolio of available and eligible outstanding customer notes receivables
within the Agriculture segment to participating institutions and simultaneously
agree to repurchase at a future date. See further discussion of this facility in
Note 10 to the interim Consolidated Financial Statements.

The company has access to approximately $7.8 billion in unused credit lines, a
decrease of $0.1 billion from $7.9 billion as of December 31, 2016. These unused
credit lines provide support to meet the company's short-term liquidity needs
and for general corporate purposes which may include funding of discretionary
and non-discretionary contributions to certain benefit plans, severance plans in
the event of a change in control, repayment and refinancing of debt, working
capital, capital expenditures and repurchases and redemptions of securities.

The company previously anticipated making contributions of approximately
$230 million to its principal U.S. pension plan in 2017. During the six months
ended June 30, 2017, the company made total contributions of $2.9 billion to its
principal U.S pension plan, an increase of approximately $2.7 billion reflecting
discretionary contributions. The discretionary contribution was funded through
the May 2017 Debt Offering, as discussed above; short-term borrowings, including
commercial paper issuance; and cash.

Summary of Cash Flows
Cash used for operating activities was $4.1 billion for the six months ended
June 30, 2017 compared to $1.5 billion during the same period in 2016. The $2.6
billion increase was due primarily to higher pension contributions, as discussed
above.

Cash used for investing activities was $1.9 billion for the six months ended
June 30, 2017 compared to $0.4 billion during the same period in 2016. The $1.5
billion increase was due primarily to increased net purchases of marketable
securities, partially offset by lower net payments from foreign currency
contracts.

Cash provided by financing activities was $4.5 billion for the six months ended
June 30, 2017, compared to $1.0 billion during the same period last year. The
$3.5 billion increase was due primarily to the May 2017 Debt Offering and
increased short-term borrowings in commercial paper for seasonal working capital
requirements.


Dividend payments to shareholders during the six months ended June 30, 2017
totaled $0.7 billion.  In April and July of 2017, the Board of Directors
declared second and third quarter common stock dividends of $0.38 per share. The
company has paid quarterly consecutive dividends since the company's first
dividend in the fourth quarter 1904.

For detailed information related to Guarantees, Indemnifications, and
Obligations for Equity Affiliates and Others, see the company's 2016 Annual

2016 can be found in the company's 2016 Annual Report, Part II, Item 7.
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of

obligations at June 30, 2017 have increased approximately $2 billion versus
prior year end. The increase is driven by the May 2017 Debt Offering. See Note
10 to the interim Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of
the company's debt offering.

E. I. DU PONT DE NEMOURS AND COMPANY Company Profile


   E. I. du Pont de Nemours (aka DuPont) puts chemicals to work. A top US chemical maker (along with Dow and ExxonMobil Chemicals), the company consists of 7 businesses across six segments, each of which serves a diverse set of markets. Using its expertise in science-based development, it offers products, materials, and services that are applied in everything from agriculture, apparel, and construction, to electronics, nutrition, and safety. DuPont operates worldwide with most of its sales coming from outside of the US. In 2015 DuPont agreed to merge with Dow to create a group valued at $130 billion, but the complexity of the deal means as of mid-2017 it is yet to close.

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Shares Sold Short The total number of shares of a security that have been sold short and not yet repurchased. Change from Last Percentage change in short interest from the previous report to the most recent report. Exchanges report short interest twice a month. Percent of Float Total short positions relative to the number of shares available to trade.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades. Our calculations are based on comprehensive, delayed quotes.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

In the 20th century, DuPont developed many polymers such as Vespel, neoprene, nylon, Corian, Teflon, Mylar, Kapton, Kevlar, Zemdrain, M5 fiber, Nomex, Tyvek, Sorona, Corfam, and Lycra. DuPont developed Freon (chlorofluorocarbons) for the refrigerant industry, and later more environmentally friendly refrigerants. It also developed synthetic pigments and paints including ChromaFlair.
In 2014, DuPont was the world's fourth largest chemical company based on market capitalization[3] and eighth based on revenue.[4] Its stock price is a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average.

History[edit]

Establishment: 1802[edit]
DuPont was founded in 1802 by Éleuthère Irénée du Pont, using capital raised in France and gunpowder machinery imported from France. The company was started at the Eleutherian Mills, on the Brandywine Creek, near Wilmington, Delaware, two years after he and his family left France to escape the French Revolution and religious persecutions against Huguenot protestants. It began as a manufacturer of gunpowder, as du Pont noticed that the industry in North America was lagging behind Europe. The company grew quickly, and by the mid-19th century had become the largest supplier of gunpowder to the United States military, supplying half the powder used by the Union Army during the American Civil War. The Eleutherian Mills site is now a museum and a National Historic Landmark.
Expansion: 1902 to 1912[edit]
DuPont continued to expand, moving into the production of dynamite and smokeless powder. In 1902, DuPont's president, Eugene du Pont, died, and the surviving partners sold the company to three great-grandsons of the original founder. Charles Lee Reese was appointed as director and the company began centralizing their research departments.[5] The company subsequently purchased several smaller chemical companies, and in 1912 these actions gave rise to government scrutiny under the Sherman Antitrust Act. The courts declared that the company's dominance of the explosives business constituted a monopoly and ordered divestment. The court ruling resulted in the creation of the Hercules Powder Company (later Hercules Inc. and now part of Ashland Inc.) and the Atlas Powder Company (purchased by Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) and now part of AkzoNobel).[6] At the time of divestment, DuPont retained the single base nitrocellulose powders, while Hercules held the double base powders combining nitrocellulose and nitroglycerine. DuPont subsequently developed the Improved Military Rifle (IMR) line of smokeless powders.[7]
In 1910, DuPont published a brochure entitled "Farming with Dynamite". The pamphlet was instructional, outlining the benefits to using their dynamite products on stumps and various other obstacles that would be easier to remove with dynamite as opposed to other more conventional, inefficient means.[8]
DuPont also established two of the first industrial laboratories in the United States, where they began the work on cellulose chemistry, lacquers and other non-explosive products. DuPont Central Research was established at the DuPont Experimental Station, across the Brandywine Creek from the original powder mills.
Automotive investments: 1914[edit]
In 1914, Pierre S. du Pont invested in the fledgling automobile industry, buying stock in General Motors (GM). The following year he was invited to sit on GM's board of directors and would eventually be appointed the company's chairman. The DuPont company would assist the struggling automobile company further with a $25 million purchase of GM stock. In 1920, Pierre S. du Pont was elected president of General Motors. Under du Pont's guidance, GM became the number one automobile company in the world. However, in 1957, because of DuPont's influence within GM, further action under the Clayton Antitrust Act forced DuPont to divest its shares of General Motors.
Major breakthroughs: 1920s–1930s[edit]

In the 1920s, DuPont continued its emphasis on materials science, hiring Wallace Carothers to work on polymers in 1928. Carothers invented neoprene, a synthetic rubber;[9] the first polyester superpolymer; and, in 1935, nylon. The invention of Teflon followed a few years later. DuPont introduced phenothiazine as an insecticide in 1935.[10]
Second World War: 1941 to 1945[edit]
DuPont ranked 15th among United States corporations in the value of wartime production contracts.[11] As the inventor and manufacturer of nylon, DuPont helped produce the raw materials for parachutes, powder bags,[12] and tires.[13]
DuPont also played a major role in the Manhattan Project in 1943, designing, building and operating the Hanford plutonium producing plant in Hanford, Washington. In 1950 DuPont also agreed to build the Savannah River Plant in South Carolina as part of the effort to create a hydrogen bomb.
Space Age developments: 1950 to 1970[edit]
After the war, DuPont continued its emphasis on new materials, developing Mylar, Dacron, Orlon, and Lycra in the 1950s, and Tyvek, Nomex, Qiana, Corfam, and Corian in the 1960s. DuPont materials were critical to the success of the Apollo Project of the United States space program.[citation needed]
DuPont has been the key company behind the development of modern body armor. In the Second World War DuPont's ballistic nylon was used by Britain's Royal Air Force to make flak jackets. With the development of Kevlar in the 1960s, DuPont began tests to see if it could resist a lead bullet. This research would ultimately lead to the bullet resistant vests that are the mainstay of police and military units in the industrialized world.[citation needed]
Conoco holdings: 1981 to 1999[edit]
In 1981, DuPont acquired Conoco Inc., a major American oil and gas producing company that gave it a secure source of petroleum feedstocks needed for the manufacturing of many of its fiber and plastics products. The acquisition, which made DuPont one of the top ten U.S.-based petroleum and natural gas producers and refiners, came about after a bidding war with the giant distillery Seagram Company Ltd., which would become DuPont's largest single shareholder with four seats on the board of directors. On April 6, 1995, after being approached by Seagram Chief Executive Officer Edgar Bronfman Jr., DuPont announced a deal in which the company would buy back all the shares owned by Seagram.[14]
In 1999, DuPont sold all of its shares of Conoco, which merged with Phillips Petroleum Company, and acquired the Pioneer Hi-Bred agricultural seed company.

DuPont describes itself as a global science company that employs more than 60,000 people worldwide and has a diverse array of product offerings.[1] The company ranks 86th in the Fortune 500 on the strength of nearly $36 billion in revenues, $4.848 billion in profits in 2013.[16] In April 2014, Forbes ranked DuPont 171st on its Global 2000, the listing of the world's top public companies.[17]
DuPont businesses are organized into the following five categories, known as marketing "platforms": Electronic and Communication Technologies, Performance Materials, Coatings and Color Technologies, Safety and Protection, and Agriculture and Nutrition.
The agriculture division, DuPont Pioneer makes and sells hybrid seed and genetically modified seed, some of which goes on to become genetically modified food. Genes engineered into their products include LibertyLink, which provides resistance to Bayer's Ignite Herbicide/Liberty herbicides; the Herculex I Insect Protection gene which provides protection against various insects; the Herculex RW insect protection trait which provides protection against other insects; the YieldGard Corn Borer gene, which provides resistance to another set of insects; and the Roundup Ready Corn 2 trait that provides crop resistance against glyphosate herbicides.[18] In 2010, DuPont Pioneer received approval to start marketing Plenish soybeans, which contains "the highest oleic acid content of any commercial soybean product, at more than 75 percent. Plenish provides a product with no trans fat, 20 percent less saturated fat than regular soybean oil, and more stabile oil with greater flexibility in food and industrial applications."[19] Plenish is genetically engineered to "block the formation of enzymes that continue the cascade downstream from oleic acid (that produces saturated fats), resulting in an accumulation of the desirable monounsaturated acid."[20]
In October 2001, the company sold its pharmaceutical business to Bristol Myers Squibb for $7.798 billion.[21]
In 2002, the company sold the Clysar(R)business to Bemis Company for $143 million.[22][23]
In 2004, the company sold its textiles business, which included some of its best-known brands such as Lycra (Spandex), Dacron polyester, Orlon acrylic, Antron nylon and Thermolite, to Koch Industries.
In 2011, DuPont was the largest producer of titanium dioxide in the world, primarily provided as a white pigment used in the paper industry.[24]
DuPont has 150 research and development facilities located in China, Brazil, India, Germany, and Switzerland with an average investment of $2 billion annually in a diverse range of technologies for many markets including agriculture, genetic traits, biofuels, automotive, construction, electronics, chemicals, and industrial materials. DuPont employs more than 10,000 scientists and engineers around the world.[1]
On January 9, 2011, DuPont announced that it had reached an agreement to buy Danish company Danisco for US$6.3 billion.[25] On May 16, 2011, DuPont announced that its tender offer for Danisco had been successful and that it would proceed to redeem the remaining shares and delist the company.[26]
On May 1, 2012, DuPont announced that it had acquired from Bunge full ownership of the Solae joint venture, a soy-based ingredients company. DuPont previously owned 72 percent of the joint venture while Bunge owned the remaining 28 percent.[27]
In February 2013, DuPont Performance Coatings was sold to the Carlyle Group and rebranded as Axalta Coating Systems.[28]
In October 2015, DuPont sold the Neoprene chloroprene rubber business to Denka Performance Elastomers, a joint venture of Denka and Mitsui.[29]
Chemours[edit]
In October 2013, DuPont announced that it was planning to spin off its Performance Chemicals business into a new publicly traded company in mid-2015.[30] The company filed its initial Form 10 with the SEC in December 2014 and announced that the new company would be called The Chemours Company.[31] The spin-off to DuPont shareholders was completed on July 1, 2015 and Chemours stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange on the same date.[32]
DuPont will focus on production of GMO seeds, materials for solar panels, and alternatives to fossil fuels. Chemours becomes responsible for the cleanup of 171 former DuPont sites, which DuPont says will cost between $295 million and $945 million.[33]
Merger with Dow[edit]
Main article: Dow DuPont merger
On December 11, 2015, DuPont announced that it would merge with the Dow Chemical Company, in an all-stock deal. The combined company, which will be known as DowDuPont, will have an estimated value of $130 billion, be equally held by the shareholders of both companies, and maintain their headquarters in Delaware and Michigan respectively. Within two years of the merger's closure, expected in the first quarter of 2017 and subject to regulatory approval, DowDuPont will be split into three separate public companies, focusing on the agricultural chemicals, materials science, and specialty product industries.[34][35] Commentators have questioned the economic viability of this plan because, of the three companies, only the specialty products industry has prospects for high growth.[35] The outlook on the profitability of the other two proposed companies has been questioned due to reduced crop prices and lower margins on plastics such as polyethylene.[35] They have also noted that the deal is likely to face antitrust scrutiny in several countries.[36] This eventually became the case, with two delays taking place due to regulatory approvals. The merger is now targeted to close in mid-2017.[37]
Locations[edit]

On October 5, 2015, DuPont announced that Ellen Kullman would retire as Chair and CEO on October 16, 2015.[42] Breen was appointed CEO in November 2015 replacing Kullman.[43][44][45]
Environmental record[edit]
In the 1990s, DuPont was a founding member of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development with then DuPont CEO Chad Holliday as chairman of the WBCSD from 2000 to 2001.[46] The organization has developed guidelines for measuring sustainability cited by the Natural Resources Defense Council[47] and the Environmental Defense Fund,[48] and its Vision 2050 blueprint for slowing and reversing environmental damage has been highlighted by The Guardian.[49]
In 2005, BusinessWeek magazine, in conjunction with the Climate Group, ranked DuPont as the best-practice leader in cutting their carbon gas emissions. DuPont reduced its greenhouse gas emissions by more than 65 percent from the 1990 levels while using 7 percent less energy and producing 30 percent more product.[50][51]
In May 2007 the $2.1 million DuPont Nature Center at Mispillion Harbor Reserve, a wildlife observatory and interpretive center on the Delaware Bay near Milford, Delaware was opened to enhance the beauty and integrity of the Delaware Estuary. The facility will be state-owned and operated by the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control (DNREC).[52][53]
In 2010, researchers at the Political Economy Research Institute of the University of Massachusetts Amherst ranked DuPont as the fourth largest corporate source of air pollution in the United States.[54] DuPont released a statement that 2012 total releases and transfers were 13% lower than 2011 levels, and 70% lower than 1987 levels.[55] Data from the EPA’s Toxic Release Inventory database included in the Political Economy Research Institute studies likewise show a reduction in DuPont’s emissions from 12.4 million lbs of air releases and 22.4 million lbs of toxic incinerator transfers in 2006[56] to 10.94 million lbs and 22.0 million pounds respectively in 2010. Over the same period, the Political Economy Research Institutes Toxic score for DuPont increased from 122,426 to 7,086,303.[57]
One of DuPont's facilities was listed No. 4 on the Mother Jones Top 20 polluters of 2010, legally discharging over 5,000,000 pounds (2,300,000 kg) of toxic chemicals into New Jersey/Delaware waterways.[58] In 2016, Carneys Point Township, New Jersey, where the facility is located, initiated a $1.1 billion lawsuit against the corporation, accusing it of divesting a unprofitable company with out first remediating the property as required by law.[59]
In 2012 DuPont was named to the Carbon Disclosure Project Global 500 Leadership Index. Inclusion is based on company performance on sustainability metrics, emissions reduction goals, and environmental performance transparency.[60] In 2014 DuPont was the top scoring company in the chemical sector according to CDP, with a score of "A" or "B" in every evaluation area except for supply chain management.[61]
Between 2007 and 2014 there were 34 accidents resulting in toxic releases at DuPont plants across the U.S., with no fewer than 8 fatalities.[62] Four employees died of suffocation in a Houston, Texas accident involving leakage of nearly 24,000 pounds (11,000 kg) of methyl mercaptan.[63] As a result, the company became the largest of the 450 businesses placed into the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's "severe violator program" in July 2015. The program was established for companies OSHA says have repeatedly failed to address safety infractions.[45][64]
DuPont was part of Global Climate Coalition, a group that lobbied against taking action on climate change.[65]
Recognition[edit]
DuPont has been awarded the National Medal of Technology four times: first in 1990, for its invention of "high-performance man-made polymers such as nylon, neoprene rubber, "Teflon" fluorocarbon resin, and a wide spectrum of new fibers, films, and engineering plastics"; the second in 2002 "for policy and technology leadership in the phaseout and replacement of chlorofluorocarbons". DuPont scientist George Levitt was honored with the medal in 1993 for the development of sulfonylurea herbicides. In 1996, DuPont scientist Stephanie Kwolek was recognized for the discovery and development of Kevlar.
On the company's 200th anniversary in 2002, it was presented with the Honor Award by the National Building Museum in recognition of DuPont's "products that directly influence the construction and design process in the building industry."[66]
Controversies[edit]
Genetically modified foods[edit]
Main article: Genetically modified food controversies
Pioneer Hi-Bred, a DuPont subsidiary, manufactures genetically modified seeds, other tools, and agricultural technologies used to increase crop yield.
Chlorofluorocarbons[edit]
Dupont, along with Frigidaire and General Motors, was a part of a collaborative effort to find a replacement for toxic refrigerants in the 1920s, resulting in the invention of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) by Thomas Midgley in 1928.[67] CFCs are ozone-depleting chemicals that were used primarily in aerosol sprays and refrigerants. DuPont was the largest CFC producer in the world with a 25 percent market share in the 1980s, totaling $600 million in annual sales.[68]
In 1974, responding to public concern about the safety of CFCs,[69] DuPont promised to stop production of CFCs should they be proven to be harmful to the ozone layer.
In February 1988, United States Senator Max Baucus, along with two other Senators, wrote to DuPont reminding the company of its pledge. The Los Angeles Times reported that the letter was "generally regarded as an embarrassment for DuPont, which prides itself on its reputation as an environmentally conscious company."[68] The company responded with a strongly worded letter that the available evidence did not support a need to dramatically reduce CFC production and calling the proposal "unwarranted and counterproductive".[70]
On March 14 of the same year, scientists from the National Aeronautics and Space Agency announced the results of a study demonstrating a 2.3% decline in mid-latitude ozone levels between 1969 and 1986, along with evidence tying the decline to CFCs in the upper atmosphere.[71] On March 24, DuPont reversed its position, calling the NASA results "important new information" and announcing that it would phase out CFC production. The company further called for worldwide controls on CFC production and for additional countries to ratify the Montreal Protocol. DuPont's change of policy was widely praised by environmentalists.[72] In 2003, DuPont was awarded the National Medal of Technology, recognizing the company as the leader in developing CFC replacements.[73]
Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA; C8)[edit]
DuPont has faced fines from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and litigation over releases of the Teflon-processing aid perfluoro-octanoic acid (PFOA, also known as C8) from their works in Washington, West Virginia.[74] PFOA-contaminated drinking water led to increased levels of the compound in the bodies of residents who lived in the surrounding area. A court-appointed C8 Science Panel investigated "whether or not there is a probable link between C8 exposure and disease in the community."[75] They eventually concluded that there is a probable link between PFOA and kidney cancer, testicular cancer, thyroid disease, high cholesterol, pre-eclampsia and ulcerative colitis.[76] Water contamination in the Netherlands and links to cancer are also being investigated.[77] A PFOA water contamination interactive maps has been published by ewg.org.[78]
DuPont agreed to sharply reduce its output of PFOA,[79] and was one of eight companies to sign on with the USEPA's 2010/2015 PFOA Stewardship Program. The agreement called for the reduction of "facility emissions and product content of PFOA and related chemicals on a global basis by 95 percent by 2010 and to work toward eliminating emissions and product content of these chemicals by 2015."[80] DuPont phased out PFOA entirely in 2013.
Unlike other persistent organic pollutants, Perfluorooctanoic acid persists indefinitely and is completely resistant to bio-degradation, remaining toxic. The only way to reduce levels in the body is by physical elimination rather than degradation.[81] In 2014, the International Agency for Research on Cancer designated PFOA as "possibly carcinogenic" in humans.[82] One Ohio resident was awarded $1.6 million when a jury in 2015 found that her kidney cancer was caused by PFOA in drinking water. In December 2016 $2 million was awarded when a jury found it caused the plaintiff’s testicular cancer and awarded punitive damages in the amount of $10.5 million.[83] This was the third case where a jury found DuPont liable for injuries resulting from exposure to PFOA in drinking water sources. There were 3,500 similar cases awaiting trial c. 2015. According to the co-lead counselor, internal documents revealed during trial showed DuPont had known of a link between PFOA and cancers since 1997. DuPont maintains it has always handled PFOA "reasonably and responsibly" based on the information they, and industry regulators, had available during its use. However, the jury concluded that DuPont did not act to prevent harm or inform the public, despite the information available.[84]
Imprelis[edit]
In October 2010 DuPont began marketing a herbicide called Imprelis, for control of certain plants in turf areas. DuPont voluntarily pulled Imprelis from the market in August 2011 before the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a mandatory stop-sale order on Imprelis after being alerted of numerous reports from golf courses to nurseries that the product was suspected of injuring and, in some cases, killing trees. Norway spruce, white pines and honey locust proved to be among the species of trees that were susceptible.[85][86]
Price fixing[edit]
In 2005, the company plead guilty to fixing prices of chemicals and products using neoprene, a synthetic rubber, resulting in an $84 million fine.[87]
NASCAR sponsorship[edit]




Jeff Gordon's car with the DuPont Cromax Pro sponsorship


DuPont is widely known for its sponsorship of former four-time NASCAR Sprint Cup Series champion Jeff Gordon and his Hendrick Motorsports No. 24 Chevrolet SS. DuPont sponsored him since he began in Sprint Cup (then Winston Cup) in 1992. DuPont said this about their sponsorship:

Our sponsorship of Jeff Gordon helps keep DuPont brands and products in the public eye. Branding is a key component of the DuPont knowledge intensity strategy for achieving sustainable growth.[88]

The partnership lasted 18 seasons before DuPont was replaced by AARP Drive to End Hunger as the No. 24 team's primary sponsor. DuPont continued as associate sponsor with a 12-race deal,[89] and the deal was extended to 14 races after DuPont sold its performance coatings business, now known as "Axalta Coating Systems", to The Carlyle Group[28] in a deal worth $4.9 billion.[90]
In addition to Gordon, DuPont sponsored Scott Lagasse in the SuperTruck Series presented by Craftsman during the 1995 season (including a one-off ride for Terry Labonte in the Skoal Bandit Copper World Classic, the inaugural Truck race).[91] In the Busch Series, the company sponsored Ricky Craven's RC Racing team in the early 1990s.[92]

E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company, commonly referred to as DuPont, is an American conglomerate that was founded in July 1802 as a gunpowder mill by American chemist and industrialist Éleuthère Irénée du Pont.
In the 20th century, DuPont developed many polymers such as Vespel, neoprene, nylon, Corian, Teflon, Mylar, Kapton, Kevlar, Zemdrain, M5 fiber, Nomex, Tyvek, Sorona, Corfam, and Lycra. DuPont developed Freon (chlorofluorocarbons) for the refrigerant industry, and later more environmentally friendly refrigerants. It also developed synthetic pigments and paints including ChromaFlair.
In 2014, DuPont was the world's fourth largest chemical company based on market capitalization[3] and eighth based on revenue.[4] Its stock price is a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average.

History[edit]

Working powder mills on Brandywine Creek, about 1905


Establishment: 1802[edit]
DuPont was founded in 1802 by Éleuthère Irénée du Pont, using capital raised in France and gunpowder machinery imported from France. The company was started at the Eleutherian Mills, on the Brandywine Creek, near Wilmington, Delaware, two years after he and his family left France to escape the French Revolution and religious persecutions against Huguenot protestants. It began as a manufacturer of gunpowder, as du Pont noticed that the industry in North America was lagging behind Europe. The company grew quickly, and by the mid-19th century had become the largest supplier of gunpowder to the United States military, supplying half the powder used by the Union Army during the American Civil War. The Eleutherian Mills site is now a museum and a National Historic Landmark.
Expansion: 1902 to 1912[edit]
DuPont continued to expand, moving into the production of dynamite and smokeless powder. In 1902, DuPont's president, Eugene du Pont, died, and the surviving partners sold the company to three great-grandsons of the original founder. Charles Lee Reese was appointed as director and the company began centralizing their research departments.[5] The company subsequently purchased several smaller chemical companies, and in 1912 these actions gave rise to government scrutiny under the Sherman Antitrust Act. The courts declared that the company's dominance of the explosives business constituted a monopoly and ordered divestment. The court ruling resulted in the creation of the Hercules Powder Company (later Hercules Inc. and now part of Ashland Inc.) and the Atlas Powder Company (purchased by Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) and now part of AkzoNobel).[6] At the time of divestment, DuPont retained the single base nitrocellulose powders, while Hercules held the double base powders combining nitrocellulose and nitroglycerine. DuPont subsequently developed the Improved Military Rifle (IMR) line of smokeless powders.[7]
In 1910, DuPont published a brochure entitled "Farming with Dynamite". The pamphlet was instructional, outlining the benefits to using their dynamite products on stumps and various other obstacles that would be easier to remove with dynamite as opposed to other more conventional, inefficient means.[8]
DuPont also established two of the first industrial laboratories in the United States, where they began the work on cellulose chemistry, lacquers and other non-explosive products. DuPont Central Research was established at the DuPont Experimental Station, across the Brandywine Creek from the original powder mills.
Automotive investments: 1914[edit]
In 1914, Pierre S. du Pont invested in the fledgling automobile industry, buying stock in General Motors (GM). The following year he was invited to sit on GM's board of directors and would eventually be appointed the company's chairman. The DuPont company would assist the struggling automobile company further with a $25 million purchase of GM stock. In 1920, Pierre S. du Pont was elected president of General Motors. Under du Pont's guidance, GM became the number one automobile company in the world. However, in 1957, because of DuPont's influence within GM, further action under the Clayton Antitrust Act forced DuPont to divest its shares of General Motors.
Major breakthroughs: 1920s–1930s[edit]

In the 1920s, DuPont continued its emphasis on materials science, hiring Wallace Carothers to work on polymers in 1928. Carothers invented neoprene, a synthetic rubber;[9] the first polyester superpolymer; and, in 1935, nylon. The invention of Teflon followed a few years later. DuPont introduced phenothiazine as an insecticide in 1935.[10]
Second World War: 1941 to 1945[edit]
DuPont ranked 15th among United States corporations in the value of wartime production contracts.[11] As the inventor and manufacturer of nylon, DuPont helped produce the raw materials for parachutes, powder bags,[12] and tires.[13]
DuPont also played a major role in the Manhattan Project in 1943, designing, building and operating the Hanford plutonium producing plant in Hanford, Washington. In 1950 DuPont also agreed to build the Savannah River Plant in South Carolina as part of the effort to create a hydrogen bomb.
Space Age developments: 1950 to 1970[edit]
After the war, DuPont continued its emphasis on new materials, developing Mylar, Dacron, Orlon, and Lycra in the 1950s, and Tyvek, Nomex, Qiana, Corfam, and Corian in the 1960s. DuPont materials were critical to the success of the Apollo Project of the United States space program.[citation needed]
DuPont has been the key company behind the development of modern body armor. In the Second World War DuPont's ballistic nylon was used by Britain's Royal Air Force to make flak jackets. With the development of Kevlar in the 1960s, DuPont began tests to see if it could resist a lead bullet. This research would ultimately lead to the bullet resistant vests that are the mainstay of police and military units in the industrialized world.[citation needed]
Conoco holdings: 1981 to 1999[edit]
In 1981, DuPont acquired Conoco Inc., a major American oil and gas producing company that gave it a secure source of petroleum feedstocks needed for the manufacturing of many of its fiber and plastics products. The acquisition, which made DuPont one of the top ten U.S.-based petroleum and natural gas producers and refiners, came about after a bidding war with the giant distillery Seagram Company Ltd., which would become DuPont's largest single shareholder with four seats on the board of directors. On April 6, 1995, after being approached by Seagram Chief Executive Officer Edgar Bronfman Jr., DuPont announced a deal in which the company would buy back all the shares owned by Seagram.[14]
In 1999, DuPont sold all of its shares of Conoco, which merged with Phillips Petroleum Company, and acquired the Pioneer Hi-Bred agricultural seed company.

DuPont describes itself as a global science company that employs more than 60,000 people worldwide and has a diverse array of product offerings.[1] The company ranks 86th in the Fortune 500 on the strength of nearly $36 billion in revenues, $4.848 billion in profits in 2013.[16] In April 2014, Forbes ranked DuPont 171st on its Global 2000, the listing of the world's top public companies.[17]
DuPont businesses are organized into the following five categories, known as marketing "platforms": Electronic and Communication Technologies, Performance Materials, Coatings and Color Technologies, Safety and Protection, and Agriculture and Nutrition.
The agriculture division, DuPont Pioneer makes and sells hybrid seed and genetically modified seed, some of which goes on to become genetically modified food. Genes engineered into their products include LibertyLink, which provides resistance to Bayer's Ignite Herbicide/Liberty herbicides; the Herculex I Insect Protection gene which provides protection against various insects; the Herculex RW insect protection trait which provides protection against other insects; the YieldGard Corn Borer gene, which provides resistance to another set of insects; and the Roundup Ready Corn 2 trait that provides crop resistance against glyphosate herbicides.[18] In 2010, DuPont Pioneer received approval to start marketing Plenish soybeans, which contains "the highest oleic acid content of any commercial soybean product, at more than 75 percent. Plenish provides a product with no trans fat, 20 percent less saturated fat than regular soybean oil, and more stabile oil with greater flexibility in food and industrial applications."[19] Plenish is genetically engineered to "block the formation of enzymes that continue the cascade downstream from oleic acid (that produces saturated fats), resulting in an accumulation of the desirable monounsaturated acid."[20]
In October 2001, the company sold its pharmaceutical business to Bristol Myers Squibb for $7.798 billion.[21]
In 2002, the company sold the Clysar(R)business to Bemis Company for $143 million.[22][23]
In 2004, the company sold its textiles business, which included some of its best-known brands such as Lycra (Spandex), Dacron polyester, Orlon acrylic, Antron nylon and Thermolite, to Koch Industries.
In 2011, DuPont was the largest producer of titanium dioxide in the world, primarily provided as a white pigment used in the paper industry.[24]
DuPont has 150 research and development facilities located in China, Brazil, India, Germany, and Switzerland with an average investment of $2 billion annually in a diverse range of technologies for many markets including agriculture, genetic traits, biofuels, automotive, construction, electronics, chemicals, and industrial materials. DuPont employs more than 10,000 scientists and engineers around the world.[1]
On January 9, 2011, DuPont announced that it had reached an agreement to buy Danish company Danisco for US$6.3 billion.[25] On May 16, 2011, DuPont announced that its tender offer for Danisco had been successful and that it would proceed to redeem the remaining shares and delist the company.[26]
On May 1, 2012, DuPont announced that it had acquired from Bunge full ownership of the Solae joint venture, a soy-based ingredients company. DuPont previously owned 72 percent of the joint venture while Bunge owned the remaining 28 percent.[27]
In February 2013, DuPont Performance Coatings was sold to the Carlyle Group and rebranded as Axalta Coating Systems.[28]
In October 2015, DuPont sold the Neoprene chloroprene rubber business to Denka Performance Elastomers, a joint venture of Denka and Mitsui.[29]
Chemours[edit]
In October 2013, DuPont announced that it was planning to spin off its Performance Chemicals business into a new publicly traded company in mid-2015.[30] The company filed its initial Form 10 with the SEC in December 2014 and announced that the new company would be called The Chemours Company.[31] The spin-off to DuPont shareholders was completed on July 1, 2015 and Chemours stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange on the same date.[32]
DuPont will focus on production of GMO seeds, materials for solar panels, and alternatives to fossil fuels. Chemours becomes responsible for the cleanup of 171 former DuPont sites, which DuPont says will cost between $295 million and $945 million.[33]
Merger with Dow[edit]
Main article: Dow DuPont merger
On December 11, 2015, DuPont announced that it would merge with the Dow Chemical Company, in an all-stock deal. The combined company, which will be known as DowDuPont, will have an estimated value of $130 billion, be equally held by the shareholders of both companies, and maintain their headquarters in Delaware and Michigan respectively. Within two years of the merger's closure, expected in the first quarter of 2017 and subject to regulatory approval, DowDuPont will be split into three separate public companies, focusing on the agricultural chemicals, materials science, and specialty product industries.[34][35] Commentators have questioned the economic viability of this plan because, of the three companies, only the specialty products industry has prospects for high growth.[35] The outlook on the profitability of the other two proposed companies has been questioned due to reduced crop prices and lower margins on plastics such as polyethylene.[35] They have also noted that the deal is likely to face antitrust scrutiny in several countries.[36] This eventually became the case, with two delays taking place due to regulatory approvals. The merger is now targeted to close in mid-2017.[37]
Locations[edit]




Entrance to Washington Works in Washington, West Virginia formerly owned by DuPont, now owned by Chemours.


The company's corporate headquarters are located in Wilmington, Delaware. The company’s manufacturing, processing, marketing, and research and development facilities, as well as regional purchasing offices and distribution centers are located throughout the world.[38] Major manufacturing sites include the Spruance plant near Richmond, Virginia, (currently the company's largest plant), the Washington Works site in Washington, West Virginia, the Mobile Manufacturing Center (MMC) in Axis, Alabama, the Bayport plant near Houston, Texas, the Mechelen site in Belgium, and the Changshu site in China.[39] Other locations include the Yerkes Plant on the Niagara River at Tonawanda, New York, the Sabine River Works Plant in Orange, Texas, and the Parlin Site in Sayreville, New Jersey. The facilities in Vadodara, Gujarat and Hyderabad, Telangana in India constitute the DuPont Services Center and DuPont Knowledge Center respectively.

On October 5, 2015, DuPont announced that Ellen Kullman would retire as Chair and CEO on October 16, 2015.[42] Breen was appointed CEO in November 2015 replacing Kullman.[43][44][45]
Environmental record[edit]
In the 1990s, DuPont was a founding member of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development with then DuPont CEO Chad Holliday as chairman of the WBCSD from 2000 to 2001.[46] The organization has developed guidelines for measuring sustainability cited by the Natural Resources Defense Council[47] and the Environmental Defense Fund,[48] and its Vision 2050 blueprint for slowing and reversing environmental damage has been highlighted by The Guardian.[49]
In 2005, BusinessWeek magazine, in conjunction with the Climate Group, ranked DuPont as the best-practice leader in cutting their carbon gas emissions. DuPont reduced its greenhouse gas emissions by more than 65 percent from the 1990 levels while using 7 percent less energy and producing 30 percent more product.[50][51]
In May 2007 the $2.1 million DuPont Nature Center at Mispillion Harbor Reserve, a wildlife observatory and interpretive center on the Delaware Bay near Milford, Delaware was opened to enhance the beauty and integrity of the Delaware Estuary. The facility will be state-owned and operated by the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control (DNREC).[52][53]
In 2010, researchers at the Political Economy Research Institute of the University of Massachusetts Amherst ranked DuPont as the fourth largest corporate source of air pollution in the United States.[54] DuPont released a statement that 2012 total releases and transfers were 13% lower than 2011 levels, and 70% lower than 1987 levels.[55] Data from the EPA’s Toxic Release Inventory database included in the Political Economy Research Institute studies likewise show a reduction in DuPont’s emissions from 12.4 million lbs of air releases and 22.4 million lbs of toxic incinerator transfers in 2006[56] to 10.94 million lbs and 22.0 million pounds respectively in 2010. Over the same period, the Political Economy Research Institutes Toxic score for DuPont increased from 122,426 to 7,086,303.[57]
One of DuPont's facilities was listed No. 4 on the Mother Jones Top 20 polluters of 2010, legally discharging over 5,000,000 pounds (2,300,000 kg) of toxic chemicals into New Jersey/Delaware waterways.[58] In 2016, Carneys Point Township, New Jersey, where the facility is located, initiated a $1.1 billion lawsuit against the corporation, accusing it of divesting a unprofitable company with out first remediating the property as required by law.[59]
In 2012 DuPont was named to the Carbon Disclosure Project Global 500 Leadership Index. Inclusion is based on company performance on sustainability metrics, emissions reduction goals, and environmental performance transparency.[60] In 2014 DuPont was the top scoring company in the chemical sector according to CDP, with a score of "A" or "B" in every evaluation area except for supply chain management.[61]
Between 2007 and 2014 there were 34 accidents resulting in toxic releases at DuPont plants across the U.S., with no fewer than 8 fatalities.[62] Four employees died of suffocation in a Houston, Texas accident involving leakage of nearly 24,000 pounds (11,000 kg) of methyl mercaptan.[63] As a result, the company became the largest of the 450 businesses placed into the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's "severe violator program" in July 2015. The program was established for companies OSHA says have repeatedly failed to address safety infractions.[45][64]
DuPont was part of Global Climate Coalition, a group that lobbied against taking action on climate change.[65]
Recognition[edit]
DuPont has been awarded the National Medal of Technology four times: first in 1990, for its invention of "high-performance man-made polymers such as nylon, neoprene rubber, "Teflon" fluorocarbon resin, and a wide spectrum of new fibers, films, and engineering plastics"; the second in 2002 "for policy and technology leadership in the phaseout and replacement of chlorofluorocarbons". DuPont scientist George Levitt was honored with the medal in 1993 for the development of sulfonylurea herbicides. In 1996, DuPont scientist Stephanie Kwolek was recognized for the discovery and development of Kevlar.
On the company's 200th anniversary in 2002, it was presented with the Honor Award by the National Building Museum in recognition of DuPont's "products that directly influence the construction and design process in the building industry."[66]
Controversies[edit]
Genetically modified foods[edit]
Main article: Genetically modified food controversies
Pioneer Hi-Bred, a DuPont subsidiary, manufactures genetically modified seeds, other tools, and agricultural technologies used to increase crop yield.
Chlorofluorocarbons[edit]
Dupont, along with Frigidaire and General Motors, was a part of a collaborative effort to find a replacement for toxic refrigerants in the 1920s, resulting in the invention of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) by Thomas Midgley in 1928.[67] CFCs are ozone-depleting chemicals that were used primarily in aerosol sprays and refrigerants. DuPont was the largest CFC producer in the world with a 25 percent market share in the 1980s, totaling $600 million in annual sales.[68]
In 1974, responding to public concern about the safety of CFCs,[69] DuPont promised to stop production of CFCs should they be proven to be harmful to the ozone layer.
In February 1988, United States Senator Max Baucus, along with two other Senators, wrote to DuPont reminding the company of its pledge. The Los Angeles Times reported that the letter was "generally regarded as an embarrassment for DuPont, which prides itself on its reputation as an environmentally conscious company."[68] The company responded with a strongly worded letter that the available evidence did not support a need to dramatically reduce CFC production and calling the proposal "unwarranted and counterproductive".[70]
On March 14 of the same year, scientists from the National Aeronautics and Space Agency announced the results of a study demonstrating a 2.3% decline in mid-latitude ozone levels between 1969 and 1986, along with evidence tying the decline to CFCs in the upper atmosphere.[71] On March 24, DuPont reversed its position, calling the NASA results "important new information" and announcing that it would phase out CFC production. The company further called for worldwide controls on CFC production and for additional countries to ratify the Montreal Protocol. DuPont's change of policy was widely praised by environmentalists.[72] In 2003, DuPont was awarded the National Medal of Technology, recognizing the company as the leader in developing CFC replacements.[73]
Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA; C8)[edit]
DuPont has faced fines from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and litigation over releases of the Teflon-processing aid perfluoro-octanoic acid (PFOA, also known as C8) from their works in Washington, West Virginia.[74] PFOA-contaminated drinking water led to increased levels of the compound in the bodies of residents who lived in the surrounding area. A court-appointed C8 Science Panel investigated "whether or not there is a probable link between C8 exposure and disease in the community."[75] They eventually concluded that there is a probable link between PFOA and kidney cancer, testicular cancer, thyroid disease, high cholesterol, pre-eclampsia and ulcerative colitis.[76] Water contamination in the Netherlands and links to cancer are also being investigated.[77] A PFOA water contamination interactive maps has been published by ewg.org.[78]
DuPont agreed to sharply reduce its output of PFOA,[79] and was one of eight companies to sign on with the USEPA's 2010/2015 PFOA Stewardship Program. The agreement called for the reduction of "facility emissions and product content of PFOA and related chemicals on a global basis by 95 percent by 2010 and to work toward eliminating emissions and product content of these chemicals by 2015."[80] DuPont phased out PFOA entirely in 2013.
Unlike other persistent organic pollutants, Perfluorooctanoic acid persists indefinitely and is completely resistant to bio-degradation, remaining toxic. The only way to reduce levels in the body is by physical elimination rather than degradation.[81] In 2014, the International Agency for Research on Cancer designated PFOA as "possibly carcinogenic" in humans.[82] One Ohio resident was awarded $1.6 million when a jury in 2015 found that her kidney cancer was caused by PFOA in drinking water. In December 2016 $2 million was awarded when a jury found it caused the plaintiff’s testicular cancer and awarded punitive damages in the amount of $10.5 million.[83] This was the third case where a jury found DuPont liable for injuries resulting from exposure to PFOA in drinking water sources. There were 3,500 similar cases awaiting trial c. 2015. According to the co-lead counselor, internal documents revealed during trial showed DuPont had known of a link between PFOA and cancers since 1997. DuPont maintains it has always handled PFOA "reasonably and responsibly" based on the information they, and industry regulators, had available during its use. However, the jury concluded that DuPont did not act to prevent harm or inform the public, despite the information available.[84]
Imprelis[edit]
In October 2010 DuPont began marketing a herbicide called Imprelis, for control of certain plants in turf areas. DuPont voluntarily pulled Imprelis from the market in August 2011 before the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a mandatory stop-sale order on Imprelis after being alerted of numerous reports from golf courses to nurseries that the product was suspected of injuring and, in some cases, killing trees. Norway spruce, white pines and honey locust proved to be among the species of trees that were susceptible.[85][86]
Price fixing[edit]
In 2005, the company plead guilty to fixing prices of chemicals and products using neoprene, a synthetic rubber, resulting in an $84 million fine.[87]
NASCAR sponsorship[edit]




Jeff Gordon's car with the DuPont Cromax Pro sponsorship


DuPont is widely known for its sponsorship of former four-time NASCAR Sprint Cup Series champion Jeff Gordon and his Hendrick Motorsports No. 24 Chevrolet SS. DuPont sponsored him since he began in Sprint Cup (then Winston Cup) in 1992. DuPont said this about their sponsorship:

Our sponsorship of Jeff Gordon helps keep DuPont brands and products in the public eye. Branding is a key component of the DuPont knowledge intensity strategy for achieving sustainable growth.[88]

The partnership lasted 18 seasons before DuPont was replaced by AARP Drive to End Hunger as the No. 24 team's primary sponsor. DuPont continued as associate sponsor with a 12-race deal,[89] and the deal was extended to 14 races after DuPont sold its performance coatings business, now known as "Axalta Coating Systems", to The Carlyle Group[28] in a deal worth $4.9 billion.[90]
In addition to Gordon, DuPont sponsored Scott Lagasse in the SuperTruck Series presented by Craftsman during the 1995 season (including a one-off ride for Terry Labonte in the Skoal Bandit Copper World Classic, the inaugural Truck race).[91] In the Busch Series, the company sponsored Ricky Craven's RC Racing team in the early 1990s.[92]

E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company, commonly referred to as DuPont, is an American conglomerate that was founded in July 1802 as a gunpowder mill by American chemist and industrialist Éleuthère Irénée du Pont.
In the 20th century, DuPont developed many polymers such as Vespel, neoprene, nylon, Corian, Teflon, Mylar, Kapton, Kevlar, Zemdrain, M5 fiber, Nomex, Tyvek, Sorona, Corfam, and Lycra. DuPont developed Freon (chlorofluorocarbons) for the refrigerant industry, and later more environmentally friendly refrigerants. It also developed synthetic pigments and paints including ChromaFlair.
In 2014, DuPont was the world's fourth largest chemical company based on market capitalization[3] and eighth based on revenue.[4] Its stock price is a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average.

History[edit]

Working powder mills on Brandywine Creek, about 1905


Establishment: 1802[edit]
DuPont was founded in 1802 by Éleuthère Irénée du Pont, using capital raised in France and gunpowder machinery imported from France. The company was started at the Eleutherian Mills, on the Brandywine Creek, near Wilmington, Delaware, two years after he and his family left France to escape the French Revolution and religious persecutions against Huguenot protestants. It began as a manufacturer of gunpowder, as du Pont noticed that the industry in North America was lagging behind Europe. The company grew quickly, and by the mid-19th century had become the largest supplier of gunpowder to the United States military, supplying half the powder used by the Union Army during the American Civil War. The Eleutherian Mills site is now a museum and a National Historic Landmark.
Expansion: 1902 to 1912[edit]
DuPont continued to expand, moving into the production of dynamite and smokeless powder. In 1902, DuPont's president, Eugene du Pont, died, and the surviving partners sold the company to three great-grandsons of the original founder. Charles Lee Reese was appointed as director and the company began centralizing their research departments.[5] The company subsequently purchased several smaller chemical companies, and in 1912 these actions gave rise to government scrutiny under the Sherman Antitrust Act. The courts declared that the company's dominance of the explosives business constituted a monopoly and ordered divestment. The court ruling resulted in the creation of the Hercules Powder Company (later Hercules Inc. and now part of Ashland Inc.) and the Atlas Powder Company (purchased by Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) and now part of AkzoNobel).[6] At the time of divestment, DuPont retained the single base nitrocellulose powders, while Hercules held the double base powders combining nitrocellulose and nitroglycerine. DuPont subsequently developed the Improved Military Rifle (IMR) line of smokeless powders.[7]
In 1910, DuPont published a brochure entitled "Farming with Dynamite". The pamphlet was instructional, outlining the benefits to using their dynamite products on stumps and various other obstacles that would be easier to remove with dynamite as opposed to other more conventional, inefficient means.[8]
DuPont also established two of the first industrial laboratories in the United States, where they began the work on cellulose chemistry, lacquers and other non-explosive products. DuPont Central Research was established at the DuPont Experimental Station, across the Brandywine Creek from the original powder mills.
Automotive investments: 1914[edit]
In 1914, Pierre S. du Pont invested in the fledgling automobile industry, buying stock in General Motors (GM). The following year he was invited to sit on GM's board of directors and would eventually be appointed the company's chairman. The DuPont company would assist the struggling automobile company further with a $25 million purchase of GM stock. In 1920, Pierre S. du Pont was elected president of General Motors. Under du Pont's guidance, GM became the number one automobile company in the world. However, in 1957, because of DuPont's influence within GM, further action under the Clayton Antitrust Act forced DuPont to divest its shares of General Motors.
Major breakthroughs: 1920s–1930s[edit]

In the 1920s, DuPont continued its emphasis on materials science, hiring Wallace Carothers to work on polymers in 1928. Carothers invented neoprene, a synthetic rubber;[9] the first polyester superpolymer; and, in 1935, nylon. The invention of Teflon followed a few years later. DuPont introduced phenothiazine as an insecticide in 1935.[10]
Second World War: 1941 to 1945[edit]
DuPont ranked 15th among United States corporations in the value of wartime production contracts.[11] As the inventor and manufacturer of nylon, DuPont helped produce the raw materials for parachutes, powder bags,[12] and tires.[13]
DuPont also played a major role in the Manhattan Project in 1943, designing, building and operating the Hanford plutonium producing plant in Hanford, Washington. In 1950 DuPont also agreed to build the Savannah River Plant in South Carolina as part of the effort to create a hydrogen bomb.
Space Age developments: 1950 to 1970[edit]
After the war, DuPont continued its emphasis on new materials, developing Mylar, Dacron, Orlon, and Lycra in the 1950s, and Tyvek, Nomex, Qiana, Corfam, and Corian in the 1960s. DuPont materials were critical to the success of the Apollo Project of the United States space program.[citation needed]
DuPont has been the key company behind the development of modern body armor. In the Second World War DuPont's ballistic nylon was used by Britain's Royal Air Force to make flak jackets. With the development of Kevlar in the 1960s, DuPont began tests to see if it could resist a lead bullet. This research would ultimately lead to the bullet resistant vests that are the mainstay of police and military units in the industrialized world.[citation needed]
Conoco holdings: 1981 to 1999[edit]
In 1981, DuPont acquired Conoco Inc., a major American oil and gas producing company that gave it a secure source of petroleum feedstocks needed for the manufacturing of many of its fiber and plastics products. The acquisition, which made DuPont one of the top ten U.S.-based petroleum and natural gas producers and refiners, came about after a bidding war with the giant distillery Seagram Company Ltd., which would become DuPont's largest single shareholder with four seats on the board of directors. On April 6, 1995, after being approached by Seagram Chief Executive Officer Edgar Bronfman Jr., DuPont announced a deal in which the company would buy back all the shares owned by Seagram.[14]
In 1999, DuPont sold all of its shares of Conoco, which merged with Phillips Petroleum Company, and acquired the Pioneer Hi-Bred agricultural seed company.

DuPont describes itself as a global science company that employs more than 60,000 people worldwide and has a diverse array of product offerings.[1] The company ranks 86th in the Fortune 500 on the strength of nearly $36 billion in revenues, $4.848 billion in profits in 2013.[16] In April 2014, Forbes ranked DuPont 171st on its Global 2000, the listing of the world's top public companies.[17]
DuPont businesses are organized into the following five categories, known as marketing "platforms": Electronic and Communication Technologies, Performance Materials, Coatings and Color Technologies, Safety and Protection, and Agriculture and Nutrition.
The agriculture division, DuPont Pioneer makes and sells hybrid seed and genetically modified seed, some of which goes on to become genetically modified food. Genes engineered into their products include LibertyLink, which provides resistance to Bayer's Ignite Herbicide/Liberty herbicides; the Herculex I Insect Protection gene which provides protection against various insects; the Herculex RW insect protection trait which provides protection against other insects; the YieldGard Corn Borer gene, which provides resistance to another set of insects; and the Roundup Ready Corn 2 trait that provides crop resistance against glyphosate herbicides.[18] In 2010, DuPont Pioneer received approval to start marketing Plenish soybeans, which contains "the highest oleic acid content of any commercial soybean product, at more than 75 percent. Plenish provides a product with no trans fat, 20 percent less saturated fat than regular soybean oil, and more stabile oil with greater flexibility in food and industrial applications."[19] Plenish is genetically engineered to "block the formation of enzymes that continue the cascade downstream from oleic acid (that produces saturated fats), resulting in an accumulation of the desirable monounsaturated acid."[20]
In October 2001, the company sold its pharmaceutical business to Bristol Myers Squibb for $7.798 billion.[21]
In 2002, the company sold the Clysar(R)business to Bemis Company for $143 million.[22][23]
In 2004, the company sold its textiles business, which included some of its best-known brands such as Lycra (Spandex), Dacron polyester, Orlon acrylic, Antron nylon and Thermolite, to Koch Industries.
In 2011, DuPont was the largest producer of titanium dioxide in the world, primarily provided as a white pigment used in the paper industry.[24]
DuPont has 150 research and development facilities located in China, Brazil, India, Germany, and Switzerland with an average investment of $2 billion annually in a diverse range of technologies for many markets including agriculture, genetic traits, biofuels, automotive, construction, electronics, chemicals, and industrial materials. DuPont employs more than 10,000 scientists and engineers around the world.[1]
On January 9, 2011, DuPont announced that it had reached an agreement to buy Danish company Danisco for US$6.3 billion.[25] On May 16, 2011, DuPont announced that its tender offer for Danisco had been successful and that it would proceed to redeem the remaining shares and delist the company.[26]
On May 1, 2012, DuPont announced that it had acquired from Bunge full ownership of the Solae joint venture, a soy-based ingredients company. DuPont previously owned 72 percent of the joint venture while Bunge owned the remaining 28 percent.[27]
In February 2013, DuPont Performance Coatings was sold to the Carlyle Group and rebranded as Axalta Coating Systems.[28]
In October 2015, DuPont sold the Neoprene chloroprene rubber business to Denka Performance Elastomers, a joint venture of Denka and Mitsui.[29]
Chemours[edit]
In October 2013, DuPont announced that it was planning to spin off its Performance Chemicals business into a new publicly traded company in mid-2015.[30] The company filed its initial Form 10 with the SEC in December 2014 and announced that the new company would be called The Chemours Company.[31] The spin-off to DuPont shareholders was completed on July 1, 2015 and Chemours stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange on the same date.[32]
DuPont will focus on production of GMO seeds, materials for solar panels, and alternatives to fossil fuels. Chemours becomes responsible for the cleanup of 171 former DuPont sites, which DuPont says will cost between $295 million and $945 million.[33]
Merger with Dow[edit]
Main article: Dow DuPont merger
On December 11, 2015, DuPont announced that it would merge with the Dow Chemical Company, in an all-stock deal. The combined company, which will be known as DowDuPont, will have an estimated value of $130 billion, be equally held by the shareholders of both companies, and maintain their headquarters in Delaware and Michigan respectively. Within two years of the merger's closure, expected in the first quarter of 2017 and subject to regulatory approval, DowDuPont will be split into three separate public companies, focusing on the agricultural chemicals, materials science, and specialty product industries.[34][35] Commentators have questioned the economic viability of this plan because, of the three companies, only the specialty products industry has prospects for high growth.[35] The outlook on the profitability of the other two proposed companies has been questioned due to reduced crop prices and lower margins on plastics such as polyethylene.[35] They have also noted that the deal is likely to face antitrust scrutiny in several countries.[36] This eventually became the case, with two delays taking place due to regulatory approvals. The merger is now targeted to close in mid-2017.[37]
Locations[edit]

On October 5, 2015, DuPont announced that Ellen Kullman would retire as Chair and CEO on October 16, 2015.[42] Breen was appointed CEO in November 2015 replacing Kullman.[43][44][45]
Environmental record[edit]
In the 1990s, DuPont was a founding member of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development with then DuPont CEO Chad Holliday as chairman of the WBCSD from 2000 to 2001.[46] The organization has developed guidelines for measuring sustainability cited by the Natural Resources Defense Council[47] and the Environmental Defense Fund,[48] and its Vision 2050 blueprint for slowing and reversing environmental damage has been highlighted by The Guardian.[49]
In 2005, BusinessWeek magazine, in conjunction with the Climate Group, ranked DuPont as the best-practice leader in cutting their carbon gas emissions. DuPont reduced its greenhouse gas emissions by more than 65 percent from the 1990 levels while using 7 percent less energy and producing 30 percent more product.[50][51]
In May 2007 the $2.1 million DuPont Nature Center at Mispillion Harbor Reserve, a wildlife observatory and interpretive center on the Delaware Bay near Milford, Delaware was opened to enhance the beauty and integrity of the Delaware Estuary. The facility will be state-owned and operated by the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control (DNREC).[52][53]
In 2010, researchers at the Political Economy Research Institute of the University of Massachusetts Amherst ranked DuPont as the fourth largest corporate source of air pollution in the United States.[54] DuPont released a statement that 2012 total releases and transfers were 13% lower than 2011 levels, and 70% lower than 1987 levels.[55] Data from the EPA’s Toxic Release Inventory database included in the Political Economy Research Institute studies likewise show a reduction in DuPont’s emissions from 12.4 million lbs of air releases and 22.4 million lbs of toxic incinerator transfers in 2006[56] to 10.94 million lbs and 22.0 million pounds respectively in 2010. Over the same period, the Political Economy Research Institutes Toxic score for DuPont increased from 122,426 to 7,086,303.[57]
One of DuPont's facilities was listed No. 4 on the Mother Jones Top 20 polluters of 2010, legally discharging over 5,000,000 pounds (2,300,000 kg) of toxic chemicals into New Jersey/Delaware waterways.[58] In 2016, Carneys Point Township, New Jersey, where the facility is located, initiated a $1.1 billion lawsuit against the corporation, accusing it of divesting a unprofitable company with out first remediating the property as required by law.[59]
In 2012 DuPont was named to the Carbon Disclosure Project Global 500 Leadership Index. Inclusion is based on company performance on sustainability metrics, emissions reduction goals, and environmental performance transparency.[60] In 2014 DuPont was the top scoring company in the chemical sector according to CDP, with a score of "A" or "B" in every evaluation area except for supply chain management.[61]
Between 2007 and 2014 there were 34 accidents resulting in toxic releases at DuPont plants across the U.S., with no fewer than 8 fatalities.[62] Four employees died of suffocation in a Houston, Texas accident involving leakage of nearly 24,000 pounds (11,000 kg) of methyl mercaptan.[63] As a result, the company became the largest of the 450 businesses placed into the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's "severe violator program" in July 2015. The program was established for companies OSHA says have repeatedly failed to address safety infractions.[45][64]
DuPont was part of Global Climate Coalition, a group that lobbied against taking action on climate change.[65]
Recognition[edit]
DuPont has been awarded the National Medal of Technology four times: first in 1990, for its invention of "high-performance man-made polymers such as nylon, neoprene rubber, "Teflon" fluorocarbon resin, and a wide spectrum of new fibers, films, and engineering plastics"; the second in 2002 "for policy and technology leadership in the phaseout and replacement of chlorofluorocarbons". DuPont scientist George Levitt was honored with the medal in 1993 for the development of sulfonylurea herbicides. In 1996, DuPont scientist Stephanie Kwolek was recognized for the discovery and development of Kevlar.
On the company's 200th anniversary in 2002, it was presented with the Honor Award by the National Building Museum in recognition of DuPont's "products that directly influence the construction and design process in the building industry."[66]
Controversies[edit]
Genetically modified foods[edit]
Main article: Genetically modified food controversies
Pioneer Hi-Bred, a DuPont subsidiary, manufactures genetically modified seeds, other tools, and agricultural technologies used to increase crop yield.
Chlorofluorocarbons[edit]
Dupont, along with Frigidaire and General Motors, was a part of a collaborative effort to find a replacement for toxic refrigerants in the 1920s, resulting in the invention of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) by Thomas Midgley in 1928.[67] CFCs are ozone-depleting chemicals that were used primarily in aerosol sprays and refrigerants. DuPont was the largest CFC producer in the world with a 25 percent market share in the 1980s, totaling $600 million in annual sales.[68]
In 1974, responding to public concern about the safety of CFCs,[69] DuPont promised to stop production of CFCs should they be proven to be harmful to the ozone layer.
In February 1988, United States Senator Max Baucus, along with two other Senators, wrote to DuPont reminding the company of its pledge. The Los Angeles Times reported that the letter was "generally regarded as an embarrassment for DuPont, which prides itself on its reputation as an environmentally conscious company."[68] The company responded with a strongly worded letter that the available evidence did not support a need to dramatically reduce CFC production and calling the proposal "unwarranted and counterproductive".[70]
On March 14 of the same year, scientists from the National Aeronautics and Space Agency announced the results of a study demonstrating a 2.3% decline in mid-latitude ozone levels between 1969 and 1986, along with evidence tying the decline to CFCs in the upper atmosphere.[71] On March 24, DuPont reversed its position, calling the NASA results "important new information" and announcing that it would phase out CFC production. The company further called for worldwide controls on CFC production and for additional countries to ratify the Montreal Protocol. DuPont's change of policy was widely praised by environmentalists.[72] In 2003, DuPont was awarded the National Medal of Technology, recognizing the company as the leader in developing CFC replacements.[73]
Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA; C8)[edit]
DuPont has faced fines from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and litigation over releases of the Teflon-processing aid perfluoro-octanoic acid (PFOA, also known as C8) from their works in Washington, West Virginia.[74] PFOA-contaminated drinking water led to increased levels of the compound in the bodies of residents who lived in the surrounding area. A court-appointed C8 Science Panel investigated "whether or not there is a probable link between C8 exposure and disease in the community."[75] They eventually concluded that there is a probable link between PFOA and kidney cancer, testicular cancer, thyroid disease, high cholesterol, pre-eclampsia and ulcerative colitis.[76] Water contamination in the Netherlands and links to cancer are also being investigated.[77] A PFOA water contamination interactive maps has been published by ewg.org.[78]
DuPont agreed to sharply reduce its output of PFOA,[79] and was one of eight companies to sign on with the USEPA's 2010/2015 PFOA Stewardship Program. The agreement called for the reduction of "facility emissions and product content of PFOA and related chemicals on a global basis by 95 percent by 2010 and to work toward eliminating emissions and product content of these chemicals by 2015."[80] DuPont phased out PFOA entirely in 2013.
Unlike other persistent organic pollutants, Perfluorooctanoic acid persists indefinitely and is completely resistant to bio-degradation, remaining toxic. The only way to reduce levels in the body is by physical elimination rather than degradation.[81] In 2014, the International Agency for Research on Cancer designated PFOA as "possibly carcinogenic" in humans.[82] One Ohio resident was awarded $1.6 million when a jury in 2015 found that her kidney cancer was caused by PFOA in drinking water. In December 2016 $2 million was awarded when a jury found it caused the plaintiff’s testicular cancer and awarded punitive damages in the amount of $10.5 million.[83] This was the third case where a jury found DuPont liable for injuries resulting from exposure to PFOA in drinking water sources. There were 3,500 similar cases awaiting trial c. 2015. According to the co-lead counselor, internal documents revealed during trial showed DuPont had known of a link between PFOA and cancers since 1997. DuPont maintains it has always handled PFOA "reasonably and responsibly" based on the information they, and industry regulators, had available during its use. However, the jury concluded that DuPont did not act to prevent harm or inform the public, despite the information available.[84]
Imprelis[edit]
In October 2010 DuPont began marketing a herbicide called Imprelis, for control of certain plants in turf areas. DuPont voluntarily pulled Imprelis from the market in August 2011 before the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a mandatory stop-sale order on Imprelis after being alerted of numerous reports from golf courses to nurseries that the product was suspected of injuring and, in some cases, killing trees. Norway spruce, white pines and honey locust proved to be among the species of trees that were susceptible.[85][86]
Price fixing[edit]
In 2005, the company plead guilty to fixing prices of chemicals and products using neoprene, a synthetic rubber, resulting in an $84 million fine.[87]
NASCAR sponsorship[edit]




Jeff Gordon's car with the DuPont Cromax Pro sponsorship


DuPont is widely known for its sponsorship of former four-time NASCAR Sprint Cup Series champion Jeff Gordon and his Hendrick Motorsports No. 24 Chevrolet SS. DuPont sponsored him since he began in Sprint Cup (then Winston Cup) in 1992. DuPont said this about their sponsorship:

Our sponsorship of Jeff Gordon helps keep DuPont brands and products in the public eye. Branding is a key component of the DuPont knowledge intensity strategy for achieving sustainable growth.[88]

The partnership lasted 18 seasons before DuPont was replaced by AARP Drive to End Hunger as the No. 24 team's primary sponsor. DuPont continued as associate sponsor with a 12-race deal,[89] and the deal was extended to 14 races after DuPont sold its performance coatings business, now known as "Axalta Coating Systems", to The Carlyle Group[28] in a deal worth $4.9 billion.[90]
In addition to Gordon, DuPont sponsored Scott Lagasse in the SuperTruck Series presented by Craftsman during the 1995 season (including a one-off ride for Terry Labonte in the Skoal Bandit Copper World Classic, the inaugural Truck race).[91] In the Busch Series, the company sponsored Ricky Craven's RC Racing team in the early 1990s.[92]

E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company, commonly referred to as DuPont, is an American conglomerate that was founded in July 1802 as a gunpowder mill by American chemist and industrialist Éleuthère Irénée du Pont.
In the 20th century, DuPont developed many polymers such as Vespel, neoprene, nylon, Corian, Teflon, Mylar, Kapton, Kevlar, Zemdrain, M5 fiber, Nomex, Tyvek, Sorona, Corfam, and Lycra. DuPont developed Freon (chlorofluorocarbons) for the refrigerant industry, and later more environmentally friendly refrigerants. It also developed synthetic pigments and paints including ChromaFlair.
In 2014, DuPont was the world's fourth largest chemical company based on market capitalization[3] and eighth based on revenue.[4] Its stock price is a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average.

DuPont was founded in 1802 by Éleuthère Irénée du Pont, using capital raised in France and gunpowder machinery imported from France. The company was started at the Eleutherian Mills, on the Brandywine Creek, near Wilmington, Delaware, two years after he and his family left France to escape the French Revolution and religious persecutions against Huguenot protestants. It began as a manufacturer of gunpowder, as du Pont noticed that the industry in North America was lagging behind Europe. The company grew quickly, and by the mid-19th century had become the largest supplier of gunpowder to the United States military, supplying half the powder used by the Union Army during the American Civil War. The Eleutherian Mills site is now a museum and a National Historic Landmark.
Expansion: 1902 to 1912[edit]
DuPont continued to expand, moving into the production of dynamite and smokeless powder. In 1902, DuPont's president, Eugene du Pont, died, and the surviving partners sold the company to three great-grandsons of the original founder. Charles Lee Reese was appointed as director and the company began centralizing their research departments.[5] The company subsequently purchased several smaller chemical companies, and in 1912 these actions gave rise to government scrutiny under the Sherman Antitrust Act. The courts declared that the company's dominance of the explosives business constituted a monopoly and ordered divestment. The court ruling resulted in the creation of the Hercules Powder Company (later Hercules Inc. and now part of Ashland Inc.) and the Atlas Powder Company (purchased by Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) and now part of AkzoNobel).[6] At the time of divestment, DuPont retained the single base nitrocellulose powders, while Hercules held the double base powders combining nitrocellulose and nitroglycerine. DuPont subsequently developed the Improved Military Rifle (IMR) line of smokeless powders.[7]
In 1910, DuPont published a brochure entitled "Farming with Dynamite". The pamphlet was instructional, outlining the benefits to using their dynamite products on stumps and various other obstacles that would be easier to remove with dynamite as opposed to other more conventional, inefficient means.[8]
DuPont also established two of the first industrial laboratories in the United States, where they began the work on cellulose chemistry, lacquers and other non-explosive products. DuPont Central Research was established at the DuPont Experimental Station, across the Brandywine Creek from the original powder mills.
Automotive investments: 1914[edit]
In 1914, Pierre S. du Pont invested in the fledgling automobile industry, buying stock in General Motors (GM). The following year he was invited to sit on GM's board of directors and would eventually be appointed the company's chairman. The DuPont company would assist the struggling automobile company further with a $25 million purchase of GM stock. In 1920, Pierre S. du Pont was elected president of General Motors. Under du Pont's guidance, GM became the number one automobile company in the world. However, in 1957, because of DuPont's influence within GM, further action under the Clayton Antitrust Act forced DuPont to divest its shares of General Motors.
Major breakthroughs: 1920s–1930s[edit]

In the 1920s, DuPont continued its emphasis on materials science, hiring Wallace Carothers to work on polymers in 1928. Carothers invented neoprene, a synthetic rubber;[9] the first polyester superpolymer; and, in 1935, nylon. The invention of Teflon followed a few years later. DuPont introduced phenothiazine as an insecticide in 1935.[10]
Second World War: 1941 to 1945[edit]
DuPont ranked 15th among United States corporations in the value of wartime production contracts.[11] As the inventor and manufacturer of nylon, DuPont helped produce the raw materials for parachutes, powder bags,[12] and tires.[13]
DuPont also played a major role in the Manhattan Project in 1943, designing, building and operating the Hanford plutonium producing plant in Hanford, Washington. In 1950 DuPont also agreed to build the Savannah River Plant in South Carolina as part of the effort to create a hydrogen bomb.
Space Age developments: 1950 to 1970[edit]
After the war, DuPont continued its emphasis on new materials, developing Mylar, Dacron, Orlon, and Lycra in the 1950s, and Tyvek, Nomex, Qiana, Corfam, and Corian in the 1960s. DuPont materials were critical to the success of the Apollo Project of the United States space program.[citation needed]
DuPont has been the key company behind the development of modern body armor. In the Second World War DuPont's ballistic nylon was used by Britain's Royal Air Force to make flak jackets. With the development of Kevlar in the 1960s, DuPont began tests to see if it could resist a lead bullet. This research would ultimately lead to the bullet resistant vests that are the mainstay of police and military units in the industrialized world.[citation needed]
Conoco holdings: 1981 to 1999[edit]
In 1981, DuPont acquired Conoco Inc., a major American oil and gas producing company that gave it a secure source of petroleum feedstocks needed for the manufacturing of many of its fiber and plastics products. The acquisition, which made DuPont one of the top ten U.S.-based petroleum and natural gas producers and refiners, came about after a bidding war with the giant distillery Seagram Company Ltd., which would become DuPont's largest single shareholder with four seats on the board of directors. On April 6, 1995, after being approached by Seagram Chief Executive Officer Edgar Bronfman Jr., DuPont announced a deal in which the company would buy back all the shares owned by Seagram.[14]
In 1999, DuPont sold all of its shares of Conoco, which merged with Phillips Petroleum Company, and acquired the Pioneer Hi-Bred agricultural seed company.

DuPont describes itself as a global science company that employs more than 60,000 people worldwide and has a diverse array of product offerings.[1] The company ranks 86th in the Fortune 500 on the strength of nearly $36 billion in revenues, $4.848 billion in profits in 2013.[16] In April 2014, Forbes ranked DuPont 171st on its Global 2000, the listing of the world's top public companies.[17]
DuPont businesses are organized into the following five categories, known as marketing "platforms": Electronic and Communication Technologies, Performance Materials, Coatings and Color Technologies, Safety and Protection, and Agriculture and Nutrition.
The agriculture division, DuPont Pioneer makes and sells hybrid seed and genetically modified seed, some of which goes on to become genetically modified food. Genes engineered into their products include LibertyLink, which provides resistance to Bayer's Ignite Herbicide/Liberty herbicides; the Herculex I Insect Protection gene which provides protection against various insects; the Herculex RW insect protection trait which provides protection against other insects; the YieldGard Corn Borer gene, which provides resistance to another set of insects; and the Roundup Ready Corn 2 trait that provides crop resistance against glyphosate herbicides.[18] In 2010, DuPont Pioneer received approval to start marketing Plenish soybeans, which contains "the highest oleic acid content of any commercial soybean product, at more than 75 percent. Plenish provides a product with no trans fat, 20 percent less saturated fat than regular soybean oil, and more stabile oil with greater flexibility in food and industrial applications."[19] Plenish is genetically engineered to "block the formation of enzymes that continue the cascade downstream from oleic acid (that produces saturated fats), resulting in an accumulation of the desirable monounsaturated acid."[20]
In October 2001, the company sold its pharmaceutical business to Bristol Myers Squibb for $7.798 billion.[21]
In 2002, the company sold the Clysar(R)business to Bemis Company for $143 million.[22][23]
In 2004, the company sold its textiles business, which included some of its best-known brands such as Lycra (Spandex), Dacron polyester, Orlon acrylic, Antron nylon and Thermolite, to Koch Industries.
In 2011, DuPont was the largest producer of titanium dioxide in the world, primarily provided as a white pigment used in the paper industry.[24]
DuPont has 150 research and development facilities located in China, Brazil, India, Germany, and Switzerland with an average investment of $2 billion annually in a diverse range of technologies for many markets including agriculture, genetic traits, biofuels, automotive, construction, electronics, chemicals, and industrial materials. DuPont employs more than 10,000 scientists and engineers around the world.[1]
On January 9, 2011, DuPont announced that it had reached an agreement to buy Danish company Danisco for US$6.3 billion.[25] On May 16, 2011, DuPont announced that its tender offer for Danisco had been successful and that it would proceed to redeem the remaining shares and delist the company.[26]
On May 1, 2012, DuPont announced that it had acquired from Bunge full ownership of the Solae joint venture, a soy-based ingredients company. DuPont previously owned 72 percent of the joint venture while Bunge owned the remaining 28 percent.[27]
In February 2013, DuPont Performance Coatings was sold to the Carlyle Group and rebranded as Axalta Coating Systems.[28]
In October 2015, DuPont sold the Neoprene chloroprene rubber business to Denka Performance Elastomers, a joint venture of Denka and Mitsui.[29]
Chemours[edit]
In October 2013, DuPont announced that it was planning to spin off its Performance Chemicals business into a new publicly traded company in mid-2015.[30] The company filed its initial Form 10 with the SEC in December 2014 and announced that the new company would be called The Chemours Company.[31] The spin-off to DuPont shareholders was completed on July 1, 2015 and Chemours stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange on the same date.[32]
DuPont will focus on production of GMO seeds, materials for solar panels, and alternatives to fossil fuels. Chemours becomes responsible for the cleanup of 171 former DuPont sites, which DuPont says will cost between $295 million and $945 million.[33]
Merger with Dow[edit]
Main article: Dow DuPont merger
On December 11, 2015, DuPont announced that it would merge with the Dow Chemical Company, in an all-stock deal. The combined company, which will be known as DowDuPont, will have an estimated value of $130 billion, be equally held by the shareholders of both companies, and maintain their headquarters in Delaware and Michigan respectively. Within two years of the merger's closure, expected in the first quarter of 2017 and subject to regulatory approval, DowDuPont will be split into three separate public companies, focusing on the agricultural chemicals, materials science, and specialty product industries.[34][35] Commentators have questioned the economic viability of this plan because, of the three companies, only the specialty products industry has prospects for high growth.[35] The outlook on the profitability of the other two proposed companies has been questioned due to reduced crop prices and lower margins on plastics such as polyethylene.[35] They have also noted that the deal is likely to face antitrust scrutiny in several countries.[36] This eventually became the case, with two delays taking place due to regulatory approvals. The merger is now targeted to close in mid-2017.[37]
Locations[edit]

On October 5, 2015, DuPont announced that Ellen Kullman would retire as Chair and CEO on October 16, 2015.[42] Breen was appointed CEO in November 2015 replacing Kullman.[43][44][45]
Environmental record[edit]
In the 1990s, DuPont was a founding member of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development with then DuPont CEO Chad Holliday as chairman of the WBCSD from 2000 to 2001.[46] The organization has developed guidelines for measuring sustainability cited by the Natural Resources Defense Council[47] and the Environmental Defense Fund,[48] and its Vision 2050 blueprint for slowing and reversing environmental damage has been highlighted by The Guardian.[49]
In 2005, BusinessWeek magazine, in conjunction with the Climate Group, ranked DuPont as the best-practice leader in cutting their carbon gas emissions. DuPont reduced its greenhouse gas emissions by more than 65 percent from the 1990 levels while using 7 percent less energy and producing 30 percent more product.[50][51]
In May 2007 the $2.1 million DuPont Nature Center at Mispillion Harbor Reserve, a wildlife observatory and interpretive center on the Delaware Bay near Milford, Delaware was opened to enhance the beauty and integrity of the Delaware Estuary. The facility will be state-owned and operated by the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control (DNREC).[52][53]
In 2010, researchers at the Political Economy Research Institute of the University of Massachusetts Amherst ranked DuPont as the fourth largest corporate source of air pollution in the United States.[54] DuPont released a statement that 2012 total releases and transfers were 13% lower than 2011 levels, and 70% lower than 1987 levels.[55] Data from the EPA’s Toxic Release Inventory database included in the Political Economy Research Institute studies likewise show a reduction in DuPont’s emissions from 12.4 million lbs of air releases and 22.4 million lbs of toxic incinerator transfers in 2006[56] to 10.94 million lbs and 22.0 million pounds respectively in 2010. Over the same period, the Political Economy Research Institutes Toxic score for DuPont increased from 122,426 to 7,086,303.[57]
One of DuPont's facilities was listed No. 4 on the Mother Jones Top 20 polluters of 2010, legally discharging over 5,000,000 pounds (2,300,000 kg) of toxic chemicals into New Jersey/Delaware waterways.[58] In 2016, Carneys Point Township, New Jersey, where the facility is located, initiated a $1.1 billion lawsuit against the corporation, accusing it of divesting a unprofitable company with out first remediating the property as required by law.[59]
In 2012 DuPont was named to the Carbon Disclosure Project Global 500 Leadership Index. Inclusion is based on company performance on sustainability metrics, emissions reduction goals, and environmental performance transparency.[60] In 2014 DuPont was the top scoring company in the chemical sector according to CDP, with a score of "A" or "B" in every evaluation area except for supply chain management.[61]
Between 2007 and 2014 there were 34 accidents resulting in toxic releases at DuPont plants across the U.S., with no fewer than 8 fatalities.[62] Four employees died of suffocation in a Houston, Texas accident involving leakage of nearly 24,000 pounds (11,000 kg) of methyl mercaptan.[63] As a result, the company became the largest of the 450 businesses placed into the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's "severe violator program" in July 2015. The program was established for companies OSHA says have repeatedly failed to address safety infractions.[45][64]
DuPont was part of Global Climate Coalition, a group that lobbied against taking action on climate change.[65]
Recognition[edit]
DuPont has been awarded the National Medal of Technology four times: first in 1990, for its invention of "high-performance man-made polymers such as nylon, neoprene rubber, "Teflon" fluorocarbon resin, and a wide spectrum of new fibers, films, and engineering plastics"; the second in 2002 "for policy and technology leadership in the phaseout and replacement of chlorofluorocarbons". DuPont scientist George Levitt was honored with the medal in 1993 for the development of sulfonylurea herbicides. In 1996, DuPont scientist Stephanie Kwolek was recognized for the discovery and development of Kevlar.
On the company's 200th anniversary in 2002, it was presented with the Honor Award by the National Building Museum in recognition of DuPont's "products that directly influence the construction and design process in the building industry."[66]
Controversies[edit]
Genetically modified foods[edit]
Main article: Genetically modified food controversies
Pioneer Hi-Bred, a DuPont subsidiary, manufactures genetically modified seeds, other tools, and agricultural technologies used to increase crop yield.
Chlorofluorocarbons[edit]
Dupont, along with Frigidaire and General Motors, was a part of a collaborative effort to find a replacement for toxic refrigerants in the 1920s, resulting in the invention of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) by Thomas Midgley in 1928.[67] CFCs are ozone-depleting chemicals that were used primarily in aerosol sprays and refrigerants. DuPont was the largest CFC producer in the world with a 25 percent market share in the 1980s, totaling $600 million in annual sales.[68]
In 1974, responding to public concern about the safety of CFCs,[69] DuPont promised to stop production of CFCs should they be proven to be harmful to the ozone layer.
In February 1988, United States Senator Max Baucus, along with two other Senators, wrote to DuPont reminding the company of its pledge. The Los Angeles Times reported that the letter was "generally regarded as an embarrassment for DuPont, which prides itself on its reputation as an environmentally conscious company."[68] The company responded with a strongly worded letter that the available evidence did not support a need to dramatically reduce CFC production and calling the proposal "unwarranted and counterproductive".[70]
On March 14 of the same year, scientists from the National Aeronautics and Space Agency announced the results of a study demonstrating a 2.3% decline in mid-latitude ozone levels between 1969 and 1986, along with evidence tying the decline to CFCs in the upper atmosphere.[71] On March 24, DuPont reversed its position, calling the NASA results "important new information" and announcing that it would phase out CFC production. The company further called for worldwide controls on CFC production and for additional countries to ratify the Montreal Protocol. DuPont's change of policy was widely praised by environmentalists.[72] In 2003, DuPont was awarded the National Medal of Technology, recognizing the company as the leader in developing CFC replacements.[73]
Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA; C8)[edit]
DuPont has faced fines from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and litigation over releases of the Teflon-processing aid perfluoro-octanoic acid (PFOA, also known as C8) from their works in Washington, West Virginia.[74] PFOA-contaminated drinking water led to increased levels of the compound in the bodies of residents who lived in the surrounding area. A court-appointed C8 Science Panel investigated "whether or not there is a probable link between C8 exposure and disease in the community."[75] They eventually concluded that there is a probable link between PFOA and kidney cancer, testicular cancer, thyroid disease, high cholesterol, pre-eclampsia and ulcerative colitis.[76] Water contamination in the Netherlands and links to cancer are also being investigated.[77] A PFOA water contamination interactive maps has been published by ewg.org.[78]
DuPont agreed to sharply reduce its output of PFOA,[79] and was one of eight companies to sign on with the USEPA's 2010/2015 PFOA Stewardship Program. The agreement called for the reduction of "facility emissions and product content of PFOA and related chemicals on a global basis by 95 percent by 2010 and to work toward eliminating emissions and product content of these chemicals by 2015."[80] DuPont phased out PFOA entirely in 2013.
Unlike other persistent organic pollutants, Perfluorooctanoic acid persists indefinitely and is completely resistant to bio-degradation, remaining toxic. The only way to reduce levels in the body is by physical elimination rather than degradation.[81] In 2014, the International Agency for Research on Cancer designated PFOA as "possibly carcinogenic" in humans.[82] One Ohio resident was awarded $1.6 million when a jury in 2015 found that her kidney cancer was caused by PFOA in drinking water. In December 2016 $2 million was awarded when a jury found it caused the plaintiff’s testicular cancer and awarded punitive damages in the amount of $10.5 million.[83] This was the third case where a jury found DuPont liable for injuries resulting from exposure to PFOA in drinking water sources. There were 3,500 similar cases awaiting trial c. 2015. According to the co-lead counselor, internal documents revealed during trial showed DuPont had known of a link between PFOA and cancers since 1997. DuPont maintains it has always handled PFOA "reasonably and responsibly" based on the information they, and industry regulators, had available during its use. However, the jury concluded that DuPont did not act to prevent harm or inform the public, despite the information available.[84]
Imprelis[edit]
In October 2010 DuPont began marketing a herbicide called Imprelis, for control of certain plants in turf areas. DuPont voluntarily pulled Imprelis from the market in August 2011 before the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a mandatory stop-sale order on Imprelis after being alerted of numerous reports from golf courses to nurseries that the product was suspected of injuring and, in some cases, killing trees. Norway spruce, white pines and honey locust proved to be among the species of trees that were susceptible.[85][86]
Price fixing[edit]
In 2005, the company plead guilty to fixing prices of chemicals and products using neoprene, a synthetic rubber, resulting in an $84 million fine.[87]
NASCAR sponsorship[edit]




Jeff Gordon's car with the DuPont Cromax Pro sponsorship


DuPont is widely known for its sponsorship of former four-time NASCAR Sprint Cup Series champion Jeff Gordon and his Hendrick Motorsports No. 24 Chevrolet SS. DuPont sponsored him since he began in Sprint Cup (then Winston Cup) in 1992. DuPont said this about their sponsorship:

Our sponsorship of Jeff Gordon helps keep DuPont brands and products in the public eye. Branding is a key component of the DuPont knowledge intensity strategy for achieving sustainable growth.[88]

The partnership lasted 18 seasons before DuPont was replaced by AARP Drive to End Hunger as the No. 24 team's primary sponsor. DuPont continued as associate sponsor with a 12-race deal,[89] and the deal was extended to 14 races after DuPont sold its performance coatings business, now known as "Axalta Coating Systems", to The Carlyle Group[28] in a deal worth $4.9 billion.[90]
In addition to Gordon, DuPont sponsored Scott Lagasse in the SuperTruck Series presented by Craftsman during the 1995 season (including a one-off ride for Terry Labonte in the Skoal Bandit Copper World Classic, the inaugural Truck race).[91] In the Busch Series, the company sponsored Ricky Craven's RC Racing team in the early 1990s.[92]

E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company, commonly referred to as DuPont, is an American conglomerate that was founded in July 1802 as a gunpowder mill by American chemist and industrialist Éleuthère Irénée du Pont.
In the 20th century, DuPont developed many polymers such as Vespel, neoprene, nylon, Corian, Teflon, Mylar, Kapton, Kevlar, Zemdrain, M5 fiber, Nomex, Tyvek, Sorona, Corfam, and Lycra. DuPont developed Freon (chlorofluorocarbons) for the refrigerant industry, and later more environmentally friendly refrigerants. It also developed synthetic pigments and paints including ChromaFlair.
In 2014, DuPont was the world's fourth largest chemical company based on market capitalization[3] and eighth based on revenue.[4] Its stock price is a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average.

History[edit]

Working powder mills on Brandywine Creek, about 1905


Establishment: 1802[edit]
DuPont was founded in 1802 by Éleuthère Irénée du Pont, using capital raised in France and gunpowder machinery imported from France. The company was started at the Eleutherian Mills, on the Brandywine Creek, near Wilmington, Delaware, two years after he and his family left France to escape the French Revolution and religious persecutions against Huguenot protestants. It began as a manufacturer of gunpowder, as du Pont noticed that the industry in North America was lagging behind Europe. The company grew quickly, and by the mid-19th century had become the largest supplier of gunpowder to the United States military, supplying half the powder used by the Union Army during the American Civil War. The Eleutherian Mills site is now a museum and a National Historic Landmark.
Expansion: 1902 to 1912[edit]
DuPont continued to expand, moving into the production of dynamite and smokeless powder. In 1902, DuPont's president, Eugene du Pont, died, and the surviving partners sold the company to three great-grandsons of the original founder. Charles Lee Reese was appointed as director and the company began centralizing their research departments.[5] The company subsequently purchased several smaller chemical companies, and in 1912 these actions gave rise to government scrutiny under the Sherman Antitrust Act. The courts declared that the company's dominance of the explosives business constituted a monopoly and ordered divestment. The court ruling resulted in the creation of the Hercules Powder Company (later Hercules Inc. and now part of Ashland Inc.) and the Atlas Powder Company (purchased by Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) and now part of AkzoNobel).[6] At the time of divestment, DuPont retained the single base nitrocellulose powders, while Hercules held the double base powders combining nitrocellulose and nitroglycerine. DuPont subsequently developed the Improved Military Rifle (IMR) line of smokeless powders.[7]
In 1910, DuPont published a brochure entitled "Farming with Dynamite". The pamphlet was instructional, outlining the benefits to using their dynamite products on stumps and various other obstacles that would be easier to remove with dynamite as opposed to other more conventional, inefficient means.[8]
DuPont also established two of the first industrial laboratories in the United States, where they began the work on cellulose chemistry, lacquers and other non-explosive products. DuPont Central Research was established at the DuPont Experimental Station, across the Brandywine Creek from the original powder mills.
Automotive investments: 1914[edit]
In 1914, Pierre S. du Pont invested in the fledgling automobile industry, buying stock in General Motors (GM). The following year he was invited to sit on GM's board of directors and would eventually be appointed the company's chairman. The DuPont company would assist the struggling automobile company further with a $25 million purchase of GM stock. In 1920, Pierre S. du Pont was elected president of General Motors. Under du Pont's guidance, GM became the number one automobile company in the world. However, in 1957, because of DuPont's influence within GM, further action under the Clayton Antitrust Act forced DuPont to divest its shares of General Motors.
Major breakthroughs: 1920s–1930s[edit]

In the 1920s, DuPont continued its emphasis on materials science, hiring Wallace Carothers to work on polymers in 1928. Carothers invented neoprene, a synthetic rubber;[9] the first polyester superpolymer; and, in 1935, nylon. The invention of Teflon followed a few years later. DuPont introduced phenothiazine as an insecticide in 1935.[10]
Second World War: 1941 to 1945[edit]
DuPont ranked 15th among United States corporations in the value of wartime production contracts.[11] As the inventor and manufacturer of nylon, DuPont helped produce the raw materials for parachutes, powder bags,[12] and tires.[13]
DuPont also played a major role in the Manhattan Project in 1943, designing, building and operating the Hanford plutonium producing plant in Hanford, Washington. In 1950 DuPont also agreed to build the Savannah River Plant in South Carolina as part of the effort to create a hydrogen bomb.
Space Age developments: 1950 to 1970[edit]
After the war, DuPont continued its emphasis on new materials, developing Mylar, Dacron, Orlon, and Lycra in the 1950s, and Tyvek, Nomex, Qiana, Corfam, and Corian in the 1960s. DuPont materials were critical to the success of the Apollo Project of the United States space program.[citation needed]
DuPont has been the key company behind the development of modern body armor. In the Second World War DuPont's ballistic nylon was used by Britain's Royal Air Force to make flak jackets. With the development of Kevlar in the 1960s, DuPont began tests to see if it could resist a lead bullet. This research would ultimately lead to the bullet resistant vests that are the mainstay of police and military units in the industrialized world.[citation needed]
Conoco holdings: 1981 to 1999[edit]
In 1981, DuPont acquired Conoco Inc., a major American oil and gas producing company that gave it a secure source of petroleum feedstocks needed for the manufacturing of many of its fiber and plastics products. The acquisition, which made DuPont one of the top ten U.S.-based petroleum and natural gas producers and refiners, came about after a bidding war with the giant distillery Seagram Company Ltd., which would become DuPont's largest single shareholder with four seats on the board of directors. On April 6, 1995, after being approached by Seagram Chief Executive Officer Edgar Bronfman Jr., DuPont announced a deal in which the company would buy back all the shares owned by Seagram.[14]
In 1999, DuPont sold all of its shares of Conoco, which merged with Phillips Petroleum Company, and acquired the Pioneer Hi-Bred agricultural seed company.

DuPont describes itself as a global science company that employs more than 60,000 people worldwide and has a diverse array of product offerings.[1] The company ranks 86th in the Fortune 500 on the strength of nearly $36 billion in revenues, $4.848 billion in profits in 2013.[16] In April 2014, Forbes ranked DuPont 171st on its Global 2000, the listing of the world's top public companies.[17]
DuPont businesses are organized into the following five categories, known as marketing "platforms": Electronic and Communication Technologies, Performance Materials, Coatings and Color Technologies, Safety and Protection, and Agriculture and Nutrition.
The agriculture division, DuPont Pioneer makes and sells hybrid seed and genetically modified seed, some of which goes on to become genetically modified food. Genes engineered into their products include LibertyLink, which provides resistance to Bayer's Ignite Herbicide/Liberty herbicides; the Herculex I Insect Protection gene which provides protection against various insects; the Herculex RW insect protection trait which provides protection against other insects; the YieldGard Corn Borer gene, which provides resistance to another set of insects; and the Roundup Ready Corn 2 trait that provides crop resistance against glyphosate herbicides.[18] In 2010, DuPont Pioneer received approval to start marketing Plenish soybeans, which contains "the highest oleic acid content of any commercial soybean product, at more than 75 percent. Plenish provides a product with no trans fat, 20 percent less saturated fat than regular soybean oil, and more stabile oil with greater flexibility in food and industrial applications."[19] Plenish is genetically engineered to "block the formation of enzymes that continue the cascade downstream from oleic acid (that produces saturated fats), resulting in an accumulation of the desirable monounsaturated acid."[20]
In October 2001, the company sold its pharmaceutical business to Bristol Myers Squibb for $7.798 billion.[21]
In 2002, the company sold the Clysar(R)business to Bemis Company for $143 million.[22][23]
In 2004, the company sold its textiles business, which included some of its best-known brands such as Lycra (Spandex), Dacron polyester, Orlon acrylic, Antron nylon and Thermolite, to Koch Industries.
In 2011, DuPont was the largest producer of titanium dioxide in the world, primarily provided as a white pigment used in the paper industry.[24]
DuPont has 150 research and development facilities located in China, Brazil, India, Germany, and Switzerland with an average investment of $2 billion annually in a diverse range of technologies for many markets including agriculture, genetic traits, biofuels, automotive, construction, electronics, chemicals, and industrial materials. DuPont employs more than 10,000 scientists and engineers around the world.[1]
On January 9, 2011, DuPont announced that it had reached an agreement to buy Danish company Danisco for US$6.3 billion.[25] On May 16, 2011, DuPont announced that its tender offer for Danisco had been successful and that it would proceed to redeem the remaining shares and delist the company.[26]
On May 1, 2012, DuPont announced that it had acquired from Bunge full ownership of the Solae joint venture, a soy-based ingredients company. DuPont previously owned 72 percent of the joint venture while Bunge owned the remaining 28 percent.[27]
In February 2013, DuPont Performance Coatings was sold to the Carlyle Group and rebranded as Axalta Coating Systems.[28]
In October 2015, DuPont sold the Neoprene chloroprene rubber business to Denka Performance Elastomers, a joint venture of Denka and Mitsui.[29]
Chemours[edit]
In October 2013, DuPont announced that it was planning to spin off its Performance Chemicals business into a new publicly traded company in mid-2015.[30] The company filed its initial Form 10 with the SEC in December 2014 and announced that the new company would be called The Chemours Company.[31] The spin-off to DuPont shareholders was completed on July 1, 2015 and Chemours stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange on the same date.[32]
DuPont will focus on production of GMO seeds, materials for solar panels, and alternatives to fossil fuels. Chemours becomes responsible for the cleanup of 171 former DuPont sites, which DuPont says will cost between $295 million and $945 million.[33]
Merger with Dow[edit]
Main article: Dow DuPont merger
On December 11, 2015, DuPont announced that it would merge with the Dow Chemical Company, in an all-stock deal. The combined company, which will be known as DowDuPont, will have an estimated value of $130 billion, be equally held by the shareholders of both companies, and maintain their headquarters in Delaware and Michigan respectively. Within two years of the merger's closure, expected in the first quarter of 2017 and subject to regulatory approval, DowDuPont will be split into three separate public companies, focusing on the agricultural chemicals, materials science, and specialty product industries.[34][35] Commentators have questioned the economic viability of this plan because, of the three companies, only the specialty products industry has prospects for high growth.[35] The outlook on the profitability of the other two proposed companies has been questioned due to reduced crop prices and lower margins on plastics such as polyethylene.[35] They have also noted that the deal is likely to face antitrust scrutiny in several countries.[36] This eventually became the case, with two delays taking place due to regulatory approvals. The merger is now targeted to close in mid-2017.[37]
Locations[edit]




Entrance to Washington Works in Washington, West Virginia formerly owned by DuPont, now owned by Chemours.


The company's corporate headquarters are located in Wilmington, Delaware.

On October 5, 2015, DuPont announced that Ellen Kullman would retire as Chair and CEO on October 16, 2015.[42] Breen was appointed CEO in November 2015 replacing Kullman.[43][44][45]
Environmental record[edit]
In the 1990s, DuPont was a founding member of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development with then DuPont CEO Chad Holliday as chairman of the WBCSD from 2000 to 2001.[46] The organization has developed guidelines for measuring sustainability cited by the Natural Resources Defense Council[47] and the Environmental Defense Fund,[48] and its Vision 2050 blueprint for slowing and reversing environmental damage has been highlighted by The Guardian.[49]
In 2005, BusinessWeek magazine, in conjunction with the Climate Group, ranked DuPont as the best-practice leader in cutting their carbon gas emissions. DuPont reduced its greenhouse gas emissions by more than 65 percent from the 1990 levels while using 7 percent less energy and producing 30 percent more product.[50][51]
In May 2007 the $2.1 million DuPont Nature Center at Mispillion Harbor Reserve, a wildlife observatory and interpretive center on the Delaware Bay near Milford, Delaware was opened to enhance the beauty and integrity of the Delaware Estuary. The facility will be state-owned and operated by the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control (DNREC).[52][53]
In 2010, researchers at the Political Economy Research Institute of the University of Massachusetts Amherst ranked DuPont as the fourth largest corporate source of air pollution in the United States.[54] DuPont released a statement that 2012 total releases and transfers were 13% lower than 2011 levels, and 70% lower than 1987 levels.[55] Data from the EPA’s Toxic Release Inventory database included in the Political Economy Research Institute studies likewise show a reduction in DuPont’s emissions from 12.4 million lbs of air releases and 22.4 million lbs of toxic incinerator transfers in 2006[56] to 10.94 million lbs and 22.0 million pounds respectively in 2010. Over the same period, the Political Economy Research Institutes Toxic score for DuPont increased from 122,426 to 7,086,303.[57]
One of DuPont's facilities was listed No. 4 on the Mother Jones Top 20 polluters of 2010, legally discharging over 5,000,000 pounds (2,300,000 kg) of toxic chemicals into New Jersey/Delaware waterways.[58] In 2016, Carneys Point Township, New Jersey, where the facility is located, initiated a $1.1 billion lawsuit against the corporation, accusing it of divesting a unprofitable company with out first remediating the property as required by law.[59]
In 2012 DuPont was named to the Carbon Disclosure Project Global 500 Leadership Index. Inclusion is based on company performance on sustainability metrics, emissions reduction goals, and environmental performance transparency.[60] In 2014 DuPont was the top scoring company in the chemical sector according to CDP, with a score of "A" or "B" in every evaluation area except for supply chain management.[61]
Between 2007 and 2014 there were 34 accidents resulting in toxic releases at DuPont plants across the U.S., with no fewer than 8 fatalities.[62] Four employees died of suffocation in a Houston, Texas accident involving leakage of nearly 24,000 pounds (11,000 kg) of methyl mercaptan.[63] As a result, the company became the largest of the 450 businesses placed into the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's "severe violator program" in July 2015. The program was established for companies OSHA says have repeatedly failed to address safety infractions.[45][64]
DuPont was part of Global Climate Coalition, a group that lobbied against taking action on climate change.[65]
Recognition[edit]
DuPont has been awarded the National Medal of Technology four times: first in 1990, for its invention of "high-performance man-made polymers such as nylon, neoprene rubber, "Teflon" fluorocarbon resin, and a wide spectrum of new fibers, films, and engineering plastics"; the second in 2002 "for policy and technology leadership in the phaseout and replacement of chlorofluorocarbons". DuPont scientist George Levitt was honored with the medal in 1993 for the development of sulfonylurea herbicides. In 1996, DuPont scientist Stephanie Kwolek was recognized for the discovery and development of Kevlar.
On the company's 200th anniversary in 2002, it was presented with the Honor Award by the National Building Museum in recognition of DuPont's "products that directly influence the construction and design process in the building industry."[66]
Controversies[edit]
Genetically modified foods[edit]
Main article: Genetically modified food controversies
Pioneer Hi-Bred, a DuPont subsidiary, manufactures genetically modified seeds, other tools, and agricultural technologies used to increase crop yield.
Chlorofluorocarbons[edit]
Dupont, along with Frigidaire and General Motors, was a part of a collaborative effort to find a replacement for toxic refrigerants in the 1920s, resulting in the invention of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) by Thomas Midgley in 1928.[67] CFCs are ozone-depleting chemicals that were used primarily in aerosol sprays and refrigerants. DuPont was the largest CFC producer in the world with a 25 percent market share in the 1980s, totaling $600 million in annual sales.[68]
In 1974, responding to public concern about the safety of CFCs,[69] DuPont promised to stop production of CFCs should they be proven to be harmful to the ozone layer.
In February 1988, United States Senator Max Baucus, along with two other Senators, wrote to DuPont reminding the company of its pledge. The Los Angeles Times reported that the letter was "generally regarded as an embarrassment for DuPont, which prides itself on its reputation as an environmentally conscious company."[68] The company responded with a strongly worded letter that the available evidence did not support a need to dramatically reduce CFC production and calling the proposal "unwarranted and counterproductive".[70]
On March 14 of the same year, scientists from the National Aeronautics and Space Agency announced the results of a study demonstrating a 2.3% decline in mid-latitude ozone levels between 1969 and 1986, along with evidence tying the decline to CFCs in the upper atmosphere.[71] On March 24, DuPont reversed its position, calling the NASA results "important new information" and announcing that it would phase out CFC production. The company further called for worldwide controls on CFC production and for additional countries to ratify the Montreal Protocol. DuPont's change of policy was widely praised by environmentalists.[72] In 2003, DuPont was awarded the National Medal of Technology, recognizing the company as the leader in developing CFC replacements.[73]
Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA; C8)[edit]
DuPont has faced fines from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and litigation over releases of the Teflon-processing aid perfluoro-octanoic acid (PFOA, also known as C8) from their works in Washington, West Virginia.[74] PFOA-contaminated drinking water led to increased levels of the compound in the bodies of residents who lived in the surrounding area. A court-appointed C8 Science Panel investigated "whether or not there is a probable link between C8 exposure and disease in the community."[75] They eventually concluded that there is a probable link between PFOA and kidney cancer, testicular cancer, thyroid disease, high cholesterol, pre-eclampsia and ulcerative colitis.[76] Water contamination in the Netherlands and links to cancer are also being investigated.[77] A PFOA water contamination interactive maps has been published by ewg.org.[78]
DuPont agreed to sharply reduce its output of PFOA,[79] and was one of eight companies to sign on with the USEPA's 2010/2015 PFOA Stewardship Program. The agreement called for the reduction of "facility emissions and product content of PFOA and related chemicals on a global basis by 95 percent by 2010 and to work toward eliminating emissions and product content of these chemicals by 2015."[80] DuPont phased out PFOA entirely in 2013.
Unlike other persistent organic pollutants, Perfluorooctanoic acid persists indefinitely and is completely resistant to bio-degradation, remaining toxic. The only way to reduce levels in the body is by physical elimination rather than degradation.[81] In 2014, the International Agency for Research on Cancer designated PFOA as "possibly carcinogenic" in humans.[82] One Ohio resident was awarded $1.6 million when a jury in 2015 found that her kidney cancer was caused by PFOA in drinking water. In December 2016 $2 million was awarded when a jury found it caused the plaintiff’s testicular cancer and awarded punitive damages in the amount of $10.5 million.[83] This was the third case where a jury found DuPont liable for injuries resulting from exposure to PFOA in drinking water sources. There were 3,500 similar cases awaiting trial c. 2015. According to the co-lead counselor, internal documents revealed during trial showed DuPont had known of a link between PFOA and cancers since 1997. DuPont maintains it has always handled PFOA "reasonably and responsibly" based on the information they, and industry regulators, had available during its use. However, the jury concluded that DuPont did not act to prevent harm or inform the public, despite the information available.[84]
Imprelis[edit]
In October 2010 DuPont began marketing a herbicide called Imprelis, for control of certain plants in turf areas. DuPont voluntarily pulled Imprelis from the market in August 2011 before the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a mandatory stop-sale order on Imprelis after being alerted of numerous reports from golf courses to nurseries that the product was suspected of injuring and, in some cases, killing trees. Norway spruce, white pines and honey locust proved to be among the species of trees that were susceptible.[85][86]
Price fixing[edit]
In 2005, the company plead guilty to fixing prices of chemicals and products using neoprene, a synthetic rubber, resulting in an $84 million fine.[87]
NASCAR sponsorship[edit]




Jeff Gordon's car with the DuPont Cromax Pro sponsorship


DuPont is widely known for its sponsorship of former four-time NASCAR Sprint Cup Series champion Jeff Gordon and his Hendrick Motorsports No. 24 Chevrolet SS. DuPont sponsored him since he began in Sprint Cup (then Winston Cup) in 1992. DuPont said this about their sponsorship:

Our sponsorship of Jeff Gordon helps keep DuPont brands and products in the public eye. Branding is a key component of the DuPont knowledge intensity strategy for achieving sustainable growth.[88]

The partnership lasted 18 seasons before DuPont was replaced by AARP Drive to End Hunger as the No. 24 team's primary sponsor. DuPont continued as associate sponsor with a 12-race deal,[89] and the deal was extended to 14 races after DuPont sold its performance coatings business, now known as "Axalta Coating Systems", to The Carlyle Group[28] in a deal worth $4.9 billion.[90]
In addition to Gordon, DuPont sponsored Scott Lagasse in the SuperTruck Series presented by Craftsman during the 1995 season (including a one-off ride for Terry Labonte in the Skoal Bandit Copper World Classic, the inaugural Truck race).[91] In the Busch Series, the company sponsored Ricky Craven's RC Racing team in the early 1990s.[92]
