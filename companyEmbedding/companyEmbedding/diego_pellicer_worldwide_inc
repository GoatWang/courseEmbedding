SEATTLE, Sept. 28, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Diego Pellicer Worldwide, a real estate and consumer retail development company that is focused on developing the world's first "premium" cannabis brand, and branded tenant Diego Pellicer Washington are opening Seattle's first quality cannabis store. 
The luxury marijuana store will open on Friday, October 7, 2016. The team is excited to showcase the store and provide a comfortable space to educate consumers about high-grade cannabis products. 








Named after the risk-taking pioneer, Diego Pellicer was a business and political leader amongst the island of Cebu in the Philippines. While others invested in the spice trade, Pellicer invested his fortunes in hemp. When a sugar crisis bankrupted many on the island, which lead to the Spanish-American War in 1898, Pellicer emerged as the largest hemp producer in the world. Today, Pellicer's great-grandson acts as the co-founder and is proud to pay homage to his great-grandfather.
"Our best of class stores will provide customers with a high-end experience currently unmet in the cannabis space," commented Ron Throgmartin, CEO of Diego Pellicer. "Diego Pellicer will be the premier brand for those seeking a high-quality cannabis experience. Beginning with our flagship store in Seattle, our knowledgeable marijuana connoisseurs will offer individuals a safe and comfortable experience as they present the best product available based on customer needs."
The Company's modern flagship store features six glass display cabinets which will showcase high-end cannabis accessories and products with cutting-edge technology allowing for an easy and convenient shopping experience. The 3,300 square foot space is modeled after an upscale jewelry store and is outfitted with granite floors, imported Spanish tile, handmade casework, custom-made hickory doors and massive chandeliers. 
The store will carry an array of Marijuana & Marijuana infused products, concentrates, vaporizers, high-end glass products, grinders, torches and Leira & Gold Leaf cannagar: luxury for the cannabis connoisseur. Each cannagar is meticulously crafted with award-winning Gold Leaf Gardens flower, coated with solvent-free rosin oil and rolled in cannabis leaves using Leira's unrivaled hand-rolling process. Glass products include: Licit Glass, Zob Glass and Mathmatix Glass; Vaporizer products include: Pax by Ploom (herbal), CloudPens (extracts), DaVinci and Honey Stick; Diego's private label grinders made by Phoenecian Grinders and Vector pocket butane torches are available as well. 
Alongside quality marijuana products, Diego Pellicer's responsible marijuana connoisseurs help create a comfortable space for customers to learn which products match their needs, whether recreational or medicinal. Ensuring the quality and consistency is apparent, each product is properly packaged, tested and labeled so the consumer understands the potency, concentration and effects. With the Diego Pellicer app, returning customers can place a reservation ahead of time and check out at the express counter. 
The Diego Pellicer store is located at 2215 Fourth Avenue South, Seattle, Washington and will be open from 8:00am to 10:00pm.  The store's location is the highest traffic intersection in Seattle with 33,200 cars passing by daily. A parking lot is next to the store along with ample street parking. 
For more information on the Diego Pellicer store please visit http://DiegoPellicer.com/ or call (516) 900-3799.

Press Releases



Diego Pellicer Worldwide, Inc., the First Brand Name in Premium Marijuana, Introduces its Initial Retail Tenant for the Company's Flagship Store






May 4, 2016, 6:00am EDT














SEATTLE, May 4, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Diego Pellicer Worldwide (OTCQB: DPWW), a real estate and consumer retail development company that is focused on developing Diego Pellicer as the world's first "premium" cannabis brand, today introduces and profiles the Company's initial retail tenant for their Flagship Seattle store.
"Peter Norris has a distinguished horticulture, design, retail and brand building background," notes Ron Throgmartin, CEO of Diego Pellicer Worldwide, Inc.
Norris built a prominent horticulture business, giving marquee clients such as Nordstrom, Four Seasons, Fairmont, and others their unique design look inside and out, utilizing plants as a key element of the design.  His operation included retail stores, 36 acres of nurseries and 500,000 square feet of commercial green-houses spread across 3 states.  Before becoming Diego's first retail tenant, Norris sold his business to a fortune 500 company, helping them do a roll up in the landscape industry nation wide.
Norris will be working closely with Diego Worldwide Board Advisor, Greg Quist, whose background includes being the first Creative Director of the Tommy Bahama Brand, one of the highest profit per square foot retailers in U.S. history.  He was also a key member in developing the hugely successful brands Union Bay, Esprit and Bebe & Co.
Throgmartin further commented, "We are determined to provide to our tenants the tools necessary to showcase the best products and service this industry has to offer.  These tools include the best built stores and grows possible coupled with consulting experts that we bring to the table, in safety, standards, design, branding and retail. "
Diego Worldwide is unique as a landlord because in most cases the Company holds an acquisition agreement with tenants that is exercisable at the company's discretion, as it becomes appropriately legal to do so.  For this reason, the Company has a serious interest in making sure our tenants maintain brand integrity and standards.
The Company's expert consultants made available to our tenants include members of our Advisory Board: Dr. Robert Epstein, former COO of the USDA; Dr. Michael Osborne, Chief of Cancer Surgery; Jon Fink, owner of one of the leading luxury packaging companies in the world, etc.
Douglas Anderson, Founder of Diego Worldwide, added, "Throgmartin himself brings the four key strengths that a CEO of Diego Worldwide should have: 1) retail and branding in a public company, 2) Real Estate and Development, 3) Agriculture and 4) Marijuana."  
Throgmartin has solid experience in all four of these key areas, having helped develop his family's business – a retail and brand play spread across 17 states – which grew to $2.4BN in revenue, then went public on the NYSE.  His real estate development company built out over 3.5MM square feet of commercial real estate; he helped build one of the largest beef cattle herds in the U.S. spread across several states; and finally, he has developed dispensary and grow operations for marijuana in CO.  The company is extremely pleased to have such a strong team lead by such a well-rounded and capable CEO.  
Rounding out the management team, the Company's chairman is a senior trader on the floor of the NYSE, and Board member Steve Norris was Co-Founder and President for 11 years of Carlyle Group. For the past 2 decades Carlyle has been considered by many to be one of the most prominent multinational investment banks with over $250BN under management.  
This management team is well poised to develop Diego into a global brand.
About Diego Pellicer Worldwide:
Diego Pellicer Worldwide Inc. is a real estate and a consumer retail development company that is focused on developing Diego Pellicer as the world's first "premium" marijuana brand by adhering to the highest quality and standards for its facilities along with both cannabis and non-cannabis products. The company's initial focus is to acquire and develop legally compliant real estate locations for the purposes of leasing them to state licensed companies in the cannabis industry. Diego does not grow or sell marijuana or marijuana infused products in the early stages of the plan.  http://DiegoPellicer.com/

Diego Pellicer Worldwide, Inc., the First Brand Name in Premium Marijuana, Introduces its Initial Retail Tenant for the Company's Flagship Store

May 04, 2016 06:00

SEATTLE, May 4, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Diego Pellicer Worldwide (OTCQB: DPWW), a real estate and consumer retail development company that is focused on developing Diego Pellicer as the world's first "premium" cannabis brand, today introduces and profiles the Company's initial retail tenant for their Flagship Seattle store."Peter Norris has a distinguished horticulture, design, retail and brand building background," notes Ron Throgmartin, CEO of Diego Pellicer Worldwide, Inc.Norris built a prominent horticulture business, giving marquee clients such as Nordstrom, Four Seasons, Fairmont, and others their unique design look inside and out, utilizing plants as a key element of the design.  His operation included retail stores, 36 acres of nurseries and 500,000 square feet of commercial green-houses spread across 3 states.  Before becoming Diego's first retail tenant, Norris sold his business to a fortune 500 company, helping them do a roll up in the landscape industry nation wide.Norris will be working closely with Diego Worldwide Board Advisor, Greg Quist, whose background includes being the first Creative Director of the Tommy Bahama Brand, one of the highest profit per square foot retailers in U.S. history.  He was also a key member in developing the hugely successful brands Union Bay, Esprit and Bebe & Co.Throgmartin further commented, "We are determined to provide to our tenants the tools necessary to showcase the best products and service this industry has to offer.  These tools include the best built stores and grows possible coupled with consulting experts that we bring to the table, in safety, standards, design, branding and retail. "Diego Worldwide is unique as a landlord because in most cases the Company holds an acquisition agreement with tenants that is exercisable at the company's discretion, as it becomes appropriately legal to do so.  For this reason, the Company has a serious interest in making sure our tenants maintain brand integrity and standards.The Company's expert consultants made available to our tenants include members of our Advisory Board: Dr. Robert Epstein, former COO of the USDA; Dr. Michael Osborne, Chief of Cancer Surgery; Jon Fink, owner of one of the leading luxury packaging companies in the world, etc.Douglas Anderson, Founder of Diego Worldwide, added, "Throgmartin himself brings the four key strengths that a CEO of Diego Worldwide should have: 1) retail and branding in a public company, 2) Real Estate and Development, 3) Agriculture and 4) Marijuana."  Throgmartin has solid experience in all four of these key areas, having helped develop his family's business – a retail and brand play spread across 17 states – which grew to $2.4BN in revenue, then went public on the NYSE.  His real estate development company built out over 3.5MM square feet of commercial real estate; he helped build one of the largest beef cattle herds in the U.S. spread across several states; and finally, he has developed dispensary and grow operations for marijuana in CO.  The company is extremely pleased to have such a strong team lead by such a well-rounded and capable CEO.  Rounding out the management team, the Company's chairman is a senior trader on the floor of the NYSE, and Board member Steve Norris was Co-Founder and President for 11 years of Carlyle Group. For the past 2 decades Carlyle has been considered by many to be one of the most prominent multinational investment banks with over $250BN under management.  This management team is well poised to develop Diego into a global brand.About Diego Pellicer Worldwide:Diego Pellicer Worldwide Inc. is a real estate and a consumer retail development company that is focused on developing Diego Pellicer as the world's first "premium" marijuana brand by adhering to the highest quality and standards for its facilities along with both cannabis and non-cannabis products. The company's initial focus is to acquire and develop legally compliant real estate locations for the purposes of leasing them to state licensed companies in the cannabis industry.

Investor Relations | Diego Pellicer Worldwide Select a DestinationWashington - SeattleColorado - DenverDigital Retail Outlet(516) 900-DPWWworldwide@diego-pellicer.comThe Leader in Premium MarijuanaInvestor RelationsFINANCIAL INFORMATIONSEC FilingsStock ChartPress Releases () ()The Time is Now for Diego Pellicer WorldwideFew times in human history has a market worth hundreds of billions of dollars gone untapped by major companies. The majority of the US population approves the end of federally sanctioned marijuana prohibition. When the laws fall, our doors will be open.Being first is more important than being best. Thankfully, Diego Pellicer has designs on both. We’re already the #1 ranked result for the search term “premium marijuana” and we have secured multiple first rate locations in Colorado, Washington and Oregon.DIEGO PELLICER WORLDWIDE, INC. (DPWW)Diego Pellicer Worldwide Inc. is a real estate and a consumer retail development company that is focused on developing Diego Pellicer as the world’s first “premium” marijuana brand by adhering to the highest quality and standards for its facilities along with both cannabis and non-cannabis products. The company’s initial focus is to acquire and develop legally compliant real estate locations for the purposes of leasing them to state licensed companies in the cannabis industry. Diego does not grow or sell marijuana or marijuana infused products in the early stages of the plan.Diego’s initial revenues derive from leasing real estate and selling non-cannabis related products; however, when it is federally legal to do so, Diego will be properly positioned to take advantage of pre-negotiated acquisition contracts with selected Diego tenants in marijuana retail and production facilities throughout the country. Diego’s proprietary model will allow it to become a nationally branded marijuana retailer and producer, instantaneously, with the change of federal law.WHAT WE DO:Lease legally compliant locations for growing, retailing or medical dispensing of marijuana.Participate in profit of café operations of non-infused products.Participate in the profit of ancillary products including branded apparel.In some cases we sign contracts with our tenants, with the right to acquire at our discretion.WHAT WE DON’T DO:Grow marijuana.Sell marijuana.Profit from the sale of marijuana.DPWW Financial News:Diego Pellicer Worldwide Provides Corporate UpdateDPWW Other Information:We have received a few inquiries regarding the status of a subpoena we received on May 23, 2014 from the United States Departed of Justice represented by the United States Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Washington.  Our attorneys have prepared the letter attached addressing the conduct taken by the Company to comply with the subpoena and the status of the subpoena to date. –  Opinion LetterContact Us about Investment OpportunitiesContact UsDIEGO PELLICER WORLDWIDE, INC.Diego offers great value to investors as a financial vehicle that gives them the ability to enter an emerging market with a leading brand—Diego Pellicer. The initial value proposition of Diego consists of a standardized approach to the build-outs of real estate holdings, customized for premium marijuana grow and retail operations. The build-out model is optimized to maximize resources while minimizing costs and overhead. With each build-out, Diego pre-negotiates acquisition contractions with licensed DP Grow and DP Retail tenants, which, upon changes to federal law, introduces our second value proposition—ownership of operations from seed to sale in an industry that is projected to exceed $8 billion by 2018 and will soon rival that of traditional markets such as tobacco and alcohol.”Please contact Ron Throgmartin
