 RISE RESOURCES INC. (OTCMKTS:RYES) Files An 8-K Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities

Item 3.02 Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities


On February6, 2017, the Company completed the issuance and sale
of an aggregate of 455,000 units at a price of CAD$0.25 per unit
for gross proceeds of CAD$113,750 (the Private Placement)
comprising the first tranche of an offering of up to 800,000
units. Each unit consists of one share of the Companys common
stock and one transferable share purchase warrant exercisable
into one share of common stock at a price of CAD$0.40 until
February6, 2019. All securities issued to the Private Placement
and the finders fee are subject to statutory hold periods in
accordance with applicable United States securities laws for a
minimum of six months and to statutory hold periods in accordance
with applicable Canadian securities laws for a minimum of four
months


In connection with the Private Placement, the Company paid a
finder a cash commission of CAD$2,625, being 6% of the gross
proceeds raised from investors introduced to the Company by that
finder, and issued 10,500 finders warrants, being 6% of the
number of Units sold to investors introduced to the Company by
the finder. Each warrant is exercisable into one share of the
Companys common stock at a price of CAD$0.40 until February6,
2019.


The Company plans to use the proceeds from the Private Placement
for general working capital purposes.


In addition, on February7, 2017, the Company granted 500,000
incentive stock options to Skanderbeg Capital Advisors Inc., the
Companys investor relations advisor, to its stock option plan.
Each option vests immediately and is exercisable into one share
of the Companys common stock at a price of CAD$0.33 per share
until February7, 2020.


The Company issued the shares and warrants underlying the
foregoing units and granted the foregoing options and finders
warrants in reliance on the exemptions from registration provided
by Rule 903 of Regulation S under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the Securities Act) for offers and sales outside of the
United States and Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act and Rule
506(b) of Regulation D thereunder for offers and sales in the
United States and to U.S. persons. The Companys reliance on Rule
903 of Regulation S under the Securities Act (Regulation S) was
based on the fact that the securities were sold in offshore
transactions, as defined in Rule 902(h) of Regulation S. The
Company did not engage in any directed selling efforts in the
United States in connection with the sale of the securities, and
none of the applicable investors was a U.S. person or acquired
the securities for the account or benefit of any U.S. person. The
Companys reliance on Rule 506(b) was based on the fact that the
sole U.S. investor in the Private Placement provided
representations to the Company regarding his status as an
accredited investor, as defined in Rule 501(a) of Regulation D,
and that neither the Company nor anyone acting on its behalf
engaged in any general advertising or general solicitation in
connection with the Private Placement.


As of the date of this current report on Form 8-K, the Company
has 57,297,841 issued and outstanding shares of common stock,
outstanding warrants to purchase 26,593,070 shares of common
stock and outstanding options to purchase 5,729,142 shares of
common stock.


Item 8.01. Other Events.


On February 7, 2017, the Company issued a press release
announcing the closing of the Private Placement described above
and the engagement of Skanderbeg Capital Advisors Inc.
(Skanderbeg) to provide investor relations services to the
Company. The initial agreement with Skanderbeg is for a one year
term for a CAD$7,500 per month fee. A copy of the press release
is attached hereto asExhibit 99.1


Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits.

Stocks: 15 minute delay, EST. Futures and Forex: 10 minute delay, CST.) and new delayed trade updates are updated on the page (as indicated by a "flash").  Summary Quoteboard The Summary Quoteboard displays snapshot quote data. When available, Bid and Ask information is updated as new data is received. Volume is also updated but is the delayed consolidated Volume from the symbol's exchange. Quoteboard data fields include:  Day High / Low: The highest and lowest trade price for the current trading session. Open: The opening price for the current trading session is plotted on the day's High/Low histogram. Previous Close: The closing price from the previous trading session. Bid: The last bid price and bid size. Ask: The last ask price and ask size. Volume: The total number of shares or contracts traded in the current trading session. Average Volume: The average number of shares traded over the last 20 days. Weighted Alpha: A measure of how much a stock or commodity has risen or fallen over a one-year period. Barchart takes this Alpha and weights this, assigning more weight to recent activity, and less (0.5 factor) to activity at the beginning of the period. Thus, Weighted Alpha is a measure of one-year growth with an emphasis on the most recent price activity.  Chart Snapshot A thumbnail of a daily chart is provided, with a link to open and customize a full-sized chart.Barchart Technical Opinion The Barchart Technical Opinion widget shows you today's overally Barchart Opinion with general information on how to interpret the short and longer term signals. Unique to Barchart.com, Opinions analyzes a stock or commodity using 13 popular analytics in short-, medium- and long-term periods. Results are interpreted as buy, sell or hold signals, each with numeric ratings and summarized with an overall percentage buy or sell rating. After each calculation the program assigns a Buy, Sell, or Hold value with the study, depending on where the price lies in reference to the common interpretation of the study. For example, a price above its moving average is generally considered an upward trend or a buy. A symbol will be given one of the following overall ratings:  Strong Buy (greater than "66% Buy") Buy (greater than or equal to "33% Buy" and less than or equal to "66% Buy") Weak Buy ("0% Buy" through "33% Buy") Hold Strong Sell (greater than "66% Sell") Sell (greater than or equal to "33% Sell" and less than or equal to "66% Sell") Weak Sell ("0% Sell" through "33% Sell")  The current reading of the 14-Day Stochastic indicator is also factored into the interpretation. The following information will appear when the following conditions are met:   If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is greater than 90 and the Overall Opinion is a Buy, the following displays: "The market is in highly overbought territory. Beware of a trend reversal." If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is greater than 80 and the Overall Opinion is a Buy, the following displays: "The market is approaching overbought territory. Be watchful of a trend reversal."  If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is less than 10 and the Overall Opinion is a Sell, the following displays: "The market is in highly oversold territory. Beware of a trend reversal."  If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is less than 20 and the Overall Opinion is a Sell, the following displays: "The market is approaching oversold territory. Be watchful of a trend reversal." Business Summary Provides a general description of the business conducted by this company. Price Performance This section shows the Highs and Lows over the past 1, 3 and 12-Month periods. Click the "See More" link to see the full Performance Report page with expanded historical information.Fundamentals For US Stocks, the Overview page includes key statistics on the stock's fundamentals, with a link to see more. Most Recent Earnings figures are based on Non-GAAP income from continuing operations. Market Cap: capitalization or market value of a stock is simply the market value of all outstanding shares. It is computed by multiplying the market price by the number of outstanding shares. For example, a publicly held company with 10 million shares outstanding that trade at $10 each would have a market capitalization of $100 million. Shares Outstanding: Common shares outstanding as reported by the company on the 10-Q or 10-K. P/E Ratio: Latest closing price divided by the earnings-per-share based on the Latest 12-Month EPS Change (LTM) of earnings. Companies with negative earnings receive an "NE." EPS: The basic annual EPS from total operations is the bottom line income after all expenses, divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. For example, if a company has $10 million in net income and 10 million in outstanding shares, then its EPS is $1. Beta: 36 Month Beta: Coefficient that measures the volatility of a stock's returns relative to the market (S&P 500). It is based on a 36-month historical regression of the return on the stock onto the return on the S&P 500. Earnings: The amount of latest Earnings Per Share (EPS) paid out to shareholders. Dividend Yield: A portion of a company's profit paid to shareholders, quoted as the dollar amount each share receives (dividends per share). Yield is the amount of dividends paid per share, divided by the closing price. Sectors: Links to the Industry Groups and/or SIC codes in which the stock is found.Support and Resistance This section shows a snapshot view of the Trader's Cheat Sheet with the Last Price, and four separate pivot points (2 Support Levels, and 2 Resistance Points). The Last Price shown is the last trade price at the time the quote page was displayed, and will not update every 10 seconds (as the Last Price at the top of the Quote page does). The Last Price will update only when the page is refreshed. Pivot points are used to identify intraday support, resistance and target levels. The pivot point and its support and resistance pairs are defined as follows, where H, L, C are the current day's high, low and close, respectively. Support and Resistance points are based on end-of-day prices and are intended for the current trading session if the market is open, or the next trading session if the market is closed.   Pivot Point: (P) = (H + L + C) / 3 First Resistance Level: (R1) = (2 * P) - L First Support Level: (S1) = (2 * P) - H Second Resistance Level: (R2) = P + (R1 - S1) Second Support Level: (S2) = P - (R1 - S1) Related ETFs Find exchange traded funds (ETFs) whose sector aligns with the same commodity grouping as the symbol you are viewing.
