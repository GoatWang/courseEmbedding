Staff » De’Shawn Little- Instructor De’Shawn Little- Instructor



Where are you from?
Milwaukee, WI
Bio:
I came in as a guest for a friend for a guest party and after that is when I realized my love for dancing. In fact, after 3 months, I decided I wanted to be a dance instructor. Now that I am, I have never been happier. I have two dogs who are troublemakers, but I love them. My favorite color is red, pink, black, purple… actually, I like all colors!
Goals:
To be the best professional dancer and instructor I can be and to show every one I meet the joy of dancing.
Hobbies:
I like sports, my favorite sports are Track & Field and Basketball.
Favorite quote:
“Fear is not real. The only place that fear can exist is in our thoughts of the future. It’s just a product of our imagination, causing us to fear things that do not at present and may not ever exist. That is near insanity. Do not misunderstand me, danger is very real, but fear is a choice.” – Will Smith
I love being a dance instructor because:
I love teaching people how to dance. It gives me the opportunity to get to know people and connect with them in a unique way and help them feel confident in themselves.

Tim Brooks – Studio Owner

Tim is originally from England and is the son of two professional dancers. Dancing over 20 years, Tim won National Titles in England and represented his country at many competitions across Europe.
Tim moved to the United States in 2006 to work for Fred Astaire Dance Studios. In 2008 he won the Eastern United States Rising Star Professional Rhythm title and has been very successful at numerous events both as a Professional competitor and helping his many students to achieve their dancing goals.
As one of the top teachers in New England and Florida he moved to Wisconsin to continue working for Fred Astaire with his wife Kristin and their children Chelsea and Jordan. This move sparked the realization of his dream of owning a studio and helping pass on his knowledge and joy of dance to others.










 

Kristin Brooks – Studio Owner

Ms. Kristin was born in Greendale, WI and raised in Grafton, WI. As a child she danced ballet and jazz and was a ballroom dance student at the Fred Astaire Dance Studios. As a student she won many competitive awards such as top solo, Pro/Am Smooth and Rhythm champion and competed at the Fred Astaire Dance Studios national competition. She has also studied business and has a cosmetology degree.
In 2008 she took the leap from student to teacher. Her awards as a teacher include top new student instructor, three-time dance store specialist and Top Guest Getter for 2011. As a professional dancer she was a Rising Star Rhythm finalist at the Michigan competition and in 2012 a finalist in the Closed Professional Rhythm Division at the Fred Astaire World Championships held in Puerto Rico
Ms. Kristin likes dance lessons to be fun and easy. She wants students to feel good social dancing and to feel confident in competitive dancing. She believes repetition is a key factor to make sure students feel comfortable with the steps. Ms. Kristin enjoys helping people achieve their goals and finding how dance can change students’ lives. She also enjoys performing with students and other professionals.










 

Juan Garcia – Instructor

Where are you from?: Germantown, Wisconsin
Bio: I’ve spent most of my life in Germantown, WI. Growing up I’ve always been attracted to anything that was about rhythm. When I was in school I also was a very active member within the Theater Arts and Band Programs. I enjoy entertaining people but it wasn’t until I walked through the Fred Astaire doors that I had a perfect opportunity to not only entertain people but to also give them a fun thing to use as an exciting new hobby in their lives.
Goals: To become a successful dancer
Hobbies: I like watching movies, playing tennis, football, ultimate Frisbee and hiking.
Favorite Quote: “Notice that the stiffest tree is most easily cracked, while the bamboo or willow survives by bending with the wind.” – Bruce Lee
I love being a Dance Instructor because: it allows me to teach people something new and exciting that not everyone knows!










 

Jennifer McKinley – Instructor

Where are you from? Hustisford, Wisconsin
Bio: I was raised in a large, crazy family so there is no such thing as too crazy or too silly in my book. I grew up only being able to watch dancing, but desired to be able to make it my life. After high school I was able to dabble with a few different styles of dance but I desired more. Fortunately I found Fred Astaire and I am now able to fully pursue my dream.
Goals: To be the most accomplished dancer I can be and live my life to the fullest.
Hobbies: I love reading, dancing (all styles), cooking, travel and horseback riding. I also love hiking, camping and spending time with my family.
Favorite Quote: “The moment you doubt whether you can fly, you cease forever to be able to do it.”  -Peter Pan,  J.M.Barrie
I love being a Dance Instructor because: Dance has changed my life and I want to use it to change the lives of others.










 

Colette Fraley- Front Desk Receptionist

Where are you from? Milwaukee, WI
Bio: I was first introduced to dance in 2015 by a friend who was taking lessons at Fred Astaire. They invited me to a guest party and I fell in love! After being a student for about a year, I was able to pursue a career at the studio as the receptionist. I have never been happier since stepping foot through these doors!
Hobbies: I love dancing (obviously), I also do hair and makeup, and reading.
Favorite quote: “Don’t let small minds ruin your big dreams” -unknown
