Specialists in Coherent Optical Interconnects
Acacia transforms communications networks relied upon by cloud infrastructure operators and content and communication service providers by delivering high-speed coherent optical interconnect products.






DSP technology


Digital Signal Processor (DSP) technology is at the heart of the coherent revolution in optical transport. By developing our own DSP technology, Acacia is able to optimize the trade-offs not only between functions on the DSP, but also between the optics and DSP.




dsp technology










Silicon Photonics PIC Technology


Coherent applications maximize the benefits of silicon photonics. Not only is Acacia able to achieve performance comparable to traditional component technologies, but our well controlled CMOS manufacturing process enables a level of photonic integration that would be extremely difficult using more traditional optics.




Silicon Photonics PIC Technology










Subsystem Integration


With control over both the DSP and PIC technologies, Acacia is able to take a holistic approach to subsystem development. Throughout the process, Acacia engineers leverage their combined expertise in every aspect of the subsystem, resulting in highly optimized products.

Applications

         Our coherent DSP ASICs and silicon PICs are at the heart of our products’ abilities to deliver cost-efficient high performance solutions from Long-haul (LH) to Metro and Include Inter-Data Center Interconnect (DCI). 


Long-haul networks have traditionally been the earliest of high-speed optical technologies, requiring sophisticated and high-capacity transmission capabilities.


Acacia technology has helped to bring the benefits of low power and pluggability to metro network applications. 


Additionally, cloud infrastructure operators and content service providers are starting to build private networks of data centers to connect their data centers to each other.

Applications Overview
Our coherent DSP ASICs and silicon PICs are at the heart of our products. These component technologies, internally developed by Acacia, deliver cost effective, high bandwidth, high performance solutions to optical networking applications such as Submarine, Long-haul and Metro, including Data Center Interconnect.
Long-haul networks, requiring sophisticated and high-capacity transmission capabilities, were the earliest adopters of high-speed coherent optical technologies. Acacia’s technology has helped to bring the benefits of low power and pluggability to metro network applications.
Additionally, cloud infrastructure operators and content service providers are deploying the latest high bandwidth technologies to connect their data centers at reaches that range from tens to thousands of kilometers.
See below for a look at the application areas that our products support.

Long Haul


Long haul terrestrial networks link major population centers within continents, spanning distances from 1,500 km to more than 2,500 km. Today’s cloud networks are constantly mirroring data between servers in geographically diverse locations. Cost effective upgrades and expansion to 100 Gbps and above is necessary to meet this growing need for data. Long haul terrestrial and subsea networks must be upgraded to provide higher bit rate dense wavelength division multiplexing (DWDM) technology to carry data from different sources simultaneously.
Long haul networks put a high value on performance. The ability to communicate over longer distances reduces the number of regeneration stages, where signals are converted from the optical domain to electrical and back. This can have significant cost savings to the overall network. In addition to prioritizing reach, it is important to maximize the amount of traffic on each fiber, known as the spectral efficiency. Coherent technology has very high spectral efficiency and enables network operators to maximize their utilization of this constrained resource.


Metro Carrier


Metro carrier optical networks interconnect a wide range of traffic from central offices and data centers within a metropolitan area. These complex mesh networks typically cover ranges from 80km to 1,500km and may include up to 24 remote optical add-drop mux (ROADM) nodes that introduce additional optical impairments. Metro networks are optimized for small physical footprints and low power, but must deliver ever-more bandwidth to meet customer needs.
While coherent technology was first adopted in long haul networks, the introduction of Acacia’s low power, pluggable coherent CFP module in 2014 made coherent much more appealing in metro applications. Old fiber and wavelength selective switch (WSS) based ROADM nodes in metro networks introduce impairments, such as polarization mode dispersion (PMD), polarization dependent loss (PDL), and reduced channel passbands. These impairments are often more severe in metro than in long haul networks. For this reason, reach alone is not a good indicator of performance requirements in these applications.


DCI


The largest cloud infrastructure operators and internet content providers are moving from leasing bandwidth from service providers networks to leasing or buying dark fibers and building private networks. These networks are increasingly dependent on higher speed optical solutions. Traffic between data centers is increasing at a faster rate than traffic between users and the data centers.
Many enterprises are moving from operating their own datacenter to cloud based services that offer lower cost and greater flexibility to scale as their needs increase. This transition is leading to larger data centers where resources are consolidated. The interconnect requirements for these mega-data centers are driving demand for solutions that are optimized for these point to point links. Instead of many smaller data centers with moderate connectivity requirements, these mega-data centers require massive bandwidth over fewer paths. This architecture reduces the need for granularity and places the highest value on cost per bit.
Traffic patterns in the cloud networks are different from traditional data centers. Where the traditional network has a lot of north-south traffic between the servers and users, cloud networks have far more east-west traffic between servers. This traffic is used for synchronization and load balancing to maximize the utilization of available resources.


Submarine


Optical interconnections span thousands of kilometers under the world’s oceans. The distance and cost associated with deploying and maintaining these links make the submarine market highly sensitive to performance and reliability. There are limited fibers available, so maximizing fiber utilization is a top priority. With the ability to compensate for severe optical impairments in CMOS, coherent technology has been groundbreaking in these applications.
Cloud operators, content providers, and many companies have locations around the globe that need networks that look like they are co-located. Traffic on submarine networks is growing, new fibers are being deployed, and capacity on existing fibers is being upgraded.
Managing submarine networks used to be extremely complex with only a handful of companies having the expertise. Deploying and maintaining the network infrastructure is still a highly specialized industry, but using coherent optical interconnects, these links are easier to turn up and provision. This has led to a transition where open submarine line systems can accept wavelengths from external systems. Cloud operators have begun to lease dark fiber service in their submarine applications.


Wireless Access


User expectations from mobile networks are escalating and wireless carriers are preparing for 5G networking that will offer as much as 5 times the bandwidth of today’s 4G networks. Video streaming to mobile devices is becoming more common and carriers are racing to find ways to make it more cost effective. While 5G standards are still being developed, wireless carriers and equipment vendors are actively trying to determine how to meet the challenge of a “video everywhere” world. New architectures will be necessary to aggregate all of that distributed bandwidth.
Wireless backhaul, where the wireless network is connected to the core, has long been an exciting optical networking market. Today, these applications are using 10 Gbps and lower optical interconnects. As the amount of data on the wireless network increases, the capacity on the backhaul networks will scale, requiring higher capacity fiber optic solutions.
In order to maximize the data available to the mobile user, the wireless networks are changing. While there are multiple proposed implementations, there are a few common elements.


Higher density of antennae in the network to increase overall capacity.


Centralized control of multiple antennae will allow for more intelligent balancing of the network resources.


Fiber optics all the way to the antennae tower, known as wireless fronthaul will relieve a bottleneck as capacity per tower increases.




Wired Access


Access networks are the on-ramps to the internet, where connections from many individual residential or enterprise customers are aggregated.
Applications such as 4K video, virtual reality gaming, and business connectivity are driving the need for higher capacities on the links that connect from the neighborhood to the central office. In addition, bandwidth demands are growing from commercial enterprises that are moving their data services to the cloud.
This market will need high capacity solutions that can be cost effectively deployed in volume. This equipment is deployed in uncontrolled environments, so future applications could face a more challenging environment than the typical central office or datacenter.

UPDATE: Acacia Communications shares slide on news of manufacturing issue
Acacia Communications Inc. shares  slid 4% in premarket trade Wednesday, after the company said it has identified a quality issue that is affecting some of its roughly 1,300 AC400 units and 5,000 CFP units made by one of its three contract manufacturers over a four-month period. The company develops transreceivers for optical networking applications. "The company believes the root cause of this quality issue has been identified as a circuit board cleaning process that has since been eliminated, and manufacturing at this contract manufacturer has resumed," it said in a regulatory filing. Acacia is now working with customers to resolve the issue, and working to determine the cost of the issue and to evaluate its impact on its manufacturing  capacity. Shares are down 25% in 2017, while the S&P 500  has gained 8%.

UPDATE: Acacia Communications shares slide on news of manufacturing issue
Acacia Communications Inc. shares  slid 4% in premarket trade Wednesday, after the company said it has identified a quality issue that is affecting some of its roughly 1,300 AC400 units and 5,000 CFP units made by one of its three contract manufacturers over a four-month period. The company develops transreceivers for optical networking applications. "The company believes the root cause of this quality issue has been identified as a circuit board cleaning process that has since been eliminated, and manufacturing at this contract manufacturer has resumed," it said in a regulatory filing. Acacia is now working with customers to resolve the issue, and working to determine the cost of the issue and to evaluate its impact on its manufacturing  capacity. Shares are down 25% in 2017, while the S&P 500  has gained 8%.

Acacia Communications is an optical networking telecommunication technology company that develops products using a process referred as "siliconization of optical interconnect" which is essentially a methodology to convert traditional optical interconnections into a silicon-based chip. Acacia products include a series of low-power coherent digital signal processor application-specific integrated circuits (DSP ASICs) and silicon photonic integrated circuits (silicon PICs), which the company has integrated into families of optical interconnect modules with transmission speeds ranging from 40 to 400 gigabits per second, for use in long-haul, metro, and inter-data center markets. Acacia products consume less power compared to traditional optical interconnects and cost less. [3]
Acacia claims their technology provides insight into network and connection point characteristics and helps identify network performance problems, all of which increase flexibility and reduce operating costs. [4]
Acacia was founded by former employees of Mintera Inc., Benny P. Mikkelsen (co-founder of Mintera), Christian J. Rasmussen, and Mehrdad Givehchi. Mintera was acquired by Oclaro (NASDAQ:  OCLR) in 2010. Acacia's current CEO Murugesan Shanmugaraj was the former Vice President of the optical networking division of Alcatel-Lucent USA. Raj was also the founder and chief executive officer of Astral Point Communications, which was acquired by Alcatel-Lucent in 2002 for $135M. [5]
Acacia gets large portions of its revenue from a handful of key customers, including ZTE Kangxun Telecom Co. Ltd. and ADVA Optical Networking North America Inc. [6]

Technology
Acacia technology is rooted in low-power coherent DSP ASICs and silicon PICs. Acacia's coherent DSP ASICs are manufactured using the complementary metal-oxide semiconductor, or CMOS. Their silicon PICs are manufactured using a CMOS-compatible process. CMOS is a widely used and cost-effective semiconductor process technology. Using CMOS to siliconize optical interconnect technology enables them to continue to integrate increasing functionality into their products, benefit from higher yields and reliability associated with CMOS, and capitalize on regular improvements in CMOS performance, density, and cost. Acacia's use of CMOS also enables them to use outsourced foundry services rather than requiring custom fabrication to manufacture their products. Also, Acacia's use of CMOS and CMOS-compatible processes enables them to take advantage of the major investments in manufacturing and the technology and integration improvements driven by other computer and communications markets that rely on CMOS.

Products
Acacia has developed families of high-speed coherent interconnect products that reduce the complexity and cost of optical interconnect technology, while simultaneously improving network performance and accelerating the pace of innovation in the optical networking industry. [7]

Why Acacia Communications, Inc. Stock Popped Today
The newly public interconnect products provider continued climbing after an even larger jump on Friday.











                Steve Symington
            

                (TMFSymington)



            
            Aug 15, 2016 at 1:26PM
            
            






Image source: Acacia Communications, Inc.
What: Shares of Acacia Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:ACIA) were up 10.8% Monday, extending a more-than-41% pop Friday after the recently public optical interconnect products specialist posted blowout second-quarter 2016 results.
So what: In its report Thursday after the market close, Acacia CEO Raj Shanmugaraj cited "the success of our disruptive technology in transforming cloud, content, and communications networks" for driving results that "exceeded our expectations across the board."
More specifically, Acacia's quarterly revenue more than doubled year over year, to $116.2 million, while adjusted net income per diluted share more than quadrupled, to $0.77. Analysts on average were looking for revenue of just $86 million, and adjusted earnings of only $0.13 per share. 
Now what: To be fair, it's not entirely surprising to see this kind of volatility surrounding Acacia considering it only just priced its initial public offering in May. So it may take some time for investors to get a better feel for its propensity for under promising and over delivering with each passing quarter as a publicly traded company. But given the gravity of its inaugural quarterly beat, it's hard to blame investors for so ferociously bidding up Acacia Communications shares the past two trading days. While I'm not particularly anxious to dive in today after the pop, you'll be hard pressed to find any investor willing to complain about these gains.

Acacia Communications Inc. is also a component of the Russell 2000. The Russell 2000 is one of the leading indices tracking small-cap companies in the United States. It's maintained by  Russell 
Investments, an industry leader in creating and maintaining indices, and consists of the smallest 2000 stocks from the broader Russell 3000 index.


Russell's indices differ from traditional indices like the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) or S&P 500, whose members are selected by committee, because they base membership entirely on an 
objective, rules based methodology. The 3,000 largest companies by market cap make up the Russell 3000, with the 2,000 smaller companies making up the Russell 2000. It's a simple approach that gives 
a broad, unbiased look at the small-cap market as a whole.

SUPPORT













Specialists in Coherent Optical Interconnects
Acacia transforms communications networks relied upon by cloud infrastructure operators and content and communication service providers by delivering high-speed coherent optical interconnect products.






DSP technology


Digital Signal Processor (DSP) technology is at the heart of the coherent revolution in optical transport. By developing our own DSP technology, Acacia is able to optimize the trade-offs not only between functions on the DSP, but also between the optics and DSP.




dsp technology










Silicon Photonics PIC Technology


Coherent applications maximize the benefits of silicon photonics. Not only is Acacia able to achieve performance comparable to traditional component technologies, but our well controlled CMOS manufacturing process enables a level of photonic integration that would be extremely difficult using more traditional optics.




Silicon Photonics PIC Technology










Subsystem Integration


With control over both the DSP and PIC technologies, Acacia is able to take a holistic approach to subsystem development. Throughout the process, Acacia engineers leverage their combined expertise in every aspect of the subsystem, resulting in highly optimized products.

Applications

         Our coherent DSP ASICs and silicon PICs are at the heart of our products’ abilities to deliver cost-efficient high performance solutions from Long-haul (LH) to Metro and Include Inter-Data Center Interconnect (DCI). 


Long-haul networks have traditionally been the earliest of high-speed optical technologies, requiring sophisticated and high-capacity transmission capabilities.


Acacia technology has helped to bring the benefits of low power and pluggability to metro network applications. 


Additionally, cloud infrastructure operators and content service providers are starting to build private networks of data centers to connect their data centers to each other.
