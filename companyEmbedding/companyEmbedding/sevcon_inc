Caribe CapitalLong/short equity, hedge fund manager, micro-cap, Come on in.  The water's fine.The Sevcon Bull Case Does Not Stand Up To Scrutiny - Fair Value Of $6/Share Background: Sevcon (NASDAQ:SEV) is a manufacturer of controllers for electric motors. The simplest way to think about it is as the box that connects the battery to an electric motor and is used to draw power and tell the motor what to do. The company has been in this business for decades and is mostly in industrial applications like mining, farming, lift trucks, forklifts, golf carts, etc. 20-25% of its controller business is in the "on road" space that is currently promoted as its key growth area and represents the core of its bull case. We do not believe this growth will emerge as hoped. The company has announced five "on road" customers, none named. These deals take                                                                                           ...

History[edit]
It was founded in 1961 as Sevcon Engineering Ltd. The company was formed to develop technology originated by Horace William Heyman (13 March 1912 - 4 September 1998), who had been Managing Director of Smith Electric Vehicles from 1949 until 1964. It was the largest manufacturer of electric vehicles in Europe.
His technology improved battery-life for frequent start-stop runs of electric vehicles at low speeds. There were always large electrical losses on starting an electric vehicle because of electrical resistances heating up. The technology allowed a 20% reduction in battery size for equivalent power, or increased battery length or power for a standard-sized battery.
An electric vehicle would have had resistances to drop the voltage on the motor when starting, but this created heating. His technology employed semiconductor-controlled rectifiers, with a semiconductor oscillator, which provided pulses of electrical power to power the motor.
It won the Queen's Award to Industry in April 1970, and the Queen's Awards for Export in April 1975. A new factory opened in June 1970 at Gateshead.
Worldwide[edit]
It opened its first subsidiary in 1968 in Paris. In 1969 it was bought by Tech/Ops of the USA.
Public company[edit]
In 1988 it was listed on the USA stock exchange, then joined the NASDAQ Capital Market in 2009.
Structure[edit]
The head office is situated opposite the automotive centre of Gateshead College. It outsources much of the manufacture of its components to Key Tronic of the USA. A UK site manufactures film capacitors.
Its competitors include Danaher's Motion division, and General Electric. In 2010 it spent around £3 million in research and development at Gateshead.
Products[edit]
It makes microprocessor controllers for electric vehicles.

History[edit]
It was founded in 1961 as Sevcon Engineering Ltd. The company was formed to develop technology originated by Horace William Heyman (13 March 1912 - 4 September 1998), who had been Managing Director of Smith Electric Vehicles from 1949 until 1964. It was the largest manufacturer of electric vehicles in Europe.
His technology improved battery-life for frequent start-stop runs of electric vehicles at low speeds. There were always large electrical losses on starting an electric vehicle because of electrical resistances heating up. The technology allowed a 20% reduction in battery size for equivalent power, or increased battery length or power for a standard-sized battery.
An electric vehicle would have had resistances to drop the voltage on the motor when starting, but this created heating. His technology employed semiconductor-controlled rectifiers, with a semiconductor oscillator, which provided pulses of electrical power to power the motor.
It won the Queen's Award to Industry in April 1970, and the Queen's Awards for Export in April 1975. A new factory opened in June 1970 at Gateshead.
Worldwide[edit]
It opened its first subsidiary in 1968 in Paris. In 1969 it was bought by Tech/Ops of the USA.
Public company[edit]
In 1988 it was listed on the USA stock exchange, then joined the NASDAQ Capital Market in 2009.
Structure[edit]
The head office is situated opposite the automotive centre of Gateshead College. It outsources much of the manufacture of its components to Key Tronic of the USA. A UK site manufactures film capacitors.
Its competitors include Danaher's Motion division, and General Electric. In 2010 it spent around £3 million in research and development at Gateshead.
Products[edit]
It makes microprocessor controllers for electric vehicles.

              Overview
          









Sevcon is a world leader in the design and manufacture of microprocessor-based controls for zero emission electric vehicles. The controls are used to vary the speed and movement of vehicles, to integrate specialized functions, and to optimize the energy consumption of the vehicle’s power source. With the acquisition of italian based Bassi, Sevcons product line has been expanded by modern fast charging systems for batteries. The company supplies customers throughout the world from its operations in the US, the UK, France and the Asia Pacific region and through an international dealer network. Sevcon’s customers are manufacturers of on- and off-road vehicles including cars, trucks, buses, motorcycles, fork-lift trucks, aerial lifts, mining vehicles, airport tractors, sweepers and other electrically powered vehicles.
 
Sevcon’s revenue growth is being driven by strong sales of the innovative Gen4 motor controls range that the company has developed for on-road electric vehicles. This growth demonstrates that automotive OEMs and tier-one suppliers increasingly recognize that the technology Sevcon has developed for off-road EV applications during the past 50 years can improve vehicle efficiency and performance in on-road applications, as well. The world’s growing demand for on-road EVs is an opportunity that has the potential to transform and dramatically increase the scale of Sevcon’s business in the years ahead. The company is successfully executing on a strategy aimed at capitalizing on this opportunity.

(“Sevcon” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq:SEV), a world leader in the design and manufacture of controls and battery chargers for zero emission electric and hybrid vehicles, today announced that it has entered into a definitive merger agreement with BorgWarner Inc. that provides for BorgWarner to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Sevcon’s common stock for $22.00 per share in cash and all of the outstanding shares of Sevcon’s Series A Convertible Preferred Stock for a price per share on an as-converted basis equal to the common stock, together with payment of any accrued and unpaid dividends.  The total transaction value, including the assumption of indebtedness, is expected to be approximately $200 million at the closing of the transaction. The transaction price of $22.00 per share represents a 61% premium to the closing sale price of common stock of the Company on Friday, July 14, 2017 and a 64% premium to the 30-day volume weighted average price of common stock of the Company. “The proposed merger with BorgWarner provides substantial value to our stockholders and the chance for Sevcon to maximize previous growth investments and capitalize on greater opportunities as a part of a much larger organization with significant market presence,” said Sevcon President and CEO Matt Boyle. The Sevcon Board of Directors has unanimously approved the merger agreement and has recommended approval of the merger by Sevcon’s stockholders. The transaction is expected to close in the fourth calendar quarter of 2017 and is contingent on the approval of Sevcon’s stockholders, and is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain other closing conditions. The transaction is not subject to a financing condition.
