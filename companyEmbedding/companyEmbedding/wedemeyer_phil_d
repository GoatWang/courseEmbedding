Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/22/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.

			Phil D. Wedemeyer, age 67, was elected to the Board of Directors in April 2015. In July 2011, Mr. Wedemeyer retired as a partner from Grant Thornton LLP, an international accounting firm, where he had served since August 2007. From May 2003 to July 2007, Mr. Wedemeyer served in various capacities with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ("PCAOB"), including serving as the Director, Office of Research and Analysis, from August 2005 to July 2007 and as a Deputy Director, Division of Registration and Inspection, from March 2004 to August 2005. Prior to his service with the PCAOB, Mr. Wedemeyer spent more than 31 years at Arthur Andersen SC, an international accounting firm, including 22 years as a partner. Mr. Wedemeyer currently serves as a director of publicly-traded Atwood Oceanics, Inc., a global offshore drilling contractor, and Trinity Steel Fabricators, a privately-held fabricator of steel structures and vessels. He is a member of the Deloitte Audit Quality Advisory Council and is a licensed Certified Public Accountant. He previously served as a director of Powell Industries, Inc., Horizon Offshore, Inc. and HMS Income Fund, Inc. 
Mr. Wedemeyer's more than 35 years of public accounting firm experience and service with the PCAOB and the Auditing Standards Board of the AICPA provide the Board with extensive accounting and financial expertise. His in-depth knowledge of accounting rules and regulation, including expertise in SEC filings and international audit standards, as well as service on other publicly-traded company boards, including on audit and compliance committees, make him a valuable contributor of financial, accounting, audit, and risk management expertise to the Board. Mr. Wedemeyer qualifies as an audit committee financial expert as defined by the SEC, and has the necessary accounting expertise to serve as the Chairman of the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.
