Mechanics Bank HQ, Walnut Creek


Mechanics Bank is a community banking financial institution headquartered in Walnut Creek, California[1][2] It was founded in 1905 and serves markets in Northern California. It operates in the San Francisco Bay and Sacramento areas. The bank has over $3.5[3] billion[4] in assets and over 500 associates[5] at 30 retail branches.[6]

Background[edit]
Mechanics Bank was originally chartered as The Iverson Bank and Trust Company, founded in Richmond in 1905. It was renamed as The Mechanics Bank in 1907. Shortly after it was renamed, Edward M. Downer joined the organization, and by 1919 he had purchased a controlling interest and soon became president.
E.M. Downer (1869–1938) was a prominent official in the town of Pinole who created the "Bank of Pinole", the precursor to Mechanics Bank.[7] In 1889 at the age of 20 E.M. Downer was appointed as Transfer Agent and Telegrapher for Southern Pacific Railroad's Pinole Depot railroad station.[7] The depot became the town hub and he subsequently opened a laundromat and started the The Pinole Weekly Times newspaper.[7] Later the depot was selected as the location for the infant city's first post office and Downer became the first postmaster.[7] After the community incorporated in 1903 he became the first city clerk and afterwards mayor.[7]
The beginnings of the bank were in 1905 when E.M. Downer began offering financial services to his acquaintances from a floor safe in his office.[7] This was a great convenience to the residents because the closest bank at the time was at the Contra Costa County seat at Martinez, 13 miles (21 km) away.[7] In 1915 he became second vice president and later, in 1919 after purchasing a controlling interest, he became president until his death in 1938.[7] He was succeed by his son E.M. Downer, Jr. in 1939 who served as president until 1978.[8]
Early years[edit]
After starting the Bank of Pinole in 1905, E.M. Downer joined Mechanics Bank in Richmond. The Downer family has led Mechanics Bank through most of its history, starting with E. M. Downer who ran the Bank through the 1920s boom years when Richmond was a major West Coast industrial center.[6] Mechanics Bank served Standard Oil, Santa Fe Railroad, the Ford Motor Company and their employees during this period.[6][7] Downer also successfully led the bank through the Great Depression while many other banks succumbed.[6][7]
In 1939, E.M. Downer, Jr. became president. During World War II Richmond became a major hub of industrial and shipping activities and the bank experienced explosive growth as did Richmond.[6][7] Over 70,000 new residents were attracted to the city largely to the Richmond Kaiser Shipyards and other World War II home front industries (see Rosie the Riveter National Park).[6]
Mechanics Bank created the first personal, automobile and appliance loans in Northern California in addition to the first drive-in banking operation.[6] From 1941 to 1945, the bank more than quadrupled in size.[6]
Expansion[edit]
E.M. Downer III became president in 1971.[6][9] In 1980, the Bank moved its headquarters to the Hilltop neighborhood of Richmond, California.[6] In 1990 the bank began expanding outside of Western Contra Costa County, adding offices in Walnut Creek, Pleasant Hill, Concord, Oakland, Marin County, and Napa Valley.[6] This was followed by later additions of Mechanics Bank offices in San Francisco, El Dorado Hills, Elk Grove, Roseville, and Lafayette. In 1995 the bank reached 1 billion dollars in assets.[9] In 2009 during the global financial crisis the bank refused 60 million dollars in bailout money (TARP).[2] The bank is currently remodeling all of its retail locations to be LEED certified as part of an effort to "go green".[10] In 2010, Dianne Daiss Felton (D.D.), the great granddaughter of E.M. Downer was named Chairman of the Board. At the same time, E.M Downer's great grandson, E. Michael Downer, was named Vice Chairman of the Board and E.M. Downer III (Eddie) was named Chairman Emeritus.
In September 2014 Texas billionaire Gerald J Ford disclosed a tender offer to buy 51% of the bank.[11]

Mechanics Bank HQ, Walnut Creek


Mechanics Bank is a community banking financial institution headquartered in Walnut Creek, California[1][2] It was founded in 1905 and serves markets in Northern California. It operates in the San Francisco Bay and Sacramento areas. The bank has over $3.5[3] billion[4] in assets and over 500 associates[5] at 30 retail branches.[6]

Background[edit]
Mechanics Bank was originally chartered as The Iverson Bank and Trust Company, founded in Richmond in 1905. It was renamed as The Mechanics Bank in 1907. Shortly after it was renamed, Edward M. Downer joined the organization, and by 1919 he had purchased a controlling interest and soon became president.
E.M. Downer (1869–1938) was a prominent official in the town of Pinole who created the "Bank of Pinole", the precursor to Mechanics Bank.[7] In 1889 at the age of 20 E.M. Downer was appointed as Transfer Agent and Telegrapher for Southern Pacific Railroad's Pinole Depot railroad station.[7] The depot became the town hub and he subsequently opened a laundromat and started the The Pinole Weekly Times newspaper.[7] Later the depot was selected as the location for the infant city's first post office and Downer became the first postmaster.[7] After the community incorporated in 1903 he became the first city clerk and afterwards mayor.[7]
The beginnings of the bank were in 1905 when E.M. Downer began offering financial services to his acquaintances from a floor safe in his office.[7] This was a great convenience to the residents because the closest bank at the time was at the Contra Costa County seat at Martinez, 13 miles (21 km) away.[7] In 1915 he became second vice president and later, in 1919 after purchasing a controlling interest, he became president until his death in 1938.[7] He was succeed by his son E.M. Downer, Jr. in 1939 who served as president until 1978.[8]
Early years[edit]
After starting the Bank of Pinole in 1905, E.M. Downer joined Mechanics Bank in Richmond. The Downer family has led Mechanics Bank through most of its history, starting with E. M. Downer who ran the Bank through the 1920s boom years when Richmond was a major West Coast industrial center.[6] Mechanics Bank served Standard Oil, Santa Fe Railroad, the Ford Motor Company and their employees during this period.[6][7] Downer also successfully led the bank through the Great Depression while many other banks succumbed.[6][7]
In 1939, E.M. Downer, Jr. became president. During World War II Richmond became a major hub of industrial and shipping activities and the bank experienced explosive growth as did Richmond.[6][7] Over 70,000 new residents were attracted to the city largely to the Richmond Kaiser Shipyards and other World War II home front industries (see Rosie the Riveter National Park).[6]
Mechanics Bank created the first personal, automobile and appliance loans in Northern California in addition to the first drive-in banking operation.[6] From 1941 to 1945, the bank more than quadrupled in size.[6]
Expansion[edit]
E.M. Downer III became president in 1971.[6][9] In 1980, the Bank moved its headquarters to the Hilltop neighborhood of Richmond, California.[6] In 1990 the bank began expanding outside of Western Contra Costa County, adding offices in Walnut Creek, Pleasant Hill, Concord, Oakland, Marin County, and Napa Valley.[6] This was followed by later additions of Mechanics Bank offices in San Francisco, El Dorado Hills, Elk Grove, Roseville, and Lafayette. In 1995 the bank reached 1 billion dollars in assets.[9] In 2009 during the global financial crisis the bank refused 60 million dollars in bailout money (TARP).[2] The bank is currently remodeling all of its retail locations to be LEED certified as part of an effort to "go green".[10] In 2010, Dianne Daiss Felton (D.D.), the great granddaughter of E.M. Downer was named Chairman of the Board. At the same time, E.M Downer's great grandson, E. Michael Downer, was named Vice Chairman of the Board and E.M. Downer III (Eddie) was named Chairman Emeritus.
In September 2014 Texas billionaire Gerald J Ford disclosed a tender offer to buy 51% of the bank.[11]

Mechanics Bank HQ, Walnut Creek


Mechanics Bank is a community banking financial institution headquartered in Walnut Creek, California[1][2] It was founded in 1905 and serves markets in Northern California. It operates in the San Francisco Bay and Sacramento areas. The bank has over $3.5[3] billion[4] in assets and over 500 associates[5] at 30 retail branches.[6]

Background[edit]
Mechanics Bank was originally chartered as The Iverson Bank and Trust Company, founded in Richmond in 1905. It was renamed as The Mechanics Bank in 1907. Shortly after it was renamed, Edward M. Downer joined the organization, and by 1919 he had purchased a controlling interest and soon became president.
E.M. Downer (1869–1938) was a prominent official in the town of Pinole who created the "Bank of Pinole", the precursor to Mechanics Bank.[7] In 1889 at the age of 20 E.M. Downer was appointed as Transfer Agent and Telegrapher for Southern Pacific Railroad's Pinole Depot railroad station.[7] The depot became the town hub and he subsequently opened a laundromat and started the The Pinole Weekly Times newspaper.[7] Later the depot was selected as the location for the infant city's first post office and Downer became the first postmaster.[7] After the community incorporated in 1903 he became the first city clerk and afterwards mayor.[7]
The beginnings of the bank were in 1905 when E.M. Downer began offering financial services to his acquaintances from a floor safe in his office.[7] This was a great convenience to the residents because the closest bank at the time was at the Contra Costa County seat at Martinez, 13 miles (21 km) away.[7] In 1915 he became second vice president and later, in 1919 after purchasing a controlling interest, he became president until his death in 1938.[7] He was succeed by his son E.M. Downer, Jr. in 1939 who served as president until 1978.[8]
Early years[edit]
After starting the Bank of Pinole in 1905, E.M. Downer joined Mechanics Bank in Richmond. The Downer family has led Mechanics Bank through most of its history, starting with E. M. Downer who ran the Bank through the 1920s boom years when Richmond was a major West Coast industrial center.[6] Mechanics Bank served Standard Oil, Santa Fe Railroad, the Ford Motor Company and their employees during this period.[6][7] Downer also successfully led the bank through the Great Depression while many other banks succumbed.[6][7]
In 1939, E.M. Downer, Jr. became president. During World War II Richmond became a major hub of industrial and shipping activities and the bank experienced explosive growth as did Richmond.[6][7] Over 70,000 new residents were attracted to the city largely to the Richmond Kaiser Shipyards and other World War II home front industries (see Rosie the Riveter National Park).[6]
Mechanics Bank created the first personal, automobile and appliance loans in Northern California in addition to the first drive-in banking operation.[6] From 1941 to 1945, the bank more than quadrupled in size.[6]
Expansion[edit]
E.M. Downer III became president in 1971.[6][9] In 1980, the Bank moved its headquarters to the Hilltop neighborhood of Richmond, California.[6] In 1990 the bank began expanding outside of Western Contra Costa County, adding offices in Walnut Creek, Pleasant Hill, Concord, Oakland, Marin County, and Napa Valley.[6] This was followed by later additions of Mechanics Bank offices in San Francisco, El Dorado Hills, Elk Grove, Roseville, and Lafayette. In 1995 the bank reached 1 billion dollars in assets.[9] In 2009 during the global financial crisis the bank refused 60 million dollars in bailout money (TARP).[2] The bank is currently remodeling all of its retail locations to be LEED certified as part of an effort to "go green".[10] In 2010, Dianne Daiss Felton (D.D.), the great granddaughter of E.M. Downer was named Chairman of the Board. At the same time, E.M Downer's great grandson, E. Michael Downer, was named Vice Chairman of the Board and E.M. Downer III (Eddie) was named Chairman Emeritus.
In September 2014 Texas billionaire Gerald J Ford disclosed a tender offer to buy 51% of the bank.[11]

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
