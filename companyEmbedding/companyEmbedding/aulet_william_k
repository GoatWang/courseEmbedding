Martin Trust Center Staff - Bill Aulet

























































 





 

Bill AuletManaging Director; Professor of the Practice, MIT Sloan School of ManagementBill Aulet is the Managing Director of the Martin Trust Center for MIT Entrepreneurship and also a Professor of the Practice at the MIT Sloan School of Management. The Center is responsible for entrepreneurship across all five schools at MIT starting with education but also extending well outside the class room with student clubs, conferences, competitions, networking events, awards, hackathons, student trips, and accelerators.
Bill teaches numerous classes each semester (introductory to advanced entrepreneurship courses) in addition to his responsibilities of running the Center. His work has won numerous awards including the Adolf F. Monosson Prize for Entrepreneurial Mentoring at MIT.
During his time running  the Center, Bill has conceived, designed, and overseen the implementation of many new innovative programs including: the MIT Clean Energy Prize, Trust Center TV, Energy Ventures Class, Regional Entrepreneurship Acceleration Program (REAP), MIT Entrepreneurship Review, Entrepreneurial Product Marketing and Development Class, Linked Data Ventures Class, Founders Skills Accelerator, t=0 Entrepreneurship Festival, Beehive Cooperative, Entrepreneurs Walk of Fame, Corporate Innovators Sponsor Group, Applications of Advanced Entrepreneurial Techniques (GSD Ninjas), and Global Founders’ Skills Accelerator.
Prior to joining MIT, Bill had a 25-year track record of success in business himself. He has directly raised more than $100 million in funding for his companies and more importantly has led to the creation of hundreds of millions of dollars in market value in those companies.
Bill started his career at IBM getting training and experience in technical, marketing, sales, financial, and international business operations and management. After 11 years, he was named an MIT Sloan Fellow which resulted in him attending MIT for a one-year degree program. Upon graduation, he resigned from IBM and became a serial entrepreneur running two MIT spinouts as the president/chief executive officer (Cambridge Decision Dynamics and then SensAble Technologies). The latter became a two-time Inc. Magazine 500 Fastest-Growing Private Company. With a presence in over 20 countries, SensAble also won more than 24 awards and was featured in Fortune Magazine, BusinessWeek, The Wall Street Journal, and many other publications for its innovative products and strong business foundation.
In 2003, he was recruited as chief financial officer to co-lead a turnaround of Viisage Technology, a security technology company with a dual focus in the areas of drivers’ licenses and facial recognition. During his tenure of two and a half years, Viisage developed a new strategy, overhauled its operations, made three major acquisitions, executed two major fundraising rounds, and, as a result, its market value increased from $50 million to over $500 million.
Today, in addition to his work at MIT, Bill works with individuals and companies to become more successful through innovation-driven entrepreneurship. From single entrepreneurs trying to launch new ventures all the way up to large multi-billion dollar corporations seeking to achieve their goals through entrepreneurship, intrapreneurship, and innovation. He also serves on the board of directors or advisors for a number of companies. He is a regularly featured speaker at management leadership programs on topics such as entrepreneurship, intrapreneurship, entrepreneurial marketing, technology innovation, creating sustainable and rapid profitable growth, financing strategies, and operational excellence.

Bill Aulet Named MD of MIT Entrepreneurship Center


March 22, 2010
By PEHub Administrator






Bill Aulet has been named managing director of the MIT Entrepreneurship Center. He had been acting managing director, and serves as a senior lecturer at MIT Sloan School of Management.
PRESS RELEASE
William K. Aulet, senior lecturer at the MIT Sloan School of Management and acting managing director of the MIT Entrepreneurship Center, has been appointed managing director at the Center. Aulet brings 25 years of experience in technology and business operations to the position as well as experience raising $100 million in institutional financing via private placements and public offerings. After starting his career at IBM, he ran two private companies, Cambridge Decision Dynamics and SensAble Technologies, before helping Viisage Technology achieve a dramatic turnaround as its chief financial officer.
David Schmittlein, dean of MIT Sloan, said, “Entrepreneurship is an integral part of the culture and curriculum at MIT. It inspires new ideas, business models, and technologies that lead to innovation and economic growth. With his depth of experience and dedication to entrepreneurship, Bill Aulet will be a great asset to the Center as it continues to develop and support MIT’s many entrepreneurial programs and activities.”
The MIT Entrepreneurship Center fosters innovation by bringing students and faculty from different disciplines across campus together in pursuit of new technologies and high-tech ventures. The Center’s team educates and develops leaders by offering best-in-class educational courses and executive programs supported by MIT’s leading-edge technology and business research. It facilitates business and technology partnerships by combining academic research with practical experience and cultivates a network that unifies academic, government, and industry leaders around the vision of entrepreneurial success. 





For the past several years, Aulet has served as an entrepreneur-in-residence at the Center, teaching and working with students and start-ups. With a strong interest in energy, he conceived, developed, and teaches a graduate class called “Energy Ventures” as well as “Special Opportunities in Energy Entrepreneurship: Natural Gas.” Aulet also created the MIT Energy Prize and serves as chairman of that competition.
His work has been recognized with numerous awards. Most recently, MIT was named the top university in the U.S. for Clean Energy Entrepreneurship & Commercialization (http://cleantech.com/news/5384/top-10-cleantech-universities-us). He also writes on the topic for Xconomy.com and consults for large and small companies in the field. Aulet has taught workshops for corporate, government, and nonprofit groups on innovation, entrepreneurship and corporate venture capital. In addition to serving on the Review Board for Entrepreneurship Grants for the U.S. Department of Energy, Aulet serves on the board of a number of private companies.
Aulet, who earned his undergraduate degree with honors in engineering from Harvard University, also holds a Master of Science degree from MIT’s Sloan School of Management, where he was a member of the MIT Sloan Fellows Program. A former professional basketball player, he lives in Belmont, Mass. with his wife and four sons. 





MIT Sloan Professor Edward Roberts, founder and chair of the MIT Entrepreneurship Center, said, “Aulet brings a wonderful combination of practical experience, enthusiastic and effective teaching and mentoring, and a host of new ambitious ideas to entrepreneurship at MIT. We welcome his continuation of leadership of our activities and programs.”
About MIT Sloan School of Management

Do Innovation Ecosystems Need Higher Education?






By Bill Aulet

































In my role at the head of the MIT Entrepreneurship Center, I have the great opportunity, at times, to travel the world and learn about entrepreneurship on a global scale, and to gain knowledge and perspective to help us be more effective in our mission at home. This past week was such an experience.
There is an underlying assumption that to have an innovation-based entrepreneurial ecosystem, there has to be an "MIT-like" anchor university in the ecosystem (Technion in Israel, Stanford in Silicon Valley, IIT in India). The presence of such an institution that attracts, trains, and continually feeds skilled and talented workers into the ecosystem makes perfect sense.
What if I told you of a place where there is a growing and vibrant IT entrepreneurial community, and yet it is in a country that lacks a single university in the top 500 in the world? This is exactly what I found in Romania these past few days.
As I met dynamic entrepreneurs and heard stories of their friends, a pattern emerged. Most have never studied computer science at a university; they said they did have time to do so, and that it was better to get real experience (some did not even graduate from high school). Romania is a poor country, but it is also an industrious and diverse society (both of which are important). Since people don't have much and life is hard, they have to be creative to get by and get ahead. Necessity is the mother of invention and, in this case, entrepreneurship.
There is also optimism in the air, partly a result of Romania joining the EU four years ago. That is helpful, but for now let's focus instead on the "adjita" (an Italian-American word for stomach agitation) driving things in this situation. The Romanians are learning programming without formal institutions to train them, which seems perfectly natural to them. They are driven and they have no choice. They note that Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, and Mark Zuckerberg didn't graduate from college, either (Not a great analogy, but that's how they see it). In my recent travels I have also found thriving, robust entrepreneurship in Scotland and Finland as well. Interestingly, if you ask people in any of these three countries if they are good at = entrepreneurship, their answer is "Oh, no." This very humility and scrappiness is what makes these regional groups have a higher propensity for entrepreneurship than their counterparts in, say, Germany, Russia, England, France, or Spain.
Should this surprise us?
Not really, because here in the United States, the studies of MIT professor Ed Roberts show that immigrants are more likely to start companies than more comfortable, long-term American residents.
As Eva Peron, who rose from the lowest levels of Argentine society and power to the very top, is described by narrator Che Guevarra in the immortalizing musical and film 'Evita', "Eva Peron had every disadvantage you need if you're going to succeed. No money, no cash, no father, no bright light."
So the moral of the Romanian tale is to reinforce a point made in an earlier article, that while other factors like the presence of a world class research institute close to MIT's caliber is extremely valuable, never underestimate the importance of culture in creation of an entrepreneurial ecosystem. In descriptions of such a culture, you should not see the words like "comfortable ---you should see words synonymous with scrappy. Just remember Evita.
[Note: Special thanks to my colleague Howard Anderson at the MIT Sloan School of Management with whom I discussed this topic and who also first pointed out the "Evita" quote].

William K. Aulet, senior lecturer at the MIT Sloan School of Management and acting managing director of the MIT Entrepreneurship Center, has been appointed managing director at the Center. Aulet brings 25 years of experience in technology and business operations to the position as well as experience raising $100 million in institutional financing via private placements and public offerings. After starting his career at IBM, he ran two private companies, Cambridge Decision Dynamics and SensAble Technologies, before helping Viisage Technology achieve a dramatic turnaround as its chief financial officer. 
David Schmittlein, dean of MIT Sloan, said, “Entrepreneurship is an integral part of the culture and curriculum at MIT. It inspires new ideas, business models and technologies that lead to innovation and economic growth. With his depth of experience and dedication to entrepreneurship, Bill Aulet will be a great asset to the Center as it continues to develop and support MIT’s many entrepreneurial programs and activities.” 
The MIT Entrepreneurship Center fosters innovation by bringing students and faculty from different disciplines across campus together in pursuit of new technologies and high-tech ventures. The center’s team educates and develops leaders by offering best-in-class educational courses and executive programs supported by MIT’s leading-edge technology and business research. It facilitates business and technology partnerships by combining academic research with practical experience and cultivates a network that unifies academic, government, and industry leaders around the vision of entrepreneurial success. 
 For the past several years, Aulet has served as an entrepreneur-in-residence at the center, teaching and working with students and start-ups. With a strong interest in energy, he conceived, developed and teaches a graduate class called “Energy Ventures” as well as “Special Opportunities in Energy Entrepreneurship: Natural Gas.” Aulet also created the MIT Energy Prize and serves as chairman of that competition.
His work has been recognized with numerous awards. Most recently, MIT was named the top university in the U.S. for Clean Energy Entrepreneurship & Commercialization (http://cleantech.com/news/5384/top-10-cleantech-universities-us). He also writes on the topic for Xconomy.com and consults for large and small companies in the field. Aulet has taught workshops for corporate, government, and non-profit groups on innovation, entrepreneurship and corporate venture capital. In addition to serving on the Review Board for Entrepreneurship Grants for the U.S. Department of Energy, Aulet serves on the board of a number of private companies. 
Aulet, who earned his undergraduate degree with honors in engineering from Harvard University, also holds an SM from MIT Sloan, where he was a member of the MIT Sloan Fellows Program. A former professional basketball player, he lives in Belmont, Mass., with his wife and four sons.
MIT Sloan Professor Edward Roberts, founder and chair of the MIT Entrepreneurship Center, said, “Aulet brings a wonderful combination of practical experience, enthusiastic and effective teaching and mentoring, and a host of new ambitious ideas to entrepreneurship at MIT. We welcome his continuation of leadership of our activities and programs.”
