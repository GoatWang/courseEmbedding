Katz Teller litigator Peter O’Shea grew up in Greater Cincinnati, and when it came time to pick a college, a law school, a judicial clerkship and a law firm, he didn’t travel far.  While those local ties may be helpful at any firm, they are especially important at a firm as connected to Greater Cincinnati as Katz Teller.

Although Peter has been educated and employed locally, no one would accuse him of being provincial.  Between graduating from Thomas More College and starting law school at the University of Cincinnati College of Law, Peter volunteered for the Peace Corps in the Republic of Moldova.  During his time abroad, Peter taught English to local students, conducted workshops on American culture and customs, and coached basketball and Model United Nations teams. 

After graduating from law school in 2010, Peter served as a judicial clerk for Judge David L. Bunning of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky in Covington.  His first private sector position in Cincinnati was with Taft, Stettinus & Hollister, LLP, where he represented clients in all phases of commercial litigation, including matters involving contractual disputes, insurance coverage, and antitrust law.

Peter joined Katz Teller in March 2014.  He handles all business disputes on both the plaintiff and the defense side, providing strategic advice and representation in litigation, mediation, or arbitration proceedings.

Item Description: Strategic Book Publishing Rights Agency, LLC, United States, 2010. Paperback. Book Condition: New. Language: English . Brand New Book ***** Print on Demand *****. In mid-19th-century Australia, like its counterparts in California and Chile, there was a focus on the rush for gold. Given the sobriquet diggers, men arrived in the tens of thousands from all points of the globe. In often remote bush settings, makeshift towns quickly sprouted in the foothills, valleys, and plateaus leading to the Blue Mountains and the Australian Alps. Focusing on the counterplay with this influx of fortune seekers, there also emerged a nascent global entertainment industry. Champagne from Six to Six is a short history of the pastimes of these diggers on the gold fields at Beechworth and the Ovens of northeast Victoria. This illustrated text, based on eyewitness accounts, newspaper reports, and histories written on this period, gives a lively recreation of what were initially the findings of an academic research project, now available to readers everywhere. Music, dance, sports, theater, opera, magic shows, trapeze artists, wax works, the circus, and even the first types of moving pictures toured these diggings Author Peter M. Shea followed the adage Go West, young man, go West and now, an aspiring Gentleman of Leisure Patron of the Arts, he appreciates good food, fine music, and wines (champagne, of course!). He currently lives between the West Coast of California and Melbourne, Australia. He is working on a number of projects, one of which is a book with the preliminary title, Before I Become Invisible - Pastiches of a Fortunate Life.  Bookseller Inventory # AAV9781609112431
