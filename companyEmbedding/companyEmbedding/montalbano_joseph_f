Back to Gallery
















Sadie Montalbano, for 66 years an owner of Montalbano Lumber in Houston and a devoted translator for Italian patients at the Texas Medical Center, died Thursday in her Houston home. She was 97.
For 61 of those years, she ran the business with her husband, Joseph F. Montalbano. His father, Francesco Montalbano, an Italian immigrant, founded the business 108 years ago on Houston Avenue. It is still operating there and on North Shepherd.



"Her family came first," said her son, John Montalbano, vice president of the company. "She made sure everyone in the family was provided for. In the store, she demanded that anybody who came to do business was treated with respect and immediate attention. Personalized service — she was very high on that."
Her son said that few women were working in that industry when his mother began working at the store.
"She was one of the first," he said. "She kept up with the trends in the lumber business. She was very knowledgeable."

Sadie Montalbano also was a Lady Commander of the Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem, a chivalric order founded at the time of the First Crusade.
Helping immigrants

Montalbano's volunteer work at the medical center began in the early 1970s after a friend encountered two Italian women who had just arrived at 
Hobby Airport
 from Italy and needed help getting to the medical center.

"They had no English, didn't know where the medical center was and how to get there," said John Montalbano. "The friend called my mother, who came and got them settled in the hospital and helped with the translation."
This began an effort that over the years smoothed the way for more than 400 Italians who came for treatment at the medical center.
Sadie Louise Butera Montalbano was born in Houston in 1910. Her parents, Louise and Mike Butera, were members of a family that for decades has operated groceries in Houston.
When Francesco Montalbano arrived at Ellis Island in New York City in the 1890s, officials asked him about his previous work experience. In his limited English, he managed to say "mill" because he had worked in a flour mill in Italy, said John Montalbano.
Thinking that Francesco was trying to say "sawmill," the officials directed him to the pine forests of East Texas, Montalbano said. For a while, he worked in a sawmill in Diboll in Angelina County.
"He stayed there long enough to save enough money to come to Houston, where he started a very small business," Montalbano said.
Francesco's son, Joseph Montalbano, married Sadie Butera in 1929. Joseph died in 2004.
Survivors, all of Houston, include two sons and three daughters-in-law, Michael J. and Vita Jean Sedita Montalbano and John J. and Angela Mascari Montalbano, and Mary Anna Todaro Montalbano; sisters, Antoinette "Donia" Mazzola and Katherine Pinto; a sister-in-law, Nellie Butera; and special friend Mary Sue Petty.
Mass is scheduled for 10 a.m. today at St. Michael Catholic Church, 1801 Sage. Burial will be in Glenwood Cemetery, 2424 Washington.
