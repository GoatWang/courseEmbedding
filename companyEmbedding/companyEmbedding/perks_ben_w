B.  The Executive desires to be employed by the Company in such positions upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement.                                      AGREEMENT             NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises and mutual covenants contained herein and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:   1.
