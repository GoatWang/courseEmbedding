JOIN THE LISTClickFIND A STOREForensic Dna Typing: Biology & Technology Behind Str Markersby Butler, John M.Forensic DNA Typing  focuses on the biology and technology behind short tandem repeat (STR) markers and the most common forensic DNA analysis method used today.  This comprehensive handbook will help forensic scientists gain a better understanding of STRs and the procedures needed to properly analyze them, while helping professionals in the law enforcement and legal communities comprehend the complexities of DNA profiling. It will also help laboratories meet the training requirements in the new DNA Advisory Board Quality Assurance Standards.  The first few chapters of  Forensic DNA Typing  provide a thorough introduction to the topic for readers who might be less familiar with DNA, while providing a useful review for more advanced readers. It goes on to cover new genetic markers and information on rapidly changing technologies to help professionals make accurate identifications through DNA typing. Detailed illustrations and examples are used throughout.  The book concludes with reviews of the DNA testing performed in high-profile cases such as the O.J. Simpson trial, the President Clinton-Monica Lewinsky affair, the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, the Thomas Jefferson-Sally Hemings family controversy, and others.  John Butler has been involved in the validation of the short tandem repeat markers that form the basis of the FBI's nationwide DNA database, CODIS, and in the development of new and innovative technologies.  His talent for explaining complex information is apparent in the clear organization, illustrations, and straightforward language of this text.  Forensic DNA Typing  has already established itself as the standard reference in the field.Key Benefits: * Chapters cover the topic from introductory level right up to "cutting edge" research * Forensic scientists learn about the new methods and technologies required by STR typing * DNA laboratories find out how to meet the training requirements of the DNA Advisory Board Quality Assurance Standards (listed in Appendix III) * Lawyers and law enforcement professionals understand the science behind the techniques * All readers can use the information listed on suppliers of DNA analysis equipment, products and servicesForensic Medicine, Biotechnology, Genetics & GenomicsCondition: Used - GoodHPB condition ratingsNew: Item is brand new, unused and unmarked, in flawless condition.Fine/Like New (F): No defects, little usage.

Early Brand History



We have always had a commitment to dentistry and to good oral health care both for the dental professional and the consumer. We have a history of excellent oral care products around the world.
 
Since our founding in 1923, Sunstar Americas, Inc. has been a respected leader in the design, manufacture and distribution of breakthrough oral health care products of the highest quality. We continue to take an active role in the worldwide advancement of oral health and dental care, including:

Educating dental professionals about the link between oral and systemic health
Sponsoring and supporting the work of professional organizations
Investing in research and development of clinically superior dental care products

Sunstar works with clinicians, academics and scientific researchers to design manufacture and distribute innovative, high quality oral health care products. As our understanding of oral health and its relationship with systemic health has grown over time, Sunstar continues its founders’ philosophy of working with clinical, academic and scientific leaders to commercialize clinically relevant, scientifically sound products. Sunstar works with professional dental associations to support the distribution of Continuing Education resources – bringing continuously updated ‘best practice’ information to dentists and allied dental professionals.
 
Dr. John O. Butler, a periodontist from Chicago, started the Company in 1923 with the introduction of a 2-row, 12 tuft, wide-handled toothbrush that answered the specific need of dental professionals for a fine quality toothbrush that met oral hygiene requirements. Toothbrushes at that time were too large and bulky to reach all the way to the back of the mouth. They were made in various shapes and sizes designed mostly for appearance rather than for any scientific reason.
 
Adhering to a basic philosophy of research and development in preventive dentistry, Butler remained virtually a one-man business -- Dr. Butler did all the selling, administration, and educating himself. The success of his design was demonstrated by the fact that competitors developed similar designs and challenged his market position within 10 years after he began. However, the strength of Dr. Butler's integrity, innovation, and quality reputation allowed the company to thrive.
 
While Dr. Butler's philosophy of preventive dentistry gained acceptance, another individual began research into the correlation of oral cleanliness and dental disease. Dr. Charles C. Bass, a physician and Dean of Tulane University Medical School, began studying dental diseases upon his retirement in 1940. He substantiated the theory that oral hygiene was related to dental caries (decay) and periodontal (gum) disease. Dr. Bass also designed the "Right Kind" toothbrush and gave The John O. Butler Company exclusive rights to market it. This product is still offered today.
 
Dr. Butler sold the company to an investment group in 1949 and they expanded the business, adding new products, a field sales force, penetration in the retail market, and overseas operations or distributors in over 50 foreign countries.
 
In 1988, Sunstar, Inc., a leading Japanese manufacturer of health-related consumer products took ownership of the company. Sunstar's strength and experience in manufacturing, research, and development have enhanced the company’s ability to grow and prosper. The company was renamed Sunstar Americas, Inc., and continues to use its well-known brand names GUM® and Butler® for all its products.
 
Today, Sunstar Americas, Inc. employs over 600 people worldwide. In addition to its U.S. headquarters in Schaumburg, Illinois, it has operations Canada, Mexico, and Argentina.
 
The future for professional and consumer oral care is very bright, as awareness of the importance of good oral hygiene continues to increase worldwide. Technological advances in oral care are growing at an accelerated rate and Sunstar is well positioned for this global growth with high brand recognition and a solid reputation.
 
Leading Product Innovations
The founder of the company, Dr. John O. Butler, was committed to designing products that would conform to the highest professional standards and oral hygiene requirements. Dr. Butler's original concept of product innovation and complete dedication to the dental profession still prevails at Sunstar Americas, Inc. today. That is why the Company has provided the dental profession with innovations to help their patients. Some of the company's earlier product innovations include:
 
1. Original 2-row toothbrush: Dr. Butler designed the original brush with a bone handle and natural bristles that had a straight trim.
 
2. Velvet-tip™, sanitized nylon: The term "velvet-tip™" was introduced by Dr. Butler many years ago when he realized the damage that could be done by an untreated, cut nylon bristle. We believe he was the first to treat bristle ends, using a rounding and tapering process that allowed each bristle to better fit in the narrow sulcus.
 
3. Round rubber-tip stimulator: Rather than triangular rubber tips found on most toothbrushes of that time, Dr. Butler placed a round tip on the brush because it scientifically gave better and more gentle contact to the interdental area.
 
4. Disclosing tablets: A disclosant tablet that eliminated the mess associated with liquid disclosants.
 
5. Colored handles: Dr. Butler switched from bone to plastic handles, originating the idea of colored handles so each member of the family could identify their own toothbrush.
 
6. Dome trim on #411 GUM® brush: Careful research confirmed that toothbrush bristles, when placed at a 45-degree angle against the tooth (Bass brushing technique), bunch together and interfere with the penetration of the bristle under the gumline and between the teeth. Sunstar Americas, Inc. minimized this bunching by trimming the bristles in a patented dome shape, which varies the length of the bristles. This benefit has been clinically proven.
 
7. The Proxabrush System interdental cleaners: The Proxabrush System was invented by a dentist at the University of Alabama who licensed it to the Sunstar Americas, Inc. to improve and promote it. The original handle was metal. Sunstar Americas, Inc. has expanded the use of interdental cleaners by introducing the first double-ended handle and the no-load Proxabrush® Trav-Ler®, adding the popular #612 tight brush refill, and coating the wire core with nylon to reduce galvanic sensitivity.
 
8. End-tuft toothbrush: Dentists told Sunstar Americas, Inc. that twisted teeth and bridges were difficult to clean with a standard toothbrush so two new end-tuft brushes were designed with the small brush head specifications that were requested.
 
9. Water soluble wax on dental floss: Paraffin wax has been added to floss by manufacturers to minimize shredding and add strength. However, wax greatly reduced the spreadability of floss which picks up plaque. Sunstar Americas, Inc. engineered a water soluble wax so the floss had strength to get between teeth without shredding, yet spread during use when it contacted saliva on the tooth surface.
 
10.  EEZ-Thru® Floss Threaders: 
This flexible nylon loop, patented by Sunstar Americas, Inc., made it possible to thread dental floss in small spaces where floss and toothbrush bristles could not fit, such as under bridges and orthodontic wires.
 
11. PostCare™ flossing aid for implants: PostCare™ was designed by a dental hygienist with an extensive background in dental implants, when she realized her patients lacked an effective means for cleaning them without scratching the metal posts. Recognizing Sunstar Americas, Inc. commitment to dentistry, she made the design available in a regular and thin braided cord for the Company to manufacture and promote.

Description


Fundamentals of Forensic DNA Typing is written with a broad viewpoint. It examines the methods of current forensic DNA typing, focusing on short tandem repeats (STRs). It encompasses current forensic DNA analysis methods, as well as biology, technology and genetic interpretation. 
              This book reviews the methods of forensic DNA testing used in the first two decades since early 1980’s, and it offers perspectives on future trends in this field, including new genetic markers and new technologies. Furthermore, it explains the process of DNA testing from collection of samples through DNA extraction, DNA quantitation, DNA amplification, and statistical interpretation. The book also discusses DNA databases, which play an important role in law enforcement investigations.  In addition, there is a discussion about ethical concerns in retaining DNA profiles and the issues involved when people use a database to search for close relatives.Students of forensic DNA analysis, forensic scientists, and members of the law enforcement and legal professions who want to know more about STR typing will find this book invaluable. 




Key Features



Includes a glossary with over 400 terms for quick reference of unfamiliar terms as well as an acronym guide to decipher the DNA dialect
Continues in the style of Forensic DNA Typing, 2e, with high-profile cases addressed in D.N.A.Boxes-- "Data, Notes & Applications" sections throughout
Ancillaries include: instructor manual Web site, with tailored set of 1000+ PowerPoint slides (including figures), links to online training websites and a test bank with key





Readership

Reviews


"There is perhaps no individual better suited to author a foundational survey of forensic DNA typing than John Butler. As with past editions, Butler’s knowledge, along with his organizational and communication skills make Fundamentals of Forensic DNA Typing a must read for students, forensic practitioners and trial attorneys. This text provides the reader with insightful and understandable explanations necessary to comprehend the underpinnings of forensic DNA analysis. It continues in the tradition of its predecessors as the premier textbook on the forensic DNA subject."- Richard Saferstein, Ph.D. Author and Forensic Science Consultant
"When ScienceWatch.com, a Thomson Reuters web resource for measuring and analyzing science trends, recently listed the most influential institutions and researchers in forensic science based on journal citations, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and one of its researchers, John Butler, were among the leaders."--ThomasNet.com
"Intended as the companion to the 2010 publication, Fundamentals of Forensic DNA Typing, this title contains 18 chapters with four appendices providing up-to-date coverage of essential topics in the field of DNA analysis. The book includes new information on DNA databases, low-level DNA, and validation; a comprehensive listing of alleles for the 23 STR loci present in commercial kits, and coverage of familial searching."--Evidence Technology Magazine, July-August 2012, page 4
