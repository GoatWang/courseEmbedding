However, these hits represent less than 18,000 investigations that have been CODIS-assisted in an average year—less than 1% of annual violent and property crimes.

NetBio Announces its DNAscan System is the First and Only Rapid DNA Product to Earn NDIS Approval from the FBI | Business Wire
























































      NetBio Announces its DNAscan System is the First and Only Rapid 
      DNA Product to Earn NDIS Approval from the FBI
    



Approval represents major step toward widespread adoption of Rapid 
      DNA analysis with potential to transform the use of DNA in criminal 
      justice






April 07, 2016 07:30 AM Eastern Daylight Time



WALTHAM, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--NetBio 
      announced today that its DNAscan™ Rapid DNA Analysis™ System has 
      received National DNA Index System (NDIS) approval from the Federal 
      Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The approval allows accredited NDIS 
      laboratories to upload DNA samples processed by DNAscan and match them 
      against DNA profiles associated with the FBI’s Combined DNA Index System 
      (CODIS) program, without manual interpretation or technical review. The 
      FBI’s CODIS software is used to support criminal justice DNA databases 
      and to operate NDIS. This represents the FBI’s first and only approval 
      of a fully automated system for “swab in, profile out” Rapid DNA 
      analysis.
    


      Rapid DNA analysis technology accelerates the process of DNA profile 
      generation from days, weeks, or even months to less than 90 minutes. The 
      revolutionary technology can be used to quickly enroll qualifying 
      offenders in NDIS, help generate and confirm investigative leads, and 
      exonerate the innocent. Because it allows DNA samples to be processed 
      outside of the existing laboratory workflow, Rapid DNA technology 
      empowers labs to focus resources on more complicated DNA sample analyses 
      and to help reduce sample backlogs.
    

      A comprehensive developmental validation study evaluated the DNAscan 
      System’s overall process – from inserting swabs to profile generation, 
      including the instrument, BioChipSet™ Cassette, STR chemistry, and data 
      interpretation by the on-board Expert System Software. The forensic 
      science community expects this validation process to be undertaken for 
      any new scientific technology introduced in the criminal justice system. 
      More than 2,000 samples were tested by leading forensic laboratories, 
      and the DNAscan System successfully produced accurate, reliable, 
      reproducible, and robust results without manual processing.
    

      Ed Davis, former Commissioner of the Boston Police Department and member 
      of NetBio’s Board of Directors commented: “A critical role of accredited 
      CODIS laboratories is to evaluate new technology to ensure it adheres to 
      federal and state standards prior to implementation. Since DNAscan is 
      the first Rapid DNA instrument to be considered for NDIS approval, it 
      was important to make sure the study design was objective and robust. 
      This approval represents many years of hard work on the part of both 
      NetBio and federal and state law enforcement agencies. Approval for 
      accredited NDIS laboratory use is a critical first step, and I look 
      forward to the day when Rapid DNA analysis is an integral part of police 
      station operations to improve public safety. A fully automated Rapid DNA 
      system has the potential to be a game-changing tool for law enforcement.”
    

      “NDIS approval of the DNAscan System is a major milestone here in the 
      United States as well as in the many countries that look to the FBI as a 
      global leader in forensic DNA analysis,” said Richard Selden, CEO of 
      NetBio. “We are thankful for the support and guidance from the FBI, 
      SWGDAM (Scientific Working Group on DNA Analysis Methods), and many 
      forensic laboratories and law enforcement agencies over the years. We 
      have worked closely with our partner in the law enforcement market, GE 
      Healthcare Life Sciences, to ensure that our DNAscan Rapid DNA Analysis 
      System generates results equivalent to those from a forensic laboratory. 
      We believe the DNAscan System has the potential to contribute 
      significantly to a safer society.”
    

About the Developmental Validation


      In addition to NetBio, laboratories participating in the developmental 
      validation of the DNAscan System included:
    

      Alabama Department of Forensic Sciences - http://www.adfs.alabama.govFlorida 
      Department of Law Enforcement - http://www.fdle.state.fl.usMichigan 
      State Police - https://www.michigan.gov/mspDubai 
      Police Crime Laboratory - http://www.dubaipolice.gov.aePennsylvania 
      State Police - http://www.psp.pa.gov


About the FBI’s Rapid DNA Initiative


      The FBI’s 
      Rapid DNA Initiative aims to integrate Rapid DNA instruments 
      effectively within the existing CODIS structure. The FBI is leading the 
      development of the regulatory and policy approach for use of Rapid DNA 
      analysis both in forensic laboratories and during the booking process.
    

About the DNAscan and ANDE Systems


      The DNAscan Rapid DNA Analysis System is a fast and easy-to-use platform 
      developed to enable law enforcement agencies to process DNA samples in 
      less than 90 minutes and accelerate the criminal investigation process. 
      The related ANDE™ Rapid DNA System is a field-forward product designed 
      for operation by non-technical users outside the lab for military and 
      homeland security applications. Articles describing the technical basis 
      of the system (http://www.investigativegenetics.com/content/4/1/16) 
      and the use of a wide range of sample types in the system (http://link.springer.com/article/10.1186%2Fs13323-016-0033-7) 
      have been published in peer-reviewed journals.
