      Acucela Hires Dr. Lukas Scheibler as Executive Vice President of 
      Translational Medicine
    



Dr. Scheibler joins company after 13 years at industry-leading 
      Novartis






August 05, 2015 12:31 PM Eastern Daylight Time



SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Acucela Inc. (TOKYO:4589) (“Acucela” or the “Company”), a clinical-stage 
      biotechnology company that specializes in discovering and developing 
      novel drug candidates to potentially treat and slow the progression of 
      sight-threatening ophthalmic diseases, announced today that it has hired 
      Dr. Lukas Scheibler as Executive Vice President of Translational 
      Medicine.
    


      Dr. Scheibler joins Acucela after a 13-year career in research and 
      development, business development and clinical trial management at 
      Novartis, the world’s largest pharmaceutical company. Dr. Scheibler 
      worked since 2008 at Alcon, a division of Novartis and the world’s 
      largest eye care company. He most recently was a Vice President in 
      charge of Alcon’s Ideation and Technology Evaluation Center, the 
      company’s center of excellence in charge of identifying novel 
      technologies that address unmet needs in ophthalmology. Before that, he 
      served as Alcon’s Vice President and Global Head of Clinical Trial 
      Management.
    

      At Acucela, Dr. Scheibler will manage the translation of pre-clinical 
      research into clinical development. He will play a key role in the 
      Company’s business development team, manage the Company’s new projects 
      before proof of concept to provide key dimensions of study protocols and 
      oversee the Company’s relationships with major academic sites and 
      research institutions.
    

      The Acucela Board of Directors appointed Dr. Scheibler as Executive Vice 
      President of Translational Medicine, effective Aug. 17, 2015, at its 
      Aug. 4 meeting in Seattle.
    

      “Dr. Scheibler is one of the world’s leading experts in the research and 
      development of treatments and cures for ophthalmic diseases,” said Ryo 
      Kubota, MD, PhD, Chairman, President and CEO of Acucela Inc. “He brings 
      an international and industry-leading pedigree that we welcome as 
      Acucela works toward its goal of becoming an international leader in the 
      treatment of debilitating eye diseases.”
    

      Dr. Scheibler started work at Novartis headquarters in Switzerland in 
      2002 as Manager of Global Drug Regulatory Affairs. While he served as VP 
      and Global Head of R&D Alliances at Alcon from 2008 to 2011, he played 
      an important role as the company made several major acquisitions and 
      deals, including the purchase of LenSx Lasers for up to US $744 million, 
      ESBATech for up to US $589 million and a Research Agreement with 
      AstraZeneca for exclusive access to the company’s ophthalmology compound 
      library.
    

      Dr. Scheibler received a Master’s degree in chemistry from University of 
      Basel, Switzerland; a Ph.D. in chemistry from University of Lausanne, 
      Switzerland; and his Postdoctoral Training from Harvard Medical School.
    

      “This is such a promising and exciting time in Acucela’s growth as a 
      leader in ophthalmology, and research and clinical development will be 
      so critical to the company as it matures,” Dr. Scheibler said. “We will 
      be on the lookout for new opportunities and new avenues to be an 
      innovator in the treatment of eye diseases. I can’t wait to get started.”

      Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Any statements contained in 
      this press release that are not statements of historical fact may be 
      deemed to be forward-looking statements. Words such as “will,” 
      “believe,” expect,” “intend,” “plan” and “should” as well as similar

      projected in forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to 
      the risk that our investigational product candidates will not
