Behind STARTEK








There’s a Brand Warrior Behind Everything We Do.
For more than 25 years we’ve held an organization-wide conviction, that it’s our job to be the front line promoting and protecting your brand. Some of the world’s most prominent industry leaders, from telecommunication giants to technology power houses entrust STARTEK to uphold their reputations and to safe-guard their hard-won customers. It’s why we’re known as Brand Warriors.
We work around the clock, around the world, and with great determination to ensure every customer interaction is one that authentically matters. It’s on this front line, in the moments of direct, person-to-person engagement, where the battle for customer loyalty lives or dies, and why we take our responsibility so seriously.
It’s how we do business — with our own customers and with yours.

Jay Kirksey

Chief Technology Officer




Board of Directors










Vision & Career Highlights:
“Our industry has gotten stale and needs more than just incremental change. We empower our STARTEK Brand Warriors to engage differently from finance to IT. It’s both uncommon and refreshing and what I believe will differentiate us.”
  With 25+ years in management, operations, strategic planning and business development, Chad brings expertise in virtually every facet of contact center know-how. Before leading the charge at STARTEK, he oversaw operations for a now billion-dollar contact center organization with 60,000 employees in 30 countries and has since refined his reputation as being somewhat of a specialist in turn-arounds for large companies and a first mover into new markets.


Friends Would Tell You:

Chad has an eclectic taste in music & food
Three kids ensure a full plate, a full heart and a dose of practical perspective 
Believes in fostering relationships based on trust and mutual respect  




Vision & Career Highlights:
Cory is a seasoned sales and operations leader who brings nearly 20 years of BPO experience to STARTEK and has a proven track record of growing businesses, managing high performing sales teams, and sustaining profitable growth. In Cory’s prior role he was responsible for a $250 million P&L across three service lines representing over 400% growth in three years from new and existing clients. Cory managed a dynamic team of sales leaders, account management professionals, program leaders, resource units, and consultants across all lines of service. Under his leadership, client operational delivery teams successfully implemented a global healthcare footprint of over 7,500 employees, 20 technology deployments, and hundreds of analytic engagements across six geographies. His career background also includes aggressive growth across healthcare lines of business and introduced new services resulting in contracts totaling $54 million in annual recurring revenue.


Friends Would Tell You:

Sports fanatic and passionate follower of the “Big Blue Nation” the Kentucky Wildcats 
Nights and weekends are spent with his kids and logging 500+ hours a year at kid events 
Very strong sense of urgency especially when dealing with his clients 




Vision & Career Highlights:
I’m driven by the philosophy that the finance and accounting function is a service organization that should support the needs of all other departments within the company. That’s why I lead my teams to become strong analytical thinkers with a bias for prioritizing initiatives and taking action to drive results.”
  With more than 30 years of experience, Don is highly adept at leading and restructuring organizations by building skilled management teams, re-engineering processes, and implementing best practices to drive results for both public and private equity owned companies in the BPO, retail, and manufacturing space. He is particularly skilled at plotting a strategic course of action and then executing against it to create and drive growth.


Friends Would Tell You:

He is happiest when spending time with family and friends…and when the University of Georgia wins an occasional football game 
Has been blessed with great colleagues and mentors in business 
Laser focused and conscientious that his functional area is a service organization for other functional areas in the company 




Vision & Career Highlights:
“I’m fortunate to have had the opportunity to work with BPO teams on literally every continent – except Africa. That has enabled me to anticipate potential pit falls and better yet, to educate my team to bridge communication gaps and make good decisions at every level.”
  20+ years of global BPO experience, including 1st-in operations in international markets, and proven team building with even the largest, most complex of client engagements, make Pete a highly valued member of the STARTEK leadership team.


Friends Would Tell You:

Rain or shine Pete will be found outdoors 
He’s as proud a Dad as there is to be found 
Despite having traveled the globe, he never tires of seeking out undiscovered spots abroad or at home 




Vision & Career Highlights:
“Building, growing and turning things around is my theme wherever I go. STARTEK’s plans call for growing into new verticals and diversifying our service offerings and I have the passion, experience and tools to make it happen!”
  When Rod gets involved, things, well, they take off. Starting his career with Gateway Computers, Rod headed support for all major accounts, responsible for more than 2,000 customer support agents in the US. He then co-founded a start-up BPO that grew to $85 million, with 5000 people in two countries, and 10 contact centers – in under 5 years. He later joined a major global BPO where he was responsible for over 7,000 agents in 16 locations. Before joining STARTEK, Rod was the COO of TMS Health.


Friends Would Tell You:

Relishes spending time with friends and family 
He and his wife have a four-legged “child” named Tag 
Self-acknowledged technology geek – can’t get enough of the stuff




Vision & Career Highlights:
“The thing that drives me (and sometimes wakes me up at night) is coming up with better ways to empower our Brand Warriors. We take constant improvement very seriously – in fact, I take it personally!”
  A broad HR career has provided Jay with deep resources to pull from including industry experience in Aerospace, Airlines, Advertising and Manufacturing while also allowing him to draw from leadership experience spanning SVP Human Resources titles with multi national / multi $billion companies to independent business ownership.


Friends Would Tell You:

Major ski hound. 50+ days and a million vertical feet skied per year 
DNA programmed to challenge how good is good enough 
Focused on operating seamlessly when it comes to customer engagement




Vision & Career Highlights:
Wayne brings a broad spectrum of experience and expertise to STARTEK, including the development of technology and network designs, processes, products, and tools to drive business solutions and client offerings for the federal government as well as companies in the BPO and automotive manufacturing space. He is particularly skilled in network systems, Big Data analytics, and security as well as datacenter infrastructure, storage, and disaster recovery. Additionally, Wayne has been called upon to give expert testimony regarding telco regulatory and legal affairs. He holds a Six Sigma Black Belt, a Project Management Professional (PMP) certification from the Project Management Institute, and is a Cisco Call Center Architect Expert (CCCAE).


Friends Would Tell You:

He’s a martial arts enthusiast and holds a Black Belt in Karate as well as a Black Belt in Kung Fu
Lead singer of Major Johnson and a published BMI songwriter
Loves spending time with his wife and four children

Community Matters




Every one of our centers has a program dedicated to improving and supporting the communities they are a part of through direct involvement and volunteerism. While we know paying it forward feels great, it also just makes good business sense. We’ve seen first hand what third party studies reinforce all the time — that engaged employees who have a sense of belonging, also have less absenteeism, lower turnover and are more profitable.
In addition to taking care of the communities our sites are in, STARTEK prides itself in taking care of one another during times of hardship as well. In 2014, STARTEK launched WIN (Warriors In Need), a foundation intended to provide basic necessities and temporary relief to any STARTEK employee as result of disaster or extraordinary life events.
The program was conceived by employees, for employees, and is primarily funded by STARTEK employee contributions to help one another in times of great need. The program is in its infancy, but has already proven to be an essential resource for more than one Brand Warrior facing a critical crisis.
In the past year alone, STARTEK employees have:










Contributed over $100,000 in personal donations





Volunteered over 20,000 hours





Donated countless pounds of food, liters of blood and miscellaneous items





Given toys, school and pet supplies and most of all — themselves








Investors




STARTEK is a comprehensive contact center and business process outsourcing service company lead by and focused on what we call our Brand Warrior culture. For over 25 years we have been committed to making a positive impact on our clients’ business results.
Our mission is to enable and empower, at every level of our organization, Brand Warriors to promote our clients’ businesses every day and to bring value to our stakeholders. Our success stories and results speak for themselves.

US Healthcare on the Cusp
With changing regulatory demands, market dynamics and customer behavior, health systems are facing unprecedented challenges that require payers, providers and suppliers to reorganize their workflow, deliver more value to patients, and reduce costs and complexity.
While the cost of financing and delivering care is expected to increase, reforms are further escalating administrative and compliance costs, adding pressure to trim operating expenses. Moreover, an aging population and changes in the health system are pushing demands higher, as payers compete for new enrollments, and providers manage increasing patient requirements.
Payers, care providers, supply manufacturers and all businesses in the healthcare ecosystem are therefore expected to offset the shrinking margins by turning to reliable support partners who will deliver process change, and cost arbitrage.
STARTEK Health is focused on helping the Healthcare industry by delivering better business outcomes. With over 27 years of experience in providing business process solutions, we help our clients identify operational inefficiencies, areas of improvements and cost reduction.

As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

May 10 17
StarTek, Inc. announced unaudited consolidated earnings results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2017. For the first quarter, revenue was $77,652,000 compared to $78,035,000 a year ago, the decrease was due to $6.8 million of year-over-year reductions in revenue volume related to the company’s initiative to reduce and eliminate lower-margin business, $1.0 million in lost programs offset by $7.5 million of new business and net growth from existing clients.
