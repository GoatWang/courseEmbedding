      Our entire board and management team are moving forward fully focused on 
      delivering on our strategic initiatives, driving performance and 
      creating value for shareholders," said Eliassen.
    

      “Itron has a number of important initiatives underway and we look 
      forward to working together with Jerome and Peter to continue executing 
      on our plan and to consider additional means to reduce costs, realize 
      growth opportunities and unlock the value inherent in Itron as a 
      world-leading technology and services company,” said Philip Mezey, Itron 
      President and Chief Executive Officer.
    

      “We are pleased to have reached an agreement to bring new perspective

      Company’s efforts through existing and new initiatives in support of our 
      shared goal of enhancing shareholder value,” said Lande.

"Enjoy the hospitable entertainment of a
political graveyard."
Henry L. Clinton, Apollo Hall, New York City, February 3, 1872





The Political Graveyard
is a web site about U.S. political history and cemeteries.
Founded in 1996, it is the Internet's most comprehensive free source 
for American political biography, listing 277,483
politicians, living and dead.
 
 


The coverage of the site includes (1) the President, Vice President,
members of Congress, elected state and territorial officeholders in
all fifty states, the District of Columbia, and U.S. territories; and
the chief elected official, typically the mayor, of qualifying 
municipalities; (2) candidates at election, including primaries, for
any of the above; (3) all federal judges and all state appellate judges;
(4) certain federal officials, including the federal cabinet,
diplomatic chiefs of mission, consuls, U.S. district attorneys,
collectors of customs and internal revenue, members of major
federal commissions; and political appointee (pre-1971) postmasters of
qualifying places; and (5) state and national political party officials,
including delegates, alternate delegates, and other participants in
national party nominating conventions.

is a continually ongoing project.
