In U.S. financial law, a unit investment trust (UIT) is an exchange-traded mutual fund offering a fixed (unmanaged) portfolio of securities having a definite life. Unlike open-end and closed-end investment companies, a UIT has no board of directors. [1] A UIT is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and is classified as an investment company.[2] UITs are assembled by a sponsor and sold through brokerage firms to investors.[3]

Types[edit]
A UIT portfolio may contain one of several different types of securities. The two main types are stock (equity) trusts and bond (fixed-income) trusts.
Unlike a mutual fund, a UIT is created for a specific length of time and is a fixed portfolio, meaning that the UIT’s securities will not be sold or new ones bought, except in certain limited situations (for instance, when a company is filing for bankruptcy or the sale is required due to a merger).[4]
Stock trusts[edit]
Stock trusts are generally designed to provide capital appreciation and/or dividend income. They usually issue as many units (shares) as necessary for a set period of time before their primary offering period closes. Equity trusts have a set termination date, on which the trust liquidates and distributes its net asset value as proceeds to the unitholders. (The unitholders may then have special options for the reinvestment of this principal.)
Bond trusts[edit]
Bond trusts issue a set number of units, and when they are all sold to investors, the trust's primary offering period is closed. Bond trusts pay monthly income, often in relatively consistent amounts, until the first bond in the trust is called or matures. When this occurs, the funds from the redemption are distributed to the clients via a pro-rata return of principal. The trust then continues paying the new monthly income amount until the next bond is redeemed. This continues until all the bonds have been liquidated out of the trust. Bond trusts are generally appropriate for clients seeking current income and stability of principal.
Legal status and documents[edit]
A UIT may be constituted as either a regulated investment company (RIC) or a grantor trust. A RIC is a trust, corporation or partnership in which investors have common investment and voting rights but do not have direct interest in investments of the investment company or fund. A grantor trust, in contrast, grants investors proportional ownership in the underlying securities.
A UIT is created by a document called the Trust Indenture. This document is drafted by the Sponsor of the fund, and names the Trustee and the Evaluator. By US law, the Sponsor and the Trustee may not be the same. The sponsor selects and assembles the securities to be included in the fund. The trustee keeps the securities, maintains unitholder records, and performs all accounting and tax reporting for the portfolio. The largest issuer of UITs is First Trust Portfolios. Other sponsors include Incapital, SmartTrust, Invesco Unit Trusts, Millington Securities, Advisors Asset Management[5] and Guggenheim Funds. Most large brokerage firms (such as Merrill Lynch and LPL Financial) sell UITs created by these sponsors.
Tax perspective[edit]
From a tax perspective, UIT's offer a shelter from the unrealized capital gains taxes typical inside of a mutual fund. Because individual UIT's are assembled and purchased for specific periods of time, the cost basis consists of the initial purchase price of the securities held in the trust. A mutual fund on the other hand, taxes the individual based on the entire previous tax year regardless of the date purchased. An investor could, for example, purchase a mutual fund in October, absorb a loss during the last quarter of the year, and yet still be taxed on capital gains within the fund depending on the overall performance of the underlying securities from January 1 of the current year. A UIT avoids this potential tax consequence by assembling an entirely new "investment" for each individual investor.
Some exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are technically classified as UITs: however, ETFs usually do not have set portfolios (they are either managed or update automatically to follow an index), and can have lifetimes of over 100 years. For example, the SPDR S&P 500 Trust is scheduled to terminate January 21, 2118,[6] and the PowerShares QQQ Trust is scheduled to terminate March 4, 2124.[7]

Unit investment trust

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

For the UK fund types, see Unit trust and Investment trust.
In U.S. financial law, a unit investment trust (UIT) is an exchange-traded mutual fund offering a fixed (unmanaged) portfolio of securities having a definite life. Unlike open-end and closed-end investment companies, a UIT has no board of directors. [1] A UIT is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and is classified as an investment company.[2] UITs are assembled by a sponsor and sold through brokerage firms to investors.[3]

Types[edit]
A UIT portfolio may contain one of several different types of securities. The two main types are stock (equity) trusts and bond (fixed-income) trusts.
Unlike a mutual fund, a UIT is created for a specific length of time and is a fixed portfolio, meaning that the UIT’s securities will not be sold or new ones bought, except in certain limited situations (for instance, when a company is filing for bankruptcy or the sale is required due to a merger).[4]
Stock trusts[edit]
Stock trusts are generally designed to provide capital appreciation and/or dividend income. They usually issue as many units (shares) as necessary for a set period of time before their primary offering period closes. Equity trusts have a set termination date, on which the trust liquidates and distributes its net asset value as proceeds to the unitholders. (The unitholders may then have special options for the reinvestment of this principal.)
Bond trusts[edit]
Bond trusts issue a set number of units, and when they are all sold to investors, the trust's primary offering period is closed. Bond trusts pay monthly income, often in relatively consistent amounts, until the first bond in the trust is called or matures. When this occurs, the funds from the redemption are distributed to the clients via a pro-rata return of principal. The trust then continues paying the new monthly income amount until the next bond is redeemed. This continues until all the bonds have been liquidated out of the trust. Bond trusts are generally appropriate for clients seeking current income and stability of principal.
Legal status and documents[edit]
A UIT may be constituted as either a regulated investment company (RIC) or a grantor trust. A RIC is a trust, corporation or partnership in which investors have common investment and voting rights but do not have direct interest in investments of the investment company or fund. A grantor trust, in contrast, grants investors proportional ownership in the underlying securities.
A UIT is created by a document called the Trust Indenture. This document is drafted by the Sponsor of the fund, and names the Trustee and the Evaluator. By US law, the Sponsor and the Trustee may not be the same. The sponsor selects and assembles the securities to be included in the fund. The trustee keeps the securities, maintains unitholder records, and performs all accounting and tax reporting for the portfolio. The largest issuer of UITs is First Trust Portfolios. Other sponsors include Incapital, SmartTrust, Invesco Unit Trusts, Millington Securities, Advisors Asset Management[5] and Guggenheim Funds. Most large brokerage firms (such as Merrill Lynch and LPL Financial) sell UITs created by these sponsors.
Tax perspective[edit]
From a tax perspective, UIT's offer a shelter from the unrealized capital gains taxes typical inside of a mutual fund. Because individual UIT's are assembled and purchased for specific periods of time, the cost basis consists of the initial purchase price of the securities held in the trust. A mutual fund on the other hand, taxes the individual based on the entire previous tax year regardless of the date purchased. An investor could, for example, purchase a mutual fund in October, absorb a loss during the last quarter of the year, and yet still be taxed on capital gains within the fund depending on the overall performance of the underlying securities from January 1 of the current year. A UIT avoids this potential tax consequence by assembling an entirely new "investment" for each individual investor.
Some exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are technically classified as UITs: however, ETFs usually do not have set portfolios (they are either managed or update automatically to follow an index), and can have lifetimes of over 100 years. For example, the SPDR S&P 500 Trust is scheduled to terminate January 21, 2118,[6] and the PowerShares QQQ Trust is scheduled to terminate March 4, 2124.[7]

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial highlights based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement. We were not engaged to perform an audit of the Trust s internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Trust s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our procedures included confirmation of securities owned at January 31, 2016 by correspondence with The Bank of New York Mellon, Trustee. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Investment Grade Corporate Trust, 3-7 Year Series 1 (included in Invesco Unit Trusts, Taxable Income Series 494) as of January 31, 2016, and the results of its operations and changes in net assets for the period from February 19, 2015 (date of deposit) through January 31, 2016, and the financial highlights for the period from February 19, 2015 (date of deposit) through January 31, 2016, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. /s/ GRANT THORNTON LLP New York, New York May 26,5 INVESCO UNIT TRUSTS, TAXABLE INCOME SERIES 494 Statement of Condition January 31, 2016 Investment Grade Corporate Trust, 3-7 Year Series Trust property Cash... $ Securities at fair value (cost $5,804,487) (notes 1 and 2)... 5,430,533 Accrued interest... 69,648 Receivable for securities sold... $ 5,500,181 Liabilities and interest to Unitholders Cash overdraft... $ 55,667 Redemptions payable...

The Evaluator may determine the value of the securities (1) on the basis of current bid prices of the securities obtained from dealers or brokers who customarily deal in securities comparable to those held by the Trust, (2) on the basis of bid prices for comparable securities, (3) by determining the value of the securities by appraisal or (4) by any combination of the above. Security Cost - The original cost to the Trust (Investment Grade Corporate Trust, 3-7 Year Series 1) was based on the determination by the Evaluator of the offering prices of the securities on the date of deposit (February 19, 2015). Since the valuation is based upon the bid prices, the Trust (Investment Grade Corporate Trust, 3-7 Year Series 1) recognized a downward adjustment of $13,571 on the date of deposit resulting from the difference between the bid and offering prices. This downward adjustment was included in the aggregate amount of unrealized depreciation reported in the financial statements for the Trust for the period ended January 31, Unit Valuation - The redemption price per Unit is the pro rata share of each Unit in the Trust based upon (1) the cash on hand in the Trust or monies in the process of being collected, (2) the securities in the Trust based on the value determined by the Evaluator and (3) interest accrued thereon, less accrued expenses of the Trust, if any. Federal Income Taxes - For a Trust with a Date of Deposit prior to August 2, 2006, such Trust has been structured to be treated as a grantor trust for federal income tax purposes. Thus, such a Trust will not be treated as a taxable entity for federal income tax purposes, and each Unitholder will be considered to be the owner of a pro rata portion of the assets of such Trust. Accordingly, no provision has been made for federal income taxes. For a Trust with a Date of Deposit on or after August 2, 2006, each such Trust has elected and intends to qualify on a continuous basis for special income tax treatment as a regulated investment company ( RIC ) under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. If such Trust so qualifies, as expected, it will not be subject to federal income tax on amounts distributed to Unitholders. Your Trust s Date of Deposit is listed above in the section entitled Summary of Essential Financial Information. For a discussion of the federal tax status of income earned on Units, see Federal Tax Status--Grantor Trusts or Federal Tax Status--Regulated Investment Companies, as applicable, in Part II of this Prospectus. For each calendar year-end, a RIC trust files an annual tax return, Form 1120-RIC, with the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ). These returns are subject to IRS examination under a three-year statute of limitations. To date, the Trust has no IRS examination pending. Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes - FASB Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ), clarifies the appropriate method of accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements and provides related guidance. There is no material effect on the net asset value, financial condition or results of operations of the Trust. Subsequent Events - Events or transactions that have occurred from the balance sheet date through the date of issuance are evaluated by the Sponsor. Other - The financial statements are presented on the accrual basis of accounting. Any realized gains or losses from securities transactions are reported on an identified cost basis. NOTE 2 - PORTFOLIO Ratings - The source of all ratings, exclusive of those designated NR or * is Standard & Poor s, A Division of the McGraw-Hill Companies ( S&P ). Ratings marked * are by Moody s Investors Service, Inc. ( Moody s ) as these Bonds are not rated by S&P. NR indicates that the Bond is not rated by S&P or Moody s. The ratings shown represent the latest published ratings of the Bonds. For a brief description of rating symbols and their related meanings, see Description of Securities Ratings in the Information Supplement. Redemption Feature - There is shown under this heading the year in which each issue of Bonds is initially or currently callable and the call price for that year. Each issue of Bonds continues to be callable at declining prices thereafter (but not below par value) except for original issue discount Bonds which are redeemable at prices based on the issue price plus the amount of original issue discount accreted to redemption date plus, if applicable, some premium, the amount of which will decline in subsequent years. S.F. indicates a sinking fund is established with respect to an issue of Bonds. P.R. indicates a bond has been prerefunded. Redemption pursuant to call provisions generally will, and redemption pursuant to sinking fund provisions may, occur at times when the redeemed Bonds have an offering side evaluation which represents a premium over par. To the extent that the Bonds were deposited in the Trust at a price higher than the price at which they are redeemed, this will represent a loss of capital when compared with the original Public Offering Price of the Units. Conversely, to the extent that the Bonds were acquired at a price lower than the redemption price, this will represent an increase in capital when compared with the original Public Offering Price of the Units. Distributions will generally be reduced by the amount of the income which would otherwise have been paid with respect to redeemed Bonds. Unitholders of record as of the applicable record date will receive distributions of principal and any premium received on such redemption on the next applicable distribution date as described in Rights of Unitholders-- Distributions of Interest and Principal in Part II. The Estimated Current Return in this event may be affected by such redemptions. For the federal tax effect on Unitholders of such redemptions and resultant distributions, see Federal Tax Status in Part II of this Prospectus. 89 NOTE 2 - PORTFOLIO (continued) Redemption pursuant to call provisions generally will, and redemption pursuant to sinking fund provisions may, occur at times when the redeemed securities have an offering side evaluation which represents a premium over par. To the extent that the securities were deposited in the Trust at a price higher than the price at which they are redeemed, this will represent a loss of capital when compared with the original Public Offering Price of the Units. Conversely, to the extent that the securities were acquired at a price lower than the redemption price, this will represent an increase in capital when compared with the original Public Offering Price of the Units. Distributions will generally be reduced by the amount of the income which would otherwise have been paid with respect to redeemed securities and there will be distributed to Unitholders the principal amount in excess of $1 per Unit semi-annually for Trusts with a Date of Deposit prior to April 23, 2009, or in excess of $5 per Unit monthly for Trusts with a Date of Deposit on or after April 23, 2009, and any premium received on such redemption. However, should the amount available for distribution in the Principal Account exceed $10.00 per Unit for Trusts with a Date of Deposit prior to April 23, 2009, the Trustee will make a special distribution from the Principal Account on the next succeeding monthly Distribution Date to holders of record on the related monthly Record Date. The estimated current return in this event may be affected by such redemptions. For the federal tax effect on Unitholders of such redemptions and resultant distributions, see Federal Tax Status in Part II of this Prospectus. Certain Bonds may have a make whole call option and are redeemable in whole or in part at any time at the option of the issuer at a redemption price that is generally equal to the sum of the principal amount of such Bonds, a make whole amount, and any accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. The make whole amount is generally equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the aggregate present value as of the date of redemption of principal being redeemed and the amount of interest (exclusive of interest accrued to the date of redemption) that would have been payable if redemption had not been made, determined by discounting the remaining principal and interest at a specified rate (which varies from bond to bond and is generally equal to an average of yields on U.S. Treasury obligations or municipal obligations, as applicable, with maturities corresponding to the remaining life of the bond plus a premium rate) from the dates on which the principal and interest would have been payable if the redemption had not been made, over (ii) the aggregate principal amount of the bonds being redeemed. ** indicates that the bond was issued by a foreign company. Insurance - Insurance coverage providing for the timely payment when due of all principal and interest on certain of the securities in the Trust may have been obtained by the Trust or by one of the Preinsured Security Insurers (as indicated in the security name), however, certain other securities may not be insured. Such insurance does not guarantee the market value of the securities or the value of the Units. For securities covered under the Trust's insurance policy the insurance is effective only while securities thus insured are held in the Trust and the insurance premium, which is a Trust obligation, is paid on a monthly basis. The premium for insurance which has been obtained from various insurance companies by the issuer of the security involved is payable by the issuer. ASC states that, for financial reporting purposes, insurance coverage of the type acquired by the Trust does not have any measurable fair value in the absence of default of the underlying Bonds or of indications of the probability of such default. Fair Value Measurements - As described in Note 1, the Trust utilizes various methods to measure the fair value of its investments. ASC establishes both a framework for measuring fair value as well as a hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation methods. The various inputs that may be used to determine the value of the Trust s investments are summarized in the three levels presented below. The inputs or methodologies used for valuing securities are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated with investing in those securities. Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical securities. Level 2 Prices determined using other significant observable inputs. Observable inputs are inputs that other market participants would use in pricing a security, which may include quoted prices for similar securities, interest rates, prepayment speeds and credit risk. Level 3 Prices determined using significant unobservable inputs. In certain situations where quoted prices or observable inputs are unavailable, unobservable inputs may be used. Unobservable inputs reflect the Trust s own assumptions about the factors market participants would use in pricing an investment, and would be based on the best information available. The following table summarizes the Trust s investments as of January 31, 2016 based on the inputs used to value them: Investments Valuation Inputs in Securities Level 1 Quoted prices $ Level 2 Other significant observable inputs 5,430,533 Level 3 Significant unobservable inputs Total $ 5,430,533 910 NOTE 2 - PORTFOLIO (continued) Unrealized Appreciation and Depreciation - An analysis of net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) at January 31, 2016 is as follows: Unrealized Appreciation $ 5,139 Unrealized Depreciation (379,093) $ (373,954) NOTE 3 - OTHER Marketability - Although it is not obligated to do so, the Sponsor may maintain a market for Units and continuously offer to purchase Units at prices, subject to change at any time, based upon the aggregate bid price of the securities in the portfolio of the Trust, plus interest accrued to the date of settlement. If the supply of Units exceeds demand, or for other business reasons, the Sponsor may discontinue purchases of Units at such prices. In the event that a market is not maintained for the Units, a Unitholder desiring to dispose of his Units may be able to do so only by tendering such Units to the Trustee for redemption at the redemption price. Cost to Investors - The cost to original investors was based on the Evaluator s determination of the aggregate offering price of the securities per Unit on the date of an investor s purchase, plus a sales charge of 1.95% of the Public Offering Price which was equivalent to 1.989% of the aggregate offering price of the securities for the Trust. The secondary market cost to investors is based on the Evaluator s determination of the aggregate bid price of the securities per Unit on the date of an investor s purchase plus a sales charge based upon the estimated long-term return life of the securities in the Trust. The sales charge ranges from 1.50% of the Public Offering Price (1.523% of the aggregate bid price of the securities) for a Trust with an estimated long-term return life with less than two years to 4.80% of the Public Offering Price (5.042% of the aggregate bid price of the securities) for a Trust with a portfolio with an estimated long-term return life of fifteen or more years. Compensation of Evaluator and Supervisor - The Supervisor receives a fee for providing portfolio supervisory services for the Trust ($.25 per Unit, not to exceed the aggregate cost of the Supervisor for providing such services to the Trust). In addition, the Evaluator receives an annual fee for regularly evaluating the Trust s portfolio. Both fees may be adjusted for increases under the category Services Less Rent of Shelter in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers.

Each Trust is a unit investment trust issued under the name Invesco Unit Trust, Taxable Income Series Van Kampen Unit Trusts, Taxable Income Series, Van Kampen Focus Portfolios, Taxable Income Series, Van Kampen Merritt Insured Income Trust, Van Kampen American Capital Insured Income Trust, Van Kampen Insured Income Trust or Van Kampen Focus Portfolios Insured Income Trust. Your Trust was created under the laws of the State of New York pursuant to a Trust Indenture and Agreement (the Trust Agreement ), dated the Date of Deposit among Invesco Capital Markets, Inc., as Sponsor, Standard & Poor s Securities Evaluations, Inc., as Evaluator, Invesco Investment Advisers LLC, as Supervisor, and The Bank of New York Mellon, as Trustee, or their predecessors. Your Trust may be an appropriate medium for investors who desire to participate in a portfolio of taxable fixed income securities, corporate bonds, or mortgage-backed securities if investing in Units of a GNMA Income Portfolio, with greater diversification than they might be able to acquire individually. Diversification of a Trust s assets will not eliminate the risk of loss always inherent in the ownership of bonds (as used herein, the term bonds shall also include mortgage-backed securities, as applicable to Unitholders of a GNMA Income Portfolio). In addition, bonds of the type initially deposited in the portfolio of a Trust are often not available in small amounts and may, in the case of any privately placed bonds, be available only to institutional investors. On the Date of Deposit, the Sponsor deposited the bonds with the Trustee. The bonds initially consisted of delivery statements relating to contracts for their purchase and cash, cash equivalents and/or irrevocable letters of credit issued by a financial institution. Thereafter, the Trustee, in exchange for the bonds, delivered to the Sponsor evidence of ownership of the Units. A Trust that holds primarily long-term bonds, as described on the cover of Prospectus Part I, is referred to herein as a Long-Term Trust. A Trust that holds primarily intermediate-term bonds, as described on the cover of Prospectus Part I, is referred to herein as an Intermediate-Term Trust. A Trust that holds a portfolio of bonds with laddered maturities, as described on the cover of Prospectus Part I, is referred to herein as a Laddered Trust. A Trust that holds only insured bonds is referred to herein as an Insured Trust. A Trust that holds primarily short-term Floating and Fixed rate corporate bonds, as described on the cover of Prospectus Part I, is referred to herein as a Variable Rate Trust. Trusts that primarily hold Build America Bonds, as described on the cover of Prospectus Part I, are referred to herein as Build America Bond Trusts. A Trust that holds bonds within the year maturity range, as described in Prospectus Part I, is referred to herein as a Year Trust. A Trust that holds primarily below investment grade bonds, otherwise referred to as junk bonds, is referred to herein as a High Yield Trust. Unless otherwise terminated as provided herein, the Trust Agreement will terminate at the end of the calendar year prior to the fiftieth anniversary of its execution in the case of a Long-Term Trust, a Laddered Trust or a Year Trust and at the end of the calendar year prior to the twentieth anniversary of its execution in the case of an Intermediate-Term Trust, Variable Rate Trust or a High Yield Trust. Each Unit initially offered represents a fractional undivided interest in the principal and net income of a Trust. To the extent that any Units are redeemed by the Trustee, or additional Units are issued as a result of additional Securities being deposited by the Sponsor only with respect to a GNMA Income Portfolio, the fractional undivided interest in a Trust represented by each Unit will increase or decrease accordingly, although the actual Units in a Trust will remain unchanged. Units will remain outstanding until redeemed by Unitholders or until the termination of the Trust Agreement. With respect only to a GNMA Income Portfolio, additional Units of your Trust may be issued at any time by depositing in the Trust (i) additional securities, (ii) contracts to purchase securities together with cash or irrevocable letters of credit or (iii) cash (or a letter of credit or the equivalent) with instructions to purchase additional securities. As additional Units are issued by the Trust, the aggregate value of the securities will be increased and the fractional undivided interest represented by each Unit will be decreased. The Sponsor may continue to make additional deposits into the Trust following the Initial Date of Deposit provided that the additional deposits will be in amounts which will maintain, as nearly as practicable, the original percentage relationship among the principal amounts of securities of specified interest rates and ranges of maturities that existed on the Initial Date of Deposit. Investors may experience a dilution of their investments and a reduction in their anticipated income because of fluctuations in the prices of the securities between the time of the deposit and the purchase of the securities and because the Trust will pay the associated brokerage and acquisition costs. Purchases and sales of Securities by the Trust may impact the value of the Securities. This may especially be the case upon Trust termination or in the course of satisfying large Unit redemptions. 214 Objectives and Bond Selection. The objective of a Long-Term Trust is to provide income and conservation of capital by investing in a professionally selected portfolio primarily consisting of long-term bonds. The objective of an Intermediate-Term Trust is to provide income and conservation of capital by investing in a professionally selected portfolio primarily consisting of intermediate-term bonds. The objective of a Year Trust is to provide a high level of current income and to preserve capital by investing in a portfolio of bonds maturing approximately 10 to 20 years from the Date of Deposit. The objective of a Laddered Trust is to provide income and conservation of capital by investing in a professionally selected portfolio consisting of bonds with laddered maturities of approximately 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 years from the Date of Deposit. The objective of a Van Kampen BlackRock Corporate Opportunity Trust ( BlackRock Trust ) is to provide a high level of current income and to preserve capital by investing in a portfolio primarily consisting of intermediate-term corporate bonds. The objective of a GNMA Income Portfolio is to provide an attractive level of monthly income by investing in a portfolio consisting of fixed-rate mortgage-backed securities representing pools of mortgages on 1- to 4- family dwellings guaranteed by the Government National Mortgage Association. The objective of a Variable Rate Trust is to provide an attractive level of income and to preserve capital by investing in a portfolio primarily consisting of short-term floating and fixed rate corporate bonds. The objective of a High Yield Trust is to provide a high level of current income and to preserve capital by investing primarily in a portfolio of high yield corporate bonds. There is, of course, no guarantee that a Trust will achieve its objective. Your Trust may be an appropriate medium for investors who desire to participate in a portfolio of taxable fixed income securities, corporate bonds, or mortgage-backed securities if investing in Units of a GNMA Income Portfolio, with greater diversification than they might be able to acquire individually. Diversification of a Trust s assets will not eliminate the risk of loss always inherent in the ownership of bonds. In selecting bonds for each Trust, the Sponsor considered the following factors, among others: (a) the ratings criteria applicable to such Trust; (b) the prices and liquidity of the bonds relative to other bonds of comparable quality and maturity, (c) the current income provided by the bonds; (d) the diversification of bonds as to purpose of issue and location of issuer; and (e) the probability of early return of principal or high legal or event risk. After the Date of Deposit, a bond may cease to be rated or its rating may be reduced below the minimum required as of the Date of Deposit. Neither event requires elimination of a bond from a Trust but may be considered in the Sponsor s determination as to whether or not to direct the Trustee to dispose of the bond (see Trust Administration--Portfolio Administration ). In particular, the ratings of the bonds in a BlackRock Trust, Income Opportunities Trust, Investment Grade Trust, Long-Term Investment Grade Trust, Long-Term Corporate Investment Grade Trust, Intermediate Corporate Investment Grade Trust, Investment Grade Income Trust or Variable Rate Trust could fall below investment grade (i.e., below BBB- or Baa3 ) during the Trust s life and the Trust could continue to hold the bonds. The portfolio for a BlackRock Trust was selected by the Sponsor from a list of corporate bonds researched and selected by the BlackRock fixed income team. With respect to the selection of securities for a GNMA Income Portfolio, the Sponsor considered factors including the following: (i) the types of GNMA securities available, (ii) the prices and yields of the securities relative to other comparable securities, including the extent to which the securities were trading at a premium or discount from their principal value, and (iii) the maturities of the securities. See The Trusts--Risk Factors. Insurance guaranteeing the timely payment, when due, of all principal and interest on certain bonds in the Trusts has been obtained from bond insurance company. See Insurance on the Bonds. Risk Factors. All investments involve risk. This section describes the main risks that can impact the value of bonds in your Trust. You should understand these risks before you invest. If the value of the bonds falls, the value of your Units will also fall. You can lose money by investing in a Trust. No one can guarantee that your Trust will achieve its objective or that your investment return will be positive over any period. The Information Supplement contains a more detailed discussion of risks related to your investment. Current economic conditions. The economic recession in the United States which began in 2007 technically came to an end in June of 2009, however the U.S. and global economies continue to feel the effects of this recessionary period, including increased unemployment and below-average levels of economic activity. The U.S. and other foreign governments have taken extraordinary steps to combat the effects of the economic crisis, however the ultimate impact of these measures is unknown and cannot be predicted. In December of 2013, the U.S. Federal Reserve announced it would begin tapering its quantitative easing program, however, there continues to be uncertainty concerning potential future changes to the federal funds rate following a period of near zero interest rates over the previous five years. On August 5, 2011, Standard & Poor s Rating Services (S&P) downgraded the long-term 315 sovereign credit rating of the United States of America to AA+ from AAA, citing the prolonged controversy over raising the statutory debt ceiling and the related fiscal policy debate. Any substantial change in general market conditions may result in sudden and significant valuation increases or declines in your Trust s holdings. Market risk is the risk that the value of the bonds in your Trust will fluctuate. This could cause the value of your Units to fall below your original purchase price or below the par value. Market value fluctuates in response to various factors. These can include changes in interest rates, inflation, the financial condition of a bond s issuer or insurer, perceptions of the issuer or insurer, or ratings on a bond. Even though the Supervisor supervises your portfolio, you should remember that no one manages your portfolio. Your Trust will not sell a bond solely because the market value falls, or the credit rating on a bond included in a BlackRock Trust or a Variable Rate Trust is downgraded, as is possible in a managed fund. Interest rate risk is the risk that the value of bonds will fall if interest rates increase. Bonds typically fall in value when interest rates rise and rise in value when interest rates fall. Bonds with longer periods before maturity are often more sensitive to interest rate changes. Given the historically low interest rate environment in the U.S., risks associated with rising rates are heightened. The negative impact on fixed income securities from any interest rate increases could be swift and significant. With respect only to a Variable Rate Trust, because the interest rates on floating rate bonds adjust periodically to reflect current market rates, falling short-term interest rates should tend to decrease the income payable to a Variable Rate Trust on its floating rate investments and rising rates should tend to increase that income. However, investments in floating rate obligations should also mitigate the fluctuations in a Variable Rate Trust s net asset values during periods of changing interest rates, compared to changes in values of fixed-rate debt securities. Nevertheless, changes in interest rates can affect the value of a Variable Rate Trust s floating rate investments, especially if rates change sharply in a short period, because the resets of the interest rates on the investments occur periodically and will not all happen simultaneously with changes in prevailing rates. Certain bonds in a High Yield Trust may be subject to interest rate adjustments if either Moody's Investors Service, Inc. ( Moody s ) S&P s or Fitch (or, in certain limited circumstances, another ratings service) downgrades the rating for such bond (or upgrades the rating after such a downgrade). The interest rates payable on certain bonds in a High Yield Trust may have already been increased due to past ratings downgrades. Any future credit rating improvements on such bonds may result in decreases to the interest rates payable on such bonds and, consequently, may adversely affect both the income you receive from the securities in a High Yield Trust and the value of your Units. On the other hand, increases in a bond's interest rate related to decreases in such bond's credit rating may place additional financial strain on the bond's issuer which could result in further decreases in financial condition and further credit rating decreases. Additionally, an increase in a bond's interest rate may increase the risk that the bond's issuer will prepay or "call" the bond before its stated maturity. Credit risk is the risk that a security s issuer is unable to meet its obligation to pay principal or interest on the security. While interest and principal payments on Ginnie Mae securities are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, a GNMA Income Portfolio and the Units thereof are not guaranteed or insured by the U.S. government or any government agency. In addition, neither the U.S. government nor Ginnie Mae guarantees the market value or yield on Ginnie Mae securities. Prepayment risk is the chance that borrowers prepay their mortgage loans earlier than expected and in particular, may affect the Units of a GNMA Income Portfolio. This reduces the Trust s life and future interest income. Any payment of mortgage debt before it is due is called prepayment. Most mortgage loans may be prepaid at any time by the borrower without penalty. Each mortgage-backed security payment includes a return of principal as well as interest. Prepayments of the entire mortgage occur when borrowers refinance or sell their homes. They may refinance to consolidate debts or take advantage of lower interest rate mortgages. As interest rates decrease, the rate of refinancings may increase significantly, thereby increasing the prepayment risk of mortgage-backed securities. Extra monthly principal payments made near the Trust s inception may significantly reduce the interest amount paid by the borrower to the lender and, therefore, the future amount received by the Trust. Your Trust will distribute prepayments of principal to you but your future interest distributions will fall as a result of the prepaid principal. You also might not be able to reinvest this principal at as high a yield. This means that you could receive less than the amount you paid for your Units. If enough principal is prepaid on the securities in your Trust, your Trust could terminate significantly earlier than expected. 416 Call risk is the risk that the issuer prepays or calls a bond before its stated maturity. An issuer might call a bond if interest rates fall and the bond pays a higher interest rate or if it no longer needs the money for the original purpose. If an issuer calls a bond, your Trust will distribute the principal to you but your future interest distributions will fall. You might not be able to reinvest this principal at as high a yield. A bond s call price could be less than the price your Trust paid for the bond and could be below the bond s par value. This means that you could receive less than the amount you paid for your units. If enough bonds in your Trust are called, your Trust could terminate early. Some or all of the bonds may also be subject to extraordinary optional or mandatory redemptions if certain events occur, such as certain changes in tax laws, the substantial damage or destruction by fire or other casualty of the project for which the proceeds of the bonds were used, and various other events. Build America Bonds, Qualified School Construction Bonds, Qualified Energy Conservation Bonds and Clean Renewable Energy Bonds, in particular, are often subject various to extraordinary or mandatory redemption provisions. See Taxable Municipal Bonds--Build America Bonds and Taxable Municipal Bonds-- Qualified School Construction Bonds, Qualified Energy Conservation Bonds and Clean Renewable Energy Bonds below. The call provisions are described in general terms in the Redemption Feature column of the Portfolio section, and the notes thereof in Prospectus Part I. Bond quality risk is the risk that a bond will fall in value if a rating agency decreases the bond s rating. Concentration risk is the risk that your Trust is less diversified because it concentrates in a particular type of bond. When a certain type of bond makes up 25% or more of a Trust, the Trust is considered to be concentrated in that bond type. The different bond types are described in the following sections. A GNMA Income Portfolio concentrates in mortgage-backed securities. You should understand these securities before you invest. These securities are described in detail in the section titled Ginnie Mae Securities. Extension risk is the chance that an increase in interest rates or lack of refinancing opportunities can cause a corresponding increase in the Trust s life due to a drop in expected prepayments of mortgage-backed securities. As a result, the securities in your Trust, and in particular, any mortgage-backed securities in a GNMA Income Portfolio, may become more sensitive to rising interest rates and may decrease in value. Foreign securities risk. Investing in foreign securities typically involves more risks than investing in securities of United States issuers. These risks can increase the potential for losses in the Trust and affect its Unit price. These risks may include risks such as losses due to political, economic and social developments, international trade conditions, foreign taxes (including withholding taxes), restrictions on foreign investments or exchange of securities, foreign currency fluctuations or restriction on exchange or repatriation of currencies. The political, economic and social structures of some foreign countries may be less stable and more volatile than those in the U.S., and investments in these countries may be subject to the risks of internal and external conflicts, currency devaluations, foreign ownership limitations and tax increases. It is possible that a government may take over the assets or operations of a company or impose restrictions on the exchange or export of currency or other assets. Some countries also may have different legal systems that may make it difficult for the Trust to exercise investor rights, and pursue legal remedies with respect to its foreign investments. Diplomatic and political developments, including rapid and adverse political changes, social instability, regional conflicts, terrorism and war, could affect the economies, industries, and securities and currency markets, and the value of the Trust s investments, in non-u.s. countries. No one can predict the impact that these factors could have on the Trust s portfolio securities. Foreign companies may not be subject to the same disclosure, accounting, auditing and financial reporting standards and practices as U.S. companies. Thus, there may be less information publicly available about foreign companies than about most U.S. companies. Certain foreign securities may be less liquid (harder to sell) and more volatile than many U.S. securities. This means the Trust may at times be unable to sell foreign securities in a timely manner or at favorable prices. Reduced diversification risk is the risk that your Trust will become smaller and less diversified as bonds are sold, are called or mature. This could increase your risk of loss and increase your share of Trust expenses. High Yield Bond Risk. High Yield Trusts invest primarily in high yield bonds. Other Trusts may hold bonds currently rated below investment grade following one or more downgrades. High yield, or junk bonds, are frequently issued 5  View more

Unit Trusts
Unit Trusts provide a simple, convenient way to gain exposure to an asset class, market sector or investment discipline. Like a traditional mutual fund, unit trusts hold a pool of securities (such as stocks, bonds or alternative investments) chosen by a professional investment manager and are available with a wide range of objectives and risk levels.

Unit Trusts
Unit Trusts provide a simple, convenient way to gain exposure to an asset class, market sector or investment discipline. Like a traditional mutual fund, unit trusts hold a pool of securities (such as stocks, bonds or alternative investments) chosen by a professional investment manager and are available with a wide range of objectives and risk levels.
