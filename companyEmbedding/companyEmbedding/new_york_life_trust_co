In addition to lifelong, guaranteed protection, this builds cash value year after year—which can help with tuition, retirement, or other needs.**





Long-Term Care Insurance

Annuities
Annuities help grow your savings over time, and can convert that money into guaranteed pension-like income for the rest of your life.





Mutual Funds
A mix of stocks, bonds, and other securities, mutual funds can help diversify your investments—without the need to hand-pick them yourself.

New York Life Insurance Company is a mutual insurance company, which means it is not publicly traded and has no shareholders. Instead, its policy owners are the ones who share in ownership rights of the company. With a mutual company, clients who purchase participating products are entitled to vote in the board of directors elections and are eligible to share in annual dividends that are declared. The company's priority is to safeguard their interests. Policies issued by our subsidiary companies are not participating and do not share in these rights.
Figure encompasses all policy owners of New York Life Insurance Company (NYLIC) and its insurance company subsidiaries. New York Life's company strength is based on several factors, including insurance in force. 
Figures reflect the consolidated results of NYLIC and its insurance subsidiaries presented on a statutory basis. Benefits paid primarily include death claims paid to beneficiaries and annuity payments. It also includes dividends paid to eligible policyholders. For more a more complete breakdown of this data, please see our Report to Policyholders.
**** While New York Life has historically paid a dividend on its participating policies, dividends on its participating policies are not guaranteed.

Some people take advantage of annuities to grow savings, while others use them to generate guaranteed “paychecks” for life. Regardless of what you use them for, annuities enable people to enter retirement with confidence—especially when they’re backed by the financial strength of New York Life. Explore our top options, and let us help find the right annuity for you.




Try Tax-Deferred Growth in the Market
Variable annuities can help you make tax-deferred investments in the market. You can also purchase protection and create a legacy.*





See How to Steadily Grow Your Savings
Fixed annuities provide a guaranteed interest rate to help your savings grow safely, no matter what happens in the market.*





Convert Your Savings into Secure Income, for Life
With Guaranteed Income Annuities, you can have regular “paychecks” after you stop working. So you receive income for life, no matter what.*  










You work hard to save for retirement. An annuity can make your savings work just as hard for you.










Good news: People are living longer than ever before. So your retirement savings need to last longer than ever before. Also keep in mind that traditional sources of retirement income like Social Security are often inadequate. So putting plans in place for now and later is essential, and annuities can be a powerful tool. With greater security, an annuity can help make your savings last longer than they otherwise could.



Annuities are a way to pay yourself forward.
Typically, when you purchase an annuity contract, you make a payment in exchange for a future stream of income. If you’re still saving for retirement, know that the earlier you save the more retirement income you’ll likely have to enjoy in the future. If you’re already retired and want to start receiving income immediately, you could make a one-time payment to fund the annuity. Or you can have the flexibility to make payments over time, which will be based on the amount you wish to receive in retirement. 
Your income is up to you: what, when, and how.
Some annuities provide income right away. Others set you up to receive income in the future. Buying an annuity now lets you secure your income when you need it, whether that’s today or years away. (Typically, the longer you wait, the more your savings will work for you and the more monthly income you’ll receive.)
The risk you want and the results you need.
A Guaranteed Income Annuity lets you convert your savings into a secure source of income that’s guaranteed to last the rest of your lifetime—so you can be sure you’ll never run out of money in retirement. 
A Fixed Annuity offers tax-deferred growth based on a guaranteed fixed interest rate, while a Variable Annuity allows you to pursue greater growth potential by investing in the market. Some variable annuities offer certain guarantees*, for an extra fee, to help ensure your investment is more protected from the market’s possible downside. 
What if you need to cancel?
Most fixed and variable annuities have a provision that allows you to cancel or surrender your policy. Surrender charges do apply on many products, typically between one and nine years, but they generally decrease every year during the surrender-charge period. Each annuity contract we offer is different, so make sure to read the terms carefully and work with a financial professional who understands the specifics of these products.
How could an annuity work for you? 
Contact expert and let us help you determine your best options.
 
New York Life annuities are issued by New York Life Insurance Company and New York Life Insurance and Annuity Corporation (NYLIAC) (a Delaware corporation) a wholly owned subsidiary of New York Life Insurance Company. Available in jurisdictions where approved.

All guarantees, including death benefit payments, are dependent on the claims-paying ability of New York Life Insurance and Annuity Corporation (NYLIAC) and do not apply to the investment performance of the underlying funds in the variable annuity.

Guaranteed income annuities.












It’s all about the guarantees.

0


You’ve worked hard. You’ve made the right moves planning for your retirement. Why not add more guaranteed income to your retirement cash flow?

A guaranteed income annuity from New York Life can help provide the income your retirement deserves with a guaranteed income stream for life. Simply put, it’s more income you can count on no matter what. You can purchase one before or after you retire. The money in your annuity—which you invest as a lump sum or through a series of payments, depending on the policy you choose—generates a stream of income paid to you for your lifetime. The amount you receive depends on several factors, including your age, gender, premium amount, and your chosen payout option.
New York Life offers several guaranteed income annuity products to meet your needs.

New York Life Guaranteed Lifetime Income Annuity is a single-premium immediate annuity that guarantees income payments for as long as you live.
Changing Needs Option.
New York Life Guaranteed Future Income Annuity is a deferred-income annuity that guarantees income payments—beginning after a chosen waiting period—for as long as you live. You also have the flexibility to make additional premium payments up to two years before your income start date.

New York Life has introduced a new income annuity product line called mutual income annuities. Mutual income annuities have the potential for additional income through dividends, if declared. Click on the appropriate fact sheets below for details on our mutual income annuity products.

New York Life Lifetime Mutual Income Annuity is a participating single-premium immediate income annuity that guarantees income payments for as long as you live, with the potential for dividend payments.1,2,3,4
New York Life Future Mutual Income Annuity is a participating deferred-income annuity that generates income—beginning after a chosen waiting period—for as long as you live, with the potential for dividend payouts.1,2,3,4

1Dividends are not guaranteed.
2Please note that the company’s previous history of dividend declarations and payments has primarily been in connection with its participating life insurance business. Mutual income annuities are participating annuity products, meaning they are also eligible to receive dividends when they are declared. However, the dividend scale for the annuity product will not be based on or related to the life insurance dividend scale. Mutual income annuities are new, and have no dividend history. Annuity premiums will be invested in a new portfolio that is separate and distinct from the existing life insurance portfolio. You should not compare the dividend-paying history of our life insurance policies or use that history in your decision to purchase this annuity. Guaranteed income payments, and dividend scales, can vary based on different factors, including the date we receive the premium payment or the date we apply a dividend to purchase additional income. Total income you receive may reflect different guaranteed amounts and different dividend scales for each income purchase.
3No dividends are payable in the first policy year. Dividends, if declared, can go up or down in value from year to year. For more information about income from a mutual income annuity, please request a personalized illustration.
4New York Life offers guaranteed income annuities that have higher guaranteed income than future mutual income and lifetime mutual income annuities, but do not offer the opportunity for dividends.

As with most other things in life, the key to achieving your long-term financial objectives is planning. Your goal may be to fund your children’s college education, protect your family during your working years, or guarantee your own retirement security. These things won’t happen by accident. It’s important to determine what you’d like to achieve financially and then map out a strategy that will help you meet those goals. The good news is that it’s never too late to start.

Of course, planning your financial future can be intimidating. Luckily, you don't have to do it alone. As a New York Life insurance agent, and a Registered Representative of NYLIFE Securities LLC.  I am a trained professional who can help you identify your financial needs and then determine which insurance and financial products can best help you meet your objectives.

Please use my Web site as a resource, and do not hesitate to contact me for additional information or to schedule a meeting. Thank you for your interest.

New York Life Insurance Company is a mutual insurance company, which means it is not publicly traded and has no shareholders. Instead, its policy owners are the ones who share in ownership rights of the company. With a mutual company, clients who purchase participating products are entitled to vote in the board of directors elections and are eligible to share in annual dividends that are declared. The company's priority is to safeguard their interests. Policies issued by our subsidiary companies are not participating and do not share in these rights.
Figure encompasses all policy owners of New York Life Insurance Company (NYLIC) and its insurance company subsidiaries. New York Life's company strength is based on several factors, including insurance in force. 
Figures reflect the consolidated results of NYLIC and its insurance subsidiaries presented on a statutory basis. Benefits paid primarily include death claims paid to beneficiaries and annuity payments. It also includes dividends paid to eligible policyholders. For more a more complete breakdown of this data, please see our Report to Policyholders.
**** While New York Life has historically paid a dividend on its participating policies, dividends on its participating policies are not guaranteed.

Note: All figures are as of Dec. 31 2015.
