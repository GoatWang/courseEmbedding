	Explanation of Responses:










	(1) 





	These shares of common stock of Extraction Oil & Gas, Inc. ("XOG") were received by the reporting person in connection with the merger of Extraction Oil & Gas Holdings, LLC ("Holdings") with and into XOG in connection with the closing of the initial public offering of XOG, pursuant to which the reporting person's equity ownership (including outstanding incentive units and restricted units) in Holdings were exchanged for shares of common stock in XOG determined by reference to XOG's implied valuation based on the 10-day volume weighted average price of XOG's common stock following the beginning of trading of XOG's common stock, in accordance with the distribution mechanics set forth in the limited liability company agreement of Holdings.









	(2) 





	Pursuant to the transactions described in footnote (1) to the reporting person's original Form 4 filed on October 28, 2016, Sierra Partners LLC received 70,019 shares of common stock. Mr. Gaensbauer is a partner at Sierra Partners LLC. The report on Form 4 filed on October 28, 2016 inadvertently omitted these shares. These shares were also omitted from one subsequently filed Form 4.
