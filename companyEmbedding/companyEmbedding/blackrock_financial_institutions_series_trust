FEATURED CHART
The economic side effects of the student loan crisis

June 28 / Rick Rieder
A college degree is still a must today; those without higher education face higher unemployment rates and lower earnings power. But the high cost of a degree is discouraging, especially to those who cannot afford college without loans in the first place. This could leave some unprepared for the workplace, worsening the class divide. The student loan crisis is a hardship for much more than just the borrowers.

NAVIGATING THE DOL FIDUCIARY RULE

Resources for building better portfolios after the rule

The BlackRock Investment Institute
Midyear investment outlook
Jul 10, 2017



By BlackRock Investment Institute








 







The global economy has settled into a steady growth rate slightly above the post-crisis trend. In fact, our BlackRock GPS suggests G7 growth over the coming year is set to comfortably exceed current consensus forecasts. Investors may want to embrace the implications of a durable economic expansion and favor risk assets like stocks over bonds.






 

Three themes to consider







 Sustained expansion



We believe the current cycle won’t die of old age any time soon. The economy still has slack for the recovery to chug on.








 Rethinking risk



Low volatility is no cause for alarm in and of itself. Placid markets are the norm when the economic backdrop is benign.








 Rethinking returns



Long-term bond yields are likely to remain low. This suggests stock valuations may not snap back to historical averages.














1. Sustained expansion
The current U.S. economic cycle has been unusually long, sparking fears that it may die of old age. We have a different take. Looking at the quantity of recovery rather than the time it has taken reveals an economy with ample slack to power on. Its remaining lifespan may be clocked in years, not quarters.
Room to runComparison of U.S. economic cycles from peaks to troughs, 1953-2017

Sources: BlackRock Investment Institute, with data from U.S. BEA, Congressional Budget Office, National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), July 2017. Notes: This chart compares real U.S. GDP with other cycles. Each line begins with the previous cycle’s peak, as determined by the NBER. We align the cycles based on their peaks, troughs and the point when potential output is reached. For details, see our interactive graphic at blackrockblog.com/cycles-in-context.
If growth persists for some time and valuations on stocks are more reasonable than historical averages suggest, the biggest danger investors face may be a premature flight to safety. Indeed, we believe the old adage holds: make hay while the sun is shining.


Take action: Stick to your guns in stocks
A sharp earnings recovery is supporting equities globally. We favor markets outside the U.S. and the  momentum style factor.

2. Rethinking risk
Much noise has been made around recent lows plumbed by volatility measures such as the VIX for the S&P 500 and MOVE for U.S. Treasuries. For some, this calm is causing consternation: Surely markets must obey the principle of mean reversion and volatility should march back to more “normal” levels? However, this popular line of reasoning features a flaw: Markets are typically docile when the economic backdrop is benign.
Low volatility ... with a long tailDistribution of realized monthly U.S. equity volatility, 1872-2017

Sources: BlackRock Investment Institute, with data from Robert Shiller, June 2017. Notes: Realized volatility is calculated as the annualized standard deviation of monthly changes in U.S. equities over a rolling 12-month period. Bars show the number of months at each level of volatility. Each bar represents a bucket of two percentage points in realized volatility. For example, the bar marked 10–12 shows that volatility was between 10% and 12% for 369 months.
This isn’t to suggest complacency is warranted. Spikes in volatility happen with some frequency and present real risk for flightier investors. However, a sustained shift into a high volatility state may require a real growth scare or systemic financial threat. As neither looks imminent (at least as we parse the signals), dialing down risk in portfolios today may leave investors tilting at windmills.


Take action: Keep calm but hedge on
Pairing stocks and bonds remains a prudent risk management play. More flexible, actively-managed strategies may help investors navigate fixed income markets in flux.

3. Rethinking returns
Expectations in the U.S. of imminent fiscal stimulus and infrastructure spending sent the 10-year Treasury yield soaring in early 2017 only to fall back over the course of the year. While we still believe bond yields will march higher over time, structural factors such as aging populations and high debt levels should cap any yield rise to levels well below pre-crisis norms. Naturally, it could be a bumpy road along the way.
Low yields matterDeveloped market real rates, neutral rates and trend growth, 1992-2017

Sources: BlackRock Investment Institute, with data from the Federal Reserve, U.S. BEA, Eurostat, Statistics Canada and Japan Cabinet Office, July 2017. Notes: This chart shows the GDP-weighted averages of 1 estimates of the neutral rate, called r*; 2 estimates of trend GDP growth rates, and; 3 the real short-term rate for the U.S., Japan, eurozone, UK and Canada. Data are through February 2017. For more details, see our Global macro outlook of November 2016 at blackrock.com/corporate/en-us/literature/whitepaper/bii-global-macro-outlook-november-2016.pdf.
This has an important equity market corollary. If, as we believe, bond yields remain low, financial logic suggests valuations on stocks could remain elevated for some time: A lower discount rate applied to future earnings will simply elevate their present value. And earnings momentum is strong across the world. This means stocks can sustain seemingly lofty multiples for longer than expected as long as bond yields are held down.

Carefully consider the Funds' investment objectives, risk factors, and charges and expenses before investing. This and other information can be found in the Funds' prospectuses or, if available, the summary prospectuses which may be obtained visiting the iShares ETF and BlackRock Mutual Fund prospectus pages. Read the prospectus carefully before investing.






Investing involves risk, including possible loss of principal.






Stock and bond values fluctuate in price so the value of your investment can go down depending on market conditions.






International investing involves risks, including risks related to foreign currency, limited liquidity, less government regulation and the possibility of substantial volatility due to adverse political, economic or other developments. These risks may be heightened for investments in emerging markets.






Fixed income risks include interest-rate and credit risk. Typically, when interest rates rise, there is a corresponding decline in bond values. Credit risk refers to the possibility that the bond issuer will not be able to make principal and interest payments.






There can be no assurance that performance will be enhanced for funds that seek to provide exposure to certain quantitative investment characteristics ("factors"). Exposure to such investment factors may detract from performance in some market environments, perhaps for extended periods. In such circumstances, a fund may seek to maintain exposure to the targeted investment factors and not adjust to target different factors, which could result in losses.






Asset allocation strategies do not assure profit and do not protect against loss.






Buying and selling shares of ETFs will result in brokerage commissions.






This information should not be relied upon by the reader as research or investment advice regarding the funds or any issuer or security in particular. The services described are strictly for illustrative and educational purposes and are not a recommendation, offer or solicitation to buy or sell any securities or to adopt any investment strategy.

Operating as a fiduciary






 




Building portfolios as a fiduciary requires deep understanding of your clients’ objectives in order to appropriately balance the risks and costs they may face. You may need a defendable and repeatable process to answer the pivotal question:Is this decision in the best interest of my client?



Not an all-inclusive illustration of the components ofthe portfolio construction process used by a financial advisor.











Objectives: This process starts with a deep understanding of a client’s specific objectives. When you spend the extra time to help them make better financial decisions, you solidify your relationships and demonstrate the value of the fees you charge. BlackRock has resources to guide you through these conversations and to assist you create a transparent, documented process. Lay the foundation with our objective-setting worksheets.


Risks: It’s important to contemplate portfolio risk in two dimensions: How much risk should be taken, and what types of risk are tolerable in the portfolio. These two questions should be used dynamically when working with clients to regularly align their objectives with the amount of risk they are willing to take to achieve them. Discover how we see and analyze risk.


Costs: Portfolio costs come in two categories: fees (transaction costs and management fees) and taxes. Each of these eat into the returns a portfolio generates. Advisors that build a documented cost budget into their portfolio construction process can limit the impact of this erosion and ensure they are incurring costs only when justified. Learn how to capture the best value across investments.






 























View Transcript


You’ve heard it before … eat right … exercise … get regular check-ups. And you know that, to be healthier, you SHOULD do those things. But what if there was a regulation that said you MUST do those things. The Department of Labor fiduciary rule underscores the importance of understanding your client’s personal and financial retirement objectives and building a portfolio based on that shared understanding.
As ERISA fiduciaries, advisors will need to demonstrate the value of the services they offer for the fees they charge … and it starts with meaningful personal relationships and deep understanding of client circumstances. Because these circumstances are what drive their financial objectives. When you look deeper, spend the extra time with clients … when you help them make better saving, spending and investing decisions … you solidify your client relationships, make them clients for life and demonstrate the value of the fees you charge.
*Research from Morningstar shows that investors who make intelligent financial planning decisions achieve better outcomes. They call it portfolio “gamma.” And, as a fiduciary, working to deeply understand client objectives … and regularly affirming those objectives ... may be the most important thing you do with clients. This is where you can add significant value … or gamma … to the client relationship.
Consider a process where you start by understanding the future purpose of the client’s money. Why are they investing? How much to they need? In what timeframe?
Then, assess different actions a client may need to take over time in order to achieve their desired goals. Do they need to work longer, spend less, or modify how they’re investing?
You and your client need to know their current cash flow to help determine how much … or how much more … they can save and invest. And, if retirement is the primary goal, understanding future cash flow can be more complicated.
Part of complying with DOL’s new regulation is having a documented process … that is transparent … to help address each client objective.
If your firm has a form for this, please use it. However, if not, BlackRock has resources to guide you through your process – including several worksheets that you can access here – to help you demonstrate your value proposition, add gamma to your client relationships AND meet your obligations as a fiduciary.










Understanding the DOL rule
The Department of Labor's (DOL) fiduciary rule, also known as the “conflict of interest” rule, extends fiduciary status and responsibilities under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) to a broader range of services relating to retirement assets, including IRAs.

As a fiduciary under ERISA, it is important for advisors and their firms to be able to demonstrate that each recommendation they make is in the best interest of the client.
At its core, the rule is intended to increase protections for individual investors by ensuring advisors are acting in their client's best interest and by addressing conflicts of interest.

Many wealth management firms are providing advisors with specific resources regarding the DOL rule. Regularly consult with your home office or legal counsel for guidance on the rule’s impact.
Read the full rule and exemptions here.
When will the DoL rule apply and what does that mean?
The fiduciary standard within the DOL fiduciary rule goes into effect on June 9, 2017. Full implementation of much of the detail of the rule has been delayed until January 1, 2018.
The delay will allow the DOL to receive further comments from the public and conduct additional analysis on the best way and the timeframe to implement this fiduciary standard. Furthermore, the SEC has recently sought public comment on the appropriate standard to be applied across all investment accounts, which may impact the rule’s full implementation.


In the transition period between June 9 and January 1, advisors are required to adhere to an “impartial conduct standard” for retirement accounts, which requires them to provide investment advice in the investors' best interest, receive no more than reasonable compensation and avoid misleading statements to investors about recommended transactions.
Between now and January 1, the DOL said it will not pursue claims against fiduciaries who are working in good faith to comply while it conducts an economic and legal analysis of the rule’s impact.


What does it mean to be an ERISA fiduciary? Are there exceptions under the rule?
ERISA fiduciaries must comply with ERISA’s prohibited transaction rules or operate under specific exemptions where available. In other words, simply disclosing or receiving consent for the conflict will not make it permissible. Intermediaries who are fiduciaries are precluded from receiving compensation that varies depending on the investment product or program, absent a specific exemption.

Absent an exemption, prohibited transactions under ERISA include:

Dealing with client assets for a fiduciary’s own interest or own account.
Acting on both sides of a transaction.
Receiving any consideration for a fiduciary’s own account in connection with a transaction involving client assets.



The fiduciary rule does contain key exemptions, and one is particularly important:

The Best Interest Contract (BIC) Exemption allows ERISA fiduciaries to receive otherwise prohibited payments (i.e., receive variable compensation) provided that the advisor meets certain conditions and adheres to an “Impartial Conduct Standard.”

To rely on the BIC and provide advice relating to IRA accounts, an advisor and firm must:

Act in the client’s best interest and charge reasonable compensation.
Not use inappropriate incentives to favor certain products or services.
Provide extensive disclosure of all payments received from providers.
Not prohibit clients from engaging in class-action litigation to resolve claims. 
Enter into a written contract which contains these terms and more.

The disclosure and contract requirements will not be enforced until January 1, 2018.

BLACKROCK SUMMIT CASH RESERVES FUND                           NOVEMBER 30, 2007 

A Letter to Shareholders                                                        

Dear Shareholder                                                                

The November reporting period was fairly tumultuous for financial markets,      
culminating in mixed results for some of the major benchmark indexes:

Subprime mortgage woes dominated headlines for much of 2007, but intensified    
in the summer and fall, spawning a widespread liquidity and credit crisis with  
ramifications across global markets. The Federal Reserve Board (the "Fed")      
stepped in to inject liquidity into the markets and bolster investor            
confidence, cutting the federal funds rate by 0.50% in September, 0.25% in      
October and 0.25% in December, which brought the target short-term interest     
rate to 4.25%. In taking action, the central bankers, who had long deemed       
themselves inflation fighters, were seeking to stem the fallout from the        
credit crunch and forestall a wider economic unraveling.                        

Amid the volatility throughout 2007, equity markets displayed surprising        
resilience. To some extent, the credit turmoil dampened corporate merger-and-   
acquisition (M&A) activity, a key source of strength for equity markets.        
Still, market fundamentals generally held firm, dividend payouts and share      
buybacks continued, and valuations remained attractive. As the returns          
indicate, the most recent six months were more trying, reflecting the slowing   
U.S. economy, a troubled housing market and a more difficult corporate          
earnings backdrop. Overall, large cap stocks outperformed small caps as         
investors grew increasingly risk averse. International markets fared better     
than their U.S. counterparts, benefiting from generally stronger economies.     

In fixed income markets, mixed economic signals and the credit woes resulted    
in a flight to quality. Investors shunned bonds associated with the housing     
and credit markets in favor of higher-quality Treasury issues. The yield on     
10-year Treasury issues, which touched 5.30% in June (its highest level in      
five years), fell to 3.97% by period-end, while prices correspondingly rose.    
Meanwhile, the tax-exempt bond market has been challenged by a combination of   
record-setting supply, economic uncertainty and concerns around the credit      
worthiness of bond insurers. This brought municipal bond prices to relatively   
attractive levels and, as such, demand generally held firm.

goals with your financial professional and to make portfolio changes, as

THIS PAGE NOT PART OF YOUR FUND REPORT                                          

Disclosure of Expenses                                                          

Shareholders of this Fund may incur the following charges: (a) expenses         
related to transactions, including sales charges, redemption fees and exchange  
fees; and (b) operating expenses including advisory fees, distribution fees     
including 12b-1 fees, and other Fund expenses. The expense example below        
(which is based on a hypothetical investment of $1,000 invested on June 1,
2007 and held through November 30, 2007) is intended to assist shareholders     
both in calculating expenses based on an investment in the Fund and in          
comparing these expenses with similar costs of investing in other mutual funds. 

The table provides information about actual account values and actual           
expenses. In order to estimate the expenses a shareholder paid during the       
period covered by this report, shareholders can divide their account value by   
$1,000 and then multiply the result by the number in the first line under the   
heading entitled "Expenses Paid During the Period."                             

The table also provides information about hypothetical account values and       
hypothetical expenses based on the Fund's actual expense ratio and an assumed   
rate of return of 5% per year before expenses. In order to assist shareholders  
in comparing the ongoing expenses of investing in this Fund and other funds,    
compare the 5% hypothetical example with the 5% hypothetical examples that      
appear in other funds' shareholder reports.                                     

The expenses shown in the table are intended to highlight shareholders'         
ongoing costs only and do not reflect any transactional expenses, such as       
sales charges, redemption fees or exchange fees. Therefore, the hypothetical    
table is useful in comparing ongoing expenses only, and will not help           
shareholders determine the relative total expenses of owning different funds.   
If these transactional expenses were included, shareholder expenses would have  
been higher.

     ratio for the class (1.02% for Investor A and 1.86% for Investor B),                                             
     multiplied by the average account value over the period, multiplied by

 **  Hypothetical 5% annual return before expenses is calculated by pro-rating                                        
     the number of days in the most recent fiscal half year divided by 365.

BLACKROCK SUMMIT CASH RESERVES FUND                           NOVEMBER 30, 2007 

Notes to Financial Statements (Unaudited)                                       

1. Significant Accounting Policies:                                             

BlackRock Summit Cash Reserves Fund (the "Fund"), a separate fund offering      
separate classes of shares of BlackRock Financial Institutions Series Trust     
(the "Trust"), is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as       
amended, as a diversified, open-end management investment company, which        
comprises a series of separate portfolios offering separate classes of shares   
to select groups of purchasers. The Fund is currently the only operating        
series of the Trust. The Fund's financial statements are prepared in            
conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, which may        
require the use of management accruals and estimates. Actual results may        
differ from these estimates. These unaudited financial statements reflect all   
adjustments, which are, in the opinion of management, necessary to present a    
fair statement of the results for the interim period.  All such adjustments     
are of a normal, recurring nature. Both classes of shares have equal voting,    
dividend, liquidation and other rights, except that only shares of the          
respective classes are entitled to vote on matters concerning only that class   
and Investor B Shares bear certain expenses related to the distribution of      
such shares. Income, expenses (other than expenses attributable to a specific   
class) and realized and unrealized gains and losses are allocated daily to      
each class based on its relative net assets. The following is a summary of      
significant accounting policies followed by the Fund.                           

(a) Valuation of investments--Short-term securities are valued at amortized     
cost, which approximates market value.                                          

(b) Income taxes--It is the Fund's policy to comply with the requirements of    
the Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment companies and to   
distribute all of its taxable income to its shareholders. Therefore, no         
federal income tax provision is required.                                       

(c) Security transactions and investment income--Security transactions are      
recorded on the dates the transactions are entered into (the trade dates).      
Realized gains and losses on security transactions are determined on the        
identified cost basis. Interest income (including amortization of premium and   
discount) is recognized on the accrual basis.                                   

(d) Prepaid registration fees--Prepaid registration fees are charged to         
expense as the related shares are issued.                                       

(e) Dividends and distributions to shareholders--The Fund declares dividends    
daily and reinvests monthly such dividends (net of non-resident alien tax and   
backup withholding tax) in additional fund shares at net asset value.           
Dividends are declared from the total of net investment income. Distributions   
of net realized gain, if any, on investments are paid at least annually.        

(f) Securities lending--The Fund may lend securities to financial institutions  
that provide cash or securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government as  
collateral, which will be maintained at all times in an amount equal to at      
least 100% of the current market value of the loaned securities. The market     
value of the loaned securities is determined at the close of business of the    
Fund and any additional required collateral is delivered to the Fund on the     
next business day. Where the Fund receives securities as collateral for the     
loaned securities, it collects a fee from the borrower. The Fund typically      
receives the income on the loaned securities but does not receive the income    
on the collateral. Where the Fund receives cash collateral, it may invest such  
collateral and retain the amount earned on such investment, net of any amount   
rebated to the borrower. Loans of securities are terminable at any time and     
the borrower, after notice, is required to return borrowed securities within    
five business days. The Fund may pay reasonable finder's, lending agent,        
administrative and custodial fees in connection with its loans. In the event    
that the borrower defaults on its obligation to return borrowed securities      
because of insolvency or for any other reason, the Fund could experience        
delays and costs in gaining access to the collateral. The Fund also could       
suffer a loss where the value of the collateral falls below the market value    
of the borrowed securities, in the event of borrower default or in the event    
of losses on investments made with cash collateral.                             

(g) Recent accounting pronouncements--Effective June 29, 2007, the Fund         
implemented Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Interpretation        
No. 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes--an interpretation of       
FASB Statement No. 109" ("FIN 48"). FIN 48 prescribes the minimum recognition   
threshold a tax position must meet in connection with accounting for            
uncertainties in income tax positions taken or expected to be taken by an       
entity, including investment companies, before being measured and recognized    
in the financial statements. Management has evaluated the application of FIN    
48 to the Fund, and has determined that the adoption of FIN 48 does not have    
a material impact on the Fund's financial statements. The Fund files U.S.       
and various state tax returns. No income tax returns are currently under        
examination. The statute of limitations on the Fund's tax returns remains       
open for the years ended May 31, 2004 through May 31, 2007.                     

BLACKROCK SUMMIT CASH RESERVES FUND                           NOVEMBER 30, 2007 

Notes to Financial Statements (continued)                                       

In September 2006, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, "Fair   
Value Measurements" ("FAS 157"), was issued and is effective for fiscal years   
beginning after November 15, 2007. FAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a    
framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value     
measurements. At this time, management is evaluating the implications of FAS    
157 and its impact on the Fund's financial statements, if any, has not been     
determined.                                                                     

In addition, in February 2007, Statement of Financial Accounting Standard       
No. 159, "The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial              
Liabilities" ("FAS 159"), was issued and is effective for fiscal years          
beginning after November 15, 2007. Early adoption is permitted as of the        
beginning of a fiscal year that begins on or before November 15, 2007,          
provided the entity also elects to apply the provisions of FAS 157. FAS 159     
permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain    
other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at     
fair value. FAS 159 also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements   
designed to facilitate comparisons between entities that choose different       
measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities. At this     
time, management is evaluating the implications of FAS 159 and its impact on    
the Fund's financial statements, if any, has not been determined.               

2. Investment Advisory Agreement and Transactions with Affiliates:              

The Fund has entered into an Investment Advisory Agreement with BlackRock       
Advisors, LLC (the "Manager"), an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of          
BlackRock, Inc. Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc. ("Merrill Lynch") and The PNC         
Financial Services Group, Inc. ("PNC") are the principal owners of              
BlackRock, Inc. The Fund has also entered into a separate Distribution          
Agreement and Distribution Plan with FAM Distributors, Inc. ("FAMD") and        
BlackRock Distributors, Inc. and its affiliates ("BDI") (collectively, the      
"Distributor"). FAMD is a wholly owned subsidiary of Merrill Lynch Group,       
Inc. and BDI is an affiliate of BlackRock, Inc.                                 

The Manager is responsible for the management of the Fund's portfolio and       
provides the necessary personnel, facilities and equipment to provide such      
services to the Fund. The Manager also performs certain administrative          
services necessary for the operation of the Trust and the Fund. For such        
services, the Manager receives a fee from the Fund at the end of each month at  
the annual rate of .50% of the average daily net assets of the Fund.            

In addition, the Manager has entered into a sub-advisory agreement with         
BlackRock Institutional Management Corporation, an affiliate of the Manager,    
under which the Manager pays the sub-adviser for services it provides a         
monthly fee at an annual rate equal to a percentage of the management fee paid  
by the Fund to the Manager.                                                     

Pursuant to the Distribution Plan adopted by the Fund in accordance with Rule   
12b-1 under the Investment Company Act of 1940, the Fund pays the Distributor   
an ongoing distribution fee accrued daily and paid monthly at the annual rate   
of .75% of the Fund's average daily net assets attributable to Investor B       
Shares. This fee is used to help defray the expenses associated with marketing  
activities and services related to Investor B Shares.                           

For the six months ended November 30, 2007, affiliates received contingent      
deferred sales charges of $25,730 relating to transactions in Investor B        
Shares. Furthermore, affiliates received contingent deferred sales charges of   
$11,824 relating to transactions subject to front-end sales charge waivers in   
Investor A Shares.                                                              

The Manager maintains a call center, which is responsible for providing         
certain shareholder services to the Fund, such as responding to shareholder     
inquiries and processing transactions based upon instructions from              
shareholders with respect to the subscription and redemption of Fund shares.    
During the six months ended November 31, 2007, the following amounts have been  
accrued by the Fund to reimburse BlackRock for costs incurred running the call  
center, which are a component of the transfer agent fees in the accompanying    
Statement of Operations.

Investor B                                      $857                            

The Fund has received an exemptive order from the Securities and Exchange       
Commission permitting it to lend portfolio securities to Merrill Lynch,         
Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, a wholly owned subsidiary of Merrill       
Lynch, or its affiliates. Pursuant to that order, the Fund has retained         
BlackRock Investment Management, LLC ("BIM"), an affiliate of the Manager, as   
the securities lending agent for a fee based on a share of the returns on       
investment of cash collateral. BIM may, on behalf of the Fund, invest cash      
collateral received by the Fund for such loans, among other things, in a        
private investment company managed by the Manager or in registered money        
market funds advised by the Manager or its affiliates.                          

PFPC Inc., an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of PNC and an affiliate of the  
Manager, is the Fund's transfer agent.                                          

For the six months ended November 30, 2007, the Fund reimbursed the Manager     
$515 for certain accounting services.

BlackRock Privacy Principles                                                    

BlackRock is committed to maintaining the privacy of its current and former     
fund investors and individual clients (collectively, "Clients") and to          
safeguarding their nonpublic personal information. The following information    
is provided to help you understand what personal information BlackRock          
collects, how we protect that information and why in certain cases we share     
such information with select parties.                                           

If you are located in a jurisdiction where specific laws, rules or regulations  
require BlackRock to provide you with additional or different privacy-related   
rights beyond what is set forth below, then BlackRock will comply with those    
specific laws, rules or regulations.                                            

BlackRock obtains or verifies personal nonpublic information from and about     
you from different sources, including the following: (i) information we         
receive from you or, if applicable, your financial intermediary, on             
applications, forms or other documents; (ii) information about your             
transactions with us, our affiliates, or others; (iii) information we receive   
from a consumer reporting agency; and (iv) from visits to our Web sites.        

BlackRock does not sell or disclose to nonaffiliated third parties any          
non-public personal information about its Clients, except as permitted by       
law or as is necessary to respond to regulatory requests or to service Client   
accounts. These nonaffiliated third parties are required to protect the         
confidentiality and security of this information and to use it only for its     
intended purpose.                                                               

We may share information with our affiliates to service your account or to      
provide you with information about other BlackRock products or services that    
may be of interest to you. In addition, BlackRock restricts access to           
nonpublic personal information about its Clients to those BlackRock employees   
with a legitimate business need for the information. BlackRock maintains        
physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that are designed to protect     
the nonpublic personal information of its Clients, including procedures         
relating to the proper storage and disposal of such information.                

Availability of Additional Information                                          

Electronic copies of most financial reports and prospectuses are available on   
the Fund's Web site or shareholders can sign up for e-mail notifications of     
quarterly statements, annual and semi-annual reports and prospectuses by        
enrolling in the Fund's electronic delivery program.                            

To enroll:

advisers, banks or brokerages may offer this service.

1) Access the BlackRock Web site at

The Fund will mail only one copy of shareholder documents, including            
prospectuses, annual and semi-annual reports and proxy statements, to           
shareholders with multiple accounts at the same address. This practice is       
commonly called "householding" and it is intended to reduce expenses and        
eliminate duplicate mailings of shareholder documents. Mailings of your         
shareholder documents may be householded indefinitely unless you instruct us    
otherwise. If you do not want the mailing of these documents to be combined     
with those for other members of your household, please contact the Fund at

FEATURED CHART
The economic side effects of the student loan crisis

June 28 / Rick Rieder
A college degree is still a must today; those without higher education face higher unemployment rates and lower earnings power. But the high cost of a degree is discouraging, especially to those who cannot afford college without loans in the first place. This could leave some unprepared for the workplace, worsening the class divide. The student loan crisis is a hardship for much more than just the borrowers.

The BlackRock Investment Institute
Midyear investment outlook
Jul 10, 2017



By BlackRock Investment Institute








 







The global economy has settled into a steady growth rate slightly above the post-crisis trend. In fact, our BlackRock GPS suggests G7 growth over the coming year is set to comfortably exceed current consensus forecasts. Investors may want to embrace the implications of a durable economic expansion and favor risk assets like stocks over bonds.






 

Three themes to consider







 Sustained expansion



We believe the current cycle won’t die of old age any time soon. The economy still has slack for the recovery to chug on.








 Rethinking risk



Low volatility is no cause for alarm in and of itself. Placid markets are the norm when the economic backdrop is benign.








 Rethinking returns



Long-term bond yields are likely to remain low. This suggests stock valuations may not snap back to historical averages.














1. Sustained expansion
The current U.S. economic cycle has been unusually long, sparking fears that it may die of old age. We have a different take. Looking at the quantity of recovery rather than the time it has taken reveals an economy with ample slack to power on. Its remaining lifespan may be clocked in years, not quarters.
Room to runComparison of U.S. economic cycles from peaks to troughs, 1953-2017

Sources: BlackRock Investment Institute, with data from U.S. BEA, Congressional Budget Office, National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), July 2017. Notes: This chart compares real U.S. GDP with other cycles. Each line begins with the previous cycle’s peak, as determined by the NBER. We align the cycles based on their peaks, troughs and the point when potential output is reached. For details, see our interactive graphic at blackrockblog.com/cycles-in-context.
If growth persists for some time and valuations on stocks are more reasonable than historical averages suggest, the biggest danger investors face may be a premature flight to safety. Indeed, we believe the old adage holds: make hay while the sun is shining.


Take action: Stick to your guns in stocks
A sharp earnings recovery is supporting equities globally. We favor markets outside the U.S. and the  momentum style factor.

2. Rethinking risk
Much noise has been made around recent lows plumbed by volatility measures such as the VIX for the S&P 500 and MOVE for U.S. Treasuries. For some, this calm is causing consternation: Surely markets must obey the principle of mean reversion and volatility should march back to more “normal” levels? However, this popular line of reasoning features a flaw: Markets are typically docile when the economic backdrop is benign.
Low volatility ... with a long tailDistribution of realized monthly U.S. equity volatility, 1872-2017

Sources: BlackRock Investment Institute, with data from Robert Shiller, June 2017. Notes: Realized volatility is calculated as the annualized standard deviation of monthly changes in U.S. equities over a rolling 12-month period. Bars show the number of months at each level of volatility. Each bar represents a bucket of two percentage points in realized volatility. For example, the bar marked 10–12 shows that volatility was between 10% and 12% for 369 months.
This isn’t to suggest complacency is warranted. Spikes in volatility happen with some frequency and present real risk for flightier investors. However, a sustained shift into a high volatility state may require a real growth scare or systemic financial threat. As neither looks imminent (at least as we parse the signals), dialing down risk in portfolios today may leave investors tilting at windmills.


Take action: Keep calm but hedge on
Pairing stocks and bonds remains a prudent risk management play. More flexible, actively-managed strategies may help investors navigate fixed income markets in flux.

3. Rethinking returns
Expectations in the U.S. of imminent fiscal stimulus and infrastructure spending sent the 10-year Treasury yield soaring in early 2017 only to fall back over the course of the year. While we still believe bond yields will march higher over time, structural factors such as aging populations and high debt levels should cap any yield rise to levels well below pre-crisis norms. Naturally, it could be a bumpy road along the way.
Low yields matterDeveloped market real rates, neutral rates and trend growth, 1992-2017

Sources: BlackRock Investment Institute, with data from the Federal Reserve, U.S. BEA, Eurostat, Statistics Canada and Japan Cabinet Office, July 2017. Notes: This chart shows the GDP-weighted averages of 1 estimates of the neutral rate, called r*; 2 estimates of trend GDP growth rates, and; 3 the real short-term rate for the U.S., Japan, eurozone, UK and Canada. Data are through February 2017. For more details, see our Global macro outlook of November 2016 at blackrock.com/corporate/en-us/literature/whitepaper/bii-global-macro-outlook-november-2016.pdf.
This has an important equity market corollary. If, as we believe, bond yields remain low, financial logic suggests valuations on stocks could remain elevated for some time: A lower discount rate applied to future earnings will simply elevate their present value. And earnings momentum is strong across the world. This means stocks can sustain seemingly lofty multiples for longer than expected as long as bond yields are held down.

Carefully consider the Funds' investment objectives, risk factors, and charges and expenses before investing. This and other information can be found in the Funds' prospectuses or, if available, the summary prospectuses which may be obtained visiting the iShares ETF and BlackRock Mutual Fund prospectus pages. Read the prospectus carefully before investing.






Investing involves risk, including possible loss of principal.






Stock and bond values fluctuate in price so the value of your investment can go down depending on market conditions.






International investing involves risks, including risks related to foreign currency, limited liquidity, less government regulation and the possibility of substantial volatility due to adverse political, economic or other developments. These risks may be heightened for investments in emerging markets.






Fixed income risks include interest-rate and credit risk. Typically, when interest rates rise, there is a corresponding decline in bond values. Credit risk refers to the possibility that the bond issuer will not be able to make principal and interest payments.






There can be no assurance that performance will be enhanced for funds that seek to provide exposure to certain quantitative investment characteristics ("factors"). Exposure to such investment factors may detract from performance in some market environments, perhaps for extended periods. In such circumstances, a fund may seek to maintain exposure to the targeted investment factors and not adjust to target different factors, which could result in losses.






Asset allocation strategies do not assure profit and do not protect against loss.






Buying and selling shares of ETFs will result in brokerage commissions.






This information should not be relied upon by the reader as research or investment advice regarding the funds or any issuer or security in particular. The services described are strictly for illustrative and educational purposes and are not a recommendation, offer or solicitation to buy or sell any securities or to adopt any investment strategy. Services described may not be available to all investors.

Operating as a fiduciary






 




Building portfolios as a fiduciary requires deep understanding of your clients’ objectives in order to appropriately balance the risks and costs they may face. You may need a defendable and repeatable process to answer the pivotal question:Is this decision in the best interest of my client?



Not an all-inclusive illustration of the components ofthe portfolio construction process used by a financial advisor.











Objectives: This process starts with a deep understanding of a client’s specific objectives. When you spend the extra time to help them make better financial decisions, you solidify your relationships and demonstrate the value of the fees you charge. BlackRock has resources to guide you through these conversations and to assist you create a transparent, documented process. Lay the foundation with our objective-setting worksheets.


Risks: It’s important to contemplate portfolio risk in two dimensions: How much risk should be taken, and what types of risk are tolerable in the portfolio. These two questions should be used dynamically when working with clients to regularly align their objectives with the amount of risk they are willing to take to achieve them. Discover how we see and analyze risk.


Costs: Portfolio costs come in two categories: fees (transaction costs and management fees) and taxes. Each of these eat into the returns a portfolio generates. Advisors that build a documented cost budget into their portfolio construction process can limit the impact of this erosion and ensure they are incurring costs only when justified. Learn how to capture the best value across investments.

You’ve heard it before … eat right … exercise … get regular check-ups. And you know that, to be healthier, you SHOULD do those things. But what if there was a regulation that said you MUST do those things. The Department of Labor fiduciary rule underscores the importance of understanding your client’s personal and financial retirement objectives and building a portfolio based on that shared understanding.
As ERISA fiduciaries, advisors will need to demonstrate the value of the services they offer for the fees they charge … and it starts with meaningful personal relationships and deep understanding of client circumstances. Because these circumstances are what drive their financial objectives. When you look deeper, spend the extra time with clients … when you help them make better saving, spending and investing decisions … you solidify your client relationships, make them clients for life and demonstrate the value of the fees you charge.
*Research from Morningstar shows that investors who make intelligent financial planning decisions achieve better outcomes. They call it portfolio “gamma.” And, as a fiduciary, working to deeply understand client objectives … and regularly affirming those objectives ... may be the most important thing you do with clients. This is where you can add significant value … or gamma … to the client relationship.
Consider a process where you start by understanding the future purpose of the client’s money. Why are they investing? How much to they need? In what timeframe?
Then, assess different actions a client may need to take over time in order to achieve their desired goals. Do they need to work longer, spend less, or modify how they’re investing?
You and your client need to know their current cash flow to help determine how much … or how much more … they can save and invest. And, if retirement is the primary goal, understanding future cash flow can be more complicated.
Part of complying with DOL’s new regulation is having a documented process … that is transparent … to help address each client objective.
If your firm has a form for this, please use it. However, if not, BlackRock has resources to guide you through your process – including several worksheets that you can access here – to help you demonstrate your value proposition, add gamma to your client relationships AND meet your obligations as a fiduciary.










Understanding the DOL rule
The Department of Labor's (DOL) fiduciary rule, also known as the “conflict of interest” rule, extends fiduciary status and responsibilities under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) to a broader range of services relating to retirement assets, including IRAs.

As a fiduciary under ERISA, it is important for advisors and their firms to be able to demonstrate that each recommendation they make is in the best interest of the client.
At its core, the rule is intended to increase protections for individual investors by ensuring advisors are acting in their client's best interest and by addressing conflicts of interest.

Many wealth management firms are providing advisors with specific resources regarding the DOL rule. Regularly consult with your home office or legal counsel for guidance on the rule’s impact.
Read the full rule and exemptions here.
When will the DoL rule apply and what does that mean?
The fiduciary standard within the DOL fiduciary rule goes into effect on June 9, 2017. Full implementation of much of the detail of the rule has been delayed until January 1, 2018.
The delay will allow the DOL to receive further comments from the public and conduct additional analysis on the best way and the timeframe to implement this fiduciary standard. Furthermore, the SEC has recently sought public comment on the appropriate standard to be applied across all investment accounts, which may impact the rule’s full implementation.


In the transition period between June 9 and January 1, advisors are required to adhere to an “impartial conduct standard” for retirement accounts, which requires them to provide investment advice in the investors' best interest, receive no more than reasonable compensation and avoid misleading statements to investors about recommended transactions.
Between now and January 1, the DOL said it will not pursue claims against fiduciaries who are working in good faith to comply while it conducts an economic and legal analysis of the rule’s impact.


What does it mean to be an ERISA fiduciary? Are there exceptions under the rule?
ERISA fiduciaries must comply with ERISA’s prohibited transaction rules or operate under specific exemptions where available. In other words, simply disclosing or receiving consent for the conflict will not make it permissible. Intermediaries who are fiduciaries are precluded from receiving compensation that varies depending on the investment product or program, absent a specific exemption.

Absent an exemption, prohibited transactions under ERISA include:

Dealing with client assets for a fiduciary’s own interest or own account.
Acting on both sides of a transaction.
Receiving any consideration for a fiduciary’s own account in connection with a transaction involving client assets.



The fiduciary rule does contain key exemptions, and one is particularly important:

The Best Interest Contract (BIC) Exemption allows ERISA fiduciaries to receive otherwise prohibited payments (i.e., receive variable compensation) provided that the advisor meets certain conditions and adheres to an “Impartial Conduct Standard.”

To rely on the BIC and provide advice relating to IRA accounts, an advisor and firm must:

Act in the client’s best interest and charge reasonable compensation.
Not use inappropriate incentives to favor certain products or services.
Provide extensive disclosure of all payments received from providers.
Not prohibit clients from engaging in class-action litigation to resolve claims. 
Enter into a written contract which contains these terms and more.

The disclosure and contract requirements will not be enforced until January 1, 2018.
