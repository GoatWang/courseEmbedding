		Ways of Reading and Jane Tompkins
	

 - Ways of Reading and Jane Tompkins 	   In the book, Ways of Reading, the authors Bartholomae and Petrosky outline what they describe as a "strong reader". They characterize the attributes that collectively contribute to this title and then talk about the relations between a strong reader and a strong writer. The perspectives that Bartholomae and Petrosky discuss on ideas and textual analysis are very interesting and in point of fact remind me of the thought process of which I use when analyzing a reading....   [tags: Papers]

		The Radical Impact of Reading
	

 - ... Conversely, giving strict standards for essay writing in any field of study may prevent authors from truly communicating and being in communion with their readers. In a literate culture, books (their existence and the subjects most common within one community) have an unimaginable influence on the development of social attitudes. Small communities, such as book clubs and fan clubs, are formed around several peoples’ interest in a particular genre or author. The ideals divulged in a book—whether implicit or explicit— have the power to shape the ideals of the reader or a group of readers....   [tags: tompkins’ theory, communication, advantages]

		Jane Eyre: Brontë's Mother Affected Jane
	

 - Would a person describe the personality and acts of their mothers as loving or nurturing or quite possibly witty with her words. When one thinks of a Mother, be it their own or another, one would usually describe them as caring, affectionate, protective; however, with her mother having died when she was a young age of five, Charlotte Brontë never had the chance to understand how essential those traits were to a child and grew up under the care and teachings of her father; which was what helped lead to her strong and virtuous independence: the lack of a mother's love and guide....   [tags: Jane Eyre]

		Jane Eyre: The Freedom of Love
	

 - Parallel to many of the great feministic novels throughout literary history, Jane Eyre is a story about the quest for authentic love.

		Jane Eyre's Development With Characterization
	

 - Two major men teach Jane to appreciate the complexities of her emotions and passions for life: Mr. Rochester and St. John. Both are antithesis of each other but both help Jane blossom into a woman with morals and ideals. With Mr. Rochester, she thrives in Thornfield’s environment where she does not need to suppress her passion and responds naturally to Rochester’s strong fervor. Because she did not receive proper moral schooling as a child, she did not know how to control her emotions. This problem is solved when Rochester fully exploits Jane’s weakness to his advantage by constantly making her feel jealous and inferior....   [tags: Jane Eyre]

		Jane Erye's Experience as a Governess
	

 - A governess is an educated woman who works for a family by teaching the school age children. It was the type of job that almost all young girls would not want to be but ironically the children of the household most likely admired and were very fond of their governess.

		Sympathy for the Character in Charlotte Brontë’s Jane Eyre
	

 - In Charlotte Brontë’s ‘Jane Eyre’, Jane instantly manages to make the reader empathise with her character. The way in which Brontë evokes this sympathy is by using a number of different methods: characterisation, the way in which the hierarchy of the characters is displayed, both physically and metaphorically; intricate choice of language, for example romanticising certain parts of the book to show intimacy between the characters and the reader; setting is also used to create sympathy for example the use of pathetic fallacy, is manipulated in conjunction with Jane’s mood or significance; narrative voices and the use of first person views throughout the entire book, create a negative semantic...   [tags: Jane Eyre Essays]

		 Charlotte Bronte Critiques Victorian Culture in Jane Eyre
	

 - “Nothing is so painful to the human mind as a great and sudden change.” Mary Shelley, in addition to the direct interpretation, suggests with this declaration that not only are humans resistant to and resentful of change, but so too are the societies in which they live, especially when the social order is directly challenged. This natural tendency causes change to occur slowly in societies after years of different ‘radicals’ pushing for transformation. Their critiques, especially in the beginning, are received with scorn and contempt....   [tags:  Jane Eyre Essays]

		Oppression, Suffering, and Poverty of Men in Jane Eyre
	

 - The novel Jane Eyre, by Charlotte Brontë, depicts the coming of age of a woman who encounters great hardships, obstacles, and heartbreak. During the Victorian era women were subordinate to men and often times lacked the same opportunities and privileges that society and the family structure gave to men. Although society and the family structure of the Victorian era treated men and women differently, men were also oppressed, experienced suffering, and had to overcome poverty, but due to the masculinity that men were forced to portray during the era often times the hardships of men have been overlooked when analyzing the men in Jane Eyre....   [tags: Jane Eyre Essays]
