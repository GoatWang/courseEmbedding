Privacy Policy
Please contact Angel Oak’s compliance department for information regarding the fund’s privacy policy.
Adam Langley Chief Compliance Officer
404-637-0412 One Buckhead Plaza Suite 500 3060 Peachtree Road, NW Atlanta, GA 30305
I. Introduction
Pursuant to Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) Regulation S-P, investment advisers must adopt and implement policies and procedures designed to: 1) ensure the security and confidentiality of Client records and information; 2) protect against any anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of Client records and information; and, 3) protect against unauthorized access to or use of Client records or information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any Client.  Furthermore, investment advisers must provide their Clients with an initial privacy notice at the time a Client relationship is established and an annual privacy notice thereafter.  As private fund(s) or other pooled investment vehicle(s) are not natural persons, investment advisers are not required to provide privacy notices to each private fund or other pooled investment vehicle Client; however, Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) rules require that the private fund(s) or other pooled investment vehicle(s) provide their investors, who are natural persons, with initial and annual privacy notices. 
II. Policy
Angel Oak Capital Advisors, LLC (“Angel Oak”) does not disclose any nonpublic personal information about its Clients to nonaffiliated third parties except to service or manage the Client’s account or as permitted by law.  Furthermore, Angel Oak restricts access to the personal information of its Clients to those employees who need that information to provide products or services to the Client.  If a Client closes their account, Angel Oak will continue to adhere to its privacy policy with respect to the nonpublic personal information of that Client.  The disposal of nonpublic personal information shall be done in a secure manner as described in Section XIX of Angel Oak’s Compliance Manual.  Angel Oak must also comply with the California Financial Information Privacy Act (SB1) if business is conducted with California Clients.  For Clients who are Massachusetts residents, Angel Oak will follow the Massachusetts Standards for Protection of Personal Information (210 CMR).

IV. Opt Out Right
Every Client has the right to direct Angel Oak to not disclose the nonpublic personal information about that Client to a nonaffiliated third party.  If a Client would like to exercise its right to opt out of Angel Oak’s privacy policy, each Client must provide a written statement exercising that right.  This right to opt out may be exercised at any time and will remain in effect until written notice revoking said right is received by Angel Oak from the Client.  However, in the event Angel Oak encounters circumstances where it is compelled by law to disclose the Client’s nonpublic personal information, Angel Oak must provide the Client’s information even if the Client has exercised its right to opt out.
V. Confidentiality and Security
Except as described below, access to nonpublic information about clients, former clients and prospective clients is restricted to Angel Oak employees who need to know that information in order to provide products or services to Clients.  Those employees with access to nonpublic personal information are required to protect the confidentiality of that information.   Angel Oak maintains physical and procedural safeguards to protect your nonpublic personal information.

**As of 6/30/17, the Angel Oak Multi-Strategy Income Fund (ANGLX) received a Morningstar rating based on risk-adjusted returns of 5 stars overall, 4 stars for the three-year period & 5 stars for the five-year period among 233, 233, and 190 multisector bond funds, respectively. The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or “star rating”, is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history, without adjustment for sales loads. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product’s monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating™ for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating™ metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.
**As of 6/30/17, the Angel Oak High Yield Opportunities Fund (ANHIX) received a Morningstar rating based on risk-adjusted returns of 4 stars overall, 5 stars for the three-year period and 4 stars for the five-year period among 590, 590, and 474 high yield bond funds. The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or “star rating”, is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history, without adjustment for sales loads. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes.

 ON 
 Leaf Group 
 
Giving the world what it wants to know.
With information and entertainment now expected to be at everyone’s fingertips, it takes a determined company to make it happen. Today, Leaf Group—with Oak’s investment and partnership—is able to reach more than 125 million visitors every month across a rich portfolio of vertical web properties.


Sean Moriarty, CEO
Leaf Group
 
  
   

 take 
 charge 
 
Eliminating the void.
There are an estimated 60 million under-banked consumers in the US. Almost a decade ago, Oak recognized the value of NetSpend’s offerings and seized the opportunity to partner with us. Today, we are a leading provider of reloadable prepaid debit cards that empower these consumers with the convenience, security, and freedom to be self-banked.


Dan Henry, CEO, 
NETSPEND
 
  
   

 SEEING 
 THROUGH 
 
A major force of change. 
One of the larger problems with today’s healthcare system is a lack of transparency for costs. Castlight Health was founded in 2008 to provide individuals unbiased pricing information with which to make smart purchase decisions. With the backing of Oak, Castlight was able to significantly strengthen our solutions, enhance our team, and develop our strategy.


Gio Colella, M.D., CEO & CO-FOUNDER, 
CASTLIGHT HEALTH
 
  
   

 NATURAL 
 FUEL 
 
Clean times two.  
Sundrop Fuels moves forward with building the largest bio-gasoline plant in the world. With continued investment and guidance from Oak, the company has developed and is now in first commercial deployment of their high efficiency, proprietary technology for converting biomass into gasoline.


Wayne Simmons, PRESIDENT & CEO, 
SUNDROP FUELS
 
  
   

 FIBER 
 OPTIMISM 
 
A foundation for connecting.  
Zayo helps carriers, enterprises, schools, and hospitals keep pace with their rapidly growing need for data and Internet bandwidth.  Oak’s investment has helped us grow our operations to include a fiber network that spans 218 markets and 45 states plus Washington, D.C.


Dan Caruso, CO-FOUNDER & CEO,
ZAYO GROUP
 
  
   

 LIFT 
 OFF 
 
Efficiency from the ground up.
At a time of a crucial acquisition in our growth story, Oak joined our investor syndicate and helped finance the acquisition in a very fast and responsive manner.  Ever since, we knew we could always count on strong financial and strategic support from Oak.  They have helped in shaping our international expansion plans and strategies and have been a consistently strong and supportive partner to Kayak.


STEVE HAFNER, CEO & CO-FOUNDER,
KAYAK
 
  
   

 Automate 
 Decisions 
 
Transforming financial services for a new generation. 
Oak came in to invest in Wonga after having followed the business for quite some time. But once they committed to invest, it was a fast and highly efficient process. Oak truly believes in our vision of transforming the financial services industry, and they bring a differentiated set of experiences with knowledge both of the Internet as well as financial services. Oak is a partner we can always count on and trust to be on our side for the long term.


Errol Damelin, Founder, 
WONGA
 
  
   

 ONE 
 STOP 
 
Bringing it all together. 
What if there were a single, web-based platform for managing benefits? That’s the idea behind Benefitfocus, which integrates benefits in a single place for employers, carriers, and consumers. Oak recognized the growing importance and demand for a solution for shopping, enrolling, and managing healthcare benefits in the cloud.


Shawn Jenkins, PRESIDENT & CEO, 
BENEFITFOCUS
 
  
   

 IT’S ALL IN 
 THE WHEELS 
 
Electric drives get traction.
With interest in hybrid and electric cars at a fever pitch, Protean Electric has developed an in-wheel electric drive system for hybrid, plug-in hybrid, and battery electric light-duty vehicles. Our partnership with Oak has enabled us to develop a system that can improve vehicle fuel economy, add torque, increase power, and enable improved vehicle handling to both new and existing vehicles.


BOB PURCELL, Vice Chairman, 
PROTEAN ELECTRIC
 
  
   

 SUPPORT 
 SUPREME 
 
Leading the way in outsourced services.  
When Fortune 1000 companies need an integrated, global provider of business process and technology management services, they look to Sutherland. Our singular focus is to drive business performance improvements and solutions that support the entire customer lifecycle. With investment and guidance from Oak, we have grown our global operations to the point where, today, we process over 13 million customer transactions for our clients every month.


Dilip Vellodi, CHAIRMAN AND CEO,
Sutherland Global Services
 
  
   

 GAME 
 ON 
 
Playing an entirely new ballgame. 
With the insatiable desire of sports fans all over the world to get news and information, Bleacher Report has emerged as the go-to source, delivering the Internet’s most engaging sports content experience. Oak’s partnership with the company has helped it grow to be the U.S.’s fourth-largest sports media site, reaching more than 25 million unique readers each month.


BRIAN GREY, CEO,

 COMPETITIVE 
 EDGE 
 
Customized financial services.  
Financial institutions are always looking for ways to enable better strategy, marketing, and risk decisions. Our unique data and analytics provide just that through competitive benchmarking, scoring solutions, analytics, and customized services to major financial institutions around the world. We partnered with Oak at an important time in Argus’ history. They provided us invaluable guidance and support as we expanded our solutions and took our business to a global scale.


Leonard Laufer, CEO, 
Argus Information & Advisory Services
 
  
   

 Automate 
 Decisions 
 
Deep clinical insights for managing medical payment policy.
Minimizing fraud, waste, and abuse is a substantial challenge for healthcare payer organizations. iHealth Technologies helps those payers ensure the proper and fair payment of claims. Oak has been a reliable partner in the planning and execution of our organic growth and acquisition strategy.
