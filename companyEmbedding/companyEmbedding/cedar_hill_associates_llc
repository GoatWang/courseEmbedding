Fixed Income Investment Management
Objective: Employ Low-Risk Vehicles and Enhance Returns Through Active Portfolio Management 
Fixed income securities represent a highly liquid investment vehicle for producing income and relative safety of principal, while providing some diversification to equity investments.

For taxable accounts, municipal bonds may offer attractive after-tax income, as most issues are exempt from federal income tax. Additionally, some issues provide state tax exemption, depending upon state of residence. For tax deferred/exempt accounts, we generally construct a diversified portfolio consisting of corporate and government bonds, as well as asset-backed securities.
Prior to selecting individual securities, we analyze general economic trends and the prevailing supply and demand for newly issued securities. This information is important in considering short- and long-term changes to interest rates, as well as shifts in the yield curve, which charts the relationship between interest rates and time to maturity of similar securities. We then construct a diversified portfolio of bonds consistent with this outlook.
Our bond portfolios represent high credit quality and short-to-intermediate maturities, and are diversified by issuer. Our domestic and international fixed income selection process includes economic analysis, yield curve assessment, security selection through numerous channels to identify securities and the continuous review of the portfolio.

Alternative Investment Strategies
Objective: Positive Returns, Limited Volatility and Low Correlation to Traditional Investments 
At Cedar Hill, we select non-traditional investments to complement our conventional equity and fixed income portfolios for qualified clients. This adds to the diversification available and is an important part of our investment philosophy.
Opportunities for qualified clients may include, but are not limited to:
Event-Driven and Relative Value Strategies that strive for capital appreciation through the allocation of assets among a select group of investment managers, consisting of distressed securities, credit exposure, capital structure arbitrage, merger arbitrage and special situations.
Long/Short Equity focuses on domestic and global managers who attempt to add value through selecting stocks and adjusting market exposure levels. These strategies capitalize on market inefficiencies and pricing anomalies in equity markets.
Private Equity Strategies pursue non-public investments offering return possibilities through capital appreciation in domestic, international and emerging markets. Opportunities include middle-market buyouts, growth capital, distressed securities, energy, financial services and properties rich in natural resources.

Natural Resource Strategies seek to capitalize on the cyclical and secular outlook for oil, natural gas, land and commodities, among others.
Real Estate Investments include income-producing and value-added properties identified on an opportunistic basis.
Specialty Finance Strategies strive for appreciation of assets held by a select group of specialty finance companies and individual investments. Opportunities in this strategy may include the financing of:

Assets Owned By Manufacturers and Distributors (Asset-Based Financing)
Equipment Leasing
Real Estate
Secured Loans

Disclaimer: Our discussion of alternatives is not a solicitation to invest. Only qualified investors, upon receipt of a private placement memorandum, may invest.

Managing Equity Investments
Objective: Produce Consistent, Risk-Adjusted Returns
Core Equity
Cedar Hill builds diversified portfolios for clients that are composed of companies that have attractive growth prospects relative to valuation, or are undervalued relative to their net asset value.

We evaluate these companies based on quantitative metrics as well as qualitative assessments of corporate management, business strategy and macro factors impacting the industry. Cedar Hill also analyzes an investment’s risk before addressing the potential return opportunity.
Other factors include a company’s profitability, financial resources, market position and the track record of the management team. Additionally, we assess the competitive landscape within the industry, identifying key macro trends as well as economic, political and regulatory risks. We determine valuation by using internally generated earnings and cash flow projections. 
Fundamental Research Complemented by Thematic Investing
Our investment methodology is rooted in fundamental analysis, which involves analyzing a company’s financial performance to make assumptions about its future prospects.
We complement our quantitative and qualitative analysis of individual companies, however, with a broader assessment of macroeconomic and industry trends that could influence performance. For example, we may explore broader investment themes, such as the aging of America or the impact of the rapidly growing middle class in emerging markets, and look for companies that are well-positioned to take advantage of these themes. 	
Adjusting Investment Positions
We develop price targets for each company in the portfolios we manage and reassess these positions based on business and economic trends. Portfolio positions may be scaled back or eliminated when one of the following conditions occurs: 

The company’s stock has met our price objective.
Another position offers a better risk/reward equation.
Deterioration in the business or industry has made the company susceptible to a permanent impairment. 

Sound, Consistent Returns
By creating a diversified portfolio in this manner and performing thorough analysis throughout the life cycle of each investment, our core equity portfolio is designed to produce sound, consistent, risk-adjusted returns. 
Equity Income
Cedar Hill’s Equity Income portfolios are composed  of actively managed portfolio stocks that have a significant income component, sometimes tax advantaged. Yields on these investments far exceed bonds or dividends from traditional stocks. Investments may include Master Limited Partnerships (energy infrastructure), Business Development Companies (lending to middle market companies), preferred equities, covered call strategies and other high income producing securities. In addition to current income, the strategy offers additional return potential through share price appreciation. Downside is not as exposed to interest rate increases as traditional fixed income.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
