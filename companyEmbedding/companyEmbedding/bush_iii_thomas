Bush Furniture
Bush Furniture is a true market leader in the manufacturing of affordable furniture solutions that will stand the test of time. With over 50 years of market experience, they have put themselves ahead of the pack by adhering to self-imposed safety standards that are well above the market standard. Bush has come a long way from its small beginnings as a small company who specialized in making flat-packed hampers. The hampers were a great success and that lead them to create a line of snap-together TV stands in 1972. Since then, the company has experienced international success. They are still headquartered today in Jamestown, NY with manufacturing plants in Pennsylvania, New York, Germany and China. Trust Bush for exceptional quality and style.Read More
Bush Series A
Series A is a no-frills collection of office furniture that's destined to be the workhorse of your office – whether big or small. But just this version of "basic" doesn't cut any corners. Series A is a totally modular system, which means that it's easy to incorporate into any work environment.  A variety of shapes and configurations are available so that you can custom tailor Series A to your workspace. Clever storage is integrated into the desks and the optional hutches. Use a lateral file for your important documents or a corner overhead shelving unit to make the most of your space. Bush Series A is available in a range of colors and finishes so that your new system will coordinate with your space.
All Bush products offer commercial grade quality to withstand the test of time. Durable thermally-fused laminate surfaces are over 1" thick and have been specially designed to withstand the rigors of a 40+ hour work week. All surfaces are glare, stain and scratch resistant. Grommets and wire management systems have been incorporated to keep your work space tidy.

Bush Furniture
Bush Furniture is a true market leader in the manufacturing of affordable furniture solutions that will stand the test of time. With over 50 years of market experience, they have put themselves ahead of the pack by adhering to self-imposed safety standards that are well above the market standard. Bush has come a long way from its small beginnings as a small company who specialized in making flat-packed hampers. The hampers were a great success and that lead them to create a line of snap-together TV stands in 1972. Since then, the company has experienced international success. They are still headquartered today in Jamestown, NY with manufacturing plants in Pennsylvania, New York, Germany and China. Trust Bush for exceptional quality and style.Read More

Letter from Assistant Director Thomas E. Bush, III, on the FBI and American Football Coaches Association National Child Identification Program









Washington, D.C.


December 20, 2006








FBI National Press Office
(202) 324-3691













Since September 11, 2001, the nation has focused on the protection of its citizens. Our most vulnerable citizens are our children. Yet even before September 11, 2001, the statistics relating to child safety are surprising:


800,000 are missing every year. That is one child every 40 seconds.


400,000 run away from home.


300,000 are abducted by family members.


50,000 are abducted by non-family members.



Prior to 1997, less than two percent of parents had a copy of their child's fingerprints or a DNA sample. However, since 1997, the American Football Coaches Association (AFCA) and FBI's National Child Identification Program have been working to decrease these staggering statistics relating to missing children in America.
To assist in protecting our children, we are requesting your participation in our nationwide faith-based child safety initiative. We are asking the nation's 54,000 largest churches, mosques, and synagogues to do the following:


Participate in the FBI-AFCA National Child Identification Program (see enclosed order form) 
Fax the enclosed faith-based participation sheet. 


Churches, mosques, and synagogues are essential in assisting us to inform parents and guardians of child safety. With your help, this can be the largest faith-based child safety initiative in our nation's history.
Thank you for your participation in helping protect children in America.
Sincerely yours,
Thomas E. Bush, IIIAssistant Director

REVIEW of a decision of the Court of Appeals.� Affirmed.� 
 
�1���� LOUIS B. BUTLER, JR., J.��
Thomas H. Bush seeks review of a published court of appeals decision
that affirmed a circuit court's order denying two pretrial motions challenging
the constitutionality of Wis. Stat. ch. 980 (chapter 980) (2001-02).[1]�� State v. Bush, 2004 WI App 193, 276
Wis. 2d 806, 688 N.W.2d 752 (Bush III).� The court of appeals concluded that Bush was procedurally barred
from raising a constitutional challenge against chapter 980.� Id., �19.
�2���� Bush asks this court to reverse the court of appeals' decision
and hold that he is not procedurally barred from bringing this constitutional
claim.� Bush further asks this court to
conclude that chapter 980 is facially unconstitutional on substantive due
process grounds in that it does not require proof of a "recent overt
act" when there has been a break in the offender's incarceration and the
offender has been reincarcerated for nonsexual behavior.
�3���� Although the State argues that Bush has waived the issue
regarding his constitutional challenge to chapter 980, we reach the issue's
merits.� We conclude that due process
does not require a showing of a recent overt act when there is a break in the
offender's incarceration and the offender is subsequently reincarcerated for
nonsexual behavior in order to prove current dangerousness.� We decline to adopt a bright-line rule that
requires current dangerousness to be proven by a particular type of
evidence.� Accordingly, we affirm the
decision of the court of appeals.
I
�4���� The following facts are undisputed and were stipulated to by the
parties at trial:
Mr. Bush was convicted in 1988 of attempted second
degree sexual assault, which, the state maintains, is the predicate act
authorizing the filing of the original petition for a Chapter 980
commitment.� Subsequent to his 1988
conviction, Mr. Bush was paroled and was permitted to leave the State of
Wisconsin in 1992.� He was arrested in
1992 for operating under the influence, but was acquitted of that charge.� As a direct result of his arrest for the
operating under the influence charge, he was returned to the State of Wisconsin
to face revocation proceedings.�
Ultimately, he was revoked as a result of drinking related events.� At no time was he charged with any new
sexually violent offense after the 1988 assault.� His revocation was as a consequence to non-sexually assaultive
behavior.� These violations did not
constitute recent overt acts of sexual violence.� No evidence was provided in the petition to reflect that the
respondent committed any "recent overt act," nor was any evidence,
consistent with a "recent overt act," introduced at the time of the
probable cause hearing.� 
�5���� The following additional facts are also helpful for our
analysis.[2]� When Bush was arrested for attempted
second-degree sexual assault in 1988, he had been placed on parole just 26 days
prior for a conviction of attempted first-degree sexual assault.� Prior to his 1988 conviction, Bush was
convicted of numerous sex-related offenses, which include: two counts of sexual
assault, three counts of sexual perversion, three counts of disorderly conduct
(including a "Peeping Tom" offense), two counts of second-degree
criminal sexual conduct, and two counts of attempted sexual assault.� By 1988, Bush had been incarcerated or under
probation and parole community supervision almost continuously in Illinois,
Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin since his first conviction in 1966.� Aside from these convictions, Bush admitted
committing other deviant sexual behavior than that for which he had been
arrested.� 
�6���� In 1992, while serving the sentence for his 1988 conviction,
Bush completed the Oshkosh Sex Offender Treatment Program.� He was placed on parole to attend the
Behavioral Medicine Institute of Atlanta, Georgia.� He successfully completed the inpatient component of the Georgia
program, but failed to comply with the requirements of the outpatient program,
in violation of the conditions of his parole, by purchasing a sports car
without knowledge or permission of the program, drinking alcohol, and getting
in a car accident.[3]� His parole was revoked and he was
incarcerated again in Wisconsin.
�7���� In addition to Bush's prior convictions, since at least 1978,
Bush's psychiatric evaluations have expressed the opinion that Bush is among
those sexual offenders who are the least likely to change their behavior.� More recent evaluations conducted in 1996
and 1997 recommended that Bush be closely supervised and identified Bush as
posing a high risk of recidivism, despite his extensive participation in
sex-offender treatment.� Furthermore,
while incarcerated, Bush continued to demonstrate behavior that is predictive
of the likelihood that he will reoffend.�
For example, Bush was reprimanded in 1995 for attempting to purchase
pornography and for corresponding by mail with a person who was engaged in
"grooming a boy for sexual purposes."� 
�8���� In 1997, while Bush remained incarcerated for his 1988 offense,
the State filed a chapter 980 petition,[4]
alleging that Bush was still sexually violent.�
See Bush III, 276 Wis. 2d 806, �3; see also State
v. Bush, No. 1997AP3454, unpublished slip op. (Wis. Ct. App. Dec. 22, 1998)
(Bush I).� Following the trial on
that petition, the jury found that Bush was sexually violent.� See Bush III, 276 Wis. 2d 806,
�3.� Bush appealed and the court of
appeals reversed his commitment because of a prejudicial jury instruction.� Id.
�9���� In 2000, Bush was retried and a second jury came to the same
conclusion.� Id., �4.� Bush again appealed, arguing that:� (1) the State's expert witnesses should have
been disqualified; (2) the State failed to present sufficient evidence to meet
chapter 980's requirements; and (3) the State failed to file the petition
within the requisite 90 days.� State
v. Bush, No. 2001AP588, unpublished slip op. at �1 (Wis. Ct. App. Nov. 26,
2002) (Bush II).� The court of
appeals affirmed in all respects except whether the State had filed the chapter
980 petition in a timely manner.� See
Bush III, 276 Wis. 2d 806, �4.�
On remand, the trial court determined that the State had complied with
the filing requirements of chapter 980.�
Id., �4.
�10���� In August 2002, Bush filed a petition for release under
Wis. Stat. � 980.09(2).[5]� Bush III, 276 Wis. 2d 806, �5.� In the pretrial motions, Bush argued, in
pertinent part, that he had been denied due process because chapter 980 failed
to require proof of a recent overt act.�
Id.� The circuit court for
Eau Claire County, Honorable William M. Gabler, denied Bush's pretrial motions,
and a jury determined that Bush was still sexually violent.� Id., �6.� His petition for discharge was therefore denied.� Id.
�11���� Bush again appealed, renewing his argument he made for the first
time in the circuit court that chapter 980 is unconstitutional because it does
not require a recent overt act.� The
State argued that Bush should not be allowed to attack the underlying commitment
on constitutional grounds because he should have made this challenge in his two
prior appeals.� Id., �7.� The court of appeals agreed with the State
and concluded that Bush was procedurally barred from raising the issue of the
constitutionality of chapter 980.� Id.,
��8, 19.
�12���� Bush seeks review, and we affirm.� 
II
�13���� Bush challenges the constitutionality of chapter 980 on due
process grounds, alleging that the statute fails to require a finding of a
recent overt act.� The constitutionality
of a statute is a question of law which we review de novo.� State v. Randall, 192 Wis. 2d 800, 824, 532
N.W.2d 94 (1995).� This
court has already determined that the State has dual interests under the
statute to protect the public from the dangerously mentally disordered and to
provide care and treatment to those with mental disorders that predispose them
to sexual violence.� State v. Post, 197
Wis. 2d 279, 302, 541 N.W.2d 115 (1995).�
"The Supreme Court has recognized both of these interests as
legitimate, the first under a state's police powers and the latter under its
parens patriae powers."� Id.
(citing Addington v. Texas, 441 U.S. 418, 426 (1979)).� Thus, the issue is whether chapter 980 is
narrowly tailored under the circumstances in this case to serve these
compelling state interests.� Id.� 
III
�14���� Before addressing the merits of Bush's argument, we first
address a procedural issue.� Relying on State
v. Trochinski, 2002 WI 56, 253 Wis. 2d 38, 644 N.W.2d 891, State v.
Molitor, 210 Wis. 2d 415, 565 N.W.2d 248 (Ct. App. 1997), and State ex
rel. Skinkis v. Treffert, 90 Wis. 2d 528, 280 N.W.2d 316
(Ct. App. (1979), Bush asserts that facial challenges to the constitutionality
of a statute present issues of subject matter jurisdiction which cannot be
waived, notwithstanding his failure to raise that challenge in his earlier
appeals.� 
�15���� The State, on the other hand, argues that the law in this area
lacks clarity and is inconsistent.�
While the State recognizes the validity of those cases relied upon by
Bush, it nevertheless suggests that those cases have not always been followed.[6]� Moreover, the State argues that another line
of cases, culminating in this court's decision last term in Village of
Trempealeau v. Mikrut, 2004 WI 79, ��2, 30, 273 Wis. 2d 76, 681 N.W.2d 190,
suggest that pursuant to Article VII, Section 8 of the Wisconsin Constitution,[7]
"no circuit court is without subject matter jurisdiction to entertain
actions of any nature whatsoever."�
Mikrut, 273 Wis. 2d 76, �8; see Mueller v.
Brunn, 105 Wis. 2d 171, 175, 313 N.W.2d 790 (1982); Eberhardy v. Cir.
Ct. for Wood Co., 102 Wis. 2d 539, 307 N.W.2d 881 (1981).
�16���� We agree with the State that the jurisprudence concerning
subject matter jurisdiction and a circuit court's competence to exercise its
subject matter jurisdiction is murky at best.�
Nevertheless, we have recently resolved this area as Bush suggests, and
we reaffirm those decisions here.� 
�17���� In both State v. Cole, 2003 WI 112, �46, 264 Wis. 2d 520,
665 N.W.2d 328, and Trochinski, 253 Wis. 2d 38, �34 n.15, this
court concluded that while an "as applied" challenge to the constitutionality
of a statute may be waived, a facial challenge is a matter of subject matter
jurisdiction and cannot be waived.� The
logic behind this conclusion is entirely consistent with
Article VII, Section 8 of the Wisconsin Constitution.� Article VII, Section 8 states that
"[e]xcept as otherwise provided by law," circuit courts have original
jurisdiction "in all matters civil and criminal."� If a statute is unconstitutional on its
face, any action premised upon that statute fails to present any civil or criminal
matter in the first instance.� As the
court of appeals correctly noted in Skinkis, if the facial attack on the
statute were correct, the statute would be null and void, and the court would
be without the power to act under the statute.�
Skinkis, 90 Wis. 2d at 538.� This is contrasted from an "as applied" challenge,
where the court initially has jurisdiction over the subject matter, as the
statute is valid upon its face.� 
�18���� This rule is also entirely consistent with our line of cases
that recognize that a criminal complaint which fails to allege any offense
known at law is jurisdictionally defective and void.� See Champlain v. State, 53 Wis. 2d 751, 754, 193
N.W.2d 868 (1972); State v. Lampe, 26 Wis. 2d 646, 648, 133 N.W.2d 349
(1965).� Once again, the premise behind
the rule is simple.� Circuit courts have
original jurisdiction over all matters civil and criminal, except as otherwise
provided by law.� If a complaint fails
to state an offense known at law, no matter civil or criminal is before the
court, resulting in the court being without jurisdiction in the first
instance.��� 
�19���� We conclude that because Bush has facially challenged the
constitutionality of chapter 980, his challenge goes to the subject matter
jurisdiction of the court.� Therefore,
because challenges to subject matter jurisdiction cannot be waived, we reach
the merits of his claim.[8]
IV
�20���� We now consider the substance of Bush's argument.� Chapter 980 applies only if an offender is a
"sexually violent person."�
Wisconsin Stat. � 980.01(7) defines a "sexually
violent person" as follows:
"Sexually violent person" means a person who
has been convicted of a sexually violent offense, has been adjudicated
delinquent for a sexually violent offense, or has been found not guilty of or
not responsible for a sexually violent offense by reason of insanity or mental
disease, defect, or illness, and who is dangerous because he or she
suffers from a mental disorder that makes it likely that the person will engage
in acts of sexual violence.� (Emphasis
added.)
�21���� Bush argues that Wis. Stat. chapter 980 is facially
unconstitutional because it does not require a showing of a recent overt act to
prove that an offender is currently dangerous.�
Specifically, Bush contends that chapter 980 violates due process
because it fails to require a showing of a recent overt act to prove current
dangerousness when there has been a break in the offender's incarceration and
the offender has been reincarcerated for nonsexual behavior.� 
�22���� Bush asks this court to adopt the rationale used by the
Washington Supreme Court in In re Albrecht, 51 P.3d 73 (Wash.
2002).� In that case, the Washington
Supreme Court concluded that when an offender has been released into the
community and his or her release is revoked for a nonsexually violent act, due
process requires that the state show a recent overt act by the offender.[9]� Albrecht, 51 P.3d at 78; see also
In re Young, 857 P.2d 989, 1009 (Wash. 1993).[10]� The Washington Supreme Court reasoned that
the constitutionality of an involuntary civil commitment is predicated on proof
that the offender is dangerous and that his or her dangerousness is
current.� Albrecht, 51 P.3d at 76
(citing Foucha v. Louisiana, 504 U.S. 71, 80 (1992)).� Once an offender has been released into the
community and is later incarcerated for a nonsexually violent offense, the
offender "cannot necessarily be said to be currently dangerous."� Id. at 78.� Therefore, when an offender has been released into the community,
due process is violated if the state has not demonstrated that the offender is
currently dangerous, and the offender's current dangerousness must be
demonstrated by a recent overt act.� Id.
at 76 (citing Young, 857 P.2d at 41-42).� The Washington court stated: "The existence of a recent
overt act . . . necessarily satisfies the dangerousness
element required by due process [because] the recent overt act requirement
directly and specifically speaks to a person's dangerousness."� Id. at 78.� 
�23���� We decline to adopt Albrecht.� Bush's argument, rooted in the Albrecht rationale, raises
three problems.� First, Bush's entire
due process argument assumes that the mere fact that an offender has been
granted parole constitutes a determination that the offender is no longer
dangerous.� Second, Bush asks this court
to adopt an absolute, bright-line rule that specifies the particular evidence
that will adequately show current dangerousness, limiting the factfinder's
ability to determine the offender's current level of dangerousness.� Third, Bush advocates an illogical standard
by urging that this court require proof of a "recent overt act" while
defining "recent" as the period of time when the offender is in the
community, regardless of the passage of time between the parole revocation and
the filing of the involuntary civil commitment petition.� We discuss each issue in turn.
A
�24���� At the outset, Bush's entire argument rests on the assumption
that the parole board must have determined that Bush was no longer dangerous
when it granted him parole in 1992. ���Bush asserts that the parole board would not have released him
into the community on supervised parole if the board believed he was
dangerous.� Once the State presumably
determined that Bush was no longer dangerous and released him into the
community, Bush reasons, due process requires the State prove he had become
dangerous subsequent to his release by showing a recent overt act.� 
�25���� The State contends that this rationale is unpersuasive because
nothing in the record demonstrates why Bush was released on supervised
parole.� 
�26���� As both parties correctly observe, the record is terse as to why
Bush was paroled or on what basis that decision was made.� In fact, the evidence contained in the
record could lead to contradictory conclusions as to the parole board's
rationale.� On one hand, the record
indicates that prior to his 1992 parole, Bush had made "excellent"
progress with his sex-offender treatment, had become a "low risk to
society," and was "not dangerous to others."� This evidence may have led to the conclusion
that Bush was no longer dangerous.� 
�27���� On the other hand, Bush was allowed to leave prison on
supervised release in order to attend the Behavioral Medicine Institute of
Atlanta, Georgia.� According to the
record, the Atlanta program is an advanced sex-offender treatment program that
"treats the most chronic of cases and those that have proven unresponsive
to previous treatments."� In
addition, the State imposed specific conditions of release upon Bush.� As such, evidence in the record also
supports a determination that Bush remained dangerous.
�28���� Therefore, we cannot conclude that the mere fact that the State
granted Bush parole necessarily leads to the conclusion that he was no longer
dangerous as that concept is used in chapter 980.� The record is simply too barren for us to agree with that
conclusion.� Although the fact that the
State placed Bush on supervised parole has probative value in undercutting the
State's case, it is not a conclusive determination of Bush's dangerousness
under chapter 980.
B
�29���� Bush advocates that we adopt a bright-line rule that requires a
showing that he committed a recent overt act while on parole, regardless of any
of his sexually violent behavior before, or after, the period of time he was on
supervised parole in 1992.� We agree
with the State that due process does not require adoption of this bright-line
rule.
�30���� We recognize that substantive as well as procedural limitations
on a state's power to commit the dangerously mentally ill vary from
jurisdiction to jurisdiction.� Post,
197 Wis. 2d at 312 (citing Jackson v. Indiana, 406 U.S. 715, 736-37
(1972)).� As such, the United States
Supreme Court has refused to proscribe strict boundaries for legislative
determinations of what is necessary for voluntary commitment.� Id.�

�31���� Moreover, the Court has cautioned that "an absolutist
approach is unworkable" in a civil commitment analysis.� Kansas v. Crane, 534 U.S. 407, 411
(2002).� The Court concluded that
"the Constitution's safeguards of human liberty in the area of mental
illness and the law are not always best enforced through precise bright-line
rules."� Crane 534 U.S. at
413 (citing Kansas v. Hendricks, 521 U.S. 346, 359 (1997)).� Bright-line rules present unworkable
standards because their rigidity hampers the factfinder's ability to measure an
individual's dangerousness.� See State
v. Laxton, 2002 WI 82, �21, 254 Wis. 2d 185, 647 N.W.2d 784.
�32���� Along similar lines, inhibiting a factfinder's evaluation of
dangerousness through bright-line rules is problematic because chapter 980 is
reserved for only the most dangerous offenders.� See Post, 197 Wis. 2d at 307.� Prior to commitment, chapter 980 requires
the State to present evidence sufficient to allow the factfinder to distinguish
"a dangerous sexual offender who has serious difficulty controlling his or
her behavior from a dangerous but typical recidivist."� Laxton, 245 Wis. 2d 185, �23.� This evaluation is not an exact science; the
standard "risk assessment" used by expert witnesses for sexual offenders
"takes into account all past violations of the law in attempting to
evaluate the probability of future sexually assaultive behavior."� State v. Franklin, 2004 WI 38, �22,
270 Wis. 2d 271, 677 N.W.2d 276.� 
�33���� Predicting an offender's dangerousness under chapter 980 is a
complex evaluation.� At trial, the
factfinder is obligated to examine the totality of the offender's past actions
and make a determination based on the offender's "relevant character
traits and patterns of behavior," as to whether the offender's mental
condition currently predisposes him or her to commit another sexually violent
act.� Id., �14 (holding that
Wis. Stat. � 904.04(2) did not apply to chapter 980); State v.
Kienitz, 227 Wis. 2d 423, 441, 597 N.W.2d 712 (1999) (reasoning that the
factfinder has an obligation to weigh all the evidence presented).� Ultimately, the question "is simply
whether it is substantially probable that the person will engage in acts of
sexual violence without regard to any specific restrictions, supervision or
time frame."� See State v. Thiel,
2004 WI App 140, �17, 275 Wis. 2d 421, 685 N.W.2d 890.� Thus, we agree with the State that due
process does not require that an evaluation of dangerousness be limited based
on Bush's proposed bright-line rule.
C
�34���� Finally, we agree with the State that Bush advocates an
illogical application of requiring recent overt acts to prove current
dangerousness.� Bush defines recent
overt acts as including acts during the time he was on parole, which in this
case was five years before the State filed the initial petition.� His rationale is again based on Albrecht,
where the Washington court found that to determine the offender's level of
current dangerousness, the factfinder must rely on an offender's behavior when
he or she is not incarcerated.� Albrecht,
51 P.3d at 77.� When an individual is
continuously incarcerated, the only behavior available to the factfinder is his
or her behavior prior to incarceration.�
Id.� But, under Albrecht,
when the offender has been released back into the community, his or her
behavior upon release is demonstrative of whether the offender continues to be
dangerous.� Id.� 
�35���� Looking to Bush's time on parole, without more, does not
necessarily give the factfinder an adequate evaluation of Bush's current
dangerousness for at least three reasons.�

�36���� First, Bush's parole was not close in time to his chapter 980
trial.� Bush was released into the
community under supervised parole in early 1992.� In less than a month, he violated specific conditions of his
parole and was reincarcerated for his 1988 offense.� Five years later, the State filed a petition to commit Bush under
chapter 980.� Bush asks this court to
conclude that his behavior while on parole in 1992 should be the only reliable
evidence for the factfinder to use in determining whether he was currently
dangerous in 1997.� His conduct during
his parole merely establishes that he had difficulty in conforming his behavior
to the law during his short release period. 
�37���� Second, under Bush's approach, an offender's behavior while
incarcerated would be irrelevant to support a determination of current
dangerousness.� However, the
factfinder's analysis of an offender's current dangerousness is not limited to
the offender's actions prior to his or her most recent incarceration and can
include an offender's actions while incarcerated.� See Franklin, 270 Wis. 2d 271, �22; State v.
Zanelli, 212 Wis. 2d 358, 379-80, 569 N.W.2d 301 (Ct. App. 1997).�� Here, Bush has engaged in the following
behavior while incarcerated:� he was
reprimanded for corresponding with a person who was "grooming a boy for
sexual purposes," and he attempted to obtain pornographic materials.� This behavior may bear on Bush's
dangerousness, but the weight to be given to this behavior is for the
factfinder.
�38���� Third, the sexually violent offense for which Bush is
incarcerated may be relevant evidence of current dangerousness.� Bush was eligible for a chapter 980
commitment only because he had been convicted of a sex-related crime.� The fact that Bush was incarcerated for
attempted sexual assault when the chapter 980 petition was filed is evidence of
his dangerousness at that time.�
Although this conviction, on its face, "is not sufficient to
establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the person has a mental disorder [as
required for a chapter 980 commitment]," Wis. Stat. � 980.05(4),[11]
we conclude that evidence of Bush's 1988 conviction is a proper component of
the evaluation of his current dangerousness.
�39���� Therefore, we conclude that due process does not require a
showing of a recent overt act to prove current dangerousness when there has
been a break in the offender's incarceration and the offender has been
reincarcerated for nonsexual behavior.�
Because due process does not require this showing under these
circumstances, we agree with the State that chapter 980 is accordingly narrowly
tailored to serve a compelling state
interest for purposes of Bush's challenge.� Therefore, we reject Bush's argument that
chapter 980 is facially unconstitutional on that basis.� 
V
�40���� In sum, we conclude that chapter 980 is not facially unconstitutional.� We conclude that due process does not
require proof of a recent overt act in evaluating the dangerousness of the
offender when there has been a break in the offender's incarceration and the
offender is reincarcerated for nonsexual behavior.� Substantive due process allows for a chapter 980 commitment when
there is sufficient evidence of current dangerousness.� We decline to adopt any bright-line rule
that requires current dangerousness to be proven by a particular type of
evidence.� 
���� By the
Court.�The decision of the court of appeals is affirmed.

references to the Wisconsin Statutes are to the 2001-02 version unless
otherwise indicated.� 


[2] As seen
below, Bush has had two commitment hearings, one in 1997 and another in
2000.� The current appellate record does
not contain the trial transcripts from the 2000 commitment hearing.� Although we do have the exhibits and a list
of which exhibits were admitted at trial, we do not know if any of the exhibits
were admitted for limited purposes.� We
will assume that they were not.�
Further, we do not know if any exhibits from the prior commitment
hearing in 1997 were incorporated by reference during the 2000 commitment
hearing.� As they are part of our record
here, we will assume that they were.� See
State v. McAttee, 2001 WI App 262, �5 n.1, 248 Wis. 2d 865, 637 N.W.2d
774 ("It is the appellant's responsibility to ensure completion of the
appellate record and when an appellate record is incomplete in connection with
an issue raised by the appellant, we must assume that the missing material
supports the trial court's ruling."�
(citation and quotations omitted)).


[3] Although
driving while intoxicated does not necessarily raise concerns for sexually
violent behavior, drinking and driving are a particularly dangerous combination
for Bush.� The record demonstrates that
"Mr. Bush has specific triggers regarding his sex offender criminal
activity which includes alcohol and fast cars."� 


[4] Wisconsin
Stat. � 980.02(2) outlines the procedures for filing a petition
alleging an offender is a sexually violent person as follows:
(2)� A
petition filed under this section shall allege that all of the following apply
to the person alleged to be a sexually violent person:
(a) The person satisfies any of the following
criteria:
1. The person has been convicted of a sexually
violent offense.
2. The person has been found delinquent for a
sexually violent offense.
3. The person has been found not guilty of a
sexually violent offense by reason of mental disease or defect.
(ag) The person is within 90 days of discharge
or release, on parole, extended supervision or otherwise, from a sentence that
was imposed for a conviction for a sexually violent offense, from a secured
correctional facility, as defined in s. 938.02 (15m), from a secured child
caring institution, as defined in s. 938.02 (15g), or from a secured group
home, as defined in s. 938.02 (15p), if the person was placed in the facility
for being adjudicated delinquent under s. 938.183 or 938.34 on the basis of a
sexually violent offense or from a commitment order that was entered as a
result of a sexually violent offense.
(b) The person has a mental disorder.
(c) The person is dangerous to others because
the person's mental disorder makes it likely that he or she will engage in acts
of sexual violence.


[5] Wisconsin Stat. � 980.09(2)
reads as follows:
(a) A
person may petition the committing court for discharge from custody or
supervision without the secretary's approval.�
At the time of an examination under s. 980.07 (1), the secretary shall
provide the committed person with a written notice of the person's right to
petition the court for discharge over the secretary's objection.� The notice shall contain a waiver of
rights.� The secretary shall forward the
notice and waiver form to the court with the report of the department's
examination under s. 980.07.� If the
person does not affirmatively waive the right to petition, the court shall set
a probable cause hearing to determine whether facts exist that warrant a
hearing on whether the person is still a sexually violent person.� The committed person has a right to have an
attorney represent him or her at the probable cause hearing, but the person is
not entitled to be present at the probable cause hearing.
�
(b) If the court determines at the probable cause
hearing under par. (a) that probable cause exists to believe that the committed
person is no longer a sexually violent person, then the court shall set a
hearing on the issue.� At a hearing
under this paragraph, the committed person is entitled to be present and to the
benefit of the protections afforded to the person under s. 980.03.� The district attorney or the department of
justice, whichever filed the original petition, shall represent the state at a
hearing under this paragraph.� The
hearing under this paragraph shall be to the court.� The state has the right to have the committed person evaluated by
experts chosen by the state.� At the
hearing, the state has the burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence
that the committed person is still a sexually violent person.
�
(c) If the court is
satisfied that the state has not met its burden of proof under par. (b), the
person shall be discharged from the custody or supervision of the
department.� If the court is satisfied
that the state has met its burden of proof under par. (b), the court may
proceed to determine, using the criteria specified in s. 980.08 (4)(b), whether
to modify the person's existing commitment order by authorizing supervised
release.


[6] See
State v. Wilks, 121 Wis. 2d 93, 107, 358 N.W.2d 273 (1984) (where court
declined to address defendant's claim that loitering ordinance was
unconstitutionally vague when raised for first time on appeal); In re Baby
Girl K., 113 Wis. 2d 429, 448, 335 N.W.2d 846 (1983) (where court
considered facial constitutional challenge raised for first time on appeal as
discretionary but to be done if in best interests of justice); and Sambs v.
City of Brookfield, 66 Wis. 2d 296, 314, 224 N.W.2d 582 (1975) (court
declined to reach claim presented for first time on appeal that liability
limits are unconstitutional, although it is not clear whether that challenge
was facial or as applied).� See also
State v. Thomas, 128 Wis. 2d 93, 97-101, 381 N.W.2d 567 (Ct. App. 1985)
(facial challenges that a statute is unconstitutionally vague go to subject
matter jurisdiction). 


[7] Under
the Wisconsin Constitution, "[e]xcept as otherwise provided by law, the
circuit court shall have original jurisdiction in all matters civil and
criminal within this state . . . ."� Wis. Const. art. VII,
� 8.� 


[8] Common
law principles of waiver generally apply to Bush's "as applied"
constitutional challenge.� See State
v. Erickson, 227 Wis. 2d 758, 766, 596 N.W.2d 749 (1999) (noting that the
waiver rule exists to promote efficiency and fairness); see also State
v. Cole, 2003 WI 112, �46, 264 Wis. 2d 520, 665 N.W.2d 328, and State
v. Trochinski, 2002 WI 56, �34 n.15, 253 Wis. 2d 38, 644
N.W.2d 891.� Because Bush failed to
raise this issue in his earlier appeals, and because we do not have all
components of the record, we conclude that Bush has waived his as applied
challenge.� However, we decline to reach
the question of whether a procedural bar, similar to one announced in State
v. Escalona-Naranjo, 185 Wis. 2d 168, 517 N.W.2d 157 (1994), applies.


[9] According to
the Washington court, a "recent overt act" is "any act that has
either caused harm of a sexually violent nature or creates a reasonable
apprehension of such harm."� In
re Albrecht, 51 P.3d 73, 77 (Wash. 2002).�
When the individual has been continuously incarcerated, no evidence of a
recent overt act is required because that would create an impossible
standard.� Id. at 77.


[10] In
In re Young, 857 P.2d 989, 1009 (Wash. 1993), the Washington Supreme Court held
that when an offender has been released from confinement since his or her last
sex offense, but before sexually violent predator proceedings are initiated
against him or her, the state had to prove he or she committed a recent overt
act in order to establish dangerousness.�
The Washington Legislature amended its sexual predator
commitment statute to reflect the court's decision.� State v. Ward, 104 P.3d 751, 753 (Wash. Ct. App. 2005). 


[11] See
Kansas v. Crane, 534 U.S. 407, 412 (2002) (emphasizing the
constitutional importance of the distinction between those who are dangerous
sexual offenders and those more properly dealt with exclusively through
criminal law.� "That distinction is
necessary lest 'civil commitment' become a 'mechanism for retribution or
general deterrence'��functions properly those of criminal law, not civil
commitment.").

 BUSH Thomas Tom Marvin Bush III, 66, passed away suddenly from an automobile accident on Friday, May 9, 2014. Tom was born in Carlsbad, New Mexico to Tom and Laura Bush. He is survived by his wife of 44 years, Dolores Lori Bush, his brother John Bush (Jacksonville Beach, FL), his daughter Christina Smith and her husband Darryl Smith (Tallahassee), his son Tom Bush IV and his wife Heather Bush (Jacksonville, NC), and his seven grandchildren: Shelby Smith, Sean Smith, Shay Bush, Riley Bush, Devin Bush, Delaney Bush and Owen Bush. Tom graduated from Hobbs High School in 1966. He received his Bachelor of Science degree from New Mexico State University in 1972, Bachelor of Arts in Theater from Florida State University in 1996 and Master of Education from Florida State University in 2001. Tom spent 20 years working in the family business as a car dealer in Jacksonville, Florida with his father and brother before pursuing his true calling as an educator. After working as a teacher in Starke, Florida, Tom settled in Tallahassee where he earned his master's degree in education. He then spent nine rewarding years as a science and math teacher at SAIL High School before retiring in 2009. Tom T-Bear Bush was a vibrant individual who loved acting, music, camping, construction projects and simply spending time with his family. He was a dreamer and a romantic, spending most of his time enjoying the peace and tranquility on his and Lori's 30 acres, always dreaming up the next big project. His larger than life personality touched many people who will dearly miss him. A gathering of family and friends was held at Culley's MeadowWood Riggins Road Chapel on Friday, May 16th from 6:00pm to 8:00pm. A Celebration of Tom's life will be held on Saturday, May 17th at 6:00pm at the home of Tom and Dolores Bush - 5032 Butterfly Hill Lane, Tallahassee, Florida. In lieu of flowers, please send a donation on his behalf to SAIL High School, A School for Arts and Innovative Learning. Please Sign the Guestbook @ Jacksonville.com

Bush Furniture
Bush Furniture is a true market leader in the manufacturing of affordable furniture solutions that will stand the test of time. With over 50 years of market experience, they have put themselves ahead of the pack by adhering to self-imposed safety standards that are well above the market standard. Bush has come a long way from its small beginnings as a small company who specialized in making flat-packed hampers. The hampers were a great success and that lead them to create a line of snap-together TV stands in 1972. Since then, the company has experienced international success. They are still headquartered today in Jamestown, NY with manufacturing plants in Pennsylvania, New York, Germany and China. Trust Bush for exceptional quality and style.Read More
Bush Series A
Series A is a no-frills collection of office furniture that's destined to be the workhorse of your office – whether big or small. But just this version of "basic" doesn't cut any corners. Series A is a totally modular system, which means that it's easy to incorporate into any work environment.  A variety of shapes and configurations are available so that you can custom tailor Series A to your workspace. Clever storage is integrated into the desks and the optional hutches. Use a lateral file for your important documents or a corner overhead shelving unit to make the most of your space. Bush Series A is available in a range of colors and finishes so that your new system will coordinate with your space.
All Bush products offer commercial grade quality to withstand the test of time. Durable thermally-fused laminate surfaces are over 1" thick and have been specially designed to withstand the rigors of a 40+ hour work week. All surfaces are glare, stain and scratch resistant. Grommets and wire management systems have been incorporated to keep your work space tidy.

Bush Furniture
Bush Furniture is a true market leader in the manufacturing of affordable furniture solutions that will stand the test of time. With over 50 years of market experience, they have put themselves ahead of the pack by adhering to self-imposed safety standards that are well above the market standard. Bush has come a long way from its small beginnings as a small company who specialized in making flat-packed hampers. The hampers were a great success and that lead them to create a line of snap-together TV stands in 1972. Since then, the company has experienced international success. They are still headquartered today in Jamestown, NY with manufacturing plants in Pennsylvania, New York, Germany and China. Trust Bush for exceptional quality and style.Read More
Bush Series A
Series A is a no-frills collection of office furniture that's destined to be the workhorse of your office – whether big or small. But just this version of "basic" doesn't cut any corners. Series A is a totally modular system, which means that it's easy to incorporate into any work environment.  A variety of shapes and configurations are available so that you can custom tailor Series A to your workspace. Clever storage is integrated into the desks and the optional hutches. Use a lateral file for your important documents or a corner overhead shelving unit to make the most of your space. Bush Series A is available in a range of colors and finishes so that your new system will coordinate with your space.
All Bush products offer commercial grade quality to withstand the test of time. Durable thermally-fused laminate surfaces are over 1" thick and have been specially designed to withstand the rigors of a 40+ hour work week. All surfaces are glare, stain and scratch resistant. Grommets and wire management systems have been incorporated to keep your work space tidy.
