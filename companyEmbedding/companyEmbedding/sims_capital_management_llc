SCM Benefits of Performance

Is 10% really much better than 7%?

The keys to great investing are time and investment performance.  While 7% and 10% seem pretty close, there's a huge divide between those returns. Small differences in annual performance  have dramatic effects over time:




Year
Value of $100 with 7% annual return
Value of $100 with 8.5% annual return
Value of $100 with 10% annual return


5
$140
$150
$161


15
$276
$340
$418


25
$543
$769
$1,083


35
$1,068
$1,738
$2,810


 

Small differences in annual performance have huge effects on the total return, where an extra 1.5% annual return provides more than 60% more money over time.  It's clear that investors end up in a much better place with modestly better results.  And a 10% return provides almost three times as much total wealth for investors than a 7% return; so never discard small changes in return!  They add up over time-- $2.8 million dollars is notably better than $1.1 million dollars!

Past performance does not guarantee future results.  Any cited performance represents past performance; future performance may be lower or higher.  The investment return and principal value will fluctuate so that an investment, in the future, may be worth more or less than the original cost.  Returns do not reflect the effect of passed-through capital gains.

Investing Strategy

  At Sims Capital we invest for the long-term.  Our preferred holding period is forever, but at the very minimum, we approach every potential investment with an expected 3- to 5-year holding period.  The purpose of holding stocks for such a long time span is to allow premium companies to generate strong profits (and gain from stock price and dividends) and limit tax liabilities by locking in long-term capital gains.

As value investors, we agree with Benjamin Graham's insight that a share of stock is a piece of an ongoing business.  As such, we try to understand and value an underlying business before we think about buying the corporation's stock.  Once we understand a business well enough and can value it with a high degree of confidence, we are only comfortable purchasing the stock when we can do so at a significant discount from its intrinsic value (the value a third party would pay for the entire business).  Buying in such a disciplined manner provides us with a "margin of safety" (in Ben Graham's vernacular)--- this simply means that even if our valuation is a little off (say the real value is only 90% of our estimate) there is still ample room for appreciation.  We prefer to buy stock at a 33% discount (a price that is 67% of intrinsic value), although we may go as high as 75% of intrinsic value for platinum quality companies---- firms with strong brands, strong balance sheets, and great growth prospects.

Research and patience are at the core of our investing strategy.
