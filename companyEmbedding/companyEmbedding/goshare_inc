Do you ever think Uber will add this as part of their current offering? If not, what do you think their reasons would be, and why don't they put you off? 

@shaun_savage_goshare 2Share·a year agoDavid Carpe@passingnotes · Thinker & Layabout@bentossell I can't see uber chasing truck capacity, but I could see them handling small transport...most trucks have smaller cabs so limited seating, and the lining of the bed is more suitable for big clunky things with sharp edges...the real competition I see is renting a uhaul or direct rentals from Home Depot and others...but the assistance from drivers is HUGE and makes me feel that I'd pay a premium for the move with some assistance 1Share·a year agoShaun SavageMaker@shaun_savage_goshare · CEO and Founder at GoShare Inc.@bentossell there are a few things that make GoShare a better choice than our modern competitors. We are the only platform that allows users to choose the type/size of truck that they need, we also allow customers to book on demand or in advance, our customers can order on any device, and our low cost pricing model is flexible to enable our drivers adapt to changing circumstances. We have spoken to Uber and done a lot of research and we don't think they will enter this space in the near future. 3Share·a year ago⚡️ Deandre Durr☀️@dredurr · Growth HackerThere are a lot of businesses in the on-demand service. I'm curious how you guys will differentiate yourself. 1Share·a year agoShaun SavageMaker@shaun_savage_goshare · CEO and Founder at GoShare Inc.@dredurr all of our drivers have trucks and vans. We provide on demand moving, hauling, and delivery services for larger items.
