Our benefits





















Indoor water recycled







"Grey water" is the term used for the soapy, mostly clean water that comes from your home's showers, laundry, and hand sinks. It is commonly accepted that grey water makes up approximately 2 out of every 3 gallons of all indoor water. The NEXtreater system captures this water and then produces clean water using an innovative 3-stage hybrid process that combines floatation, filtration and disinfection in an appliance-like package. 



























Reduction in energy used for water heating







Grey water is often generated by showers and laundry and typically is quite warm. By utilizing this grey water as a heat source, the NEXheater can efficiently concentrate and transfer this heat through a novel heat pump process. This process is efficent enough to provide all of the home's hot water needs and replaces a traditional water heater.



























Reduction in sewer flow







By capturing a home's grey water and reusing it for landscaping and toilet flushing a home can easily expect to reduce its sewer flow by 70% or more! Those who receive the biggest value from this feature of water recycling are often land developers and municipal utility companies.

Nexus In the News





























You can actually reclaim two-thirds of the water in your house, and in drought-stricken California the homebuilders are very interested in this.


Diana Olick


CNBC







[Nexus eWater] eliminates the need for much of the drinking water now used to quench thirsty landscapes. It would drop overall water use by as much as 72 percent. Water officials say it is the first time such a system is being installed in a housing subdivision.


Roger Showley


San Diego Union-Tribune







Food from garden to table. Solar power from roof to outlet. And now soapy water from your own shower to your lawn? [Nexus eWater] aims to reclaim water from showers and sinks, clean it and use it for irrigation and flushing toilets, among other non-potable uses in the same home.


Matt Richtel


New York Times







[Gray water recycling is] a “two-fer” that reduces a home’s intake of water and helps maintain some level of landscaping, which is environmentally preferable to covering everything with pavement.


Carolyn Lochhead


San Francisco Chronicle







Californians—now in their fourth year of extreme drought—are increasingly installing gray-water systems, which recycle wastewater from sinks and bathtubs for use in landscape irrigation.


Kerry Close


Wall Street Journal

Nexus eWater and partner River Islands were featured in the Tracy Press article "City, Builders set sights on recycled water".
Read the full article here or see below for a quick excerpt:

An extensive drought across the state has forced local developers and municipalities to look outside the box for alternative water sources to keep green space green.
The River Islands master-planned development in Lathrop, east of Tracy, was highlighted at the White House Water Summit in Washington, D.C., last week for an innovative recycled water proposal. The plan calls for building water-recycling systems designed by San Diego-based Nexus eWater into future houses.
The system will enable homeowners to recycle water from their own showers and appliances to irrigate landscape on their own property.
“We want to have it in all the homes,” said Susan Dell’Osso, River Islands project developer, on Wednesday.

Download the Guide to Recycle Ready Home Design









































Download "The Nexus Guide to the Recycle Ready Home." Whether you are about to buy a new home or build 1,000, if you are in the California home market, you need to understand  how easy it is to go Recycle Ready!









Recycle Ready builds drought resiliency into every new home...

The California drought has demonstrated how conventional approaches to water conservation have reached their limits.  The next Big Step Forward in residential water-use efficiency happens when homes are built to recycle and reuse their own water.
Whether you are a home buyer, an architect, a builder or developer, you need to read this guide and find out just how easy it is to build a home that is ready and able to recycle its own water.
The Nexus solution to Recycle Ready can be applied across thousands of homes or just the one that is important to you.
A Recycle Ready house offers the following benefits to its owners:

LIFETIME CAPABILITY:  Recycle Ready infrastructure is inexpensive to add during initial home construction, and anticipates a future that may look remarkably like the recent past.  You will be able to upgrade right away or in ten years -- at any time, really -- to begin treating and recycling the home's once-used shower, bath, hand sink and washing machine water.  
EASY AND INEXPENSIVE UPGRADE:  The upgrade will be simple and seamless.  You will be able to add on the only Home Water Recycler -- the NEXtreater by Nexus eWater -- that already meets the high certification standards enshrined in the California Plumbing Code.  And you can do it without tearing up the yard or cutting into your walls.
USE LESS BY REUSING MORE:  Once upgraded, your home will begin recycling all the drain water from the selected fixtures -- about 2 out of every three gallons of water used first inside your home!  That is a lot of water.  And each gallon that you reuse is a gallon that you no longer buy from your local water providor.  
PRIDE OF OWNERSHIP:  Recycle Ready is for anyone who understands the pride of owning the best.   Your home is ready to deal with whatever drought the weather gods may throw at you.  Anytime you want, you can make it the most Water Efficient home in your city.
PROTECTS YOUR LANDSCAPE:  Most California homeowners are currently restricted to watering their landscapes just once or twice a week.  By using your own recycled water for landscape, you should not be subject to the same restrictions.  (And if you are, we will gladly fight for your right to use your own recycled water whenever you need to).
PROTECTS YOUR HOME'S RESALE VALUE:  If you need to sell your home during a drought, do you want your landscape at its lushest when you put your home on the market?  Or do you want to sell your home with a brown lawn looking like it had just gone through, what?, a drought?

 In "The Nexus Guide to the Recycle Ready Home," Nexus eWater shows you how to site and incorporate the infrastructure you need to make your next home Recycle Ready.  Piping, electrical, plumbing connections, and proximity to city water and sewer lines are all part of the equation we address in this guide.
If you want your next home to represent the care that you have for water resources, be sure it is a Recycle Ready Home.   The steps to building a Recycle Ready Home are simple to understand and easy to implement by any builder.  The cost of building the Recycle Ready Home is modest in the cost of typical California construction.  Be sure to make yours a Recycle Ready Home -- it just makes cents/sense, doesn't it?

US-Australian company prepares for US market launch of disruptive 
      product aimed at radically reducing California residential water, 
      energy, and wastewater use


Estimates US market opportunity to be $15 billion per year



      Nexus eWater, Inc. today announced the successful closing of $2.1 
      million in Series A funding from investors in the US, Australia and UK.

      Nexus eWater has developed the world's first practical water and energy 
      recycler for homes. The estimated annual US market for this new product 
      suite is projected at $15 billion per year. The patented product 
      collects a home’s grey water (the drain water from showers and laundry), 
      then cleans it to the highest standard for at-home recycling for lawn 
      watering and other approved uses. Additionally, the system captures and 
      re-uses the heat found in the grey water for further recycling. The 
      system is available for both new homes and for retrofits.
    

      The international investor team includes Canberra-based venture fund ANU 
      Connect Ventures (ANUCV), the Sydney Angels and the Sydney SideCar Fund. 
      The round was led by Thomas Reeves Hitchner, the retired general partner 
      of Baltimore-based venture fund, QuestMark Partners. Proceeds from this 
      funding cycle will complete the initial product roll-out of Nexus’ 
      on-site water and energy recycling products for the California and US 
      market.
    

      The Nexus system is affordable, robust and efficient. It is a 
      sustainability “triple play.” For a house with a family of four, the 
      system provides these three benefits:
    

        Reduces in-home water usage by 40%, (up to 200 gallons per day) by 
        recycling 67% of the water used in a house;
      

        Reduces wastewater by 70%, (up to 200 gallons per day); and
      

        Reduces home electric energy usage by 10-20%.
      

      The energy recycler provides the equivalent power of a 1.5 kW solar 
      array, but at a fraction of the cost. In large, older homes, this amount 
      could be tripled. Energy recycling is accomplished by using a patented 
      heat pump system, which harvests the energy from the warm grey water and 
      then uses that energy to heat fresh, new water for the home. By 
      recycling this energy, the home’s water can be heated using 75% less 
      energy than any conventional tank or tankless water heater.
    

      Customers include new home builders/developers, water districts, cities, 
      energy utilities and existing homeowners. The company is launching in 
      drought-stricken California and has pilot projects in several locations 
      across the state including Los Angeles, Pomona, as well as in two 
      high-profile eco projects with KB Home for their Double ZeroHouse 2.0 in 
      the City of Lancaster, California, and the KB Double ZeroHouse 3.0 in El 
      Dorado Hills (Sacramento).
    

      Mark P. Petroff, CEO of Nexus eWater, stated: “We are excited about the 
      huge potential market for Nexus products in the US and globally. Being 
      first-to-market in an untapped $15 billion market sector with a 
      low-cost, robust and reliable system is an enormous opportunity, and we 
      expect to grow the company rapidly. Nexus looks forward to our 
      partnerships with ANUCV, Sydney Angels, Sydney Sidecar Fund, Thomas 
      Hitchner and our other Australian, US and UK investors. We believe the 
      critical need in California and in the US Western region for a solution 
      such as ours will help drive faster adoption of our patented products.”
    

      “We have supported this technology through our two funds and have been 
      delighted with the progress,” said Nick McNaughton, CEO of ANU Connect 
      Ventures. “Over the last year the company has made significant progress 
      in commercializing its technology and introducing it to drought-stricken 
      areas like Southern California.”
    

      Nik Hayes, who led the Sydney Angels syndicate team (including the 
      Sydney Angels’ Side Car Fund investment), commented that Nexus eWater 
      has a compelling product, a strong team and the right ‘go-to-market’ 
      strategy. “When the Nexus team pitched the Sydney Angels, it immediately 
      resonated with a number of our members. It’s a fantastic 
      Australian-developed innovation with huge potential in overseas markets. 
      The team has also taken a global approach by identifying the right 
      market to launch the product, and we’re very excited,” he said.
    

      The system was developed in Canberra, Australia by company co-founders: 
      Andrew Hermann, Tom Wood and Craig Richmond.
    

      As part of the transaction, Thomas Reeves Hitchner of Cambridge, 
      Massachusetts, will join the Company’s board of directors. Additionally, 
      Mark C. Gauci will join as the board representative for ANUCV. Mr. Gauci 
      is Sydney based and manages Australian operations for the global 
      company, bioMérieux, a worldwide leader in invitro diagnostics.
