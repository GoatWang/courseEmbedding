Partnering
with you on
your financial 
journey 

 







Focus on what is important to you 

 







Pointing you in the right direction 

 







Coordinated Team Effort 

 



 








 






DEDICATED TO SERVE
Founded with the ultimate goal of focusing solely on our clients.
           
 






ATTENTIVE
 
We believe that a partnership requires open communication about the details of your life that makes your story unique.  To truly understand the dreams and goals of our clients, we must be dedicated and focused on listening to your story.

DILIGENT
 
Our foundation in service is built upon delivery of services based on your needs.  Hard work is at the core of everything we do. We pride ourselves on our dedication to service, and we strive everyday to embody the motto of our founders’ alma mater, Virginia Tech, “Ut Prosim” – That I may serve.
 






	Learn more about our dedication to service! 	
 










 













TRUSTED EXPERIENCE
 
We have been honored over the years to serve clients with their diverse financial needs. We work with families and individuals on their personal finances, foundations and trusts on their institutional investments, and small businesses on their retirement plan needs. We believe that our long term relationships are founded in trust. It is through a trusted relationship that you are able to focus on things that are more important to you such as your family and career. We focus serving with 4 major principles: Honesty, Transparency, Dependability, and Continuous Improvement
           





 

















 












INDEPENDENT GUIDANCE
 
We established our business as an independent fee only registered investment advisor. Our goal was to remove inherent conflicts of interest that exist by being paid commissions for selling products. As a result we deliver independent guidance and exceptional service for our clients. Below are a few ways we can serve you:
           





FINANCIAL ORGANIZATION AND CONSULTING SERVICES
                     





 
Many investors, trustees and financial stewards find their investments spread across a number of financial institutions.  As the years pass and life becomes more complex, it becomes increasingly difficult to properly organize and track all your investments.  As a result, it is difficult to ensure you are on track with a sensible financial plan.  Through our FOCuS Program, we strive to increase successful outcomes.








FIDUCIARY REPORTING AND CONSULTING SERVICES
                     





 
Fiduciary portfolios, such as trusts, have been carefully established in order to protect loved ones or provide long lasting funds to help important causes. Of all responsibilities that fiduciaries have, the duty to monitor service providers and investment managers is the most time consuming and critical.








PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT SERVICES
                     





 
With many years of managing investment portfolios for our clients, we believe that a sound investment process founded in 5 principles of investing increases the probability of success while reducing volatility.








RETIREMENT PLAN CONSULTING
                     





Retirement Plans continue to gain focus in the United States because of the significant shift from traditional pension plans to Defined Contribution Plans.  Plan sponsors and those responsible for overseeing the retirement plan have a tremendous amount of responsibility.  Whether your organization already has a retirement plan or you are looking to setup a retirement plan as an employee benefit, the complexities can be overwhelming.  We work to reduce the complexity and help you find the best options for you and your organization.
 




	Learn how our independence benefits you! 	





 











OUR FAMILY
We serve our clients as a team. Together each member of the team serves as an integral part of the service we deliver. Our coordinated efforts ensure our clients’ interests are first and that we provide only exceptional service for those who have placed their trust in us.

Come and join with uscategoriesFinancial Planner · Finance CompanySTORYWe believe the traditional financial services model is broken, yet now we believe there's no better time to change the future system. There is skepticism and mistrust in the financial services industry let alone any industry about the often inherent conflicts of interest and lack of will to do the right thing.  Do we stand by idly on the sideline and watch others being taken advantage of, or do we... engage the adversity of the status quo?  We're taking steps forward because our conviction is there's a better way.   Courage Miller Partners was founded by Ralph Courage and Jeff Miller in 2008 with the ultimate goal of serving clients better. We decided to move our business to complete independence as an SEC Registered Investment Advisor, so we could eliminate the inherent conflicts of interest that exist as part of the sales organization for a large brokerage company. As a Registered Investment Advisor, we operate as a fee only fiduciary advisor providing exceptional service where all decisions are made in the clients’ best interest while providing full transparency of fees.  Courage Miller Partners is never compensated for transactions or by commission from investments.  As a result, we feel empowered to work only for our clients so we can focus on helping our clients pursue long term goals and needs.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer
10
25
35

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year

      By default backtester will test your strategy using all available dates going back to 2001 (for subscribers only).

Overview







Description
        
Courage Miller Partners was founded by Ralph Courage and Jeff Miller in 2008 with the ultimate goal of serving clients better. We decided to move our business to complete independence as an SEC Registered Investment Advisor, so we could eliminate the inherent conflicts of interest that exist as part of the sales organizationRead More for a large brokerage company. As a Registered Investment Advisor, we operate as a fee only fiduciary advisor providing exceptional service where all decisions are made in the clients’ best interest while providing full transparency of fees. Courage Miller Partners is never compensated for transactions or by commissions from investments. As a result, we feel empowered to work only for our clients so we can focus on helping our clients pursue long term goals and needs.Read Less

Overview







Description
        
Courage Miller Partners was founded by Ralph Courage and Jeff Miller in 2008 with the ultimate goal of serving clients better. We decided to move our business to complete independence as an SEC Registered Investment Advisor, so we could eliminate the inherent conflicts of interest that exist as part of the sales organizationRead More for a large brokerage company. As a Registered Investment Advisor, we operate as a fee only fiduciary advisor providing exceptional service where all decisions are made in the clients’ best interest while providing full transparency of fees. Courage Miller Partners is never compensated for transactions or by commissions from investments. As a result, we feel empowered to work only for our clients so we can focus on helping our clients pursue long term goals and needs.Read Less
