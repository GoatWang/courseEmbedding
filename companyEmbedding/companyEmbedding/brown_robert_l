Brown, Robert L
Owner


















Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Virginia:













Does Brown, Robert L carry a valid contracting license?



In Virginia all remodeling and construction work with a cost of $1000 and up, requires a licensed contractor. There are three classes of license for contractors, from A to C. These are based on the size and scope of projects. 
Brown, Robert L currently holds license 0401000576 (Architect License), which was Active when we last checked. 











How important is contractor licensing in Virginia?



All applicants for A and B contractor licenses are required to complete a pre-license education course that has been approved by the Virginia Department of Professional and Occupational Regulation's Board for Contractors. Additionally contractors must prove at least 2 years of work experience in their specific trade. 











Your liability risk when hiring Brown, Robert L



Licensed contractors in the state of Virginia are not required to carry general liabilty or workers' compensation insurance. It is always a good idea to only hire contractors that have current general liabilty and workers' compensation policies. Request copies of the insurance certifcates for each.











Financial recourse when hiring Brown, Robert L



Virginia does offer support to homeowners for construction projects gone wrong. The Virginia Contractor Transaction Recovery Act provides relief to eligible consumers who have incurred losses through the improper or dishonest conduct of a licensed residential contractor. The Recovery Fund is supported entirely by assessments paid by licensed contractors, not by any tax revenues. Filing a claim does not guarantee payment.











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



Before hiring a contractor in Virginia,be sure to get at least 3 detailed bids.Quality contractors will take the time to explain their budget proposal,and help guide you through the estimate process.Be wary of an abnormally low bid,they are not worth the risk.These underpriced projects often do not end well for the homeowner,choose a contractor you trust and can clearly communicate with.BuildZoom has made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free).Just click here to get started.

Description:

TECHNICAL FIELDThis invention relates to a hair treatment product, and more particularly, to a composition that is useful for removing chlorine from hair. One aspect of the invention relates to a hair treatment product that also functions as a conditioner and is effective when applied to the hair either before or after the application of a permanent wave. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Swimmers who spend a great deal of time in and around chlorinated swimming pools have long been aware of the detrimental effects of chlorine on human hair. For competitive swimmers who necessarily spend a large number of hours in swimming pools each week, the problem is especially acute. In many cases, such swimmers have found that their hair actually turns green from chlorine buildup after long term exposure to the chlorinated water. Although chlorine damage to the hair can be largely avoided by wearing a waterproof, elastomeric swimcap, many swimmers find such caps to be objectionable for other reasons. Swimmers experiencing chlorine damage to their hair have heretofore attempted to wash out the chlorine with conventional, commercially available shampoos, rinses, conditioners, and the like. However, such products have proved to be largely ineffective for treating the chlorine problem. A composition is therefore needed that can be safely and conveniently applied by an individual to his or her own hair, and that will remove the chlorine from the hair, leaving it manageable and soft. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION According to the present invention, a composition is provided that is adapted to safely and effectively remove chlorine from hair. According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, a hair treatment product is provided that removes chlorine from the hair and simultaneously conditions chlorine-damaged hair so as to make it more soft and manageable. According to another embodiment of the invention, a product for removing chlorine from hair is provided that comprises a substantially homogeneous mixture of ammonium lauryl sulfate, cocamide diethanolamine, sodium bicarbonate, cocobetaine and water. According to a particularly preferred embodiment of the invention, a composition for removing chlorine from hair is provided that comprises from about 2 to about 15 weight percent ammonium lauryl sulfate, from about 2 to about 8 weight percent cocamide diethanolamine, from about 0.1 to about 75 weight percent sodium bicarbonate, from about 2 to about 8 weight percent cocobetaine, and the remainder of water. According to another preferred embodiment of the invention, minor effective amounts of aloe vera, vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin C, methylparabens and alcohol are also employed in combination with ammonium lauryl sulfate, cocamide diethanolamine, sodium bicarbonate, cocobetaine and water in the compositions of the invention. The compositions disclosed herein will, for the first time, provide swimmers with a safe, economical and effective product for removing chlorine from hair and for reconditioning and restoring luster, softness and body to chlorine damaged hair. They can also be effective when utilized as either a preconditioner or postconditioner when applied to the hair before or after treatment with a permanent wave solution. The compositions of the invention are further described and explained in the detailed description set forth below.   DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The compositions disclosed herein have been found to be surprisingly effective for treating chlorine damaged hair. They are preferably liquid, water-based compositions that can be conveniently applied to the hair and then rinsed out in much the same manner as other conventional, commercially available shampoos and the like. Thus, a swimmer might desirably apply the subject composition to the hair and then rinse it from the hair while showering or bathing in the usual manner upon leaving a chlorinated pool or pool area. After rinsing the subject composition from the hair, the hair can be toweled, blow dried, or otherwise dried, in accordance with the usual preferences of the swimmer. The compositions of the invention preferably comprise water having dissolved or homogeneously dispersed therein from about 2 to about 15 weight percent ammonium lauryl sulfate, from about 2 to about 8 weight percent cocamide diethanolamine, from about 0.1 to about 75 weight percent sodium bicarbonate and from about 2 to about 8 weight percent cocobetaine. More preferably, the compositions of the invention will comprise water having dissolved or homogeneously dispersed therein from about 2 to about 15 weight percent ammonium lauryl sulfate, from about 2 to about 8 weight percent cocamide diethanolamine, from about 10 to about 20 weight percent sodium bicarbonate, and from about 2 to about 8 weight percent cocobetaine. Especially desirable results are achieved by employing the foregoing combination of ingredients in combination with minor effective amounts of vitamin C, vitamin D, vitamin E and methylparabens. For most purposes, a minor effective amount of each of the foregoing ingredients ranges up to about 1 percent by weight of the total composition although greater amounts can be included without departing from the scope of the invention. Additionally, relatively minor amounts of an alcohol such as, for example, up to about 2 percent by weight of the nonaqueous ingredients of isopropanol can also be employed in the compositions of the invention to facilitate dissolution and dispersion of the non-water soluble components. A proteinaceous compound can also be included if desired, and other conventional, commercially available conditioners can be employed to augment the compositions disclosed herein for rehabilitating damaged hair. Thus, although the components recited above are believed to be sufficient for making the compositions of the invention, it will be understood and appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art upon reading this application that other compounds, components and ingredients can also be incorporated within the subject formulations within the scope of the invention and without otherwise detracting from the unexpected and beneficial results that are achieved with the compositions of the invention. Likewise, it is understood that in some cases other components, compounds or ingredients that are structurally and functionally analagous to those recited above can also be used within the scope of the invention. The compositions of the present invention are satisfactorily made by mixing the various ingredients at room temperature in a stainless steel tank equipped with a high speed stirring device. After mixing, the composition is transferred by conventional filling equipment into bottles or other containers suitable for shipping, storage or use. In addition to functioning as a chlorine remover for hair, the subject compositions are also useful when applied before or after treatment with a permanent wave solution, and will make the hair less frizzy following a permanent. Beneficial results have also been observed in using the subject compositions for treatment of hand dermatitis. Other alterations, modifications or uses of the compositions disclosed herein will become apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art upon reading the specification, and it is intended to cover all such alterations, modifications, or uses as fall within the scope of the appended claims.
