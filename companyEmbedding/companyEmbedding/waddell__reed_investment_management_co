Waddell & Reed Financial, Inc. (NYSE: WDR) is an American asset management and financial planning company founded in 1937. It has been a publicly traded company since 1998, and has its headquarters in Overland Park, Kansas. It operates asset management and distribution subsidiaries, including Ivy Investment Management Company and Waddell & Reed Investment Management Company.[1]
The company distributes products through three primary channels, the Advisors channel (a network of personal financial advisors around the country); the Wholesale channel (unaffilated broker/dealers, registered investment advisors and retirement platforms); and the Institutional channel (pension plans, defined benefit plans and endowments).
History[edit]
The company traces its history to September 3, 1937 when it was founded by Chauncey Waddell and Cameron Reed. The company was one of the first to sell funds following the Investment Company Act of 1940. Two of its funds—United Income Fund and United Accumulative Fund—were among the first mutual funds in the United States. Its first offices were in department stores. Continental Investment Corporation of Boston bought Waddell & Reed for $82.5 million in 1969. Liberty National Insurance Holding Company, later renamed Torchmark Corporation acquired it for $160 million in 1981.[2] Torchmark spun it off in 1998 in a deal where for 10 Torchmark shares held, Torchmark shareholders received 3 shares of Waddell & Reed.[3]

Is Waddell & Reed Financial (WDR) a Great Stock for Value Investors?


July 27, 2017, 09:30:00 AM EDT
By Zacks Equity Research, Zacks.com

Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn't want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let's put Waddell & Reed Financial Inc.WDR stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock's current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Waddell & Reed Financial has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 10.01, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 20.66. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, Waddell & Reed Financial's current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years, with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months.Further, the stock's PE also compares favorably with the Zacks classified Finance- Investment Management industry's trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 17.50. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Waddell & Reed Financial has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year's earnings) of just 13.07, so it is fair to say that the stock price might appreciate in future.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock's price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Waddell & Reed Financial has a P/S ratio of about 1.47. This is a lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.21 right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.If anything, WDR is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P/S metric, suggesting some level of undervalued trading-at least compared to historical norms.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Waddell & Reed Financial currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of 'B', putting it into the top 40% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Waddell & Reed Financial a solid choice for value investors.What About the Stock Overall?Though Waddell & Reed Financial might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of 'F' and a Momentum score of 'A'. This gives WDR a Zacks VGM score-or its overarching fundamental grade-of 'C'. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company's recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best. The current quarter has seen two estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to two lower, while the full year estimate has also seen two up and two down in the same time period.This has had just a small impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has fallen by 5.1% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has inched up by 1.2%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Waddell & Reed Financial, Inc. Price and ConsensusWaddell & Reed Financial, Inc. Price and Consensus | Waddell & Reed Financial, Inc. QuoteThis somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and why we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineWaddell & Reed Financial is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Moreover, a strong industry rank (Top 30%) strengthens its growth potential. In fact, over the last one year, the Finance-Investment Management industry has clearly outperformed the broader market, as you can see below:So, value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.More Stock News: Tech Opportunity Worth $386 Billion in 2017                 From driverless cars to artificial intelligence, we've seen an unsurpassed growth of high-tech products in recent months. Yesterday's science-fiction is becoming today's reality. Despite all the innovation, there is a single component no tech company can survive without.

Waddell & Reed Financial, Inc. (NYSE: WDR) is an American asset management and financial planning company founded in 1937. It has been a publicly traded company since 1998, and has its headquarters in Overland Park, Kansas. It operates asset management and distribution subsidiaries, including Ivy Investment Management Company and Waddell & Reed Investment Management Company.[1]
The company distributes products through three primary channels, the Advisors channel (a network of personal financial advisors around the country); the Wholesale channel (unaffilated broker/dealers, registered investment advisors and retirement platforms); and the Institutional channel (pension plans, defined benefit plans and endowments).
History[edit]
The company traces its history to September 3, 1937 when it was founded by Chauncey Waddell and Cameron Reed. The company was one of the first to sell funds following the Investment Company Act of 1940. Two of its funds—United Income Fund and United Accumulative Fund—were among the first mutual funds in the United States. Its first offices were in department stores. Continental Investment Corporation of Boston bought Waddell & Reed for $82.5 million in 1969. Liberty National Insurance Holding Company, later renamed Torchmark Corporation acquired it for $160 million in 1981.[2] Torchmark spun it off in 1998 in a deal where for 10 Torchmark shares held, Torchmark shareholders received 3 shares of Waddell & Reed.[3]

SEC-Required Report on Routing of Customer Orders
Waddell & Reed, Inc. ("W&R") introduces transactions on a fully disclosed basis to our clearing firm, Pershing LLC ("Pershing") . In November 2000, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") adopted new rules aimed at improving the quality and availability of disclosure related to order execution and routing practices. Pershing has prepared reports pursuant to U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 606 that requires all brokerage firms to make publicly available quarterly reports on their order routing practices. The report provides information on the routing of "non-directed orders" - any order that the customer has not specifically instructed to be routed to a particular venue for execution. For these non-directed orders, our clearing firm has selected the execution venue on behalf of its customers.

The report is divided into four sections: one for securities listed on the New York Stock Exchange, one for securities listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market, one for securities listed on the American Stock Exchange or regional exchanges, and one for exchange-listed options. For each section, this report identifies the venues most often selected by the clearing firm, sets forth the percentage of various types of orders routed to the venues, and discusses the material aspects of the respective clearing firm's relationship with the venues. W&R directs its equity order flow to its clearing firm, Pershing, for routing and execution based upon where the customer's account is held. W&R does not receive compensation for directing order flow to Pershing.

Proxy Voting

Prior to the general meeting of a company or fund, shareholders will receive a package
in the mail containing a variety of documents that report financial data and operations
results and announce important issues - such as proposals for changes to the company's
share structure or mergers and acquisitions. These are all matters that shareholders
or unit holders, the true owners of the company or fund, will vote on at the general
meeting. If, however, a shareholder is not able to attend an annual (or special)
meeting, he or she can vote on proposals by means of a proxy, one of the documents
that is included in the pre-meeting mailing package. Shareholders are encouraged
to take advantage of their opportunity to influence the company and fund’s operations
by casting their vote.

Data quoted is past performance and current performance may be lower or higher. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate, and shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.Risk Factors: The value of the Fund's shares will change, and you could lose money on your investment. Investing in companies involved primarily in a single asset class (large cap) may be more risky and volatile than an investment with greater diversification. An investment in the Fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. These and other risks are more fully described in the Fund's prospectus. Not all funds or fund classes may be offered at all broker/dealers.
Index Description: The Russell 1000 Growth Index measures the performance of the large-cap growth segment of the U.S. equity universe. It is not possible to invest directly in an index.
Performance results for some funds may include the effect of expense reduction arrangements. If those arrangements had not been in place, the performance results would have been lower.
Fee Waiver and/or Expense Reimbursement: Through October 31, 2017, Waddell & Reed Investment Management Company (WRIMCO), the Fund’s investment manager, Waddell & Reed, Inc. (Waddell & Reed), the Fund’s distributor, and / or Waddell & Reed Services Company, doing business as WI Services Company (WISC), the Fund’s transfer agent, have contractually agreed to reimburse sufficient management fees, 12b-1 fees and / or shareholder servicing fees to cap the total annual ordinary fund operating expenses as follows: Class A shares at 2.31%, Class B shares at 2.12%, Class C shares at 0.87%. Prior to that date, the expense limitation may not be terminated by WRIMCO, Waddell & Reed, WISC or the Board of Trustees.
Pricing: All prices and year-to-date returns are based on closing quotes unless noted, as supplied to the NASDAQ by 6:00 p.m. Eastern time. YTD Prices can be updated 3 to 4 hours after the Daily Pricing information which can result in mismatching data.
Style Analysis: The Morningstar Style Box reveals a fund's investment style. For equity funds the vertical axis shows the market capitalization of the stocks owned and the horizontal axis shows investment style (value, blend, or growth). For fixed-income funds, the vertical axis shows the credit quality of the bonds owned and the horizontal axis shows interest rate sensitivity as measured by a bond's effective duration. Morningstar seeks credit rating information from fund companies on a periodic basis (e.g., quarterly). In compiling credit rating information, Morningstar instructs fund companies to only use ratings that have been assigned by the following Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations (NRSROs): Moody's, Standard & Poor's, Fitch, and Egan-Jones. If two NRSROs have rated a security, fund companies are to report the lowest rating; if three or more NRSROs have rated the same security differently, fund companies are to report the rating that is in the middle. For example, if NRSRO X rates a security AA-, NRSRO Y rates the same security an A and NRSRO Z rates it a BBB+, the fund company should use the credit rating of 'A' in its reporting to Morningstar. PLEASE NOTE: Morningstar, Inc. is not itself an NRSRO nor does it issue a credit rating on the fund. An NRSRO rating on a fixed-income security can change from time-to-time. For credit quality, Morningstar combines the credit rating information provided by the fund companies with an average default rate calculation to come up with a weighted-average credit quality. The weighted-average credit quality is currently a letter that roughly corresponds to the scale used by a leading NRSRO. Bond funds are assigned a style box placement of "low", "medium", or "high" based on their average credit quality. Funds with a low credit quality are those whose weighted-average credit quality is determined to be less than "BBB-"; medium are those less than "AA-", but greater or equal to "BBB-"; and high are those with a weighted-average credit quality of "AA-" or higher. When classifying a bond portfolio, Morningstar first maps the NRSRO credit ratings of the underlying holdings to their respective default rates (as determined by Morningstar's analysis of actual historical default rates). Morningstar then averages these default rates to determine the average default rate for the entire bond fund. Finally, Morningstar maps this average default rate to its corresponding credit rating along a convex curve. For interest-rate sensitivity, Morningstar obtains from fund companies the average effective duration. Generally, Morningstar classifies a fixed-income fund's interest-rate sensitivity based on the effective duration of the Morningstar Core Bond Index (MCBI), which is currently three years. The classification of Limited will be assigned to those funds whose average effective duration is between 25% to 75% of MCBI's average effective duration; funds whose average effective duration is between 75% to 125% of the MCBI will be classified as Moderate; and those that are at 125% or greater of the average effective duration of the MCBI will be classified as Extensive. For municipal bond funds, Morningstar also obtains from fund companies the average effective duration. In these cases static breakpoints are utilized. These breakpoints are as follows: (i) Limited: 4.5 years or less; (ii) Moderate: more than 4.5 years but less than 7 years; and (iii) Extensive: more than 7 years. In addition, for non-US taxable and non-US domiciled fixed income funds static duration breakpoints are used: (i) Limited: less than or equal to 3.5 years; (ii) Moderate: greater than 3.5 and less than equal to 6 years; (iii) Extensive: greater than 6 years.
Unsubsidized yields reflect what the yield would have been without the effect of reimbursements and waivers. The adviser and its affiliates have or may voluntarily waive a portion of their fees (including, but not limited to, distribution and service (12b-1) fees) and reimburse certain expenses. There is no guarantee that the fund will avoid a negative yield. Such undertaking may be amended or withdrawn at any time. 
12-Month Trailing Distribution Yield: at NAV refers to the 12-month historical cash flow paid over the past 12 months in dividends, divided by the past months ending NAV. 
Alpha, Beta, R-Squared, Standard Deviation, Sharpe Ratio and Capture Ratio are 5 year statistics. Alpha is a measure of a fund's actual returns and expected performance, given its level of risk (as measured by beta). Beta reflects the sensitivity of the fund's return to fluctuations in the market index. R-squared indicates how much of a fund's fluctuations were attributable to movements in the fund's benchmark. Standard deviation is a measure of how volatile a fund's returns are. Sharpe ratio is a measure of a fund's risk-adjusted performance. Capture ratio reflects the annualized product of fund vs. index returns for all months in which the index had a positive return (upside capture) or negative return (downside capture).
The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance, and does not include the effects of sales charges. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.  © 2017 Morningstar, Inc.

*Eligible Rollover Distribution (ERD) refers to those distributions from Qualified Plans that are eligible to move between various fiduciary plan types (for example - 403(b), 401(k)) without tax consequences. These Qualified Plan types are referred to in Internal Revenue Code (IRC) 401(a) and include Profit Sharing, 401(k), Money Purchase Pension, Defined-Benefit, and ESOP. An ERD may also be from an IRC 403(b) (7) plan, which is for employees of non-profit institutions and public schools.
If an election is made to take an ERD from these plans in cash or "in kind" there is a mandatory 20% federal withholding. When this occurs, various states require withholding as indicated.

Traditional, Roth and rollover IRAs offer attractive tax advantages and can serve as primary or supplemental retirement savings vehicles.  




Traditional IRA



Invest in a traditional IRA and defer paying taxes until you make withdrawals in retirement. Why does deferral matter? Simply put, if you think you will be in a lower tax bracket when you retire, your tax savings could be significant when you withdraw the money. Learn more about the traditional IRA:

Deferred taxes and tax deductions. In addition to deferring taxes on current investment income or appreciation, you may be able to deduct all or a portion of your annual contribution, depending on your adjusted gross income.
Contributions. If you are younger than 70½ in 2017 and have taxable compensation, you may contribute up to the current maximum of $5,500. If you are 50 or older, you can make an additional $1,000 catch-up contribution. You also may contribute for a non-working or minimally working spouse. 
Reinvested earnings. All earnings from your traditional IRA are automatically reinvested into your account to maximize your total return.
Required withdrawals.  At age 70½, the IRS mandates that you begin taking an annual withdrawal called a required minimum distribution (RMD). Your Waddell & Reed financial advisor can assist you in calculating and understanding the RMD process.  



IRA vs. Taxable Account Comparison
Your IRA’s potential growth is tax deferred until withdrawn and can accumulate substantially faster than identical savings in a taxable account

This chart is for illustration purposes only and does not represent the past or future performance of any specific investment. This chart assumes the reinvestment of all earnings
and does not take into account any applicable fees, expenses, or possible withdrawals. The chart does not reflect all possible variables that may affect results. This illustration does not reflect the impact of state income taxes. Your situation may be different.

The assumed rate of return is not a guarantee, and investments that pay higher rates of return are generally subject to higher risk and volatility. Please note that lower minimum
tax rates on capital gains and dividends would make the investment return for the taxable investment more favorable and thus would reduce the difference in performance
between the accounts shown.

Investors should consider their personal investment horizon and income tax bracket, both current and anticipated, when making an investment decision, as these may further
impact the comparison.



Roth IRA



What are your tax expectations when you retire? If you think you will be taxed at a higher rate than today, think about saving for retirement with a Roth IRA. You'll make Roth contributions with money that has already been taxed at today's potentially lower rate. When you withdraw in retirement, your contributions and any potential growth may be tax free. That's one big reason to contribute. Other reasons the Roth IRA may be right for you include:


 Roth IRA Flyer



Contributions. You can contribute to a Roth IRA as long as you or your spouse have taxable income and your modified adjusted gross income is within the Roth limits. For 2017 you may contribute up to the current maximum of $5,500. If you are 50 or older, you can make an additional $1,000 catch-up contribution.




Roth IRA Adjusted Gross Income Limits for 2017


Single, head of household
 $118,000-$133,000


Married filing jointly 
$186,000-$196,000


Married filing separately
 $10,000





Withdrawals. You can withdraw contributions for any reason at any time without taxes or penalties. However, request a withdrawal before your account is at least five years old or if you are not yet 59½ and the earnings portion may be subject to a 10% penalty (exceptions apply). With a Roth, unlike the traditional IRA, the IRS does not mandate a required minimum distribution at age 70½.

Earn too much to contribute to a Roth IRA? Consider contributing to and converting a traditional IRA to a Roth. A Waddell & Reed financial advisor can explain the details and guide you in this decision. 



Rollover IRA



When you’re ready to retire or switch employers, don’t leave without thinking about the assets in your employer’s retirement plan. One option is to transfer them directly to a rollover IRA, where you may benefit from:


 Rollover IRA Flyer



Tax-deferred retirement savings. Defer taxes on earnings until withdrawn in retirement.
    
No current income taxes. Avoid current income taxes, including a mandatory 20% income tax withholding and possible 10% excise tax, when you rollover.
    
Withdrawal flexibility. Withdraw without tax penalties between ages 59 ½ and 70 ½. After 70 ½, the IRS mandates require minimum distributions based on your average life expectancy

Other options for your assets in a former employer's retirement plan include: 

Leave the assets in the plan
Keep/spend the assets
Receive the assets in a check and deposit them yourself in an IRA rollover
Transfer your assets directly into your new employer’s retirement plan

What you choose depends on your previous employer’s plan document, your specific needs and your tax advisor's guidance. 






Add an IRA to your retirement savings plan.

Important Information:
Early withdrawals are subject to ordinary income tax and a 10% penalty if you take a distribution before reaching age 59½.

Is It Wise to Trade Your Pension for a Lump Sum?

Most private employers have already replaced traditional pensions, which promise lifetime income payments in retirement, with defined contribution plans such as 401(k)s.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.
