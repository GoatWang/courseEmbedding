Strategos Capital Management, LLC (the “Company”) has a company culture devoted to integrity and client service.  Integrity and client service are a part of our Company’s core values and are reflected in the way we serve our clients each day.

This Privacy Policy and Notice (this “Policy”) reflects the practices of the Company.  It describes how “nonpublic personal information,” which includes customer and financial information, may be collected and shared, as well as the steps we take to protect this information from unauthorized access.

These guidelines apply to both current and former clients of the Company and are designed to comply with the privacy provisions in Title V of the Gramm-Leach Bliley Act, as well as applicable federal privacy regulations.

II. Why?

Financial companies choose how they share your nonpublic personal information. Federal law gives consumers the right to limit some, but not all sharing. Federal law also requires us to tell you how we collect, share, and protect your nonpublic personal information. Please read this notice carefully to understand what we do.

III. What?

The types of nonpublic personal information we collect and share depend on the product or service you have with us. This information may be collected from a variety of sources, including:


Information (such as your name, address, Social Security number, and financial information) we receive from you on subscription agreements, investment management agreements or other account forms;

Information we receive through your transactions or experiences as our customer, such as your account balance, payment history and securities holdings; and

Information we may receive from outside companies, such as a credit reporting agency.



IV. Reasons We Can Share Your Nonpublic Personal Information

Other parties as permitted or required by applicable law. These may include, for example, government agencies in response to subpoenas and other legal processes, consumer reporting agencies, or those with whom you have authorized us to share information.
