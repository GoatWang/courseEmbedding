The strategy of The Chartist Newsletter has evolved over the years, but its basic approach to the market remains the same. Founder and Editor Dan Sullivan explains, "We do not make predictions or pretend to have a crystal ball. Instead we let the market be our guide. If we are wrong we simply get out of the market and wait for a more opportune time. And while we are quick to sell off our losers, we part with our winners very slowly. This approach might not work for everyone, but it has certainly worked for us." The Chartist is unusual because of the thousands of investment advisory newsletters published in the U.S., only a few follow their own advice with real money on the line. Sullivan is highly critical of the so-called "hypothetical portfolios," contending that they are out of touch with the real world. Dan Sullivan's investment strategy is dictated by an iron-clad discipline: profits are allowed to run, losses are quickly cut. And, he uses relative strength for his stock selection process. Essentially, this is a buy high, sell higher approach. The basic concept of relative strength is that the stocks that are stronger compared to their peers will appreciate to a much greater degree than the average issue. This dictates buying stocks after they have already made significant gains. The average investor finds this difficult to do because it is, in effect, the opposite of conventional lore of buying low and selling high. The high relative strength stocks, however, are exactly the ones Sullivan wants because they offer the potential for the greatest gains. It should be cautioned that relative strength is a double-edged sword. These stocks have the potential for outsized gains in bull markets, but will be among the hardest hit during bear markets. For this reason, Sullivan combines his stock selection process with market timing. His proprietary indicators measure the risk in the stock market. This strategy allows Sullivan to invest in top-performing stocks while keeping the overall risk low. Sullivan has been successfully utilizing these techniques for over 42 years. He believes in his disciplined approach to investing and puts real money on the line to prove it. The Chartist is one of the very few advisory services that actually buys and sells the stocks it recommends. In an industry where hundreds of financial newsletters come and go every year, The Chartist has stood the test of time.

About Accelerate Diagnostics (NASDAQ:AXDX)
Accelerate Diagnostics, Inc. is an in vitro diagnostics company engaged in providing solutions that develop patient outcomes through the diagnosis of serious infections. The Company's in vitro diagnostic platform, the Accelerate Pheno system utilizes genotypic technology to identify (ID), infectious pathogens and phenotypic technology to conduct antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST), which determines whether live bacterial or fungal cells are resistant or susceptible to a particular antibiotic. It detects and identifies pathogens directly from a single patient sample followed by antimicrobial susceptibility testing based on the identification results. The Accelerate PhenoTest BC Kit provides ID and AST results for patients suspected of bacteremia or fungemia, both life-threatening conditions with high morbidity and mortality risk. The Accelerate Pheno system features walk-away automation and consists of a fixed instrument and single-use test kit.

Consensus Ratings for Accelerate Diagnostics (NASDAQ:AXDX) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 3 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Buy (Score: 3.00)Consensus Price Target: $30.33 (11.31% upside)

						Chartists Hone In On Comscore Inc (SCOR)’s Rank Correlation Indicator					











Shares of Comscore Inc (SCOR) are nearing some key technical levels as the Rank Correlation indicator has trending higher over the past few sessions, nearing potential overbought territory.  Crossing the 80 mark would suggest that a chance of a reversal is increasing. 
The Rank Correlation Index (RCI) is based on an analysis algorithm by Charles Spearman. It uses a combination of price change data and time change data to identify potential changes in market sentiment, thereby exposing turning points.  Zero crossings are seen as buy and sell signals, with tops and bottoms yielding overbought and oversold information. 
While traders are taking a second look at how shares of Comscore Inc (SCOR) have been performing lately, we can examine some additional key indicators. A favorite tool among technical stock analysts is the moving average. Moving averages are considered to be lagging indicators that simply take the average price of a stock over a specific period of time. Moving averages can be very useful for identifying peaks and troughs. They may also be used to help the trader figure out proper support and resistance levels for the stock. Currently, the 200-day MA is sitting at 27.28, and the 50-day is 25.95.
The 14-day ADX for Comscore Inc (SCOR) is currently at 40.77. In general, and ADX value from 0-25 would represent an absent or weak trend. A value of 25-50 would support a strong trend. A value of 50-75 would signify a very strong trend, and a value of 75-100 would point to an extremely strong trend. Checking in on some other technical levels, the 14-day RSI is currently at 64.07, the 7-day stands at 62.43, and the 3-day is sitting at 53.70. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of stock price movements. The RSI was developed by J. Welles Wilder, and it oscillates between 0 and 100. Generally, the RSI is considered to be oversold when it falls below 30 and overbought when it heads above 70. RSI can be used to detect general trends as well as finding divergences and failure swings.
At the time of writing, Comscore Inc (SCOR) has a 14-day Commodity Channel Index (CCI) of 136.48. Developed by Donald Lambert, the CCI is a versatile tool that may be used to help spot an emerging trend or provide warning of extreme conditions. CCI generally measures the current price relative to the average price level over a specific time period. CCI is relatively high when prices are much higher than average, and relatively low when prices are much lower than the average. Investors may be watching other technical indicators such as the Williams Percent Range or Williams %R. The Williams %R is a momentum indicator that helps measure oversold and overbought levels. This indicator compares the closing price of a stock in relation to the highs and lows over a certain time period. A common look back period is 14 days. Comscore Inc (SCOR)’s Williams %R presently stands at -35.14. The Williams %R oscillates in a range from 0 to -100. A reading between 0 and -20 would indicate an overbought situation. A reading from -80 to -100 would indicate an oversold situation.
