                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

any products, goods or services to Obligors with respect to the
Receivables so long as such practices, promotions or sales are
offered to obligors of comparable motor vehicle receivables
serviced by the Servicer for itself and others, whether or not such

aggregate amount of payments on the Receivables, prepayments or
faster or slower timing of the payment of the
Receivables.

PROCEDURES AS LONG AS, IN EACH CASE, SUCH PROGRAMS OR MODIFICATIONS

301.7701-4(C) THAT IS TREATED AS A GRANTOR TRUST UNDER SUBPART E,
PART I OF SUBCHAPTER J OF THE CODE.
SECTION
3.3     Realization
Upon Receivables .
On behalf of the Issuer, the Servicer will use commercially
reasonable efforts, consistent with its Customary Servicing
Practices, to repossess or otherwise convert the ownership of the
Financed Vehicle securing any Receivable as to which the Servicer
has determined eventual payment in full is unlikely unless it
determines in its sole discretion that repossession will not
increase the Liquidation Proceeds by an amount greater than the
expense of such repossession or that the proceeds ultimately
recoverable with respect to such Receivable would be increased by
forbearance. The Servicer will follow such Customary Servicing
Practices as it deems necessary or advisable, which may include
reasonable efforts to realize upon any recourse to any Dealer and
selling the Financed Vehicle at public or private sale. The
foregoing will be subject to the provision that, in any case in
which the Financed Vehicle has suffered damage, the Servicer shall
not be required to expend funds in connection with the repair or
the repossession of such Financed Vehicle unless it determines in
its sole discretion that such repair and/or repossession will
increase the Liquidation Proceeds by an amount greater than the
amount of such expenses. In addition, the Servicer may from time to
time (but is not required to) sell any deficiency balance in
accordance with its Customary Servicing Practices; provided
, however , that (i) each sale must be made at a price equal
to the fair market value of such deficiency balance in cash in
immediately available funds and (ii) such sale must be without
recourse, representation or warranty by the Issuer or the Servicer
(other than any representation or warranty regarding the absence of
Liens, that the Issuer has good title to the deficiency balance, or
similar representation or warranty). Net proceeds of any such sale
allocable to the Receivable will constitute Liquidation Proceeds,
and the sole right of the Issuer and the Indenture Trustee with
respect to any such sold Receivables will be to receive such
Liquidation

Proceeds.
Upon such sale, the Servicer will mark its computer records
indicating that any such receivable sold is no longer a Receivable.
The Servicer is authorized to take any and all actions necessary or
appropriate on behalf of the Issuer to evidence the sale of the
Receivable free from any Lien or other interest of the Issuer or
the Indenture Trustee.
SECTION
3.4     Maintenance
of Security Interests in Financed Vehicles .
The Servicer will, in accordance with its Customary Servicing
Practices, take such steps as are necessary to maintain perfection
of the security interest created by each Receivable in the related
Financed Vehicle. The provisions set forth in this Section are the
sole requirements under the Transaction Documents with respect to
the maintenance of collateral or security for the Receivables. It
is understood that the Financed Vehicles are the collateral and
security for the Receivables, but that the Certificate of Title
with respect to a Financed Vehicle does not constitute collateral
for that Receivable and merely evidences such security interest.
The Issuer hereby authorizes the Servicer to take such steps as are
necessary to re-perfect such security interest on behalf of the
Issuer and the Indenture Trustee in the event of the relocation of
a Financed Vehicle or for any other reason.
SECTION
3.5     Covenants
of Servicer .
Unless required by law or court order, the Servicer will not
release the Financed Vehicle securing each such Receivable from the
security interest granted by such Receivable in whole or in part
except (a) in the event of payment in full by or on behalf of the
Obligor thereunder or payment in full less a deficiency which the
Servicer would not attempt to collect in accordance with its
Customary Servicing Practices, (b) in connection with repossession
or (c) as may be required by an insurer in order to receive
proceeds from any Insurance Policy covering such Financed
Vehicle.
SECTION
3.6     Purchase
of Receivables Upon Breach .
Upon discovery by any party hereto of a breach of any of the
covenants set forth in Section 3.2 , 3.3 , 3.4
or 3.5 with respect to any Receivable which materially and
adversely affects the interests of the Issuer, the
Certificateholders or the Noteholders, the party discovering such
breach shall give prompt written notice thereof to the other
parties hereto; provided, that delivery of a
Servicer’s Report which identifies the Receivables that are
being or have been purchased pursuant to this Section 3.6
shall be deemed to constitute prompt notice by the Servicer and the
Issuer of such breach; provided , further , that the
failure to give such notice shall not affect any obligation of the
Servicer hereunder. If the breach materially and adversely affects
the interests of the Issuer, the Certificateholders or the
Noteholders, then the Servicer shall either (a) correct or cure
such breach or (b) purchase such Receivable from the Issuer, in
either case on or before the Payment Date following the end of the
Collection Period which includes the 60th day (or, if the Servicer
elects, an earlier date) after the date that the Servicer became
aware or was notified of such breach. Any such breach or failure
will be deemed not to have a material and adverse effect if such
breach or failure does not affect the ability of the Issuer to
receive and retain timely payment in full on such Receivable. Any
such purchase by the Servicer shall be at a price equal to the
Repurchase Price. In consideration for such purchase, the Servicer
shall make (or shall cause to be made) a payment to the Issuer
equal to the Repurchase Price by depositing such amount into the
Collection Account prior to 11:00 a.m., New York City time on the
date of such purchase, if such date is not a Payment Date or, if
such date is a Payment Date, then prior to the close of business on
the Business Day prior to such date. Upon payment of such
Repurchase Price by the Servicer, the Issuer and the Indenture
Trustee shall release and shall execute and deliver such
instruments of release, transfer or assignment, in each case
without recourse or representation and as prepared by and at the
expense of the Servicer, as shall be reasonably necessary to vest
in the Servicer or its designee any Receivable and the related
Transferred Assets purchased pursuant hereto. It is understood and
agreed that the obligation of the Servicer to purchase any
Receivable as described above shall constitute the sole remedy
respecting such breach available to the Issuer and the Indenture
Trustee.
SECTION
3.7     Servicing
Fee .
On each Payment Date, the Issuer shall pay to the Servicer the
Servicing Fee in accordance with Section 8.5 of the
Indenture for the immediately preceding Collection Period as
compensation for its services. In addition, the Servicer will be
entitled to retain all Supplemental Servicing Fees. The Servicer
also will be entitled to receive investment earnings (net of
investment losses and expenses) on funds deposited in the
Collection Account during each Collection Period.
SECTION
3.8     Administrator’s
Fee .
The Servicer shall pay the fees and expenses of the Administrator
described in Section 3 of the Administration

and authority, to engage in the following activities:
(a) to

and
(f) subject
to compliance with the Transaction Documents, to engage in such
other activities as may be required in connection with conservation
of the Trust Estate and the making of distributions to the
Certificateholders and payments to the Noteholders.

Each
of the Owner Trustee and the Administrator, as applicable, is
hereby authorized to engage in the foregoing activities on behalf
of the Issuer. Neither the Issuer nor any Person acting on behalf
of the Issuer shall engage in any activity other than in connection
with the foregoing or other than as required or authorized by the
terms of this Agreement or the other Transaction
Documents.
Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in the Transaction Documents or in any
other document, neither the Issuer nor the Owner Trustee (nor any
agent of either person) shall be authorized or empowered to acquire
any other investments, reinvest any proceeds of the Issuer or
engage in activities other than the foregoing, and, in particular
neither the Issuer nor the Owner Trustee (nor any agent of either
person) shall be authorized or empowered to do anything that would
cause the Issuer to fail to qualify as a fixed investment trust

treated as a grantor trust under subpart E, Part I of subchapter J
of the Code.

Estate and shall be deposited in the Collection Account.

of Trust .

obligations of the Issuer under the Transaction Documents. It is
the intention of the parties hereto that the Issuer

constitute
a statutory trust under the Statutory Trust Statute and that (i)
this Agreement constitute the governing instrument of such
statutory trust and (ii) for United States federal, state and local
income, franchise and value added tax purposes, the Issuer shall be
treated as a fixed investment trust described in Treasury
Regulation section 301.7701-4(c) that is treated as a grantor trust
under subpart E, Part I of subchapter J of the Code, with the
assets of the Issuer constituting the Receivables and other assets
held by the Issuer, and the Notes constituting non-recourse debt of
the Certificateholder(s), provided that if it is
successfully asserted by the appropriate tax authorities that the
Issuer is not properly characterized as a fixed investment trust
described in Treasury Regulation section 301.7701-4(c) that is
treated as a grantor trust under subpart E, Part I of subchapter J
of the Code, the Issuer shall be treated, for United States
federal, state and local income, franchise and value added tax
purposes, as (A) a disregarded entity if there is only one
beneficial owner for U.S. federal income tax purposes of the
Certificates and any Notes that are treated as equity in the
Issuer, or (B) a partnership (other than an association or publicly
traded partnership taxable as a corporation) if there is more than
one beneficial owner for U.S. federal income tax purposes of the
Certificates and any Notes that are treated as equity for U.S.
federal income tax purposes in the Issuer, with the assets of the
partnership being the Receivables and other assets held by the
Issuer, the partners of the partnership being the
Certificateholders and the holders of the Notes that are treated as
equity in the Issuer for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and the
remaining Notes constituting indebtedness of the partnership. The
parties hereto and each Certificateholder, by acceptance of a
Certificate, agree to treat the Issuer in accordance with the
intention that the Issuer be characterized as a fixed investment
trust described in Treasury Regulation section 301.7701-4(c) that
is treated as a grantor trust under subpart E, Part I of subchapter
J of the Code and, unless otherwise required by appropriate taxing
authorities or by law, not to take any action or, direct any other
party to take any action, inconsistent therewith, including, but
not limited to, modifying, or directing any other party to modify,
the terms of a Receivable unless the modification is a Permitted
Modification. In furtherance of the foregoing, (i) the purpose of
the Issuer shall be to protect and conserve the assets of the
Issuer, and the Issuer shall not at any time engage in or carry on
any kind of business for U.S. federal income tax purposes or any
kind of commercial activity and (ii) the Issuer and Owner Trustee
(upon direction from the Certificateholder) (and any agent of
either person) shall take, or refrain from taking, all such action
as is necessary to maintain the status of the Issuer as a fixed
investment trust described in Treasury Regulation section
301.7701-4(c) that is treated as a grantor trust under subpart E,
Part I of subchapter J of the Code. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement or otherwise, neither the Issuer nor the
Owner Trustee (nor any agent of either person) shall (1) acquire
any assets or dispose of any portion of the Issuer other than
pursuant to the specific provisions of this Agreement, (2) vary the
investment of the Issuer within the meaning of Treasury Regulation
section 301.7701-4(c) or (3) substitute new investments or reinvest
so as to enable the Issuer to take advantage of variations in the
market to improve the investment of any Certificateholder. The
provisions of this Trust Agreement shall be interpreted consistent
with and to further this intention of the parties. The parties
agree that, unless otherwise required by appropriate tax
authorities, the Issuer will file or cause to be filed annual or
other necessary tax returns, reports and other forms consistent
with the foregoing characterization of the Issuer for United States
federal, state and local income, franchise and value added tax
purposes. No election will be made by or on behalf of the Issuer to
be classified as an association taxable as a corporation for United
States federal income tax purposes. Effective as of the date
hereof, the Owner Trustee shall have all rights, powers and duties
set forth herein and, to the extent not inconsistent herewith, in
the Statutory Trust Statute with respect to accomplishing the
purposes of the Issuer. The Owner Trustee has heretofore filed the
Certificate of Trust with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware as required by Section 3810(a) of the Statutory Trust
Statute, such filing hereby being ratified and approved in all
respects. Notwithstanding anything herein or in the Statutory Trust
Statute to the contrary, it is the intention of the parties hereto
that the Issuer constitute a “business trust” within
the meaning of Section 101(9)(A)(v) of the Bankruptcy
Code.
SECTION 2.7. Organizational
Expenses; Liabilities of the Holders .
(a) The
Servicer shall pay organizational expenses of the Issuer as they
may arise.
(b) No
Certificateholder (including the Depositor if the Depositor becomes
a Certificateholder) shall have any personal liability for any
liability or obligation of the Issuer.
SECTION 2.8. Title
to the Trust Estate .
Legal title to all the Trust Estate shall be vested at all times in
the Issuer as a separate legal entity.

SECTION 2.9. Representations
and Warranties of the Depositor .
The Depositor hereby represents and warrants to the Owner Trustee
that:
(a) Existence
and Power .
The Depositor is a limited liability company validly existing and
in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and has,
in all material respects, all power and authority required to carry
on its business as now conducted. The Depositor has obtained all
necessary licenses and approvals in each jurisdiction where the
failure to do so would materially and adversely affect the ability
of the Depositor to perform its obligations under the Transaction
Documents.
(b) Authorization
and No Contravention .
The execution, delivery and performance by the Depositor of each
Transaction Document to which it is a party (i) have been duly
authorized by all necessary action on the part of the Depositor and
(ii) do not contravene or constitute a default under (A) any
applicable law, rule or regulation, (B) its organizational
instruments or (C) any material agreement, contract, order or other
instrument to which it is a party or its property is subject (other
than violations of such laws, rules, regulations, indenture or
agreements which do not affect the legality, validity or
enforceability of any of such agreements and which, individually or
in the aggregate, would not materially and adversely affect the
transactions contemplated by, or the Depositor’s ability to
perform its obligations under, the Transaction Documents to which
it is a party).
(c) No
Consent Required .
No approval, authorization or other action by, or filing with, any
Governmental Authority is required in connection with the
execution, delivery and performance by the Depositor of any
Transaction Document other than (i) UCC filings, (ii) approvals and
authorizations that have previously been obtained and filings which
have previously been made and (iii) approvals, authorizations or
filings which, if not obtained or made, would not have a material
adverse effect on the ability of the Depositor to perform its
obligations under the Transaction Documents to which it is a
party.
(d) Binding
Effect .
Each of the Transaction Documents to which the Depositor is a party
constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of the
Depositor enforceable against the Depositor in accordance with its
terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, receivership,
conservatorship or other similar laws affecting creditors’
rights generally and, if applicable, the rights of creditors of
limited liability companies from time to time in effect or by
general principles of equity or other similar laws of general
application relating to or affecting the enforcement of
creditors’ rights generally and subject to general principles
of equity.
(e) No
Proceedings .
There is no Proceeding pending or, to the knowledge of the
Depositor, threatened against the Depositor which, either in any
one instance or in the aggregate, would result in any material
adverse change in the business, operations, financial condition,
properties or assets of the Depositor, or in any material
impairment of the right or ability of the Depositor to carry on its
business substantially as now conducted, or in any material
liability on the part of the Depositor, or which would render
invalid this Agreement or the Receivables or the obligations of the
Depositor contemplated herein, or which would materially impair the
ability of the Depositor to perform under the terms of this
Agreement or any other Transaction Document.
SECTION 2.10.

Situs of Issuer .
The Issuer shall be located in the State of Delaware (it being
understood that the Issuer may have bank accounts located and
maintained outside of Delaware).
SECTION 2.11.

Covenants of the Certificateholders .
Each Certificateholder, by becoming an owner of a Certificate and
beneficial owner of the Issuer, hereby acknowledges and agrees (a)
that the Certificateholder is subject to the terms, provisions and
conditions of this Agreement, to which the Certificateholder agrees
to be bound; and (b) that it shall not take any position in such
Certificateholder’s tax returns inconsistent with Section
2.6 herein and Section 2.15 of the Indenture.

ARTICLE III 
 
CERTIFICATES AND TRANSFER OF CERTIFICATES
SECTION 3.1. Initial
Ownership .
Upon the formation of the Issuer and until the issuance of the
Certificates, the Depositor shall be the sole beneficiary of the
Issuer and, upon the issuance of the initial Certificate, the
Depositor will no longer be a beneficiary of the Issuer, except to
the extent that the Depositor is a Certificateholder.
SECTION 3.2. Authorization
of the Certificates .
Concurrently with the sale of the Transferred Assets to the Issuer
pursuant to the Sale Agreement, at the direction of the Depositor,
(a) a single Book-Entry Certificate shall be executed by the Owner
Trustee on behalf of the Issuer and authenticated and delivered in
the name of Cede & Co. or (b) a single Definitive Certificate
shall be executed by the Owner Trustee on behalf of the Issuer and
authenticated and delivered by the Certificate Registrar to or upon
the written order of the Depositor. Each Certificate will be issued
in the form of a typewritten certificate substantially in the form
of Exhibit A hereto. The Certificates shall represent, in the
aggregate, 100% of the Percentage Interest in the Issuer and shall,
to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, be fully paid
and nonassessable.
SECTION 3.3. Book-Entry
Certificates .
(a) Each
of the Certificates will be issued in the form of one or more
typewritten certificates, substantially in the form of Exhibit
A hereto, representing the Book-Entry Certificates, to be
delivered to the Indenture Trustee, as initial agent for the
Clearing Agency, by, or on behalf of, the Issuer; provided ,
however , that, upon payment in full of principal and
interest on the Notes, the Indenture Trustee (or such other Person
that is then the Paying Agent) will transfer, upon written request
of the Administrator, on behalf of the Issuer, any such
certificates it is then holding to the Owner Trustee, as agent for
the Clearing Agency. The Book-Entry Certificates shall be issued in
an aggregate nominal principal amount of $100,000 (which shall be
deemed to be the equivalent of 100,000 units, with $1 of principal
amount the equivalent of 1 unit), and all beneficial interests in
the Book-Entry Certificates shall be owned, in the minimum
principal amount of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1 in excess
thereof. The Issuer shall not issue any Certificate that would
cause the aggregate nominal principal amount of all Certificates to
exceed $100,000, or 100,000 units, without the prior written
consent of all Certificateholders. No distributions of moneys to
the Certificateholders under the Transaction Documents shall be
deemed to reduce the nominal principal amount of any Certificate
prior to payment in full of all Notes; provided, however ,
that the final aggregate $100,000 distributed to the
Certificateholders under the Transaction Documents upon final
distribution of the Trust Estate and termination of the Issuer
pursuant to Sections 9.1 and 9.2 shall be deemed to
repay the aggregate nominal principal amount of the Certificates in
full; provided, further , that any failure to pay in full
the nominal principal amount of a Certificate on such final
distribution date shall not result in any recourse to, claim
against or liability of any Person for such shortfall. Any amounts
payable to the Certificateholders on or in respect of the
Certificates under the Transaction Documents shall be paid and
allocated to the various Certificateholders ratably based on their
respective Percentage Interests. Such Certificates shall initially
be registered on the Certificate Register in the name of Cede &
Co., the nominee of DTC as the initial Clearing Agency, and no
Certificateholder will receive a Definitive Certificate
representing such Certificateholder’s interest in such
Certificate, except as provided in Section 3.5 . Unless and
until definitive, fully registered Certificates ( “
Definitive Certificates ”) are issued pursuant to
Section 3.5 :
(i) the
provisions of this Section shall be in full force and
effect;
(ii) the
Certificate Registrar and the Owner Trustee shall be entitled to
deal with the Clearing Agency for all purposes of this Agreement
(including the payment of amounts payable under the Transaction
Documents and the giving of instructions or directions hereunder)
as the sole Certificateholders, and shall have no obligation to the
Certificate Owners;
 















 




5



 






 




 

 
(iii) to
the extent that the provisions of this Section conflict with any
other provisions of this Agreement, the provisions of this Section
shall control;
(iv) the
rights of Certificate Owners shall be exercised only through the
Clearing Agency and shall be limited to those established by law
and/or agreement between or among such Certificate Owners and the
Clearing Agency and/or the Clearing Agency Participants or Persons
acting through Clearing Agency Participants. Pursuant to the
Depository Agreement, unless and until Definitive Certificates are
issued pursuant to Section 3.5 , the initial Clearing Agency
shall make book-entry transfers among the Clearing Agency
Participants and receive and transmit payments due under the
Transaction Documents with regard to the Certificates to such
Clearing Agency Participants;
(v) whenever
this Agreement requires or permits actions to be taken based upon
instructions or directions of Certificateholders representing a
specified percentage of the Certificate Percentage Interest, the
Clearing Agency shall deliver instructions to the Owner Trustee
only to the extent that it has received instructions to such effect
from Certificate Owners and/or Clearing Agency Participants or
Persons acting through Clearing Agency Participants owning or
representing, respectively, such required percentage of the
beneficial interest in the Certificates;
(vi) owners
of a beneficial interest in a Book-Entry Certificate will not be
entitled to have any portion of a Book-Entry Certificate registered
in their names and will not be considered to be the Certificate
Owners or Certificateholders of any Certificates under this Trust
Agreement; and
(vii) payments
on a Book-Entry Certificate will be made to the Clearing Agency or
its nominee as the registered owner thereof and none of the Issuer,
the Owner Trustee or the Certificate Paying Agent will have any
responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating
to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests in
a Book-Entry Certificate or for maintaining, supervising or
reviewing any records relating to the beneficial ownership
interests.
(b) Notwithstanding
any provision to the contrary herein, so long as a Book-Entry
Certificate remains outstanding and is held by or on behalf of the
Clearing Agency, transfers of a Book-Entry Certificate, in whole or
in part, shall only be made in accordance with Section
3.3(a) . Subject to clauses (i) - (iii) of
Section 3.3(a) , transfers of a Book-Entry Certificate shall
be limited to transfers of such Book-Entry Certificate in whole,
but not in part, to a nominee of the Clearing Agency or to a
successor of the Clearing Agency or such successor’s
nominee.
In
the event that a Book-Entry Certificate is exchanged for one or
more Definitive Certificates pursuant to Section 3.5 , such
Certificates may be exchanged for one another only in accordance
with the provisions of this Agreement and with such procedures as
may be from time to time adopted by the Issuer and the Owner
Trustee.
SECTION 3.4. Notices
to Clearing Agency .
Whenever a notice or other communication to the Certificateholders
is required under this Agreement, unless and until Definitive
Certificates are issued to Certificate Owners pursuant to
Section 3.5 , the Owner Trustee shall give all such notices
and communications specified herein to be given to the
Certificateholders to the Clearing Agency and shall have no
obligation to the Certificate Owners.

SECTION 3.5. Definitive
Certificates .
(a) If
(i) the Depositor advises the Owner Trustee in writing that the
Clearing Agency is no longer willing or able to properly discharge
its responsibilities with respect to the Certificates, and the
Depositor is unable to locate a qualified successor or (ii) the
Depositor at its option advises the Owner Trustee in writing that
it elects to terminate the book-entry system through the Clearing
Agency, then the Clearing Agency shall notify all Certificate
Owners and the Owner Trustee of the occurrence of any such event
and of the availability of Definitive Certificates representing the
Certificates to Certificate Owners requesting the same. Upon
surrender to the Owner Trustee of the typewritten Certificate or
Certificates representing the Book-Entry Certificates by the
Clearing Agency, accompanied by re-registration instructions, the
Issuer shall execute and the Owner Trustee shall authenticate
Definitive Certificates representing the Certificates in accordance
with the instructions of the Clearing Agency. None of the Issuer,
the Certificate Registrar or the Owner Trustee shall be liable for
any delay in delivery of such instructions and may conclusively
rely on, and shall be protected in relying on, such instructions.
Upon the issuance of Definitive Certificates representing the
Certificates, the Owner Trustee shall recognize such Holders of the
Definitive Certificates as the applicable
Certificateholders.
(b) Subject
to the transfer restrictions contained herein and in the
Certificates, any Holder of a Certificate may transfer all or any
portion of the Percentage Interest (subject to the requirements set
forth in Sections 3.3 and 3.7) evidenced by such
Certificate upon surrender thereof to the Owner Trustee, and with
such signature guarantees and evidence of authority of the Person
signing the instrument of transfer as the Owner Trustee may
reasonably require, and accompanied by the documents required by
this Article III. Promptly upon the receipt of such documents and
receipt by the Owner Trustee of the transferor’s Certificate,
the Owner Trustee shall record the name of the transferee as a
Certificateholder and its Percentage Interest in the Certificate
Register and issue, execute and deliver to such Certificateholder a
Certificate evidencing such Percentage Interest. In the event a
transferor transfers only a portion of its Percentage Interest, the
Owner Trustee shall register and issue to such transferor a new
Certificate evidencing such transferor’s new Percentage
Interest and shall issue, execute and deliver to the transferee a
new Certificate evidencing such transferee’s Percentage
Interest. Subsequent to each transfer of a beneficial interest and
upon the issuance of the new Certificate or Certificates, the Owner
Trustee shall cancel and destroy in accordance with its customary
practices the Certificate surrendered to it in connection with such
transfer. The Owner Trustee may treat, for all purposes whatsoever
(other than as required under applicable law), the Person in whose
name any Certificate is registered as the sole owner of the
Percentage Interest evidenced by such Certificate without regard to
any notice to the contrary.
Definitive
Certificates will not be eligible for clearing or settlement
through DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream.
SECTION 3.6. Registration
of the Certificates .
The Owner Trustee, as an agent of the Issuer, in its capacity as
“Certificate Registrar” (the “ Certificate
Registrar ”) shall maintain at its office referred to in
Section 2.2 , or at the office of any agent appointed by it
and approved in writing by the Certificateholders at the time of
such appointment, a register (the “ Certificate
Register ”) for the registration and transfer of any
Certificate, and the Owner Trustee or such agent shall promptly
notify the Indenture Trustee of any change in the registered
ownership of a Certificate. Prior to the due presentment to the
Certificate Registrar for registration of transfer of any
Certificate, the Owner Trustee, and the Certificate Registrar or
any agent of the Owner Trustee or the Certificate Registrar and the
Indenture Trustee (or any agent of any such party) may treat the
Person in whose name any Certificate is registered (as of the
applicable Record Date) as the owner of such Certificate for the
purpose of receiving distributions on such Certificate and for all
other purposes whatsoever. For the avoidance of doubt, a
Certificate is not negotiable and the records maintained by the
Certificate Registrar in the Certificate Register with respect to
each Certificate and its related registered owner are intended to
cause the Certificates to be issued in registered form, within the
meaning of Treasury Regulation section 5f.103-1(c), and shall
record (a) the Percentage Interest evidenced by each Certificate
and (b) all distributions made to each Certificateholder with
respect to the Issuer’s assets.

is a Qualified Institutional Buyer, (2) is aware that the sale of
the Certificates (other than a sale of the Certificates by the
Depositor or any of its Affiliates as part of the initial
distribution or any redistribution of the Certificates by the
Depositor or any of its Affiliates) to it is being made in reliance
on the exemption from registration provided by Rule 144A, and (3)

more accounts, each of which is a Qualified Institutional Buyer,
and as to each of which the owner exercises sole investment
discretion or for resale pursuant to Rule 144A;

transferee understands that the Certificates are being offered only
in a transaction not involving any public offering in the United
States within the meaning of the Securities Act, none of the
Certificates have been or will be registered under the Securities

of its investment in the Certificates, and the transferee and any
accounts for which it is acting are each able to bear the economic
risk of such investment;
(v) such
transferee will not make any general solicitation by means of
general advertising or in any other manner, or take any other
action that would constitute a distribution of the Certificates
under the Securities Act or that would render the disposition of
the Certificates a violation of Section 5 of the Securities Act or
any other applicable securities laws or require registration
pursuant thereto, and will not authorize any Person to act on its
behalf, in such manner with respect to the Certificates;
(vi) such
transferee is not acquiring the Certificates with a view to the
resale, distribution or other disposition thereof in violation of
the Securities Act;
(vii) such
transferee will provide notice to each Person to whom it proposes

restrictions and representations set forth in this Agreement,
including the Exhibits hereto;

therein) on behalf of or with any assets of (i) a Benefit Plan, or
(ii) any governmental plan, non-U.S. plan, church plan or any other
employee benefit plan or arrangement that is subject to Similar
Law;

transferee acknowledges that the Issuer, the Owner Trustee, the
Depositor, the Initial Certificate Purchaser and others will rely
upon the truth and accuracy of the acknowledgements,
representations, warranties and agreements in this
Section 3.7 and agrees that if any of the

longer accurate, the transferee will promptly notify the Issuer,
the Owner Trustee and the Depositor; and
(x) such

Certificates (a) none of the Issuer, the Servicer, the Depositor,
the Initial Certificate Purchaser or the Owner Trustee is acting as
a fiduciary or financial or investment adviser for the transferee,
(b) the transferee is not relying (for purposes of making any
investment decision or otherwise) upon any advice, counsel or
representations (whether written or oral) of the Initial
Certificate Purchaser, the Issuer, the Servicer, the Depositor or
the Owner Trustee other than in the most current private placement
memorandum for such Certificates and any representations expressly
set forth in a written agreement with such party, (c) none of the
Initial Certificate Purchaser, the Issuer, the Servicer, the
Depositor or the Owner Trustee has given to the transferee
(directly or indirectly through any other Person, in any
documentation for the Certificates or otherwise) any assurance,
guarantee or representation whatsoever as to the expected or
projected success, profitability, return, performance, result,
effect, consequence or benefit (including legal, regulatory, tax,
financial, accounting or otherwise) of its purchase of the
Certificates, (d) the transferee has consulted with its own legal,
regulatory, tax, business, investment, financial, and accounting
advisers to the extent it has deemed necessary and it has made its
own investment decisions (including decisions regarding the
suitability of any transaction pursuant to or contemplated by this
Agreement) based upon its own judgment and upon any advice from
such advisers as it has deemed necessary and not upon any view
expressed by the Initial Certificate Purchaser, the Issuer, the
Servicer, the Depositor or the Owner Trustee, (e) the transferee
has determined that the rates, prices or amounts and other terms of
the purchase and sale of the applicable Certificates reflect those
in the relevant market for similar transactions, (f) the transferee
is purchasing the Certificates with a full understanding of all of
the terms, conditions and risks thereof (economic and otherwise),
and is capable of assuming and willing to assume (financially and
otherwise) these risks and (g) the transferee is a sophisticated
investor familiar with transactions similar to its investment in
the Certificates.
By
accepting and holding a Certificate (or any interest therein), the
Holder shall be deemed to have represented and warranted that it is
not, and is not purchasing the Certificate (or any interest
therein) on behalf of or with any assets of, a Benefit Plan or any
governmental, non-U.S., church or any other employee benefit plan
or retirement arrangement that is subject to Similar Law. Subject
to the transfer restrictions contained herein and in the
Certificates, any Certificateholder may transfer all or any portion
of the Percentage Interest evidenced by such Certificate upon
surrender thereof to the Owner Trustee accompanied by the documents
required by this Section. Such transfer may be made by the
registered Certificateholder in person or by his attorney duly
authorized in writing upon surrender of the Certificate to the
Owner Trustee accompanied by (a) a written instrument of transfer
in the form of the “Assignment” attached to the Form of
Certificate (attached hereto as Exhibit A ) and with such
signature guarantees and evidence of authority of the Persons
signing the instrument of transfer as the Owner Trustee may
reasonably require; provided, however, that the Owner Trustee shall
not require the signature of the Depositor to be medallion
guaranteed for the transfers from the Depositor to the applicable
transferees on the date hereof, (b) an executed direction letter
regarding registration of such transfer in the form attached hereto
as Exhibit D , (c) the documents required by
Section 3.7(c) and (d) a Certificate Investor
Representation Letter substantially in the form attached hereto as
Exhibit B . Promptly upon the receipt of such documents
and receipt by the Owner Trustee of the transferor’s
Certificate, the Owner Trustee shall record the name of such
transferee as a Certificateholder and its Percentage Interest in
the Certificate Register and issue, execute and deliver to such
Certificateholder a Certificate evidencing such Percentage
Interest. In the event a transferor transfers only a portion of its
Percentage Interest, the Owner Trustee shall issue, execute and
deliver to such transferor a new Certificate evidencing such
transferor’s new Percentage Interest. Subsequent to a
transfer of a Percentage Interest and upon the related issuance of
the new Certificate or Certificates, the Owner Trustee shall cancel
and destroy the Certificate surrendered to it in connection with
such transfer. Unless otherwise provided in this Section 3.7
or under applicable

law,
the Owner Trustee may treat the Person in whose name any
Certificate is registered as the sole owner of the beneficial
interest in the Issuer evidenced by such Certificate.
(b) As
a condition precedent to any registration of transfer under this
Section 3.7 , the Owner Trustee may require the payment of a
sum sufficient to cover the payment of any tax or taxes or other
governmental charges required to be paid in connection with such
transfer.
(c) Each
registered owner of and, if different, each owner of a beneficial
interest in, a Certificate that is a “United States

deliver to the Owner Trustee, the Administrator and the Certificate
Paying Agent two properly completed and duly executed originals of
U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 (or applicable successor
form) certifying that it is not subject to backup withholding and
that it is a U.S. person. Each registered owner of and, if
different, each owner of a beneficial interest in, a Certificate
that is not a “United States person” shall deliver to
the Owner Trustee, the Administrator and the Certificate Paying
Agent two properly completed and duly executed originals of U.S.
Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN (Certification of Foreign
Status as Beneficial Owner), IRS Form W-8BEN-E (Certificate of
Status of Beneficial Owner for United States Withholding and
Reporting (entities)), IRS Form W-8IMY (Certification of Foreign
Intermediary Status) or IRS Form W-8ECI (Certification of Foreign
Person’s Claim for Exemption from Withholding on Income
Effectively Connected with Conduct of a U.S. Trade or Business), or
any applicable successors to such IRS forms or other reasonable
information or certification requested by the Owner Trustee, the
Administrator or the Certificate Paying Agent (i) to permit the
Owner Trustee, the Administrator and the Certificate Paying Agent
to make payments to the registered owner of, and if different, each
owner of a beneficial interest in, a Certificate without
withholding or deduction (including any FATCA Withholding Tax),
(ii) to enable the Issuer to qualify for a reduced rate of
withholding in any jurisdiction from or through which the Issuer
receives payments on its assets, or (iii) to enable the Owner
Trustee, the Administrator and the Certificate Paying Agent to
satisfy any reporting or other obligations under any applicable tax
law (including FATCA), and will update or replace such form,
certification or other information as necessary in accordance with
its terms or its subsequent amendments. The applicable Internal
Revenue Service forms and information required to be delivered, as
described above, shall be delivered on or prior to the date on
which a Certificateholder and, if different, a Certificate Owner
becomes a Certificateholder or Certificate Owner under this
Agreement and from time to time thereafter as prescribed by
applicable law or upon the request of the Certificate Paying
Agent.
(d) Each
registered owner of, and, if different, each owner of a beneficial
interest in, a Certificate represents to the Issuer and Owner
Trustee by acceptance of this Certificate or interest therein that
it is not and will not become subject to any FATCA Withholding
Tax.
(e) Each
purchaser, beneficial owner and subsequent transferee of
Certificates or an interest therein will be required or deemed to
acknowledge that the Issuer may provide such information and any
other information concerning its investment in the Certificates to
the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. In addition, each purchaser,
beneficial owner and subsequent transferee of Certificates or an
interest therein will be required or deemed to understand and
acknowledge that the Issuer has the right, hereunder, to withhold
on any beneficial owner of an interest in a Certificate that fails
to comply with the foregoing requirements.
(f) No
transfers shall be permitted if such transfer is effected through
an established securities market or secondary market (or the
substantial equivalent thereof) within the meaning of the Code
Section 7704 and any proposed, temporary or final Treasury
regulations thereunder.
(g) Each
Certificate shall bear a legend in substantially the following
form, unless the Depositor determines otherwise in accordance with
applicable law:

CERTIFICATE OR ANY INTEREST HEREIN HAS NOT BEEN AND WILL NOT BE

APPLICABLE SECURITIES LAWS OF ANY STATE OF THE UNITED STATES AND
ANY OTHER APPLICABLE JURISDICTION. EACH PURCHASER WILL BE DEEMED TO
HAVE MADE CERTAIN REPRESENTATIONS AND AGREEMENTS SET FORTH IN THE
TRUST AGREEMENT. ANY TRANSFER IN VIOLATION OF THE FOREGOING WILL BE
OF NO FORCE AND EFFECT, WILL BE VOID AB INITIO , AND WILL
NOT OPERATE TO TRANSFER ANY RIGHTS TO THE TRANSFEREE,
NOTWITHSTANDING ANY INSTRUCTIONS TO THE CONTRARY TO THE ISSUER, THE
OWNER TRUSTEE, OR ANY INTERMEDIARY. IF AT ANY TIME, THE ISSUER
DETERMINES OR IS NOTIFIED THAT THE HOLDER OF SUCH CERTIFICATE OR
PERCENTAGE INTEREST IN SUCH CERTIFICATE WAS IN BREACH, AT THE TIME
GIVEN, OF ANY OF THE REPRESENTATIONS SET FORTH IN THE TRUST
AGREEMENT, THE ISSUER AND THE OWNER TRUSTEE MAY CONSIDER THE
ACQUISITION OF THIS CERTIFICATE OR SUCH INTEREST IN SUCH
CERTIFICATE VOID AND REQUIRE THAT THIS CERTIFICATE OR SUCH INTEREST
HEREIN BE TRANSFERRED TO A PERSON DESIGNATED BY THE
ISSUER.
BY
ACQUIRING THIS CERTIFICATE, EACH PURCHASER AND TRANSFEREE WILL BE
DEEMED TO REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT IT IS NOT ACQUIRING THIS
CERTIFICATE (OR ANY INTEREST HEREIN) ON BEHALF OF OR WITH ANY
ASSETS OF (I) AN “EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLAN” AS DEFINED IN
SECTION 3(3) OF THE EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT OF
1974, AS AMENDED (“ERISA”), WHICH IS SUBJECT TO TITLE I

CHURCH, NON-U.S. OR OTHER PLAN THAT IS SUBJECT TO ANY FEDERAL,
STATE, LOCAL OR NON-U.S. LAW THAT IS SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR TO TITLE
I OF ERISA OR SECTION 4975 OF THE CODE.
(h) If
a Responsible Officer of the Owner Trustee has actual knowledge
that (1) a transfer or attempted or purported transfer of any
Certificate or interest therein was consummated in compliance with
the provisions of this Section 3.7 on the basis of a
materially incorrect certification from the transferor or purported
transferee, (2) a transferee of a Definitive Certificate failed to
deliver to the Owner Trustee a Certificate Investor Representation
Letter substantially in the form of Exhibit B hereto or (3)
the Certificateholder of any Certificate or interest therein is in
material breach of any representation or agreement set forth in any
Certificate or any deemed representation or agreement of such
Certificateholder, the Owner Trustee will direct the Certificate
Registrar not to register such attempted or purported transfer and,
if a transfer has been registered, such transfer shall be
absolutely null and void ab initio and shall not operate to
transfer any rights to the purported transferee (such purported
transferee, a “ Disqualified Transferee ”) and
the last preceding Certificateholder of such Certificateholder that
was not a Disqualified Transferee shall be restored to all rights
as a Certificateholder thereof retroactively to the date of the
purported transfer of such Certificate by such
Certificateholder.
(i) After
the Closing Date, a Certificate (or beneficial interest therein)
may not be sold or transferred to a Person that beneficially owns a
Note (or interest therein) if such sale or transfer will result in
such Person beneficially owning more than 99% of the Certificates
of the Issuer (and any other interest in the Issuer treated as
equity for United States federal income tax purposes).

SECTION 3.8. Lost,
Stolen, Mutilated or Destroyed Certificates .
If (i) any mutilated Certificate is surrendered to the Owner
Trustee, or (ii) the Owner Trustee receives evidence to its
satisfaction that any Certificate has been destroyed, lost or
stolen, and upon proof of ownership satisfactory to the Owner
Trustee together with such security or indemnity as may be
requested by the Owner Trustee to save it and the Issuer harmless,
the Owner Trustee shall execute and deliver a new Certificate for
the same Percentage Interest as the Certificate so mutilated,
destroyed, lost or stolen, of like tenor and bearing a different
issue number, with such notations, if any, as the Owner Trustee
shall determine. Upon the issuance of any new Certificate under
this Section 3.8 , the Issuer or Owner Trustee may require
the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other
governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any
transfer or exchange of the Certificate and any other reasonable
expenses (including the reasonable fees and expenses of the Issuer
and the Owner Trustee) connected therewith. Any duplicate
Certificate issued pursuant to this Section 3.8 shall
constitute complete and indefeasible evidence of ownership in the
Issuer, as if originally issued, whether or not the lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate shall be found at any time. The provisions of
this Section 3.8 are exclusive and shall preclude (to the
extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the
replacement or payment of mutilated, defaced, destroyed, lost or
stolen Certificates.
SECTION 3.9. Appointment
of the Certificate Paying Agent .
To the extent Definitive Certificates have been issued, the
Certificate Paying Agent shall make distributions to
Certificateholders from the Certificate Distribution Account
pursuant to Section 5.1 and shall report the amounts of such
distributions to the Owner Trustee and the Servicer;
provided , however , that no such reports shall be
required so long as the Depositor or an affiliate of the Depositor
is the sole Certificateholder. Any Certificate Paying Agent shall
have the revocable power to withdraw funds from the Certificate
Distribution Account for the purpose of making the distributions
referred to above. The Owner Trustee may revoke such power and
remove the Certificate Paying Agent if the Owner Trustee determines
in its sole discretion that the Certificate Paying Agent shall have
failed to perform its obligations under this Agreement in any
material respect. The Certificate Paying Agent shall initially be
Citibank and any co-paying agent chosen by the Certificate Paying
Agent. Citibank shall be permitted to resign as Certificate Paying
Agent upon thirty (30) days’ written notice to the Owner
Trustee. If Citibank shall no longer be the Certificate Paying
Agent, the Owner Trustee or Administrator shall appoint a successor
to act as Certificate Paying Agent (which shall be a bank or trust
company). The Owner Trustee or Administrator shall cause such
successor Certificate Paying Agent or any additional Certificate
Paying Agent appointed by the Owner Trustee or Administrator to
execute and deliver to the Owner Trustee a written agreement in
which such successor Certificate Paying Agent or additional
Certificate Paying Agent shall agree with the Owner Trustee that,
as Certificate Paying Agent, such successor Certificate Paying
Agent or additional Certificate Paying Agent shall hold all sums,
if any, held by it for payment to the Certificateholders in trust
for the benefit of the Certificateholders entitled thereto until
such sums shall be paid to such Certificateholders. Subject to
applicable laws with respect to the escheat of funds, the
Certificate Paying Agent shall return all funds that have remained
unclaimed by a Certificateholder for two years to the Owner Trustee
and, upon removal of a Certificate Paying Agent, such Certificate
Paying Agent shall also return all funds (including any unclaimed
funds) in its possession to the Owner Trustee. The rights,
protections, indemnities and immunities of the Owner Trustee under
this Agreement shall apply to the Owner Trustee also in its role as
Certificate Paying Agent or Certificate Registrar for so long as
the Owner Trustee shall act as Certificate Paying Agent or
Certificate Registrar and, to the extent applicable, to any other
paying agent, certificate registrar or authenticating agent
appointed hereunder. Any reference in this Agreement to the
Certificate Paying Agent shall include any co-paying agent unless
the context requires otherwise.
SECTION 3.10.

Maintenance of Office or Agency .
As long as any of the Certificates remain outstanding, the Issuer
shall maintain an office or agency where Certificates may be
surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange, and where
notices and demands to or upon the Issuer in respect of the
Certificates and this Agreement may be served. The Issuer hereby
initially designates the Corporate Trust Office of the Certificate
Registrar for the foregoing purposes. The Issuer shall give prompt
written notice to the Owner Trustee of the location, and of any
change in the location, of any such office or agency. If at any
time the Issuer shall fail to maintain any such office or agency or
shall fail to furnish the Owner Trustee with the address thereof,
such surrenders, notices and demands may be made or served at the
applicable Corporate Trust Office, and the Issuer hereby appoints
the Owner Trustee as its agent to receive all such surrenders,
notices and demands.

.
SECTION 5.4. Certificate
Distribution Account .
The Certificate Distribution Account shall be established pursuant
to Section 8.2 of the Indenture. The Certificateholders
shall possess all beneficial right, title and interest in and to
all funds on deposit from time to time in the Certificate
Distribution Account and all proceeds thereof. Except as otherwise
provided herein or in the Indenture, the Certificate Distribution
Account shall be under the sole dominion and control of the
Certificate Paying Agent for the benefit of the Certificateholders.

SECTION 5.5. Withholding

In the event that any withholding tax is imposed on the

distributable to the Certificateholder. The Owner Trustee and
Certificate Paying Agent are hereby authorized and directed, and
the Indenture Trustee is authorized pursuant to Section
3.3(c) of the Indenture, to retain from amounts otherwise
distributable to the Certificateholders sufficient funds for the
payment of any tax that is legally payable by the Issuer (but such
authorization shall not prevent the Owner Trustee or Certificate
Paying Agent from contesting any such tax in an appropriate
Proceeding and withholding payment of such tax, if permitted by
law, pending the outcome of such Proceeding). The amount of any
withholding tax imposed with respect to a Certificateholder shall
be treated as cash distributed to such Certificateholder at the
time it is withheld by the Issuer and remitted to the appropriate
taxing authority. If there is a possibility that withholding tax is
payable with respect to any distribution (such as any distribution
to a non-U.S. Person), the Owner Trustee or Certificate Paying
Agent may in its sole discretion withhold such amounts in
accordance with this Section 5.5 and the Indenture Trustee
may withhold such amounts in accordance with Section 3.3(c)
of the Indenture.

provided, however, that such amounts may be invested in Permitted
Investments selected in writing by the Servicer but only until the
next Payment Date (and only

such investments mature on or prior to such Payment Date without a
disposition thereof prior to maturity), when they shall be
distributed.

in accordance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act on
behalf of the Issuer or any other Person, any periodic reports
filed pursuant to the Exchange Act, or any other documents pursuant
