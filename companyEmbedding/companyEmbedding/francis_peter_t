Other Board Experience: Former Chairman and Director J.M. Huber Corporation. 
Skills and Qualifications: The responsibilities of Mr. Francis as an investment manager require him to make regular business and investment decisions across a wide range of industries, an important perspective that he brings to the Board.

His experience as Chairman, President and CEO for over 16 years of an international manufacturing conglomerate with locations in over 25 countries enables him to provide valuable input to the Board and our CEO on matters relating to: portfolio structuring; industrial manufacturing; management oversight, executive compensation, performance evaluation and succession planning; and Board governance and composition. As Chairman of the Board of J.M. Huber Corporation, Mr. Francis led the design of board processes, the implementation of individual board member evaluations, and the development of the audit, nominating, management and compensation, environmental and finance committee charters. As President and CEO, Mr. Francis entirely redesigned J.M. Huber's strategy and restructured its portfolio with over 25 divestitures and 100 acquisitions. Mr. Francis has also lived or worked outside the United States for more than eight years and brings an international perspective to the Board. Mr. Francis has an MBA from Stanford University.
