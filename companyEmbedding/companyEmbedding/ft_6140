Overview


                                  Kenmore 6.5 cu. ft. Electric Dryer - Better Fabric Care    This  Kenmore 6.5 cu. ft. electric dryer 6140  was designed to protect the life of your clothing while making laundry a more quick, convenient task for you. Features like Auto Dry, which automatically shut off the moment clothes are dry, offer better fabric care by protecting clothing from overdrying and reducing the likelihood of shrinkage. The air-only option and three dryness settings let you fluff clothing and prevent delicates from overheating. Get better fabric care at home with this Kenmore electric dryer.  
 Medium range capacity gives this dryer the power of some bigger machines, allowing it to deliver features that fluff, finish and dry your fabrics to perfection. Auto dry cycles use an integrated thermostat to control temperatures and sense when fabrics are dry to help eliminate heat damage and take the guesswork out of drying. Air-only dry cycles reduce heat damage to delicate fabrics while evaporating moisture and gently tumbling them dry. An integrated side-swing reversible dryer door helps you customize your laundry room by positioning the door to open closest to the washer for faster loading and more convenience.

The 6140-6 4-1/2 inch 5.5 amp grinder is ideal for getting into tight
spaces where other grinders can not. Its low profile and light weight
make it perfect for those lighter duty sanding and grinding projects.
The tool is double insulated (two prong cord) and incorporates the
industry standard 5/8-11 threaded arbor. Like its heavy duty big
brothers, it also has spiral bevel gears for optimum transmission of
torque to the work piece. The comfortable body grip style is easy to
hold onto, and in conjunction with the supplied side handle, allows for
maximum operator control. The side handle can be attached in three
locations. The wheel guard can be moved around the spindle (without the
use of tools) for greatest operator protection. Sold as a grinder with
guard, this tool can be used as a sander when a 4-1/2 inch backing pad
and disc are attached.
