Note) The roller diameter (Da) for model numbers
containing symbol V at the end represents the
value 1/√2 times that of types for the same model
number with no symbol.
The diameter of the roller to be combined with
90°V surface will be 1/√2 times that of the roller on
the flat surface.
For example, when using model FT4035 (roller
diameter: Ø4) on the flat surface, use model
FTW4030V (roller diameter: Ø2.828) on the V
surface. Performance of the Flat Roller is
significantly affected by the contact state of the
upper and lower raceways. You can check the fit
before installing the Flat Roller by designing the
raceways as indicated in the figure above.

                    Toledo is a city in and the county seat of Lucas County, Ohio, United States. Toledo is in northwest Ohio, at the western end of Lake Erie bordering the state of Michigan. The city was founded by United States citizens in 1833 on the west bank of the Maumee River, and originally incorporated as part of Monroe County, Michigan Territory. It was re-founded in 1837, after conclusion of the Toledo War, when it was incorporated in Ohio. Toledo continued to expand in population and industry into the early 20th century. Because of its dependence on manufacturing, the city was hit hard by the Great Depression. Many large-scale WPA projects were constructed to reemploy citizens in the 1930s. Some of these include the amphitheater and aquarium at the Toledo Zoo and a major expansion to the Toledo Museum of Art.

Effects of climate change on nutrition and genetics of White-tailed Ptarmigan [chapter 21]Product Type: Book, Pages inYear: 2011Author(s): Oyler-McCance, S.J., C.A. Stricker, J. St. John, C.E. Braun, G.T. Wann, M.S. O'Donnell, and C.L. AldridgeSuggested Citation: Oyler-McCance, S.J., C.A. Stricker, J. St. John, C.E. Braun, G.T. Wann, M.S. O'Donnell, and C.L. Aldridge. 2011. Effects of climate change on nutrition and genetics of White-tailed Ptarmigan [chapter 21]. In: Ecology, conservation, and management of grouse: Studies in Avian Biology. Berkeley, CA: University of California Press. 283-294. White-tailed Ptarmigan (Lagopus leucura) are well suited as a focal species for the study of climate change because they are adapted to cool, alpine environments that are expected to undergo unusually rapid climate change. We compared samples collected in the late 1930s, the late 1960s, and the late 2000s using molecular genetic and stable isotope methods in an effort to determine whether White-tailed Ptarmigan on Mt. Evans, Colorado, have experienced recent environmental changes resulting in shifts in genetic diversity, gene frequency, and nutritional ecology. We genotyped 115 individuals spanning the three time periods, using nine polymorphic microsatellite loci in our genetic analysis. These samples were also analyzed for stable carbon and nitrogen isotopic composition. We found a slight trend of lower heterozygosity through time, and allelic richness values were lower in more recent times, but not significantly using an alpha of 0.05 (P 0.1). We found no changes in allele frequencies across time periods, suggesting that population sizes have not changed dramatically. Feather δ13C and δ15N values decreased significantly across time periods, whereas the range in isotope values increased consistently from the late 1930s to the later time periods. Inferred changes in the nutritional ecology of White-tailed Ptarmigan on Mt. Evans relate primarily to increased atmospheric deposition of nutrients that likely influenced foraging habits and tundra plant composition and nutritional quality. Future work seeks to integrate genetic and isotopic data with longterm demographics to develop a detailed understanding of the interaction among environmental stressors on the long-term viability of ptarmigan populations.
