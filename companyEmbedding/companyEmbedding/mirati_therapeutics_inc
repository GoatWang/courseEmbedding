A TARGETED ONCOLOGY COMPANY DEVELOPING
BREAKTHROUGH MEDICINES FOR PRECISELY DEFINED PATIENT POPULATIONS
Mirati Therapeutics is transforming the treatment of patients with cancer by targeting the genetic changes in tumor cells that result in uncontrolled tumor growth and spread. Our precision oncology strategy seeks to treat the patients most likely to benefit and is driven by 1) drugs that target very specific genetic mutations that cause cancer, and 2) genomic tests that identify patients who carry those driver mutations. The promise of this approach includes better patient outcomes, more efficient cancer treatment and faster drug development.

Sitravatinib (MGCD516)










  








  








TARGETS:
Receptor tyrosine kinases including RET, CHR4q12, CBL, Trk, and DDR families.


INDICATIONS:
Solid tumors with an initial focus on Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)


STATUS:
Phase 1B basket trial in patients with solid tumors, once daily oral dose



Sitravatinib (MGCD516) is being evaluated in a Phase 1b dose expansion cohort in selected patients with specific genetic alterations that are drivers of tumor growth, with an initial focus on NSCLC and in other solid tumors where sitravatinib may confer a benefit. Sitravatinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor with demonstrated potent inhibition of a closely related spectrum of tyrosine kinases, including RET, CBL, CHR4q12, DDR and Trk, which are key regulators of signaling pathways that lead to cell growth, survival and tumor progression.  Based on our experience to date, the PK is well-behaved and a convenient, once daily dosing regime is being explored.
Mirati owns the worldwide rights to Sitravatinib (MGCD516).

CLINICAL DEVELOPMENTSCIENTIFIC RATIONALE


Clinical Development
Sitravatinib (MGCD516) is in Phase 1b development for the potential treatment of advanced solid tumors. Mirati plans to identify the maximum tolerated dose of sitravatinib (MGCD516) and initiate expansion cohorts in selected patients with NSCLC who have genetic alterations in sitravatinib (MGCD516) RTK targets or their key regulatory pathways in the first quarter of 2015.
In vitro, the compound has demonstrated potent inhibition of cell survival in cell lines that are driven by RET, CHR4q12, CBL, Trk, or DDR mutations. In animal studies, sitravatinib (MGCD516) shows good oral bioavailability in mice, rats and dogs, and demonstrated tumor regression in multiple human xenograft tumor models in mice.
Sitravatinib (MGCD516) Clinical Trials





Scientific Rationale
The receptor tyrosine kinases in the RET, CHR4q12, CBL, Trk, and DDR families are key regulators of signaling pathways leading to cell growth, survival and migration. RET, CHR4q12, CBL, Trk, and DDR are dysregulated in many cancers through overexpression or genetic alteration and act as oncogenic drivers promoting cancer development and progression. Preclinically, sitravatinib (MGCD516) has demonstrated tumor growth inhibition and regression in several animal models, including models with genetic alterations of sitravatinib (MGCD516)’s targets.
Collectively, the genetic alterations of the sitravatinib (MGCD516) tyrosine kinase targets provide clinical development opportunities in multiple indications. Activating mutations and gene rearrangements of RET have been identified as oncogenic drivers in a subset of lung adenocarcinoma and were found to be mutually exclusive with other known driver alterations. Trk family kinases are also genetically altered in multiple cancers including gene rearrangements in lung adenocarcinoma and other solid tumors. In addition, activating oncogenic mutations involving DDR have been identified in lung cancer.
The clinical development of sitravatinib (MGCD516) will select for patients whose tumors have genetic alterations of sitravatinib  targets or genetic alterations activating multiple sitravatinib targets. Prospectively selecting for patients that harbor these genetic drivers of disease will potentially enable sitravatinib to demonstrate a high response rate and rapidly establish clinical efficacy. Mirati believes that this approach is the most efficient way to achieve regulatory approval, ultimately bringing the drug to patients as quickly as possible.

Mocetinostat (MGCD103)


 


Image: The Rationale and Therapeutic Promise of Combining HDAC Inhibitors with Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors




Targets:
Class I & IV HDAC Inhibitor


Indications:
NSCLC and other solid tumors 


Status:
Phase 1/2



Mocetinostat (MGCD103) is an orally-bioavailable, spectrum-selective Class I & IV HDAC inhibitor currently being studied in a Phase 2 trial as a combination therapy with durvalumab, targeting the programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) pathway, which has been implicated in advanced lung cancers. In preclinical models, mocetinostat with durvalumab demonstrated significant reduction in tumor volume compared to either agent alone. Mirati retains worldwide rights to Mocetinostat (MGCD103) with the exception of certain Asian territories where the program is partnered with Taiho.AACR 2016:  Abstract 4021: "The class I HDAC inhibitor, mocetinostat, induces expression of PD-L1 and tumor antigen presentation machinery and modifies tumor immune cellular subsets providing a rationale for immune checkpoint inhibitor combinations"  click to view
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
The overall five year survival rate for patients with NSCLC is only 16.8% and NSCLC results in the greatest number of cancer deaths in the United States. Over recent years, new therapies have been approved that target gene pathways implicated in progression of NSCLC, including EGFR kinase inhibitors, EML4-ALK inhibitors, and immune checkpoint inhibitors. However, these targets represent only a fraction of the growing list of cancer genes that play a role in NSCLC. There remains a significant unmet medical need to develop new therapies that inhibit multiple targets, particularly those that also inhibit novel targets for which no therapy exists. Backed by a strong scientific rationale, we believe that Mocetinostat (MGCD103), combined with durvalumab (an investigational anti-PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibitor), may result in synergistic and immune enhancing anti-tumor effect.



Clinical Development
Mocetinostat (MGCD103) has completed 13 clinical trials which have enrolled more than 400 patients with hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. 
Mocetinostat (MGCD103) in combination with immunotherapy 
A Phase 1-2 study of Mocetinostat (MGCD103), in combination with durvalumab (an investigational anti-PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibitor), is anticipated to start in 2016. The study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of the combination in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
 

 
Mocetinostat (MGCD103) Clinical Trials


Scientific Rationale

In combination with immunotherapy
Preclinical data suggests that spectrum-selective HDAC inhibitors, such as Mocetinostat (MGCD103), may enhance the anti-tumor activity of checkpoint inhibiting antibodies (anti-programmed cell death (PD-1) and anti-programmed cell death ligand (PD-L1) inhibitors) by increasing tumor cell immunogenicity and decreasing cell types that limit the T-cell mediated tumor immune response.  In addition, evidence suggests that Mocetinostat (MGCD103) enhances tumor cell immunogenicity by selectively inhibiting Class I HDACs, which results in increased human leukocyte antigen (HLA) expression, can increase PD-L1 expression, and decrease immunosuppressive tumor myeloid derived suppressor cells and T regulatory cells. Lastly, in contrast to other HDAC inhibitors, Mocetinostat (MGCD103) does not inhibit Class II HDACs which may limit the efficacy of immunotherapy and are associated with significant side effects. These data indicate that Mocetinostat (MGCD103) could potentially be used to enhance the efficacy of immune check-point inhibitors, such as PD-1 or PD-L1 antagonists.

A TARGETED ONCOLOGY COMPANY DEVELOPING
BREAKTHROUGH MEDICINES FOR PRECISELY DEFINED PATIENT POPULATIONS
Mirati Therapeutics is transforming the treatment of patients with cancer by targeting the genetic changes in tumor cells that result in uncontrolled tumor growth and spread. Our precision oncology strategy seeks to treat the patients most likely to benefit and is driven by 1) drugs that target very specific genetic mutations that cause cancer, and 2) genomic tests that identify patients who carry those driver mutations. The promise of this approach includes better patient outcomes, more efficient cancer treatment and faster drug development.

					Full Description



Mirati Therapeutics, Inc., incorporated on April 29, 2013, is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company. The Company is focused on developing a pipeline of targeted oncology products. The Company's clinical pipeline consists of three product candidates: MGCD265, MGCD516 and mocetinostat. Mocetinostat has completed approximately 10 clinical trials in over 400 patients with a range of hematologic malignancies and solid tumors.MGCD265MGCD265 is an orally-bioavailable, small molecule kinase inhibitor of MET and Axl receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). MGCD265 is in development for the treatment of solid tumors, such as non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and other solid tumors, including gastroesophageal cancers and squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (HNSCC). MGCD265 is in Phase Ib clinical development.MGCD516MGCD516 is an orally-bioavailable, small molecule spectrum-selective kinase inhibitor in development for the treatment of solid tumors with a focus on genetic alterations involving the RET, DDR and Trk RTK families, as well as CHR4q12 amplicons and CBL inactivating mutations. MGCD516 is in the dose escalation phase of Phase I clinical development. It plans to focus on solid tumors exhibiting genetic alterations, which result in dysregulation of these key drivers of tumor growth, initially in NSCLC.MocetinostatMocetinostat is an orally-bioavailable, spectrum-selective histone deacetylase (HDAC), inhibitor, which is in Phase II development. Mocetinostat is being developed for the second line treatment of patients with bladder cancer and non-hodgkins lymphoma (NHL), specifically focusing on diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and follicular lymphoma (FL).The Company competes with AbbVie, Inc., AstraZeneca PLC, Exelixis Inc., GlaxoSmithKline PLC, Ignyta, Inc., Incyte Corporation, Merck KGaA, NantPharma LLC, Novartis AG, Pfizer Inc., Sanofi S.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

A TARGETED ONCOLOGY COMPANY DEVELOPING
BREAKTHROUGH MEDICINES FOR PRECISELY DEFINED PATIENT POPULATIONS
Mirati Therapeutics is transforming the treatment of patients with cancer by targeting the genetic changes in tumor cells that result in uncontrolled tumor growth and spread. Our precision oncology strategy seeks to treat the patients most likely to benefit and is driven by 1) drugs that target very specific genetic mutations that cause cancer, and 2) genomic tests that identify patients who carry those driver mutations. The promise of this approach includes better patient outcomes, more efficient cancer treatment and faster drug development.
