Interference Mitigation - xG Technology               xG Technology Company Websites  IMT Solutions Vislink  xG Technology Interference Mitigation xMax overcomes challenging wireless environments and conditions using advanced, field-proven interference mitigation technologyInterference is the chief limiting factor in high-capacity mobile communications. It can negatively impact reliability, performance and coverage in wireless systems. Interference is responsible in many cases for dropped calls, slow download speeds and shortened battery life.While interference has long been an issue in unlicensed spectrum bands, mobile carriers are seeing that the licensed (i.e. dedicated) spectrum used in their 3G and 4G mobile networks is also experiencing unprecedented levels of interference. In large part, this is due to unrelenting growth in high-bandwidth, media-rich mobile data use. In addition to commercial networks, interference is also of concern to our public safety, armed forces and homeland security agencies. Their growing reliance on broadband communications makes unintentional and intentional interference (jamming) a real threat to their missions.xMax leverages proprietary xG-developed technology to implement a “layered” approach to dealing with interference—an industry first.Beginning with an advanced version of Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA), xMax uses real-time sensing of interference to instantly change channels if better frequencies are detected. However, xMax goes beyond simple DSA by incorporating sophisticated interference mitigation software that enables it to continue operating reliably on interference-laden channels. Essentially, xMax employs advanced intelligence to determine, at a granular level, how much interference it can effectively withstand before reconfiguring its parameters.  When xG’s interference mitigation technology is added to its DSA capabilities, xMax can greatly increase the capacity of both new and existing spectrum assets.xMax radios employ powerful parallel processing digital signal processors and computer processing units (DSP/CPU) that support speeds up to 50 Giga OPS (billion operations per second) for signal processing. These processors, combined with 2×4 MIMO antenna configurations and patented spatial processing algorithms, enable the xMax system to remove unwanted interference from the target xMax signals. Each xMax cognitive radio can simultaneously mitigate up to 24 mobile sources of interference or jamming. By using xMax’s multi-antenna technology to separate unwanted interference from desired xMax signals, xG is able to offer robust and reliable links in conditions that would cause other radio systems to fail.xMax MIMO Based Interference Mitigation Separates Interference from Desired SignalsBecause xMax can tolerate high levels of interference before requiring the radios to switch channels, more “gray spectrum” (containing interference or jamming) can be used in place of scarce “white spectrum” (clean and interference-free). In turn, this makes white spectrum channels available for other radios that cannot effectively mitigate interference on their own. This capability increases an xMax network’s total throughput and capacity greatly—without consuming additional scarce and costly spectrum resources.The following press releases underscore xMax’s interference mitigation attributes:xG Technology Demonstrates Resistance to Jamming at U.S. Special Operations Command EventxG Technology Awarded New Patent for Enhanced Mitigating Interference in Wireless SystemsxG Technology Announces New Interference Mitigation PatentxG Technology Announces Increased Performance in its Market-Leading Interference Mitigation Technology CapabilitiesRelated PagesxG FederalVideo TechnologiesFlexible DeploymentCognitive Radio NetworksInterference MitigationAny Device - Any SoftwareNetwork Architecture  Related Resources  xMax Superior Interference Tolerance vs. Commercial Systems  xMax Cognitive Radio System Interference Mitigation  Interference Mitigation White Paper Contact xG  Helpful LinksAbout xG TechnologyIntegrated Microwave Technologies (IMT)VislinkxMax SolutionsInterference MitigationPress ReleasesInvestor InformationxG Blog xMax ProductsxMax CN3200 Dual-Band Routing ModemxMax CN1100 Access PointxMax CN5100 Mobile HotspotxMax CN3100 Vehicle ModemxMax CN7000 Mobile Control Center (MCC)Network ToolsRecent TweetsxG Technology’s Vislink Business Receives $1.5 Million Order from Medical Device Manufacturer - xG Technology https://t.co/BHfZFWiOxe 10:13:58 AM July 19, 2017 from BufferxG Technology’s Vislink Receives Orders Worth $1 Million for HCAM HEVC 4K Wireless Systems in China - xG Technology… https://t.co/xXIykIEDLs 02:41:20 PM July 17, 2017 from BufferxG Technology Announces Preliminary Q2 Financial Results Exceeding Analyst Expectations - xG Technology https://t.co/wiolZrE4Ah 01:36:46 PM July 13, 2017 from Buffer@xgtechnologyCompany InformationxG Technology, Inc. 240 South Pineapple Avenue, Suite 701 Sarasota, FL 34236 Tel: (941) 953-9035 Email: info@xgtechnology.com

Rural Telcos - xG Technology               xG Technology Company Websites  IMT Solutions Vislink  xG Technology Rural Telcos   Unlock new sources of non-regulated revenueSmall and rural telcos are in search of new and creative ways of generating non-regulated revenue to remain competitive in a changing marketplace. Traditionally, options for creating non-regulated revenue have been limited to costly fixed infrastructure like FTTH or acquiring expensive and scarce wireless spectrum—assuming it is even available.This has caused a number of smaller, family-owned companies to leave the business due to burdensome regulatory issues and low profit margins. Others have invested heavily in wired infrastructure, only to see their target consumers – and the potential for profit – access networks on the outer edges of their territories. Another challenge is that government funding mechanisms often do not adequately cover the cost of delivering services to those remote communities.  As a result, even though 20% of all Americans live in rural areas where wireless broadband coverage (and competition) is quite limited, for many providers, revenues are flat and growth is getting harder to find.However, there are still substantial business opportunities available for rural telcos to uncover. If you are a service provider, here is something to think about: Throughout your service area there are probably dozens of enterprises and organizations that could benefit from reliable, interoperable, easily deployed, and affordable wireless broadband communications. For example:Emergency response professionals are using smart phones and tablets to deliver data and high-speed video during emergencies and disasters. Many are paying $40-$60 per month for LTE that is not always available or accessible. How much money could you make if you provided more reliable service for less?Many municipalities are looking for simple and more cost-effective ways to provide wireless broadband to parks, libraries, senior centers, and other community areas. How would it impact your bottom line if you provided those services without the massive expense and management challenges of municipal WiFi?Colleges and universities are looking for ways to improve security and speed communications during crisis situations when the public cellular networks are seriously congested.During large events such as college football games and music festivals, communications can become problematic for event organizers, vendors, and attendees. What would it be worth to them if you could solve those problems easily and inexpensively?The solution for rural telcos is xMaxxMax from xG Technology is a wireless network technology that delivers private and secure broadband video, data, and VoIP communications over unlicensed radio spectrum. With a range of up to 5 miles and broadband speeds, our patented software-defined networking technology can blanket towns and counties with secure and reliable communications. In addition, xMax is built upon an end-to-end IP architecture. This means that mobile customers can use any commercially available smart phone, tablet, laptop, video camera, rugged handheld, or other IP-enabled device, as well as their preferred applications, like PTT, VPN and encryption.Among the key features of xMax are the following:Reliable xMax delivers a private high-speed voice and data network that is only accessible by the people given access rights by their administrators. It has been DoD tested and provides interference mitigation and jam/hack resistance unmatched by any other wireless system available today—so communications are available whenever and wherever they are needed.Interoperable xMax creates an end-to-end IP transport layer that allows users of the system to connect using any commercially available smartphone, tablet, video camera, or unmanned sensor. In addition, they can use the devices they already have without the need for any special software or modification.Easily Deployable xMax can be set up as permanent fixed infrastructure that is dynamically scalable, self-organizing, self-healing, and is easily updated with software upgrades. xMax is also an expeditionary broadband network that can be set up and operational in minutes by anyone with minimal technical skill.

Critical Infrastructure - xG Technology               xG Technology Company Websites  IMT Solutions Vislink  xG Technology Critical Infrastructure   Enabling Connectivity and Security for Critical InfrastructureIn order to improve operational effectiveness and reduce costs, public utilities and other critical infrastructure installations are recognizing the need to transition their current communications services to more advanced and flexible alternatives. While many have already started adding digital communications and monitoring systems to their production, transportation, distribution and monitoring systems, there remains a critical need to optimize the limited bandwidth they have at their disposal to support their wireless networks and mobile communication applications.The xMax wide-area mobile broadband data and video solution can help ensure uninterrupted access to the productivity and security applications that critical-function industries depend upon. xMax has the flexibility to be configured as a complete private network for critical communications, or to serve as a backup communication system that can provide coverage and capacity during disasters and other emergency situations. xMax for critical infrastructure provides an efficient and low-cost service delivery compared to traditional cellular infrastructures, reliable real-time communications with smart meters and sensors, and secure, highly-resilient connectivity. This is a solution that meets the key requirements of utility and critical industry while supporting their essential applications such as SCADA, mobile voice, mobile data, security and surveillance.Among the benefits of deploying xMax for critical infrastructure are the following:Unmatched Reliability: xMax was engineered from the ground up to deliver anywhere-anytime communications that perform in the most demanding situations. xMax fills in the gaps in coverage and capabilities that are inherent in the design of traditional systems and adds a superior level of survivability and redundancy that provide continuity of operations. xMax also supports multiple backhaul connection options, including SATCOM, PTP wireless and microwave.Exceptional Interoperability: xMax creates an end-to-end, IP transport layer that enables connectivity with any commercially available, WiFi-enabled device, including smartphones, tablets, video cameras and sensors. This is critical when multiple-agency response takes place and a wide variety of communications gear is involved. xMax also interconnects easily with LTE, GSM, CDMA and P25 systems.A truly private, always-secure network: xMax delivers a high-speed voice and data network that goes beyond “priority access” and delivers “private access,” meaning it is only designated users and groups. Unlike the public cellular network, there is no contention for airwaves. There are also no commercially available radios sharing the system, so private communications remain private. xG’s patented, multi-layered interference mitigation technology makes xMax difficult to jam or hack, and it also supports encryption via FIPS140-2 compliance. Related PagesEmergency ManagementCritical InfrastructureTelemedicineDoD and Military  Related Resources  xMax Solution for Port Facilities  xMax Overview and Benefits for Public Utilities Contact xG  Helpful LinksAbout xG TechnologyIntegrated Microwave Technologies (IMT)VislinkxMax SolutionsInterference MitigationPress ReleasesInvestor InformationxG Blog xMax ProductsxMax CN3200 Dual-Band Routing ModemxMax CN1100 Access PointxMax CN5100 Mobile HotspotxMax CN3100 Vehicle ModemxMax CN7000 Mobile Control Center (MCC)Network ToolsRecent TweetsxG Technology’s Vislink Business Receives $1.5 Million Order from Medical Device Manufacturer - xG Technology https://t.co/BHfZFWiOxe 10:13:58 AM July 19, 2017 from BufferxG Technology’s Vislink Receives Orders Worth $1 Million for HCAM HEVC 4K Wireless Systems in China - xG Technology… https://t.co/xXIykIEDLs 02:41:20 PM July 17, 2017 from BufferxG Technology Announces Preliminary Q2 Financial Results Exceeding Analyst Expectations - xG Technology https://t.co/wiolZrE4Ah 01:36:46 PM July 13, 2017 from Buffer@xgtechnologyCompany InformationxG Technology, Inc. 240 South Pineapple Avenue, Suite 701 Sarasota, FL 34236 Tel: (941) 953-9035 Email: info@xgtechnology.com

The microLite is a wireless camera system enabling broadcast news operators to eliminate the use of coaxial cables in their remote news operations. MiniMobile Commander and Mobile Commander are the products that serve the sports and entertainment markets.The Company's xMax system is a cognitive radio network system that is designed to include interference mitigation by using its spatial processing. xMax implements its interference mitigation software. Its system is frequency agnostic, although designed to operate within the 902 to 928 megahertz unlicensed band. xMax serves as a mobile voice over Internet protocol (VoIP) and broadband data system that utilizes an Internet Protocol (IP) system architecture. The xMax product and service suite includes a line of access points, fixed and mobile personal hotspots, mobile switching centers, network management systems, deployment tools and customer support. Its xMax system also enables enterprises to set up a mobile communications network.The Company's xMax cognitive radio technology can also be used to provide additional capacity to licensed spectrum by identifying and utilizing unused bandwidth within the licensed spectrum. In any spectrum band that xMax operates in, the Company breaks the band into channels and sub channels. The xMax product suite that the Company is developing is band specific. The xMax system design represents a turnkey network solution that includes self-organizing access points (base stations), fixed and mobile personal wireless fidelity (Wi-Fi) hotspots, mobile switching centers, as well as network management and deployment tools.The Company's xMax CN5100 Mobile Hotspot is a device that allows users of Wi-Fi-enabled smartphones, tablets, notebooks and other devices to access the Internet through the xMax cognitive radio network. The CN5100 Mobile Hotspot acts as a transparent protocol bridge that connects end user devices to the xMax network using secure Wi-Fi links, universal serial bus (USB) or Ethernet cables. It supports not only fixed users but also supports mobile users and has been designed to provide quality of service (QoS) and mean opinion score (MoS) while supporting calls, texting (shot messaging service (SMS)) and broadband data streams over the xMax network. The CN5100 Mobile Hotspot includes a Wi-Fi router chip that allows it to simultaneously support multiple external devices wirelessly. It enables operators to deploy long-range xMax networks that can integrate with the large installed base of Wi-Fi and Ethernet-capable devices. The CN5100 Mobile Hotspot and xMax system is designed to support nomadic and mobile connectivity (including high-speed handoffs), which allows xMax operators to offer on-the-go services. xMax is deployed in fixed, mobile or nomadic configurations.The Company's xMax CN3100 Vehicle Modem is an IP67-rated ruggedized subscriber device that is designed to be installed inside or outside vehicles. The CN3100 Vehicle Modem acts as a transparent protocol bridge, allowing users of Wi-Fi-enabled smartphones, tablets, notebooks and other devices to access the Internet through the xMax cognitive radio network. The CN3100 Vehicle Modem is waterproof. While primarily developed for vehicle usage, the CN3100 Vehicle Modem can also be externally mounted in fixed locations, such as parks or other outdoor areas to provide Wi-Fi access for use in monitoring, surveillance, machine-to-machine and other applications using the xMax backhaul link.The Company's xMax CN3200 Dual-Band Routing Modem is a single compact unit that operates in both approximately 900 megahertz and 2.4 gigahertz frequency bands. The CN3200 Dual-Band Routing Modem utilizes interprotocol smart-routing algorithms to determine which frequency to use based on the user's application. Voice calls are prioritized to the 900-megahertz band while video and data are prioritized to the 2.4-gigahertz band. CN3200 Dual-Band Routing Modem is designed for use in both fixed and mobile applications. In logistics, military, or public service applications, the 2.4-gigahertz link can assist in loading and unloading high volumes of data from the application server to a stationary vehicle and then transparently switch to the 900-megahertz band once it goes mobile.The Company's CN3200 Dual-Band Routing Modem switches all data and voice traffic to the 900-megahertz radio to keep the connection alive. When the vehicle becomes stationary again, the CN3200 Dual-Band Routing Modem resumes dual band operation. If the 2.4-gigahertz band becomes congested, slow, or filled with interference, the CN3200 Dual-Band Routing Modem routes all voice and data communications to the 900-megahertz band to preserve communications. The CN3200 Dual-Band Routing Modem has been engineered to support the delivery of both fixed location high data rates and high-speed mobility in the same system.The Company's xMax CN1100 Access Point is an all-IP wireless access point. The CN1100 Access Point brings together a range of technologies, including software defined radio (SDR), cognitive networking and a 2x4 multiple in, multiple out (MIMO) in a compact broadband access point. These capabilities enable the CN1100 Access Point to deliver coverage and broadband throughput for fixed, nomadic and mobile applications. The CN1100 Access Point (as well as all xMax components) supports mobile connectivity, including high-speed handoff that allows xMax operators to offer on-the-go services. The CN1100 Access Point is a small, single channel device that provides voice, data and video over ranges of 1 to 5 miles (non-line-of-sight) and over 15 miles (line-of-sight), depending on environmental and installation conditions. CN1100 Access Points are global positioning system (GPS) time-synchronized to avoid self-interference.The Company's xMax CN7000 Mobile Control Center is the backbone network element in the xMax regional network. The CN7000 Mobile Control Center controls the delivery of voice and data services, and manages all elements in the regional network, including access points and end user devices.
