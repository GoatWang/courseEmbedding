About Wenger Watches
Wenger watches are the military cousins of the original genuine Swiss Army knife, and they are just as necessary on the battle field and in life in general. Manufactured in Biel, Switzerland, Wenger men’s watches exhibit an emphasis on being as multifunctional as possible because they may need to be utilized in a seemingly endless amount of different situations. And while the women’s Wenger watches have more of an elegant design focus, they still can be trusted as a heavy duty timepiece for even the toughest test. A Wenger watch is symbolic of style and function, and its wearer can always know that of all of the accessories and equipment they carry, their watch will never be the part that lets them down.
Wenger Nomad LED
Because Wenger watches serve the needs of the constant traveler, it has now released the perfect model for that person: The Wenger Nomad LED watch. Displaying  lustrous digital displays behind clean analog clock dials, Wenger Nomad LED watches display twice the information of a normal timepiece. But that’s not the only attraction of a men’s Wenger Nomad LED watch. Further benefits of these new designs include:

The Wenger Nomad LED watch will never permit its user to get lost because of the digital compass function on the dial that provides both direction and bearing.
The digital readout on the Wenger Nomad LED watches also provide time, day of the week, date and month as well.
A wearer of any of the men’s Wenger Nomad watches can choose whether to keep the digital readout hidden or displayed prominently at the push of a single button.
With a 316L stainless steel 43 millimeter case, a Wenger Nomad watch has the perfect sixe and sturdiness to function in the office or in the field.
The mineral glass crystal on a men’s Wenger Nomad watch is nearly scratchproof, and the 100-meter water resistant timepiece is covered by the manufacturer’s three-year warranty as well.

Wenger Excavating Company










Wenger Excavating

Wenger Excavating Inc. had its beginnings in 1967 when Howard Wenger, working the night shift in the quality control labs at Republic Steel, decided that he also needed a day job to fulfill his ambitions.  Howard purchased a  backhoe and began doing miscellaneous excavating work in the Village of Dalton.  From digging graves to repairing local farmers’ drain tiles and installing underground utilities for the village, Howard soon found that he enjoyed the challenge of solving underground problems.   Wenger Excavating continues to find solutions for excavating problems in the twenty-first century.
The excavating company realized from the beginning that four things were important to achieve its dreams: a source of operating capital to feed the growing business, good people to do the work, affordable and reliable equipment, and dedication to family.
In finding sufficient operating capital Howard’s people skills were fully challenged.  When the bank did not offer enough capital to fund his dreams, Howard turned to friends, family and employees to build the company.  In return, Howard made friendships that have lasted throughout the growth of the company.   
Howard hired his brother-in-law Clair Good as his first employee and over forty years later Clair is still helping to find solutions for problems in the company.  In addition Howard’s loyalty to his hometown meant that his work force was made up of local workers whom he could trust with the important work of providing quality services for Wenger Excavating’s customers.
Howard serves as chief executive officer for Wenger Excavating Inc. with the support of his family.  Wenger Excavating, Inc. has its home office in Dalton with state-of-the-art office and shop facilities.  The company specializes in excavating and underground utility installation in the north-central region of Ohio.   Wenger Excavating Inc. serves residential and commercial developers, industry and state and local government.  In the peak, approximately 100 employees continue the dreams that Howard Wenger had in the 60’s: offer the customer the best service possible and stay in good communication with your fellowman whether it be your family, your customer or your employee.
