Tim Grieve Named National Journal Editor-In-Chief






By Michael Calderone






























Tim Grieve, who recently jumped from Politico to National Journal and has been hiring up reporters, has been named National Journal's editor-in-chief, according to a memo from Atlantic Media chief David Bradley. 
The move puts Grieve head-to-head now with his former bosses at Politico in competing for politics and policy scoops. 
National Journal editor Charlie Green, who joined the publication in 1997, will be leaving the company at the end of the year. 
Bradley praised the outgoing and incoming top editors, while recalling the end of "It's a Wonderful Life" in the memo below:

My Colleagues at National Journal:
As if in the same entering class at school, Charlie Green and I joined the National Journal Group roughly contemporaneously. Charlie was recruited by Steve Smith as the magazine's deputy editor in 1997; I joined only a few months prior. I've barely spent a working day in media without Charlie Green carrying the larger work. Now, I will have to. After 16 years at the National Journal Group, rising to editor of the whole, Charlie has decided that he would like a new run with his career still at its zenith. For reasons I'll explain below, I'm honor bound to acquiesce. As Charlie steps back, I'm reassured of strong leadership by Bruce's and my decision to appoint Tim Grieve, himself an extreme talent, to the position of editor-in-chief overseeing all our journalism products.
As to Charlie--and as to my sense of being bound by honor--I want to tell the story of this great editor's time with us. On first purchasing the National Journal, and immediately trying to add columnist Stuart Taylor to our ranks, I came across a large perception problem. Stuart had been on the threshold of accepting our offer--and leaving the American Lawyer--when its (very, very) smart owner, Steve Brill, asked Stuart: "National Journal - isn't that the Washington reference publication with the three-hole punch?" Under Steve Smith, then under Michael Kelly but then, and most, under Charlie Green, the National Journal became a first-tier-talent, national-class magazine. For 16 years, Charlie has edited the most-intelligent, considered, trustworthy, prestigious public policy publishing property in the U.S.  All of us who love this brand are profoundly in his debt.
As won't surprise any of our editorial staff, the degree of Charlie's talent caught me unaware. Michael Kelly first told me: "You know, this deputy editor Steve hired - he's really something. I mean the real deal."  Then, when Michael left Washington to edit The Atlantic, he added: "I don't really think we have to do any recruiting here. Charlie's really it. You'll never hear him say it, but he can do this better than I can." Demonstrating the highest ratio of exceptional talent over selfless regard I've ever seen, Charlie lead us from then on.
The "honor-bound" story is more personal. Three years ago, in a hard hour for the National Journal, I decided we needed to pursue a reorganization.  Expecting some turnover in staff, and not wanting to decide who, I offered a buyout to 100% of the editorial staff. I thought a few would choose to go; in the event, it was barely safe to stand between the elevators and the B-2 garage so headlong was the rush for the door. At the time, I had told Charlie that he, too, had a right to take the buyout, but I asked him not to. I understood by then, acutely, that I needed Charlie, probably Atlantic Media's single most-beloved leader, to hold the center. In asking Charlie to stay, I committed that, whenever he decided he did want to move on, I would support that decision. Charlie brought me the news, three months ago, that that time had arrived. He will be leaving at the end of the year.  I want to return to an image of Charlie, and his great service in life, that I've had in mind for this writing. But, first, let me turn to the unsurpassed good news that Tim Grieve has agreed to serve as National Journal Group's editor-in-chief.
Tim joined us in May to re-create the National Journal website. Like so much ambitious legal talent--Tim, Bruce, Stuart Taylor, Steven Brill, (me)--Tim devoted his legally-trained mind to getting out of law. Raised in California, graduating Stanford, graduating Georgetown Law, clerking in Washington for the nation's second-highest court, practicing - some - in California, Tim reported for the Sacramento Bee and, leaving law behind, became a senior writer at Salon. Before joining National Journal, Tim was a top editor at Politico - having edited Congressional coverage and then launched Politico's Politico Pro product line. Tim is a force of nature and a professional on a vertical trajectory through life. I'm not sure that he would have chosen to lead the whole of the National Journal Group, surely not this early, but Charlie joins Bruce and me in thinking Tim is made for this work. I am deeply appreciative of Tim and deeply appreciative he is here.
Closing, and in an indulgence only the owner should risk, I want to set down the mental image of Charlie I've had since I began thinking about my letter to you. Most will know it, though maybe our youngest staff not. That is the closing scene from the 1946 Christmas drama, It's a Wonderful Life. Dear George Bailey (Jimmy Stewart) is the man who has given up on everything he had intended in life instead to serve others. As a 12-year-old, he saves his brother from drowning and, in so doing, loses his own hearing. His brother goes on to become a WWII fighting ace; loss of hearing keeps George from enlisting. He gives up college to take over his father's struggling savings & loan. He uses savings for his honeymoon with Mary (Donna Reed) to bail out depositors. And then, in the penultimate scene, the closing crisis, a careless Uncle Billy loses $8,000 of the bank's deposits setting the bank on a course to insolvency. Unable to find a loan to carry the bank through, George climbs out on a bridge to leap into the freezing (December) waters below. George, saved by an angel, is shown how worse would have been the lives of the neighbors in Bedford Falls had George not devoted his life to them. George returns home, Christmas Eve, house decked out for the holiday, to find word has gone out - George is in trouble. Neighbors, by the score, are coming by to give of their savings. I'll switch to excerpts from the script:
Uncle Billy: "Mary did it, George! Mary did it! She told a few people you were in trouble and they scattered all over town collecting money. They didn't ask any questions - just said, 'If George is in trouble, count on me.' You never saw anything like it."
(Charlie adds his money to the pile.)
(Martini dumps his money on the table.)
(Mr. Gower enters with a large glass jar jammed full of notes.)
(Violet arrives and takes out the money George had given her for her trip to New York.)
Violet: "I'm not going to go, George. I changed my mind."
Annie: "I've been saving this money for a divorce, if I ever get a husband."
People line up in the warmly decorated house to give their savings. A crowd forms outside and begins to sing. The festive scene ends with everyone singing "Auld Lang Syne:"
Should old acquaintance be forgot,
and never brought to mind?
Should old acquaintance be forgot,
and old lang syne?
For auld lang syne,
my dear,
for auld lang syne.
We'll take a cup of
kindness yet,
for auld lang syne.
And there's a hand my
trusty friend!
And gives us a hand o'
thine!
And we'll take a right good-will draught,
for auld lang syne.
Maybe you had to be there. But, those who know the story will sense something of the direction my mind has taken. In my career, I don't think that I've known a man more beloved, thought a more universal blessing, than Charlie Green. I don't know that Charlie, especially Charlie, can understand how broadly and how much he has meant.
Thank you, Charlie.
Thank you, Tim.
My best to all.

Introducing POLITICO Pro





 Share on Facebook
 Share on Twitter


Nearly four years ago, POLITICO launched with a team of about 40 journalists and went on to change the game of political journalism. 
 Now, POLITICO formally announces its plans to take a team of the same size and launch a new product in February 2011, with similarly large ambitions: POLITICO Pro, a subscription service providing highly detailed, rapid-fire reporting on the politics of energy, technology and health care. Story Continued Below






 “Political and policy professionals want someone to cut through the clutter, tell them what really matters and tell them first,” said POLITICO Executive Editor Jim VandeHei. “We have a proven track record for doing just that — and POLITICO Pro will build on it.” 
 Hiring for the new product has already begun, led by Tim Grieve, the editor-in-chief of POLITICO Pro, currently a deputy managing editor at POLITICO. 
 “I don’t know where it’s written down that policy coverage has to be boring,” Grieve said. “A lot of other policy-focused publications produce dry recitations of hearings and meetings. We’ll put all of our money in what matters most: journalists who can deliver human intelligence better and faster than anyone else.” 
 The energy team will be led by Dan Berman, a former senior reporter for Greenwire and editor of Environment & Energy Daily, and include Darren Samuelsohn, Josh Voorhees and Robin Bravender — all of whom left E&E to join POLITICO — plus Darren Goode from The Hill and several more reporters to be announced soon. 
 Kim Hart, who has covered the tech sector for The Washington Post, The Hill and POLITICO, will lead POLITICO Pro’s technology team. She’ll be joined by Tony Romm, co-author of POLITICO’s Morning Tech, and Jennifer Martinez from GigaOm and the Tribune Co.’s Washington bureau, along with four other reporters. 
 The health care team will be led by Diane Webber, a veteran of the New York Post, the Brooklyn Papers, Scholastic and other publications, building on the foundation laid by Sarah Kliff and Jennifer Haberkorn, authors of the POLITICO Pulse morning newsletter. 
 POLITICO’s LaRonda Peterson will serve as POLITICO Pro’s production editor, leading a team that will include copy editor Abby McIntyre and Web producers Kate Nocera, Jess Kamen and Alex Guillen. 
 Poppy MacDonald, who has launched new products for Gallup Inc. and The Advisory Board Co., will lead POLITICO Pro’s sales and customer relations teams. Early hires in those areas include Miki King, Khari Joseph and Lauren Englander. 
 The launch comes at a time of rapid change in Washington’s journalism landscape, as players such as Bloomberg are expanding, while older players such as National Journal have reinvented themselves to respond to the 24/7 pace of today’s news cycle. 
 “Our ambition is to emerge from the great upheaval in journalism to become the dominant publication covering Washington politics and governance,” VandeHei said.

I’m never going to die. I’m sorry I can’t say the same for you. My role models for how to do death are Jesus and Wile E. Coyote. Yours are other dead people. However, because I’m never going to die, I’m super comfortable with the entire topic, and the fact that I’m late turning in this column on books about death and dying has nothing to do with avoiding the subject.So an author who suggests the dead are not howling in the abyss but rather hanging out in what she imagines as a pretty “waiting area” — well, that’s an author who’s easy for me to love. Theresa Caputo’s television show, “Long Island Medium,” has been a mainstay on TLC, and in GOOD GRIEF: Heal Your Soul, Honor Your Loved Ones, and Learn to Live Again (Atria, $25.99), Caputo (with her co-writer, Kristina Grish) wants us to know what she has learned from all those years of channeling the dead: “It’s their greatest hope that you learn to heal and carry on.” The dead — or Spirit, as she calls them — are quite chatty and opinionated. Among the things Spirit wants you to know:Your relationship with your loved one isn’t over; it has merely changed. (Even if the loved one can’t drive you to the airport, if you ask nicely Spirit might “help you get a cab.”) You can let your feelings rule you for short periods of time, but “you must also take active steps to heal.” (Spirit doesn’t like whiners.) When it’s your time, it’s (usually) your time, or at least in the “destiny window” of time. Caputo has a host of practical, rather adorable ideas for honoring Spirit, which often involve giving gifts to others in Spirit’s name.After a while it occurred to me that if the departed behaved in the loving way Caputo describes, I would like them more when they were dead than when they were alive. No matter; I am entirely agnostic, and still found this book comforting and quite touching. I felt oddly close to my own dead parents as I read along.Those whose loss is more recent may prefer a less warm and fuzzy approach — more of a “what can I do to get on with my life right now?” book. Resilience is a hot topic these days, and Lucy Hone has written a book about bereavement reflecting both her own research and her own grief. RESILIENT GRIEVING: Finding Strength and Embracing Life After a Loss That Changes Everything (The Experiment, paper, $15.95) begins with Hone’s own tragedy: In 2014, her 12-year-old daughter was killed in a car accident. Hone shows us how to harness the (thankfully common) power of our own resilience to work our way through a horrible loss. Continue reading the main story

Resilience is not a shield against suffering, Hone suggests. It enables us to feel and to move through emotions like pain and guilt so that we can continue to feel alive and experience happiness. Hone does not buy into the idea that you just feel your feelings and take all the time in the world; what if, like Hone herself, you have other kids at home, a demanding job, and an urgent need to function in the real world? Hone offers concrete strategies for regaining your equilibrium even in the greatest pain. Among them: Choosing where to focus your attention (not on hating someone or something, which consumes energy); taking your time with the body of the one you love (there is no mad rush to bury or memorialize beloved); and re-establish routines, particularly if you have children, who may need that structure even more than you do.Despite her insistence to the contrary, there is a strong whiff of “just-get-on-with-it” matter-of-factness that may be a little beyond some of us. Patrick O’Malley’s GETTING GRIEF RIGHT: Finding Your Story of Love in the Sorrow of Loss (Sounds True, paper, $16.95), co-written by Tim Madigan, is for those of us made of less stern stuff. O’Malley was trained as a counselor, but when he lost his infant son, and he tried to work through the famous Kübler-Ross stages of grieving — denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and finally acceptance — he felt like a failure. Grief was not linear; it was more of an oscillation. O’Malley wanted to talk about his son, to tell others who his son was, even in the few months he was on this earth. He began to see the wisdom of the writer Isak Dinesen, who noted, “All sorrows can be borne if you put them in a story or tell a story about them.”O’Malley gives us the tools to tell the story of the deceased: favorite memories, when he or she was happiest and saddest, how you learned about the death, and so forth. Different kinds of loss bring different stories, and different kinds of pain. Telling the story of how you loved and how you lost gives shape and meaning to what first seems to be a meaningless, uncontrollable event.

For a compelling argument for why we have to rethink the wisdom of end-of-life “heroics,” there is EXTREME MEASURES: Finding a Better Path to the End of Life (Avery, $27). The author, Jessica Nutik Zitter, is a physician who specializes in both critical care medicine and palliative care, the yin and yang of medicine. Critical care specialists are taught to save lives with all the technology and machinery at their disposal. Palliative care specialists need the opposite skill set: They have to know how to help a dying person let go. Zitter is trained in both.

Of course, it was not always thus. Dr. Zitter describes her first Code Blue as a resident. She rushes into the room to heroically save the patient, and instead she is asked to resuscitate someone who is clearly dead, or should be. “With each compression, there is a sickening click, which I don’t recognize until I hear someone next to me whisper, ‘His whole chest is breaking,’” she writes. “This man is dead.”The patient stays dead. But in that moment Zitter realizes that there must be a better way to depart this earth. She also discusses how palliative care can respond to many of the most painful symptoms of dying in a way that care geared toward prolonging life cannot. And why, at the end of life, less is often more compassionate. Like Atul Gawande’s “Being Mortal,” Zitter’s book shows how knowing when to do nothing is as vital to being a good doctor as knowing when to do everything.As compared to the more philosophical “Extreme Measures,” John Abraham’s HOW TO GET THE DEATH YOU WANT: A Practical and Moral Guide (Upper Access, paper, $14.95) is exactly as nuts and bolts as it sounds. Abraham, a thanatologist and Episcopal priest, writes extensively about advance directives and how to ensure your wishes are abided by; and then, he tells us the least painful and messy ways to go. It may not be easy to read about these methods, but they affirm the idea expressed by a popular button worn by Abraham and other members of the Final Exit Network — “Let me die like a dog” — because anyone who has ever had to euthanize a beloved pet knows how painless and peaceful death can be. Those of us who fear loss of control of our lives more than we fear death will find Abraham’s book edifying. I even appreciate the phrase he uses instead of assisted suicide; he prefers “deliberate life completion.”Knowing Nina Riggs died shortly after writing THE BRIGHT HOUR: A Memoir of Living and Dying (Simon & Schuster, $25), the story of her experience with metastatic breast cancer, makes this moving and often very funny memoir almost unbearable to read. But that’s because it is not one bromide after the other. It is true, and it might crush you. There is one moment here that says everything about how lonely you can feel when you’ve been told you have a disease. It’s past midnight, and Riggs and her husband are lying in bed: “‘I just can’t wait for things to get back to normal,’ says John from his side of the moon.” Riggs realizes there may not be a “normal” anymore, and reacts with anger, and a growing resolve that we all wish we could achieve: “Thinking that way kind of invalidates my whole life right now. I have to love these days in the same way I love any other.”I’ll just say this: You can read a multitude of books about how to die, but Riggs, a dying woman, will show you how to live.

Roberts said the individual mandate survives because Congress has power to impose taxes. | AP Photo
Close







“Given its expansive scope, it is no surprise that Congress has employed the commerce power in a wide variety of ways to address the pressing needs of the time. But Congress has never attempted to rely on that power to compel individuals not engaged in commerce to purchase an unwanted product.  Legislative novelty is not necessarily fatal; there is a first time for everything. But sometimes “the most telling indication of [a] severe constitutional problem . . . is the lack of historical precedent” for Congress’s action.”More Roberts: No really, it’s not happening.

More from the chief justice:
“As expansive as our cases construing the scope of the commerce power have been, they all have one thing in common: They uniformly describe the power as reaching ‘activity.’ It is nearly impossible to avoid the word when quoting them . . . .
“The individual mandate, however, does not regulate existing commercial activity. It instead compels individuals to become active in commerce by purchasing a product, on the ground that their failure to do so affects interstate commerce. . . .
“People, for reasons of their own, often fail to do things that would be good for them or good for society. Those failures — joined with the similar failures of others — can readily have a substantial effect on interstate commerce. Under the Government’s logic, that authorizes Congress to use its commerce power to compel citizens to act as the Government would have them act. That is not the country the Framers of our Constitution envisioned.”
Ginsburg: Roberts is a throwback.
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg explains why she and the court’s other liberals think Roberts has it wrong on the Commerce Clause:
“The provision of health care is today a concern of national dimension, just as the provision of old-age and survivors’ benefits was in the 1930’s. In the Social Security Act, Congress installed a federal system to provide monthly benefits to retired wage earners and, eventually, to their survivors. Beyond question, Congress could have adopted a similar scheme for health care. Congress chose, instead, to preserve a central role for private insurers and state governments. According to THE CHIEF JUSTICE, the Commerce Clause does not permit that preservation. This rigid reading of the Clause makes scant sense and is stunningly retrogressive.”
More Ginsburg: Oh, and this ain’t broccoli.
This was probably inevitable:
“Maintaining that the uninsured are not active in the health-care market, the Chief Justice draws an analogy to the car market. An individual ‘is not ‘active in the car market,’ the Chief Justice observes, simply because he or she may someday buy a car.  The analogy is inapt. The inevitable yet unpredictable need for medical care and the guarantee that emergency care will be provided when required are conditions nonexistent in other markets. That is so of the market for cars, and of the market for broccoli as well. Although an individual might buy a car or a crown of broccoli one day, there is no certainty she will ever do so. And if she eventually wants a car or has a craving for broccoli, she will be obliged to pay at the counter before receiving the vehicle or nourishment. She will get no free ride or food, at the expense of another consumer forced to pay an inflated price.”

The ruling states that it's unconstitutional to mandate the purchase of health insurance under the commerce clause, but it is constitutional to penalize the failure to purchase health insurance, under the taxing power. Basically, we can't force you to buy it, but we can tax you for not buying it.  With this ruling, lifestyle taxes are coming. Your BMI is over 30, there will be a tax to 'motivate' you to a healthy lifestyle. Just as 'sin' taxes today are supposed to do with regards to alcohol and tobacco.

Thank God for this ruling. His mercies endures for ever. Now more fellow Americans will have health coverage. A CONSERVATIVE court has spoken. Let's go ahead and continue to IMPROVE what is the first step in fixing what was our hopelessly broken health care system that was only tailored for the few. Obviously since the insurance companies do not like it, it must have been benefiting someone that's not them (the people they insure). In our collective pursuit of life (which is not guaranteed without health care), liberty (now the government cannot force us to buy health insurance, but can tax us if we can afford it but don't, since they must treat us in hospital if we show up), and the pursuit of happiness.

Dave-MO, just like you rightly pointed out, lifestyle taxes have always been here. Yet you refer to them as coming in spite of stating pretty much they've always been here in the same paragraph. We are taxed for injesting tobacco and burdening the health system. We are taxed for having no health insurance and showing up in ERs. The Bills just get sent to the right place now. Good call.

The idea that it's bad that healthy people are being "forced" to be in the system is absurd. Accidents happen to healthy people and when they do, quite suddenly they're not healthy anymore. Duh...... You'd think someone who made it to the Supreme Court would be able to work that one out. --------------------------- Mitt Romney's moral compass points to Las Vegas

The Supreme Court confirmed that Obama and the democrats have passed the largest TAX increase in American history. Expect the government to start taxing the individual for anything they can find an excuse.

Poor, reich-wing babies! Remember, Republicans blocked a national healthcare plan in America for 60 years out of greed and opposed the ACA because it cut into the excessive profits and abuses of their healthcare benefactors. Since the healthcare companies, inurers muscled they way in on the creation of the ACA, many said they would keep many of its provisions even if the SCOTUS decided against it. Republicans NEVER mention that healthcare costs DOUBLED under Bush-Cheney and that the GOP changed the bankruptcy laws to benefit not consumers but the banks and credit card companies, many of whom were later bailed out. Republicans claimed that cardholders were abusing their credit, when, in fact, when the law was passed, most bankruptcies were due to overwhelming hospital and medical bills.

TeamPOLITICO: Jun. 28, 2012 - 1:09 PM EST all Chief Justice John Roberts, a conservative, joined the four liberal justices in upholding most of President Barack Obama’s health care law. They decided that the “individual mandate,” which requires most Americans to have health insurance by 2014 or pay a penalty, is constitutional under Congress’ power to tax.  Read more at:   http://dyn.politico.com/mem... I am surprised and glad he sided to uphold ACA. Just what I thought, the law would be upheld by a 5-4 decision.

JRichter7: Jun. 28, 2012 - 1:17 PM EST  Lifestyle taxes amout to the same thing as a consumption tax. Consumption tax = the more you but, the more you pay. Lifesyle tax = the more crap you put in your body, the more you pay. So basically both require a person to be conservative with their spending and their lifestyles...why would conservatives have a problem with this?

Sign up   *Invalid email address   Got it   Got it                By Erik Wemple  By Erik Wemple   September 9, 2015  Follow @ErikWemple    National Journal today announced that Editor in Chief Tim Grieve will be leaving the company — hardly an unexpected move considering that the longtime Beltway policy magazine in July announced that it would bag its print product. Grieve will be heading to McClatchy Company and will serve as head of News Strategies, “working on digital expansion for the company’s more than two dozen newspapers and news sites around the country, including the Miami Herald and the Sacramento Bee,” according to memo from Tim Hartman, chief executive of the National Journal Group. In a memo to staff, Grieve wrote, in part, “It’s been an absolute thrill and honor to work with you, and I’m so proud of the journalism we produced together. Even more than that, I’m proud of the newsroom we built — a newsroom full of people who care about and support each other at every turn. I hope you’re all proud of the role you’ve played in that. You should be.” When the suspension of the National Journal print operation was announced, the company insisted it would redo its Web site; develop a “high velocity” news sensibility in part by recommitting itself to National Journal Daily and Hotline; lower its staff count as humanely as possible; and take various other steps as it formulated a brand-new strategy after a string of failed efforts. The search for Grieve’s replacement is under way, according to Hartman’s memo. In the interim, Tom Shoop, editor in chief for Government Executive Media Group, will lead the newsroom on an interim basis.        opinions  erik-wemple Orlando Shooting Updates News and analysis on the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history. post_newsletter348 follow-orlando true after3th false          Please provide a valid email address.
