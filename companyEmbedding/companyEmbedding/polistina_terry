MADISON, Wis.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Spectrum Brands Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: SPB), a global consumer products 
      company with market-leading brands, announced today that Terry L. 
      Polistina, President of its Global Appliances division, has elected to 
      leave the Company, effective September 30, 2013, following the 
      successful completion of the multi-year restructuring and integration of 
      the Global Appliances business and the implementation of a succession 
      plan. Mr. Polistina will continue to serve as a member of the Board of 
      Directors of Spectrum Brands.
    


      Steve Fraundorfer, who has more than 20 years of manufacturing and 
      operations experience at Spectrum Brands, has been appointed Vice 
      President and General Manager for Global Appliances, which includes 
      responsibility for North American Appliances sales and marketing in 
      addition to his current responsibilities for Global Appliances business 
      operations. Mr. Fraundorfer will report to Dave Lumley, Chief Executive 
      Officer of Spectrum Brands Holdings. Andreas Rouvé, President, 
      International, maintains his responsibility for all international 
      Appliances operations and continues to report to Mr. Lumley. The Global 
      Appliances management structure was instituted earlier this year in 
      preparation for Mr. Polistina’s planned departure from the Company.
    

      “Terry has made valuable and significant contributions to our global 
      continuous improvement, supply chain and new product development 
      processes, and to our Company’s overall growth and strategic 
      development,” said Mr. Lumley. “Under his leadership, we exceeded our 
      initial cost synergy estimates from the acquisition of Russell Hobbs and 
      the subsequent integration of our Home and Remington® Personal Care 
      divisions. Our Global Appliances division has been streamlined, is 
      achieving record annual cost savings this year, and is currently 
      introducing a record number of new products across the world. We thank 
      Terry for his leadership and wish him well. We are grateful he remains a 
      director of the Company.”
    

      David Maura, Chairman of Spectrum Brands, said, “Terry has provided 
      outstanding leadership and service to Spectrum Brands over the past 
      three years, most notably through the many significant operating 
      improvements to our Global Appliances business. Terry has been a 
      business partner and friend of mine for a number of years, and I am very 
      pleased that he will continue to serve on our Board. We all join in 
      wishing Terry the very best in his future business activities.”
    

      Mr. Polistina, 50, was appointed to the Spectrum Brands Board of 
      Directors in August 2009 and named President of Spectrum Brands’ Small 
      Appliances division, upon the closing of the Company’s merger in June 
      2010 with Russell Hobbs, Inc., a leading global marketer of small 
      kitchen and home appliances with a broad portfolio of such well-known 
      brands as Black & Decker®, George Foreman®, Farberware®, Toastmaster® 
      and Juiceman® . He became President, Global Appliances in October 2010.
    

      Prior to joining Spectrum Brands, Mr. Polistina was Chief Executive 
      Officer of Russell Hobbs. Prior to joining Russell Hobbs, he served as 
      Chief Operating Officer of Applica Incorporated from 2006 to 2007 and as 
      Chief Financial Officer from 2001 to 2007. Mr. Polistina also served as 
      a Senior Vice President of Applica from 1998 to 2001. Applica was a 
      global small appliances manufacturer and a predecessor company to 
      Russell Hobbs.
    

      Mr. Polistina earned a bachelor’s degree in finance from the University 
      of Florida and an MBA from the University of Miami.

Terry Polistina, President of Spectrum Brands’ Global Appliances Business, to Leave the Company But Remain a Member of the Board of Directors

MADISON, Wis.



(Business Wire)  
      Spectrum Brands Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: SPB), a global consumer products 
      company with market-leading brands, announced today that Terry L. 
      Polistina, President of its Global Appliances division, has elected to 
      leave the Company, effective September 30, 2013, following the 
      successful completion of the multi-year restructuring and integration of 
      the Global Appliances business and the implementation of a succession 
      plan. Mr. Polistina will continue to serve as a member of the Board of 
      Directors of Spectrum Brands.
    

      Steve Fraundorfer, who has more than 20 years of manufacturing and 
      operations experience at Spectrum Brands, has been appointed Vice 
      President and General Manager for Global Appliances, which includes 
      responsibility for North American Appliances sales and marketing in 
      addition to his current responsibilities for Global Appliances business 
      operations. Mr. Fraundorfer will report to Dave Lumley, Chief Executive 
      Officer of Spectrum Brands Holdings. Andreas Rouvé, President, 
      International, maintains his responsibility for all international 
      Appliances operations and continues to report to Mr. Lumley. The Global 
      Appliances management structure was instituted earlier this year in 
      preparation for Mr. Polistina’s planned departure from the Company.
    

      “Terry has made valuable and significant contributions to our global 
      continuous improvement, supply chain and new product development 
      processes, and to our Company’s overall growth and strategic 
      development,” said Mr. Lumley. “Under his leadership, we exceeded our 
      initial cost synergy estimates from the acquisition of Russell Hobbs and 
      the subsequent integration of our Home and Remington® Personal Care 
      divisions. Our Global Appliances division has been streamlined, is 
      achieving record annual cost savings this year, and is currently 
      introducing a record number of new products across the world. We thank 
      Terry for his leadership and wish him well. We are grateful he remains a 
      director of the Company.”
    

      David Maura, Chairman of Spectrum Brands, said, “Terry has provided 
      outstanding leadership and service to Spectrum Brands over the past 
      three years, most notably through the many significant operating 
      improvements to our Global Appliances business. Terry has been a 
      business partner and friend of mine for a number of years, and I am very 
      pleased that he will continue to serve on our Board. We all join in 
      wishing Terry the very best in his future business activities.”
    

      Mr. Polistina, 50, was appointed to the Spectrum Brands Board of 
      Directors in August 2009 and named President of Spectrum Brands’ Small 
      Appliances division, upon the closing of the Company’s merger in June

Steve Fraundorfer, who has more than 20 years of manufacturing and operations experience at Spectrum Brands, has been appointed vp/general manager for Global Appliances, which includes responsibility for North American Appliances sales and marketing in addition to his current responsibilities for Global Appliances business operations. Fraundorfer will report to Dave Lumley, CEO of Spectrum Brands Holdings. Andreas Rouvé, President, International, maintains his responsibility for all international Appliances operations and continues to report to Lumley. The Global Appliances management structure was instituted earlier this year in preparation for Polistina’s planned departure from the company.
“Terry has made valuable and significant contributions to our global continuous improvement, supply chain and new product development processes, and to our company’s overall growth and strategic development,” said Lumley. “Under his leadership, we exceeded our initial cost synergy estimates from the acquisition of Russell Hobbs and the subsequent integration of our Home and Remington Personal Care divisions. Our Global Appliances division has been streamlined, is achieving record annual cost savings this year, and is currently introducing a record number of new products across the world. We thank Terry for his leadership and wish him well. We are grateful he remains a director of the company.”
Polistina was appointed to the Spectrum Brands Board of Directors in August 2009 and named president of Spectrum Brands’ Small Appliances division, upon the closing of the company’s merger in June 2010 with Russell Hobbs, Inc.  Prior to joining Spectrum Brands Polistina was CEO of Russell Hobbs. Prior to joining Russell Hobbs, he served as COO of Applica Incorporated from 2006 to 2007 and as Chief Financial Officer from 2001 to 2007. Polistina also served as a senior vp of Applica from 1998 to 2001.
