The Fund
The Fund invests worldwide in companies principally engaged in the discovery, development, production or distribution of products (or services) related to scientific advances in health care, including biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, diagnostics, managed  health care, and medical equipment and supplies.



The Approach
The portfolio managers seek to purchase stocks that are reasonably priced in relation to their fundamental value and that the portfolio managers believe will grow in value over time regardless of short-term market fluctuations. The stock selection proces s is based on numerous factors, including the potential to increase market share (for larger companies), and the potential of research and development projects (for smaller companies). The team is based in Boston and London.



The Features
Growth in the health care sector is led by aging demographics, innovation and rising global incomes. As the global population ages and becomes wealthier, we believe health care spending is likely to continue to rise. Innovation drives growth in the secto r, as increased scientific understanding leads to new breakthroughs.

The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds and exchange-traded funds) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considere d a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding  consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star.The Overall Morningstar Rat ing for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns,  60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most  weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods. Star ratings do not reflect the effect of any applicable sales load.©2017 Morningstar. All  Rights Reserved.

 Insights & Analysis  Commentary
A Word On The Markets as of  Mar 31, 2017
Global equity markets delivered solid gains in the first quarter of 2017 despite a pullback by U.S. stocks late in the period amid dimming prospects for President Donald Trump's pro-business agenda.
U.S. stocks advanced for much of the period, extending the rally that began with President Trump's election in November. Responding to continued economic growth, the U.S. Federal Reserve (the Fed) raised its benchmark interest rate in March and indicated  that further rate hikes would be coming in 2017.Taking the Fed action as a vote of confidence in the U.S. economy, stocks rose following the rate hike. Bank stocks led the advance on expectations that bank earnings would benefit from higher rates. Stron g manufacturing and jobs data also boosted equity markets. During February, the U.S. added 235,000 new jobs, topping forecasts, while the unemployment rate remained steady at 4.7%.
But U.S stocks reversed course after President Trump's health care bill was withdrawn from Congress. The health care failure raised concerns about the prospects for the president's future economic initiatives, including tax reduction and infrastructure s pending. Equities recouped some of the lost ground in the final days of the three-month period.
Globally, signs of economic gains across a broad spectrum of regions encouraged investors during the period. In Asia, rising demand for semiconductors and other electronics boosted growth in the region's export-oriented economies. In Europe, positive eco nomic data and receding political risks helped push stocks higher. Even countries long-mired in recession, such as Russia and Brazil, showed signs of recovery during the period.The MSCI World Index11 finished the quarter up 6.38%, driven by str ong returns across the majority of sectors. Ten of the 11 index sectors posted positive returns for the quarter, led by information technology and healthcare, while energy was the lone negative-performing sector.


Performance Summary 
For the first quarter of 2017, the Worldwide Health Sciences Fund Class A Shares outperformed the MSCI World Healthcare Index (the Index), returning 9.22% at NAV, vs. 8.44% for the Index.

Healthcare is off to a strong start in 2017, with all index sub-industries posting positive returns for the first quarter. The health care sector's positive performance was driven by a number of factors, including strong earnings releases from major heal th care companies, new drug approvals, positive clinical trial results coming out of the biotechnology industry and a stall in the President's health care agenda in Congress.
Health care technology was the best-performing industry, followed by life science tools, and equipment and suppliers. Health care providers and services lagged for the quarter.
Both stock selection and industry positioning relative to the Index were positive influences on Fund performance for the first quarter.
The Fund's overweight to the United States was additive to performance, as the U.S. outperformed much of the world during the quarter. Additionally, the Fund's underweight to Japan and overweight to Belgium aided relative returns.

Contributors 
Positive contributors for the Fund's performance include:

Stock selection was strong for the quarter, most notably in health care equipment and suppliers and pharmaceuticals.
The Fund's relative underweight to health care providers and services, as well as positive stock selection within the industry boosted returns for the quarter.
The top contributor from a stock selection standpoint for the first quarter was Wright Medical Group., a maker of joint implants and bone graft substitutes. The company reported higher-than-expected revenues and investors are optimistic about the company 's robust pipeline.
Within biotech, Incyte Corporation, a biopharma company which focuses on oncology and autoimmune diseases, remained a top-contributor to Fund performance. Vertex Pharmaceuticals was a positive contributor as well, as the company published positive result s for one of its late-stage Cystic Fibrosis drugs.
Additional contributors included health care equipment company Intuitive Surgical Inc. and pharmaceutical companies Eli Lilly and Japanese ophthalmic drug maker Santen Pharmaceuticals.



Detractors 
Negative contributors for the Fund's performance include:

Stock selection within biotechnology was a detractor to the Fund's relative performance, although somewhat offset by the Fund's overweight relative to the  industry.
The Fund's relative performance was also hindered by an underweight to life sciences and tools, as well as negative stock selection for the quarter within the industry.
Stock detractors for the quarter included pharma companies Zoetis Inc., which reported somewhat mixed fourth quarter revenue results, and Bristol-Myers Squibb which had announced in early January news that accelerated approval for their lung cancer drug  would not be sought. Additionally, biotech company Alexion Pharmaceuticals detracted from Fund performance as investors remain cautious on the name after the recent management changes.



Investment Outlook And Fund Positioning 
The overall health care sector has been stuck in a range since mid-2015 after a strong multi-year rally. We think that within the broader sector, specific industries such as pharmaceuticals and biotech are offering value. In fact, both industries are tra ding on the lower end of their historical valuation ranges in terms of price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios.
With the first attempt of the repeal of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) failing, we are watching for either a congressional pivot toward tax reform or one last push to address healthcare reform. As the political spotlight slowly shifts away from healthcare , we can get back to fundamentals.
Within the overall sector, we're looking for innovation. We favor companies that deliver strong returns on capital and companies that have a very solid competitive advantage. Among these companies, there are some amazing things going on right now in rese arch and development (R&D). For the past 30 years, oncology companies have been trying to move away from chemotherapy to develop targeted therapies that go right after tumors. Now, companies like Bristol Myers, Roche and Merck are actually trying to harn ess the human immune system to target tumors. We continue to believe there will always be a market for innovative solutions to the world's health problems.

Portfolio Characteristics 

 
Portfolio Characteristics 



P/B Ratio
The price to book (P/B) value ratio is a fundamental measure used to determine if an investment is valued appropriately. The book value of a company is a measure of how much a company&#39;s assets are worth assuming the company&#39;s debts are paid off. Negative book values are excluded from this calculation and holding price to book ratios over 25 are set to 25.

as of 30-Jun-2017



4.04




P/E Ratio - Forward
The forward price-to-earnings ratio is used to assess a company’s valuation. To compute this ratio, the latest closing price is divided by the company’s consensus mean EPS estimate for the next unreported fiscal year. The ratio represents a weighted harmonic mean of the forward price-to-earnings ratios of its holdings with negative values being excluded from the calculation.

Ratings

 Ratings



Morningstar Rating

Overall Health Sciences Opportunities Fund received a Morningstar Rating of 5 stars for the 3-year period, 5 stars for the 5-year period and 5 stars for the 10-year period, rated against 127, 120 and 98 Health Funds, respectively. Performance results represent past performance and are no guarantee of future results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For each U.S.-domiciled fund with at least a 3-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar RatingTM based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund&#39;s monthly performance (including the effects of sales charges, loads and redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of funds in each category receive five stars, the next 22.5% receive four stars, the next 35% receive three stars, the next 22.5% receive two stars and the bottom 10% receive one star. (Each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages.) The Overall Morningstar Rating for a fund is derived from a weighted-average of the performance figures associated with its 3-, 5- and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Morningstar Ratings are for the share classes cited only; other classes may have different ratings.

Lipper Leader
Lipper Leader Ratings
 


Consistent Return Health Sciences Opportunities Fund received the following Consistent Return ratings for the 3-, 5-, and 10-year periods, respectively: 5 (81 funds), 5 (74 funds), and 5 (60 funds).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lipper ratings for Consistent Return reflect funds&#39; historical risk-adjusted returns, adjusted for volatility, relative to peers.

 


Preservation Health Sciences Opportunities Fund received the following Preservation ratings for the 3-, 5-, and 10-year periods, respectively: 3 (11,916 funds), 4 (10,073 funds), and 5 (6,498 funds).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lipper ratings for Preservation reflect funds&#39; historical loss avoidance relative to other funds within the same asset class. Preservation ratings are relative, rather than absolute, measures, and funds named Lipper Leaders for Preservation may still experience losses periodically; those losses may be larger for equity and mixed equity funds than for fixed income funds.

 


Total Return Health Sciences Opportunities Fund received the following Total Return ratings for the 3-, 5-, and 10-year periods, respectively: 5 (81 funds), 4 (74 funds), and 4 (60 funds).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lipper ratings for Total Return reflect funds&#39; historical total return performance relative to peers.

 


Overall Lipper Leaders ratings based on an equal-weighted average of percentile ranks for each measure over 3-, 5-, and 10-year periods (if applicable) and do not take into account the effects of sales charges for these categories (Consistent Return, Preservation, Total Return, Expense, and Tax Efficiency) as of 30-Apr-2017 out of 81, 11,916, 81, 35 and 81 Funds, respectively in Lipper's Health/Biotech Funds classification.

Important Information

 

Carefully consider the Funds' investment objectives, risk factors, and charges and expenses before investing. This and other information can be found in the Funds' prospectuses or, if available, the summary prospectuses which may be obtained by visiting the iShares Fund and BlackRock Fund prospectus pages. Read the prospectus carefully before investing.


The fund is actively managed and its characteristics will vary.

Stock and bond values fluctuate in price so the value of your investment can go down depending on market conditions.

International investing involves special risks including, but not limited to currency fluctuations, illiquidity and volatility. These risks may be heightened for investments in emerging markets.

The fund may use derivatives to hedge its investments or to seek to enhance returns. Derivatives entail risks relating to liquidity, leverage and credit that may reduce returns and increase volatility.

Investing in small- and mid-cap companies may entail greater risk than large-cap companies, due to shorter operating histories, less seasoned management or lower trading volumes.

Investments in health services industries may be affected by changes in regulations, advancing technological developments and product liability lawsuits. )

Performance may be attributable to unusually high IPO profits. There is no guarantee this level of performance will be repeated. IPO securities have no trading history and the price may be volatile.


Performance results reflect past performance and are no guarantee of future results. Investment return and principal value of shares will fluctuate so that shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. All returns assume reinvestment of all dividends. Performance information shown without sales charge would have been lower if the applicable sales charge had been included. Performance during periods of exceptional market conditions should not be expected to be repeated in a normal market environment. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted. Investing involves risk, including possible loss of principal.Fund details, holdings and characteristics are as of the date noted and subject to change. Yields are based on income earned for the period cited and on the Fund's NAV at the end of the period. Some BlackRock funds make distributions of ordinary income and capital gains at calendar year end. Those distributions temporarily cause extraordinarily high yields. There is no assurance that a fund will repeat that yield in the future. Subsequent monthly distributions that do not include ordinary income or capital gains in the form of dividends will likely be lower.


The Funds are distributed by BlackRock Investments, LLC (together with its affiliates, “BlackRock”).

Morningstar Ratings1


as of 05/31/2017



Overall





3 Year





5 Year





10 Year







				Morningstar rated the Health Sciences Fund among 
127,
127,
120
and 
98
Health
funds for the overall rating and the 3-, 5-, and 10-year periods (as applicable) 
ending 05/31/2017, respectively.


The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance 
figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The 
weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year 
rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating 
for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most 
weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is 
included in all three rating periods.
			

Performance Comparison
as of 
					
						06/30/2017
					
				







							This chart shows the value of a hypothetical $10,000 investment in the fund over the past 10 years or since its inception (for funds lacking 10-year records). The result is compared with benchmarks, which may include a broad-based market index and a peer group average or index. Market indexes do not include expenses, which are deducted from fund returns as well as mutual fund averages and indexes.
						
Benchmark Definitions



1 The Morningstar Rating for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, 
variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at 
least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for 
comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation 
in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent 
performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 
35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating 
for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, 
and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of 
total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% 
five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating 
formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest 
impact because it is included in all three rating periods.

T. Rowe Price mutual funds are subject to ongoing management fees and may be subject to redemption fees. An IRA may be subject to an annual fee, and a fee may be assessed when an IRA is closed. See prospectus for details.

The mutual funds referred to in this website are offered and sold only to persons residing in the United States and are offered by prospectus only. The prospectuses include investment objectives, risks, fees, expenses, and other information that you should read and consider carefully before investing.
Morningstar gives its best ratings of 5 or 4 stars to the top 32.5% of all funds (of the 32.5%, 10% get 5 stars and 22.5% get 4 stars) based on their risk-adjusted returns. The Overall Morningstar Rating™ is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with a fund's 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating™ metrics. As of 5/31/17, 72 of 106 of our rated funds (Investor class only) received an overall rating of 5 or 4 stars.
The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star.

*144 of our 330 mutual funds had a 10-year track record as of 3/31/17 (includes all share classes and excludes funds used in insurance products). 122 of these 144 funds beat their Lipper averages for the 10-year period. 204 of 311 (66%), 175 of 213, 140 of 178 (79%), of T. Rowe Price funds outperformed their Lipper average for the 1-, 3-, and 5-year periods ended 3/31/17, respectively. Calculations are based on cumulative total return. Not all funds outperformed for all periods. (Source for data: Lipper Inc.)
24 of our 39 Retirement Funds had a 10-year track record as of 3/31/17 (includes all share classes). 23 of these 24 funds beat their Lipper averages for the 10-year period. 38 of 39, 35 of 36, and 35 of 36 of the Retirement Funds outperformed their Lipper average for the 1-, 3-, and 5-year periods ended 3/31/17, respectively. Calculations are based on cumulative total return. Not all funds outperformed for all periods. (Source for data: Lipper Inc.)
Source: Lipper Inc. 168 of 213 funds (excluding institutional and bank institutional funds as defined by Lipper) more than 6 months old had expense ratios below their Lipper averages based on fiscal year-end data available as of 3/31/17.
The principal value of the Retirement Funds is not guaranteed at any time, including at or after the target date, which is the approximate year an investor plans to retire (assumed to be age 65) and likely stop making new investments in the fund. If an investor plans to retire significantly earlier or later than age 65, the funds may not be an appropriate investment even if the investor is retiring on or near the target date. The funds’ allocations among a broad range of underlying T. Rowe Price stock and bond funds will change over time. The funds emphasize potential capital appreciation during the early phases of retirement asset accumulation, balance the need for appreciation with the need for income as retirement approaches, and focus on supporting an income stream over a long-term postretirement withdrawal horizon. The funds are not designed for a lump-sum redemption at the target date and do not guarantee a particular level of income. The funds maintain a substantial allocation to equities both prior to and after the target date, which can result in greater volatility over shorter time horizons.

T. Rowe Price mutual funds are subject to ongoing management fees and may be subject to redemption fees. An IRA may be subject to an annual fee, and a fee may be assessed when an IRA is closed. See prospectus for details. 
Past performance cannot guarantee future results. All mutual funds are subject to market risk, including possible loss of principal. Diversification cannot assure a profit or protect against loss in a declining market.
Based on cumulative total return, 174 of 232 (75%), 142 of 160 (89%), 115 of 127 (91%), and 105 of 114 (92%) T. Rowe Price stock funds (including all share classes and excluding funds used in insurance products) outperformed their Lipper averages for the 1-, 3-, 5-, and 10-year periods ended 6/30/17, respectively. Not all funds outperformed for all periods. (Source for data: Lipper Inc.)

1Source: Lipper Inc. 162 of 213 funds (excluding institutional and bank institutional funds as defined by Lipper) more than 6 months old had expense ratios below their Lipper averages based on fiscal year-end data available as of 6/30/17.
*The principal value of the Retirement Funds and Target Funds (collectively, the "target date funds") is not guaranteed at any time, including at or after the target date, which is the approximate year an investor plans to retire (assumed to be age 65) and likely stop making new investments in the fund. If an investor plans to retire significantly earlier or later than age 65, the funds may not be an appropriate investment even if the investor is retiring on or near the target date. The target date funds' allocations among a broad range of underlying T. Rowe Price stock and bond funds will change over time. The Retirement Funds emphasize potential capital appreciation during the early phases of retirement asset accumulation, balance the need for appreciation with the need for income as retirement approaches, and focus on supporting an income stream over a long-term retirement withdrawal horizon. The Target Funds emphasize asset accumulation prior to retirement, balance the need for reduced market risk and income as retirement approaches, and focus on supporting an income stream over a moderate postretirement withdrawal horizon. The target date funds are not designed for a lump-sum redemption at the target date and do not guarantee a particular level of income. The key difference between the Retirement Funds and the Target Funds is the overall allocation to equity; although they each maintain significant allocations to equities both prior to and after the target date, the Retirement Funds maintain a higher equity allocation, which can result in greater volatility over shorter time horizons.
