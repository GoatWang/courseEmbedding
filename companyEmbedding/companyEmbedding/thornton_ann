        floss for every possibility
        


        Posted by Pauleg07@gmail.com on 30th May 2017
    
the perfect product for the job



        Great for implants
        


        Posted by Unknown on 9th Mar 2017
    
I knew what I was ordering. This floss is great for all the implants I have. Great delivery, too.
Thanks Amazon for continuing to have wonderful vendors!




        Nice but, could be better
        


        Posted by Kurt Hertel on 24th Jun 2016
    
I have been using these for 11 years due to implants and bridges. My dentist recommended them and I have liked the idea of not having to use a leader loop to pass the floss under the appliance. I usually get the 10 pkg. The last batch I received seemed to be constructed of poorer quality than the previous (12 or so) batches. The blue coating used to stiffen the leader ends seemed to be less thick allowing the ends to bend with very little resistance and as a result I had to resort to the loop leader. The whole idea, for me, was to eliminate this step. After finishing the first of my 10 boxes last week I can report that the issue I've had seems to have been corrected. Perhaps I just got a poor batch. All in all a great idea and a good product.



        Tried them all!
        


        Posted by Unknown on 5th Feb 2016
    
I have a 4 post full upper implant that is difficult to clean. I have tried every product on the market. This threader/floss combo is by far the best. Please improve the packaging. Mine are in a snack bag.



        Best implant - bridge floss
        


        Posted by Unknown on 15th Mar 2015
    
This is the best and is well worth the price.



        cleanest by far
        


        Posted by Hope Eknoian on 1st Mar 2015
    
I have used these for a few years and they are great.  If ONLY they could find a better way of packing.  Pulling one out, and they all follow.  I undo the whole thing and get them all together and put a bread wrapper clip and then just have to pull one and get ONE! Takes up a lot of room, but so much easier. Also great foe cleaning hearing aids!!!! Just the right size to be tight!!!!



        Great Item
        


        Posted by Roger on 7th Jan 2015
    
I learned of these from my dentist and found they work GREAT. Now I keep a couple extra packs on hand at all times.



        BEST OF FLOSSES
        


        Posted by SIS on 14th Dec 2014
    
I mentioned to my hygienist last time there that seems the super flosses are not as thick as they used to be. She gave me a pkg. of these flosses to try. I found these are exactly what I need to get the job done right. I have several permanent bridges and some implants. So happy now!!



        Great Product
        


        Posted by Mary N on 4th Dec 2014
    
The product is great as well as the company and service.

        Best Implant Floss Ever!!
        


        Posted by Judy on 8th May 2012
    
I used to buy this at CVS, but am unable to find this product recently.  I am a 'constant flosser', as I have too much $$$ invested in my mouth.  This is the BEST I've found!!

In 2007 the company had fallen behind on their federal employment taxes exceeding $1M. In 2008-2009 I had a surgery that went awry and spent 43 days in ICU and had 18 follow-up surgeries. During this time the company had convinced the IRS to hold me as a liable party for over $500,000 in back taxes for the company debt. I never had an opportunity to even appeal the case due to my health. I had obtained legal counsel to appeal this case in 2010 and was told there was nothing that could be done. After spending $4,000 in legal fees, I still remained a liable party. We were at a dead end and did not know what we were going to do. My wife and I came home one evening only to find a packet from the IRS threatening to garnish our wages for a debt that was not even ours. I immediately submitted an on-line request to Victory Tax Solutions. I thought due to the late hour I would not receive a call until the next day. To my surprise, I received a call from Erick Finkiewicz immediately. From that moment Victory gave us a true peace knowing they were taking care of this matter for us. Within a couple days Victory started working on our case and I started working with one of Victory’s attorney’s, Heather Gosnick. Heather started working with the IRS case worker immediately and started the appeal process. From the time I initially contacted Victory both Heather and Erick were there each step of the way, regardless of the hour or day. After a few short months, it was determined that I was NOT a liable party . It was such a blessing to my wife and me to know that we would no longer have to worry about paying $500,000 and we could finally move on with our life. We could not have done this without Victory, Heather or Erick. They by far are the most impressive group of professionals we have ever had the pleasure of working with. They saved us from declaring bankruptcy and allowed us to have our life back. We will always be grateful for what they have done for us. We thank the Victory team and thank God for leading us to Victory!

I had fallen ill and unable to work all that time. Over the years I received letters in the mail from different tax solution companies but could not act on them since I was unemployed. I finally did call one when I knew I was going to get a job but the man who took my call was not very professional and did not seem to care about my situation. By God's grace a week later, once employed, I heard an advertisement over the radio on my way home from church. I quickly put the number in my phone and called them on that Monday. I received the most polite person, Terrance, who made me feel I could get through this situation with no problem. I told him I had just started working only two weeks and was trying to be proactive in getting in front of my tax situation by calling them to see what they could do to help me. Terrance assured me they would be able to help and would be willing to work around my just getting started with my first check. The company Victory Tax Solutions allowed me to make two installments to get started. All the paperwork was submitted to me to sign within days of my first installment so they could get started working on my case. After the second payment, Terrance gave me a call the very next business day along with an attorney and explained to me how my case would go and what I could expect. I have $20,000 in tax debt between the two agencies and Victory Tax Solutions will be able to bring that to ZERO!!!! I am so grateful that I heard their advertisement and took the time to call. They have been on top of every thing since I contacted them a month ago. I am also impressed in how quickly they processed my case. If it hadn't been for me getting paid every two weeks I would have seen results in a matter of weeks. Thank you Victory Tax Solutions for all your hard work and for caring for those of us who are trying to get our lives back on track.Victory Tax SolutionsRichard S. ratedI received a lock-in letter from the IRS and if it would have been implemented, it would have created a huge hardship on me and my family. I can honestly say, it was one of the most stressful situations I've experienced. I knew that I had to do something, but didn't have the know how on how to dispute this. Furthermore, my past experiences with trying to work with the IRS have not been successful. So, I looked online and came across Victory Tax Solutions. I first talked to Matt who was very helpful in gathering up my information and explaining to me what to expect and the pricing. After my information was gathered, I was then told I would be working with their attorney Lyle. I wasn't sure what to expect because I've never really had any good experiences with attorneys. I've always found them to be easily annoyed with questions. Not the case with Lyle. He went above and beyond in making sure I understood exactly what was going on and made sure he answered all my questions. Lyle explained to me what was going to happen and the estimated time frame. I received some further calls, clarifying some information. He even sent a few emails along the way explaining the current progress. And to my surprise, even the emails were very detailed. In less than two weeks, Lyle was able to fix the issue with the lock-in letter, and then renegotiated a better payment plan and put in for a waiver of some penalties on my behalf. I do have to say, at first I was a little hesitant due to the price. But, it was less than other attorneys and far less than what it would have cost me in the long run, (and the short term for that matter). The IRS is not an easy group to deal with on your own. I cannot recommend VTS enough to anyone experiencing any issues with the IRS. Lyle and Matt exceeded my expectations. Their communication and the outcome of their work could not have been any better. If you are having any issues with the IRS, do yourself a favor and hand off that stress to Victory.Victory Tax SolutionsKenneth A. ratedDon't know what we would have done without the outstanding expertise of Jeff & Erick from Victory Tax Solutions.Where to begin, I was in a total mess not knowing where to go or what to do. I investigated Tax Solution Companies and was very impressed with Victory Tax Solutions. From the beginning contact my girlfriend & I had with Atty. Jeff Murray & Erick Finkiewicz, we found much relief. I am a trucker and not always readily available to talk on the phone. Jeff & Erick graciously communicated with me & my girlfriend to keep contact open. We felt very confident that Jeff & Erick truly cared about "us" as individuals and not only my problem. Jeff & Erick always greeted us with a positive approach & response which was much needed on our end as we were stressed to the max about the situation! Jeff & Erick always explained & re-explained details as we went along the road to the final settlement. They showed us patience but kept us determined to see this through. Can't express enough how both Jeff & Erick make this road trip so much less stressful for us. They saved us approximately $433,000 with their expertise and knowledge of handling situations like mine. Both guys were definitely a Godsend to us. With the loss of a son & health issues surrounding us, we truly needed a direct knowledgeable hand to lead us through this. We thank Jeff & Erick tremendously for helping us. We were blessed to have Jeff & Erick on our side! We recommend Victory Tax Solutions with fullest respect to the employees of this Company. This Company has the most courteous, knowledgeable, compassionate employees to help you with your tax problems. Put your tax problems in their hands and you will be quite pleased with the outcome! We truly appreciate all Jeff & Erick have done and know for sure we could not have done it without their help!!! THANK YOU JEFF & ERICK WITH HEARTFELT APPRECIATION!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Victory Tax SolutionsJose G. ratedVTS and Jennifer Long are the real deal !My nightmare began in the summer of 2012, I received an IRS notice that I owed over $70,000 in back taxes. Needless to say that a notice like that gives you a new perspective on the exact location of your rear end. I entrusted my tax return to that H&R somebody and ended up with an IRS dilemma. After going back and forth with the H&R people I decided it was more important to take care of the IRS problem and then deal with the incompetence of my tax preparer. That night I spent several hours on the inter-web and found VTS and Erick Finkiewicz. Immediately he assured me that in some way shape or form this issue would get resolved, that night I felt a bit of relief and was able to sleep without that heavy burden of taking on the IRS by myself. VTS gave my case to Jennifer Long, ( words cannot be put in this review that can measure the gratitude that I owe to this person that I only know by phone calls and E-mails ), Jennifer took my case, explained to me the situation that I was in, and how we were going to get resolution with it. I'm not going to tell you that things were resolved over night because they weren't, but Jennifer kept me abreast of everything the whole time. Finally in May of this year I received resolution in my case. I could not be any happier with the outcome that VTS and Jennifer Long got for me. VTS is located in Ann Arbor, MI. and I'm in Miami Fl. but it always felt like they were right up the street from me, all my phone calls and E-Mails were always answered expeditiously. I recommend this company to anyone who is looking for professionals to deal with a serious problem with the precision of a surgeon. THANK YOU VICTORY TAX SOLUTIONS AND A WARM HEART FELT THANK YOU TO JENNIFER LONG !!!!!! (yes I'm yelling). Victory Tax SolutionsCarrol E. ratedVictory Tax Solution Rocks!We had gotten into a situation with our taxes. We had made payment arrangements with the I.R.S. . We were late one month and they sent us a very upsetting letter, seems because we had been late ,that would cancel out our contract to make the payments and they wanted all the money now. Not knowing what to do , but knowing we needed help, my husband went through the yellow pages of the phone book and found Victory Tax solutions. He called and we talked with Erick. He was so nice and helpful and got us back on good terms with the I.R.S. . Our story doesn't end there. Erick would call us every once in a while to make sure every thing was okay, offered us help and guidance if we needed it. I was really glad when he called a few months ago because things had really changed. My husband ended up in the hospital and the Doctor said he needed to apply for disability because his health was so bad he could no longer work. Worried about how we would pay all the bills but especially the tax agreement. I asked Erick how we could get our payments lowered... he took care of every thing. he got us a lawyer who contacted the I. R.S. and because of our situation we don't have to make payments. We will still owe and if things change, will pay what we owe...but for now they won't be harassing us. I was skeptical when my husband first called Victory Tax Solution, but I am so glad he did. No way could we have handled this without help . I would recommend this company to anyone having tax problems..and when you call ask for Erick..he'll get you what you need and put your mind at ease. Thanks Erick and everyone else from Victory Tax Solutions. Carol & Michael - From KansasVictory Tax SolutionsTammy T. ratedIf you want the Victory over your Tax Problems then Victory Tax Solutions is the ANSWER.My husband and I was so far behind in our taxes from year 2008-2013 and we always tried to call the I.R.S. to make some type of Installment agreement with them they kept giving us the run arounds and different payment amounts and each week we would receive a letter in the mail from the I.R.S. stating that they were going to put a Levy and put a garnishment on all of my husbands assets even after making a Installment agreement with the I.R.S. for $275 a month with oweing $32,000.00 to the I.R.S. So one evening my husband and I started looking through the Yellow Book Pages and we found Victory Tax Solutions and called but at that time no one was in the office the office had closed for the day so I left a message on their answering machine. Mrs. Starla Finkiewics took the time to call me right back even while she was on vacation within 10 minutes and she took my information over the phone and ask me a few questions and the very next day I received a fax with all my paperwork to sign and I immediately faxed everything back and from there they got the ball rolling. Victory Tax Solutions has the best lowest fees and yes they are willing to work with you. My husband and I monthly Installment fees with the I.R.S. is now only $50 a month with only oweing the I.R.S. $21,000.00 Wow Thanks Victory Tax Solutions and all the staff members. Starla Finkiewicz, Jeff Murry and Martha. They are all wonderful.Victory Tax SolutionsVirgilio B. ratedI recommend this company to anyone, and I will be returning to have my taxes done by this company every year from now on. Victory Tax Solutions provided me with amazing (EMPHASIS AMAZING) service. When I called Victory, half of my paychecks were being garnished by the State of California, and the IRS was coming for me soon after for 3 years of back taxes. Victory truly found me a solution with payments plans that were more than accommodating to me, especially since I had a new baby on the way and money was super tight. Victory Tax Solutions had the garnishments on my paychecks released within a week or two of submitting my first payment beginning my case. Also, they worked mostly with my fiance, which was much appreciated since my work schedule is so hectic. Victory was always sure to update her regularly with the status of things, and would even call every few weeks just to ask how we were doing. In the end, they deal that Victory worked out for me with the State of California and the IRS totally fit my budget and I now have a renewed sense of comfort in knowing that I will have all of my back taxes repaid in a few years and my family won't suffer from it; and I never had to call the collectors and sit on hold not once. Thank you Steve, Starla and Heather at Victory Tax Solutions for all of your help!!Victory Tax SolutionsCharles B. ratedI am writing this letter to express my sincere appreciation of the efforts that Victory Tax Solution displayed during my recent audit from the IRS. More precisely, I would like to personally relay my sincerest appreciation to Heather Gosnick (Tax Attorney) and Steven Hook (Senior Settlement Officer). From my very first encounter, they demonstrated full confidence on how to proceed, were very clear on timelines and expectations, were very thorough with explanations and provide ample feedback during the entire process.  I was extremely , apprehensive at first, utilizing a company that was not available locally, however, I found that the phone conversations and internet exchanges provided a sufficient client forum. The atmosphere was quite professional, comprehensive and relaxing. In summary, my case was settled with the IRS in my favor from a claim that I owe in excess of 100K in back taxes to receiving an IRS tax return for the year in question. Although I hope not to required your services again, I would not hesitate to use or recommend your agency to anyone that has an issue with any taxes in any State.  Sincerely,  CB (Florida)Did You Know?Types of AttorneysThe legal profession is vast, with each attorney having his or her specialties. Here are some of the most common attorneys individuals seek out when they require legal aid:Criminal Lawyer
A criminal defense lawyer is probably the attorney the average person imagines. Criminal attorneys are the men and women who defend individuals accused of a crime. The lawyer may work pro bono - for the public good - so the accused is certain to have representation, even if he or she cannot afford an attorney.Criminal lawyers are experts in the criminal justice system. They help their clients decide how to plead when first charged by the police and guide them through trial procedures. Defense lawyers must use every bit of their knowledge and resources to get their clients the fairest results from criminal proceedings.Business Lawyer
If you are a small business owner or the head of a larger corporation, you may come into contact with a business lawyer. Many big companies keep a legal staff on payroll to deal with the daily operations of running and maintaining a large enterprise. Business lawyers may have more specific specialties like copyright law, product liability and mergers and acquisitions.Business attorneys may focus their practices on certain industries. There are entertainment lawyers to guide artists through royalties and media contracts, while hospitals employ malpractice attorneys to protect doctors from aggressive litigation.Employment Lawyer
When you work for a company, you may find yourself in need of an employment lawyer - especially if the relationship between you and your employer sours. An employment attorney prevents people from losing their jobs due to unfair reasons. Workers' compensation lawyers help maintain safe employment conditions and ensure workers receive fair compensation after workplace injury or discrimination.Finance Lawyer
A personal finance attorney can protect and manage your investments and securities. You may use a finance lawyer to help you prepare your taxes, but you might be better off working with an accountant. A tax attorney is more commonly contacted after a business or individual runs into trouble with the IRS or state regulators.Real Estate Lawyer
Your family may keep a lawyer on retainer to guide you through the major expenses that come up in life. When buying a home, you could work with a real estate lawyer to make sure you get the best deal and won't get taken advantage of by tricky mortgage agreements or unfair landlords. An estate attorney can help you plan for the worst by creating a will and preparing your finances for after your death.Bankruptcy Lawyer
A bankruptcy lawyer is essential to help you resolve your financial difficulties when they start to spin out of control. Certain attorneys help create strategies to bring you out of debt and speak to your creditors. A lawyer can advise you on which type of bankruptcy you should file for.Civil Lawyer
If you are suing someone or being sued, you need a civil lawyer. Civil attorneys - and criminal lawyers - are the legal representatives who argue on your behalf in a courtroom setting. Civil lawyers may represent you on matters of business, finance or a wide variety of other specialized needs.One of the most common types of civil attorneys is a personal injury lawyer. When you're hurt by an outside party and you would like to hold them legally responsible, a personal injury attorney conducts litigation and negotiates settlements to compensate for your pain and suffering. Sometimes many wronged people will join together with a single civil lawyer or law office to form a class action lawsuit.Family/Divorce Lawyer
Most people will turn to a lawyer during a divorce to navigate the emotionally charged legal proceedings. A divorce attorney can assist in determining grounds for separation, division of property and custody of children.Family attorneys deal with much more personal matters. If you're getting married, a family lawyer can help you prepare a prenuptial agreement or other family planning paperwork such as adoption or inheritance documents.Questions One Should Ask a Lawyer Before Hiring ThemTo ensure you find a competent attorney who won't abuse your trust or drain your finances, you have to make the proper inquiries. There are several questions you should ask, but the majority will fall under three general topics:Training and Experience Questions
One of the best ways to determine quality is to examine an attorney's history. When you first step into a lawyer's office, you should check for the appropriate certifications and diplomas. You have to ask how long he or she has practiced law and request information that demonstrates the practice's success. Look for precise details such as percentage of cases settled out of court.Once you inquire about the broad details of their legal career, you should ask questions about their experience that pertains to your specific issue. You should ask how many similar cases they have handled and if they have special skills or training that applies specifically to your needs. Lawyers can't mention clients by name, but you should ask for basic details about identical past cases.Financial Questions
You need to ask about every possible fee that will come up when working with an attorney. You should request a list of all costs in advance so you won't be surprised by additional expenses like overhead. Also determine exactly when you will start being billed. You want to inspect paperwork carefully. If the attorney charges you for his or her experience, you need to make sure he or she will perform tasks personally and not hand it off to an assistant.Find out if the attorney has a flat fee or charges by the hour. Many civil lawyers work on contingency. Whatever the payment plan, make inquiries about how the lawyer plans to provide service for your money and what you can do if you start to feel unsatisfied with his or her performance.Lawyer/Client Relationship Questions
When you hire a lawyer, you're agreeing to work with someone over a certain period of time. You need to ask questions about how the attorney will communicate with you and what responsibilities you hold in the relationship. The attorney should let you know the best channel for quick communication and you need to inform him or her when you want updates.You should also ask questions to get to know the attorney as an individual in order to ensure this is a person you can trust. Ask about their legal philosophy and how he or she views the lawyer/client relationship. Great questions to start off with are ones that will make your life easier, such as how to keep fees down or what daily disruptions you should expect from a long legal battle. The more forthcoming the lawyer appears to be with individual needs, the better.Top Reasons to Hire a LawyerYou may keep a lawyer on retainer or you could turn to an attorney during specific situations. Here are some common reasons people begin seeking legal representation or advice:You Know Your Limitations
If you sign documents and you come across a word you don't recognize, you need assistance. You may need a third party to help you navigate important employment or real estate paperwork.
