Fleetmatics Appoints Former Intuit Senior Executive Jill Ward as President and COO





Dublin, Ireland and Boston, Massachusetts – April 7, 2015 – Fleetmatics Group PLC (NYSE: FLTX), a leading global provider of mobile workforce solutions for service-based businesses of all sizes delivered as software-as-a-service (SaaS), today announced the appointment of Jill Ward to the position of President and Chief Operating Officer effective immediately.  In this role, Ms. Ward will be responsible for leading the Company’s global sales and marketing, product strategy and development, customer support, operations, and IT.  She reports to Jim Travers, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.

“Speaking on behalf of the entire Board of Directors, we are delighted to welcome Jill to the team,” stated Jim Travers, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Fleetmatics.  “Her executive leadership and operating experience with SMB and enterprise customers, and scaling businesses and product sets that serve them, make her highly qualified to help lead the Company through its next stage of growth.”

Most recently, Ms. Ward was Senior Vice President and General Manager at Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ: INTU), a global provider of SaaS offerings for small businesses and consumers. She led the Accountant and Advisor Group, serving accounting professionals who are pivotal to Intuit’s success with SMBs on a global scale. Throughout her twelve year career at Intuit, she led multiple business units to deliver growth through business management solutions for SMBs and enterprise clients. 

Prior to joining Intuit in 2001, Ms. Ward was president of CRM outsourcer Telespectrum Customer Care, held senior small business and consumer marketing positions at Fidelity Investments, and led strategy consulting teams at global consultancy Bain & Company.   She earned an MBA at the Amos Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth College and a BA at Wellesley College. 

“I am excited to be joining the Fleetmatics team, as we see a large underpenetrated global market opportunity,” said Jill Ward, President and Chief Operating Officer.  “I believe Fleetmatics has the right combination of customer intimacy, product innovation, and business intelligence to continue its strong track record of global expansion and growth.”
