Your Personal Mortgage Bank.
Carlyle Financial is a California-based mortgage bank with a commitment to clear and simple home loan solutions. As a direct lender, we offer extensive mortgage options in a single place including jumbo home loans, ARMs, and interest-only mortgages.












Expanding your portfolio?
Minimize risk and maximize cash flow on your residential and commercial investments. We provide several lending options to assist you with expanding your portfolio. Our mortgage bankers are well-versed in the areas of multifamily and non-residential investment lending.
We provide a full range of lending products and services including interest-only payments, cash-out refinances, and corporate entity vesting.

Is FHA Financing right for you?
We are an approved Federal Housing Administration lender. Conventional loans generally require a 20 percent down payment of the purchase price, however, borrowers who choose FHA Financing can put down as little as 3.5 percent. Ideal for borrowers with limited credit history as FHA loans allow the use of non-traditional items - such as utilities and mobile phone accounts - in place of standard credit accounts typically required for home loans.
We provide you with an extensive suite of jumbo and super‑jumbo loan options for purchasing a home or investing in new property. Our experienced mortgage bankers find you the best rates and terms available.
Learn More




Need an interest-only Jumbo ARM?
Choose from a wide variety of rates and terms, including interest‑only payments and fixed or adjustable‑rate programs. We offer an extensive suite of jumbo and super‑jumbo loan options tailored to your needs. Our jumbo loans can also be used to purchase a second home or investment property.
We underwrite and fund our own jumbo home loans to save you time and prevent the headaches that come with using an outside lender.

I recently closed on my first home working with Jesse Collins at Carlyle Financial. 
As a first-time homeowner with ZERO knowledge, Jesse made my home-buying experience completely easy and stress-free! He was incredibly responsive and knowledgeable, gave great advice, and explained everything in such clear terms.
Jesse really went above and beyond to make things convenient and comfortable for me -- the entire process went perfectly smooth from start to finish, and he secured me a great rate.
I'd highly recommend him to anyone!

Jumbo Mortgages












Where other lenders can only offer limited choices, Carlyle Financial provides an extensive suite of jumbo and super‑jumbo loan options. You can choose from a wide variety of rates and terms, including interest‑only payments and fixed or adjustable‑rate programs

 





Jumbo Mortgages




Interest-only payments can be an attractive and useful option among jumbo home loans. The rate is fixed for a period of 5, 7 or 10 years when clients can choose to pay only interest on the principal balance. After that time, the mortgage payment changes to a traditional amortized structure over the remainder of the term.
An interest-only mortgage can be beneficial:

When you want to use the money saved for other investments.
When you plan to be in the home for only a short period of time.
When you earn a sizable bonus or income from commissions and want the ability to make larger, irregular payments to cut down on principal faster.
When you prefer to keep monthly payments low for a period of time.
When there is already substantial equity in the property.


 





Jumbo Home Loans – An Overview




Jumbo home loans are mortgages that are above the conforming lending limit (currently $417,000 and up to $625,500 for high-balance conforming), or that might not meet conventional lending guidelines.
Jumbo home loans are often requested by our clients in higher-priced real estate markets such as Los Angeles and San Francisco. Our staff has extensive experience in structuring and closing jumbo mortgages, while still providing you with the highest levels of service you won’t find elsewhere.
What makes us the leaders in jumbo lending: 

As a mortgage bank, we underwrite and fund our own jumbo home loans to save you time and prevent the headaches that come with using an outside lender.
We provide flexible and competitive jumbo home loan packages with fixed or adjustable-rate products, as well as interest-only payment options.
Our jumbo loans can also be used to purchase a second home or investment property.

Robert and the Carlyle Financial team make the financing process understandable. They help you overcome any issues, they explain what's going on, they are very patient throughout the whole process. They truly are on your team. I was amazed at how smart, diligent, friendly, creative and dedicated Robert and his team are. They are committed to helping you and getting a deal done.

 Investment Approach
Carlyle relies on its industry expertise, extensive footprint and management know-how to identify investment opportunities. Collectively, the Global Financial Services Buyout team has more than 100 years of experience across all sectors of the financial services industry, providing strong historical knowledge, working relationships with key financial services players and deep expertise to guide our investment choices.
Currently, the U.S. financial services sector is experiencing a sharp downturn, which began in the summer of 2007. Industry valuations generally reflect this stress, having declined 20-80% across various sub-sectors since summer 2007 with multiple sub-sectors trading at discounts to book value. Based on past cycles and considering the unique characteristics of the current crisis, Carlyle believes that many financial services firms will need to raise equity capital to shore up their balance sheets and restore confidence in the marketplace. Given the scope and scale of the current distress, Carlyle believes that even established companies with proven business models and brands are likely to seek fresh capital at depressed prices.
The Global Financial Services Buyout team’s approach to investing comprises the following major principles.
Industry Specialization: Since its inception, Carlyle has adopted an industry-focused approach to investing. We believe in-depth knowledge of specific industries improves our ability to source and create deals, conduct effective due diligence, develop strong relationships with management teams and identify potential buyers as part of a coherent exit strategy.
Consistent and Disciplined: A consistent and disciplined investment philosophy produces the highest consistent returns. We seek to make sound investments in good companies with strong management teams and structure our transactions with appropriate amounts of debt.
Influence and Strategic Partnering: We draw on existing relationships as well as forging new ones to bring the most value to the investment – be it during the due diligence phase or in advising portfolio companies in ongoing operations.
The Carlyle Edge: We pursue investments only if we believe we have an edge over our competition in the form of deep industry knowledge, extensive expertise, positive relationships with management teams, the ability to move quickly to commit to transactions, and/or the opportunity to participate in strategic joint ventures with corporate partners.

testimonials 





																	Tony Curneen															
Finance Director
Heating Plumbing Supplies Limited
We conduct business with Kent Carlyle Wealth Management because the service levels are of the highest standard. Advice is readily available at all times and queries are dealt with swiftly and efficiently.

The staff are friendly and at the same time professional – we get good value for our money.







																	Anne Vial															
Private Client
Norwich
I was initially quite reluctant to appoint a financial adviser. However, now I wouldn’t have it any other way. Why not employ someone to advise you on what is probably one of the most important elements of life, your financial future.

I have been very happy with the advice I have received, although I can’t profess to understand all the intricacies, it has certainly worked for me.

The money I have accumulated over the years is important to me and I have the knowledge that it is being invested in the best way possible for me and my future.







																	Luke & Louise Stevenson															
Restaurant Owners
Norwich
We were delighted with the service we received from Kent Carlyle Wealth Management. Our adviser is clearly highly knowledgeable and we felt that we were making all the right decisions, with his extensive experience and expertise.

Everyone at Kent Carlyle Wealth Management is also very friendly and accommodating. Our adviser was happy to meet us at unusual hours (running a restaurant meant that we were not always able to meet him during traditional business hours) and nothing was too much trouble.

We wouldn’t hesitate to recommend their services.







																	Melissa Powell															
Private Client
Norwich
I reviewed my pension arrangements with my adviser a couple of years ago and my aim was to increase the value of my funds. I have been totally overwhelmed by the outcome and I am now on target to achieving a satisfactory retirement fund.

I am a very happy client and will be continuing to take his advice and will be happy to recommend Kent Carlyle Wealth Management to friends and colleagues.







																	Sarah De Chair															
Private Client
Norwich
Whilst working for the Royal Norfolk Agricultural Association, Kent Carlyle Wealth Management undertook the role as our pensions adviser to all the staff. Our adviser visited us each year and interviewed every member of staff individually, discussing what they wished to achieve with their pension and advising the best way for them to invest.

He was very approachable and the staff felt able to ask questions if they did not fully understand what they were signing up to. This meeting was followed up with a written review.

Since retiring I have continued to use Kent Carlyle Wealth Management who are again giving excellent advice under totally different circumstances.







																	Carol Gowen															
Owner
Broadland Book-keeping and Accountancy Services
Broadland Book-keeping and Accountancy Services appointed Kent Carlyle Wealth Management to undertake setting up workplace pensions for some of my clients.

I have found the company to be very professional, friendly and patient in answering all my questions. The company also followed this through when dealing with my clients.

I would not hesitate to recommend them to deal with any financial affairs.







																	Raymond Capps															
Private Client
Norwich
I have been a client of Kent Carlyle Wealth Management for many years and have always found them exemplary in handling my affairs. What started out as just somewhere to pool my finances and get some pension advice has grown into a sound relationship.

They have helped to grow and safeguard my investments for my retirement and, now that time has arrived, they continue to advise and help me in getting the best from my investments.

I can honestly say that whether you are just an individual, or a business, Kent Carlyle Wealth Management will give you great service and work tirelessly to fulfill your expectations.







																	Mike & Jo Smith															
Private Clients
Norwich
The advice we have been given over the years and that is a lot, has always been very helpful.

We are told exactly what the product is and how it works with benefit and any down sides fully explained.

All staff are extremely polite, helpful and explain things in a way we understand.







																	Rob Ward															
Private Client
Norwich
Up until now my career had included working for companies with whom organising my pension had involved ticking a box and signing a form, it all just happened and I was happy not to worry about the details.

Now I find myself working in a small offshoot of an American company with an HR department not at all used to UK systems and I needed to set up my own pension plan.

I’m not a financial expert and Kent Carlyle Wealth Management took me through the process in a way that gave me confidence that I was getting exactly what I needed (both for myself and for my family) whilst also being in complete control of the process.

The level of service and advice to both myself and my employer was first class.







																	Maureen Giner															
Private Client
Norwich
40 + year’s connection with predecessor company and have always really appreciated the personal attention and advice received. Fully confident that the team will continue to provide a thoroughly professional service with a human touch.

Your Personal Mortgage Bank.
Carlyle Financial is a California-based mortgage bank with a commitment to clear and simple home loan solutions. As a direct lender, we offer extensive mortgage options in a single place including jumbo home loans, ARMs, and interest-only mortgages.












Expanding your portfolio?
Minimize risk and maximize cash flow on your residential and commercial investments. We provide several lending options to assist you with expanding your portfolio. Our mortgage bankers are well-versed in the areas of multifamily and non-residential investment lending.
We provide a full range of lending products and services including interest-only payments, cash-out refinances, and corporate entity vesting.
Learn More




Is FHA Financing right for you?
We are an approved Federal Housing Administration lender. Conventional loans generally require a 20 percent down payment of the purchase price, however, borrowers who choose FHA Financing can put down as little as 3.5 percent. Ideal for borrowers with limited credit history as FHA loans allow the use of non-traditional items - such as utilities and mobile phone accounts - in place of standard credit accounts typically required for home loans.
We provide you with an extensive suite of jumbo and super‑jumbo loan options for purchasing a home or investing in new property. Our experienced mortgage bankers find you the best rates and terms available.
Learn More




Need an interest-only Jumbo ARM?
Choose from a wide variety of rates and terms, including interest‑only payments and fixed or adjustable‑rate programs. We offer an extensive suite of jumbo and super‑jumbo loan options tailored to your needs. Our jumbo loans can also be used to purchase a second home or investment property.
We underwrite and fund our own jumbo home loans to save you time and prevent the headaches that come with using an outside lender.

I recently closed on my first home working with Jesse Collins at Carlyle Financial. 
As a first-time homeowner with ZERO knowledge, Jesse made my home-buying experience completely easy and stress-free! He was incredibly responsive and knowledgeable, gave great advice, and explained everything in such clear terms.
Jesse really went above and beyond to make things convenient and comfortable for me -- the entire process went perfectly smooth from start to finish, and he secured me a great rate.
I'd highly recommend him to anyone!

Robert and all the staff were extremely polite and efficient. The eSigning and document uploading processes made everything very easy and secure, and Robert really knows his jumbo loan products. Carlyle Financial has earned another new loyal customer!

Jesse Collins provided me with a very detailed breakdown with many options and financial scenarios over e-mail. We were able to meet in person the following week to go over these in further detail. I had a million questions and he was able to go through them one by one, going over pros and cons. Great Service and Knowledge. Well recommended.
