FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION
Granting of Request for Early
Termination of the Waiting Period
Under the Premerger Notification
Rules
Section 7A of the Clayton Act, 15
U.S.C. § 18a, as added by Title II of the

Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust
Improvements Act of 1976, requires
persons contemplating certain mergers
or acquisitions to give the Federal Trade
Commission and the Assistant Attorney
General advance notice and to wait
designated periods before
consummation of such plans. Section
7A(b)(2) of the Act permits the agencies,
in individual cases, to terminate this
waiting period prior to its expiration
and requires that notice of this action be
published in the Federal Register.
The following transactions were
granted early termination—on the dates
indicated—of the waiting period
provided by law and the premerger
notification rules. The listing for each
transaction includes the transaction
number and the parties to the
transaction. The grants were made by
the Federal Trade Commission and the
Assistant Attorney General for the
Antitrust Division of the Department of
Justice. Neither agency intends to take
any action with respect to these
proposed acquisitions during the
applicable waiting period.

FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION


Granting of Request for Early Termination of the Waiting Period 
Under the Premerger Notification Rules

    Section 7A of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. Sec.  18a, as added by 
Title II of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, 
requires persons contemplating certain mergers or acquisitions to give 
the Federal Trade Commission and the Assistant Attorney General advance 
notice and to wait designated periods before consummation of such 
plans. Section 7A(b)(2) of the Act permits the agencies, in individual 
cases, to terminate this waiting period prior to its expiration and 
requires that notice of this action be published in the Federal 
Register.
    The following transactions were granted early termination--on the 
dates indicated--of the waiting period provided by law and the 
premerger notification rules. The listing for each transaction includes 
the transaction number and the parties to the transaction. The grants 
were made by the Federal Trade Commission and the Assistant Attorney 
General for the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice. 
Neither agency intends to take any action with respect to these 
proposed acquisitions during the applicable waiting period.
