Asset allocation solutions








Asset allocation, the foundation for long-term investing

Asset allocation1 creates a consistent investment structure to help you stay focused on long-term goals through turbulent market cycles. In addition to helping maintain a portfolio that matches your appetite for risk, this strategy can help diversify your portfolio across asset classes and markets as well as support a consistent, disciplined approach to investing. We believe that employing proper asset allocation is the key to a long-term investment strategy, which is why we offer a variety of exclusive, customized asset allocation solutions. 
An investment plan as unique as your needs
Financial professionals2 from HSBC Securities (USA) Inc.3  can help you to develop a custom asset allocation strategy by taking the time to understand your risk tolerance, time horizon, financial goals, liquidity needs and other relevant factors. Our first priority is to follow an investment strategy with which you are comfortable. Start with scheduling a review by calling us at 866.586.4722 or by submitting an online request. 
Asset allocation solutions to potentially enhance your portfolio
Because we place a strong emphasis on proper asset allocation, we're pleased to make a wide variety of HSBC asset allocation solutions available to our clients. 
HSBC Spectrum4 provides flexibility for a wide variety of investment styles through an open architecture asset allocation program:

Five asset allocation models. Models offer allocations to equity and fixed income mutual funds, money market funds and ETFs (exchange traded funds)
Assistance from your financial professional to evaluate allocation models that align with your tolerance for risk
Periodic evaluation of client accounts against their selected target model to determine if rebalancing is recommended
A minimum initial investment of $25,000

Form ADV Part 2 acts as a disclosure document for clients of the business and includes information such as advisory services offered, advisor's fee schedule, whether the investment advisor acts as a broker-dealer and transacts securities, disciplinary information, and conflicts of interest. This information should be read carefully and if you have any questions please reach out to your investment adviser representative.

1 Asset allocation is a method of diversification that positions assets among major investment categories. This tool may be used in an effort to manage risk and enhance returns. However, it does not guarantee a profit or protect against a loss. It also cannot eliminate the risk of fluctuating prices and uncertain returns.

PWA/PRAs primarily focus on a full suite of Premier products and services while FAs primarily focus on a full suite of Advance products and services.  Both offer bank products through HSBC Bank (USA) N.A., investments and certain insurance products, including annuities, through HSBC Securities (USA) Inc. and traditional insurance products through HSBC Insurance Agency (USA) Inc.

Asset Allocation Trust

NOTES TO PORTFOLIO OF INVESTMENTS  December 31, 2010 (UNAUDITED)

The Trusts portfolio of investments as of the date on the cover of this report has not been
audited. This report is provided for the general information of the Trusts shareholders. For
more information regarding the Trust and its holdings, please see the Trusts most recent
prospectus and annual report.

Security valuation

Investments in the underlying open-end mutual funds are valued at the net asset value per share as
reported by the underlying funds as of the close of the regular trading on the New York Stock
Exchange on each day the exchange is open for trading.

Securities are valued by brokers which use prices provided by market markers or estimates of market
value obtained from yield data relating to investments or securities with similar characteristics.

Debt securities of sufficient credit quality with original maturities of 60 days or less generally
are valued at amortized cost which approximates fair value. The amortized cost method involves
valuing a security at its cost, plus accretion of discount or minus amortization of premium over
the period until maturity.

Investments in open-end mutual funds and non-registered investment companies are generally valued
at net asset value.

`The valuation techniques used by the Trust to measure fair value are consistent with the market
approach, income approach and/or cost approach, where applicable, for each security type.

Fair valuation measurements

Fair value measurements of investments are determined within a framework that has established a
fair value hierarchy based upon the various data inputs utilized in determining the value of the
Funds investments. The three-level hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted
prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to
unobservable inputs (Level 3). The Trusts investments are classified within the fair value
hierarchy based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
The inputs are summarized into three broad levels as follows:





 
Level 1 
 
quoted prices in active markets for identical securities


 

 
Level 2 
 
other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices for similar
securities, interest rates, prepayment speeds, credit risk, etc.)


 

 
Level 3 
 
significant unobservable inputs (including the Funds own assumptions
in determining the fair value of investments)



The inputs or methodologies used for valuing securities are not necessarily an indication of the
risk associated with investing in those securities.

As of December 31, 2010, the inputs used in valuing the Trusts assets, which are carried at fair
value, were as follows:
