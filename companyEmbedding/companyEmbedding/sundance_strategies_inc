The Discount Rate that the market offers is 18% to 20%, and sometimes even higher.  The ability for an investor to earn 20% on A-rated credit is remarkable.  The policies trade at this high discount rate because of two primary disadvantages: (1) the “negative yield” or cost of the ongoing premiums, and (2) uncertain maturity.  Most investors do not prefer investments of an uncertain amount of capital with an estimated, but not guaranteed, holding period. It is the way that Sundance Strategies addresses these two primary issues that creates the opportunity.Negative Yield – The way that many investment funds address the cost of ongoing premiums is to raise an amount of capital, say $100M.  They then allocate $60M to acquire policies and reserve $40M to pay the ongoing premiums.  This is very inefficient because the $60M is being invested at a 20% expected IRR, but the $40M cash reserve is earning maybe 1% until it is used to pay premiums.  The risk for this type of investor is that the $40M may not be enough to pay the ongoing premiums until the death benefits start to come in which will help pay the ongoing premiums on the remaining portfolio.  If the fund depletes its premium reserve, it must raise more capital or, most likely, start to liquidate the portfolio.  It is from these liquidations that Sundance purchases a portion of its inventory.Senior Financing – The management of Sundance believes that Senior Financing provides a much better alternative to dealing with the unknown cost of future premiums.  If the investment fund described above was able to secure financing, then perhaps they would raise $100M, borrow an additional $80M and use $180M to acquire policies.  The lender would then arrange a line of credit to fund all ongoing premiums.  The death benefits, as received would be used to retire the outstanding senior debt before the net proceeds are paid to the fund.  This would allow 3X the policies to be purchased for the same initial capital commitment from the investors, but a much higher IRR on their investment. Uncertain Maturity – The life expectancy (“LE”) that is provided for the investors to consider when purchasing a policy are from one or more of the industry LE providers.  While they are accurate on a pool of policies (100+), they are not definitive on a single insured.  Even on a pool of life insurance policies, there can be a standard deviation of a year or two on the average expected LE compared with actual results. Mortality Reinsurance – One of the best ways to deal with uncertain maturity of a pool of life policies is to purchase Mortality Reinsurance.  This is an insurance policy issued to the owner of a pool of life insurance policies that guarantees a minimum annual cash flow from the pool.  The coverage is issued for a period of 15 years and guarantees that at least 75% of the death benefits are received as expected.  If in any year, say year 5, $100M of death benefits were anticipated and only $50M were received. Then the Reinsurance provider would advance approximately $25M to get the portfolio owner at least 75% of the expected cashflow.  In later years, when the death benefits are eventually received, the Reinsurance is repaid. NIBs – The management of Sundance believes that the best way to capitalize on the life settlement market, to acquire policies with the highest IRR with the minimum risk, is to purchase NIBs.  These NIBs receive the net cash flow from a pool of life settlement policies that have (1) long term financing for premiums and (2) Mortality Reinsurance coverage to guarantee a minimum level of performance. By combining these two features, Sundance will use the capital of the company to acquire NIBs on approximately $1B of policies per year.  The net cash flow over the life of the NIBs is anticipated to be 30% to 35% of the death benefit.  The cost of the NIBs will be about 6% of the death benefit.  The IRR of the investment in NIBs is projected to be well above 20% market returns.    sundance strategies © 2014   HomeLife SettlementsProcessInvestor RelationsAbout UsContact Us    View on Mobile

	Item 1.  Financial Statements



	 


	The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company
	required to be filed with this Quarterly Report were prepared by management and commence below, together with related notes.
	In the opinion of management, the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements fairly present the financial condition of the
	Company and include all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation of
	the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. The results from operations for the three month period ended
	June 30, 2016, are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017.
	The unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the March 31, 2016 Consolidated
	Financial Statements and footnotes thereto included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year
	ended March 31, 2016, which was filed with the SEC on June 14, 2016, and which is referenced in Part II, Item 6, below.

	NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS




	June 30, 2016





	 


	 



	(1) ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION



	 


	The accompanying interim condensed consolidated
	financial statements have been prepared by the Company, without audit, in accordance with the instructions to the Quarterly Report
	on Form 10-Q, and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X promulgated by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”)
	and, therefore, do not include all information and footnotes necessary for a fair presentation of its consolidated financial position,
	results of operations and cash flows in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”).


	 


	In the opinion of management, the unaudited
	financial information for the interim periods presented reflects all adjustments, consisting of only normal and recurring adjustments,
	necessary for a fair presentation of the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.
	These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included
	in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016. Operating results for interim periods
	are not necessarily indicative of operating results for an entire fiscal year.


	 


	The preparation of financial statements in conformity
	with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and the disclosure of contingent
	amounts in the Company’s financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual results could materially differ from those
	estimates. These condensed consolidated unaudited financial statements reflect all adjustments, including normal recurring
	adjustments which, in the opinion of management, are necessary to present fairly the operations and cash flows for the periods
	presented.


	 


	Sundance Strategies, Inc. (formerly known as
	Java Express, Inc.) was organized under the laws of the State of Nevada on December 14, 2001, and engaged in the retail selling
	of beverage products to the general public until these endeavors ceased in 2006; it had no material business operations from 2006,
	until its acquisition of ANEW LIFE, INC. (“ANEW LIFE”), a subsidiary of Sundance Strategies, Inc. (“Sundance
	Strategies,” the “Company” or “we”). The Company is engaged in the business of purchasing or acquiring
	and selling life insurance policies and residual interests in or financial products tied to life insurance policies, including
	notes, drafts, acceptances, open accounts receivable and other obligations representing part or all of the sales price of insurance,
	life settlements and related insurance contracts being traded in the secondary marketplace, often referred to as the “life
	settlements market.” Currently, the Company is focused on the purchase and sale of net insurance benefit contracts (“NIBs”)
	based on life settlements or life insurance policies. The Company does not take possession or control of the policies. The Holder
	of the life settlements or life insurance policies acquire such policies at a discount to their face value. The Holder has available
	credit to pay premiums and expenses on the underlying policies until settlement. On settlement, the Company receives the net insurance
	benefit after all borrowings, interest and expenses have been paid by the Holder out of the settlement proceeds.

	NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS



	   



	 


	The Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”)
	issued Accounting Standard Update (“ASU”) 2014-09, 2015-14 and 2016-8, 10,11 and 12 – Revenue from Contracts
	with Customers, which provides a single, comprehensive revenue recognition model for all contracts with customers. The core principal
	of the ASUs is that an entity should recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that
	reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The ASUs also requires
	additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts,
	including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract.
	In July 2015, the FASB deferred the effective date of this standard. As a result, the standard and related amendments will be effective
	for the Company for its fiscal year beginning April 1, 2018, including interim periods within that fiscal year. Early application
	is permitted, but not before the original effective date of April 1, 2017. Entities are allowed to transition to the new standard
	by either retrospective application or recognizing the cumulative effect. The Company is currently evaluating the guidance, including
	which transition approach will be applied and the estimated impact it will have on our consolidated financial

	statements. The Company does not believe adoption of the ASUs will
	have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.



	 



	In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15
	Presentation of Financial Statements—Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity’s
	Ability to Continue as a Going Concern. The new standard provides guidance around management’s responsibility to evaluate
	whether there is substantial doubt about an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote
	disclosures. The new standard is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December
	15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s
	financial statements.


	 


	In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01
	regarding Financial Instruments, which amended guidance on the classification and measurement of financial instruments. Under the
	new guidance, entities will be required to measure equity investments that are not consolidated or accounted for under the equity
	method at fair value with any changes in fair value recorded in net income, unless the entity has elected the new practicability
	exception. For financial liabilities measured using the fair value option, entities will be required to separately present in other
	comprehensive income the portion of the changes in fair value attributable to instrument-specific credit risk. Additionally, the
	guidance amends certain disclosure requirements associated with the fair value of financial instruments. The standard will be effective
	for the Company’s fiscal year beginning April 1, 2018, including interim reporting periods within that fiscal year. The Company
	is currently evaluating the effect of the adoption of this guidance on the consolidated financial statements.


	 


	In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02
	related to the accounting for leases. This pronouncement requires lessees to record most leases on their balance sheet, while expense
	recognition on the income statement remains similar to current lease accounting guidance. The guidance also eliminates real estate-specific
	provisions and modifies certain aspects of lessor accounting. Under the new guidance, lease classification as either a finance
	lease or an operating lease will determine how lease-related revenue and expense are recognized. The pronouncement is effective
	for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company is currently
	evaluating the effect of the adoption of this guidance on the consolidated financial statements.


	 


	In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-06 related
	to the embedded derivative analysis for debt instruments with contingent call or put options. This pronouncement clarifies that
	an exercise contingency does not need to be evaluated to determine whether it relates only to interest rates or credit risk. Instead,
	the contingent put or call option should be evaluated for possible bifurcation as a derivative in accordance with the four-step
	decision sequence detailed in FASB ASC 815-15, without regard to the nature of the exercise contingency. The pronouncement is effective
	for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company does not believe
	the adoption of this guidance will have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.


	 


	In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,
	Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. The new standard is designed to simplify the areas of share based payments
	relating to income tax consequences. ASU 2016-09 is effective for the Company for its fiscal year beginning April 1, 2017. The
	Company is currently evaluating the effect of the adoption of this guidance on the consolidated financial statements.


	 


	In June 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-13, Financial Instruments
	- Credit Losses. ASU 2016-13 requires entities to report “expected” credit losses on financial instruments and other
	commitments to extend credit rather than the current “incurred loss” model. These expected credit losses for financial
	assets held at the reporting date are to be based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable
	forecasts. This ASU will also require enhanced disclosures relating to significant estimates and judgments used in estimating credit
	losses, as well as the credit quality. The amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including
	interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of ASU 2016-13 will have
	on its consolidated financial statements and results of operations.


	 


	The Company has reviewed all other recently
	issued, but not yet adopted, accounting standards, in order to determine their effects, if any, on its results of operations, financial
	position or cash flows. Based on that review, the Company believes that none of these pronouncements will have a significant effect
	on its financial statements.

	(3) ADVANCE FOR INVESTMENT IN NET INSURANCE BENEFITS



	 


	On June 7, 2013, the Company entered into an
	Asset Transfer Agreement (the “Del Mar ATA”) with Del Mar Financial, S.a.r.l. (“Del Mar”). As part of the
	Del Mar ATA, the Company entered into a Structuring and Consulting Agreement with Europa Settlement Advisors Ltd. (respectively,
	the “Europa Agreement” and “Europa”).


	 


	The Del Mar ATA involved the purchase of certain
	life settlement assets consisting of the legal and net beneficial ownership interest in a portfolio of life insurance policies
	(the “NIBs”), among other assets that are consideration and collateral for certain cash advances and expense payments
	made by the Company. According to the Del Mar ATA, Del Mar, with the assistance of Europa, was obligated to convert the NIBs and
	other newly acquired NIBs into “Qualified NIBS.” As soon as Del Mar met its obligation to provide Qualified NIBs to
	the Company, any remaining NIBs and any other consideration and collateral would be returned or released to Del Mar. The original
	due date for the conversion was December 31, 2013, which date was subsequently extended several times. On April 30, 2015, the Company
	finalized an amendment to the Del Mar ATA and the related Europa Agreement to extend the deadline until August 31, 2015.


	 


	The remaining consideration and collateral under
	the Del Mar ATA, as of September 1, 2015, primarily consisted of approximately 72.2% of the NIBs associated with a portfolio of
	life settlement policies having a face value that originally totaled $94,000,000. The remaining 27.8% interested in the NIBs were
	held by other parties. During June 2015, one of the life settlement policies matured for $10,000,000 (the “Matured Policy”),
	lowering the remaining face value of such life settlement policies to $84,000,000. The premiums and expenses related to the maintenance
	of these life insurance policies are financed by a loan from a lender.


	 


	As Del Mar was unable to provide the required
	amount of Qualified NIBs by the extended due date of August 31, 2015, effective September 1, 2015, the agreements with Del Mar
	and Europa were cancelled and the Company obtained full ownership and control of the collateral, which included the above mentioned
	approximately 72.2% of the NIBs associated with the $84,000,000 face value of life settlement policies and certain rights to net
	proceeds relating to the Matured Policy.


	 


	On September 30, 2015, the Company transferred
	to Investment in NIBs the remaining balance of advances and expense payments to Del Mar, totaling $3,368,380, which approximates
	fair value. This amount was residing in advance for investment in NIBs before being transferred to investment in NIBs (see Note
	4).


	 


	The bulk of the $10,000,000 proceeds paid in
	connection with the Matured Policy were used to repay loans secured by such Matured Policy. However, on September 10, 2015, the
	Company received $1,094,335 as a result of the rights associated with the Matured Policy. These proceeds were allocated $239,415
	to pay off a note receivable (including interest), $547,308 to reimburse the Company for expense payments made to or on behalf
	of Del Mar and $307,612 as a refund of advance payments previously made to or on behalf of Del Mar as part of the Del Mar ATA.
	The $547,308 and $307,612 proceeds, which together total $854,920, were applied to reduce Advance for Investment in NIBs.


	 


	In addition to obtaining full and unrestricted
	rights to the NIBs upon termination of the Del Mar ATA and Europa Agreement, the Company also is entitled to receive liquidated
	damages from Del Mar in an amount equal to 100% of any cash advances made under the Del Mar ATA. The Company is currently determining
	the extent of the liquidated damages claim and Del Mar’s ability to pay any such liquidated damages. The liquidated damages
	are computed pro rata, based upon the percentage of Qualified NIBs delivered by Del Mar under the Del Mar ATA. The Company received
	$90,600,000 in Qualified NIBs or approximately 22.65% of the $400,000,000 in Qualified NIBs due under the Del Mar ATA. Accordingly,
	once 22.65% of its costs and expenses are deducted, the Company would be entitled to receive the remaining amount of its costs
	and expenses, times two, as liquidated damages. As a result of the termination, the Company has no further payment obligations
	to Del Mar or fee obligations to Europa.

	As explained in Note 3, the Company transferred
	$3,368,380 from advance for investment in NIBs into investment in NIBs on September 30, 2015.  


	 


	The estimated fair value of the Company’s
	investment in NIBs approximated carrying value at June 30, 2016, with fair value calculated using level 3 inputs as there is little
	observable market data available and management is required to use significant judgment in its estimates.  


	 


	During April 2016, the Company received $1,417,870
	in cash proceeds associated with the $10,000,000 maturity explained in Note 2 and miscellaneous adjustments to other underlying
	policies. The cash proceeds had the effect of reducing accrued interest on NIBs.


	 




	The investment in NIBs is a residual economic
	beneficial interest in a portfolio of life insurance policies that have been financed by an independent third party via a loan
	from a senior lender and insured via a mortality risk insurance product or mortality re-insurance (“MRI”). 
	Future expected cash flow is defined as the net insurance proceeds from death benefits after senior debt repayment, mortality risk
	repayment and service provider or other third-party payments. The Company is not responsible for maintaining premiums or other
	expenses related to maintaining the underlying life insurance contracts. Therefore, the investment in NIBs balance on the Company’s
	balance sheet does not increase when premiums or other expenses are paid.   The Company holds a 100% interest in the
	NIBs relating to the underlying life insurance policies as of March 31, 2015. During the year ended March 31, 2016 we acquired
	NIBs in which the holders of the underlying policies only owned 72%. Therefore, as of June 30, 2016 the Company holds between 72%
	and 100% in the NIBs relating to the underlying life insurance policies.


	 


	The Company accounts for its investment
	in NIBs

	    


	at
	the initial investment value increased for interest income and decreased for cash receipts received by the Company.  At
	the time of transfer or purchase of an investment in NIBs, the Company estimates the future expected cash flows and determine
	the effective interest rate based on these estimated cash flows and our initial investment. Based on this effective interest
	rate, the Company calculates accretable income, which is recorded as interest income on investment in NIBs in the statement
	of operations.  Our current projections are based off of various assumptions including, but not limited to, the amount
	and timing of projected net cash receipts, expected maturity events, changes in discount rates, life expectancy estimates and
	their relation to premiums, interest, and other costs incurred, among other items. These uncertainties and contingencies are
	difficult to predict and are subject to future events that may impact our estimates and interest income. As a result, actual
	results could differ significantly from these projections. Therefore, subsequent to the purchase and on a regular basis,
	these future estimated cash flows are evaluated for changes. If the determination is made that the future estimated cash
	flows should be significantly adjusted, a revised effective yield is calculated prospectively based on the current amortized
	cost of the investment, including accrued accretion. Any positive or adverse change in cash flows that does not result in the
	recognition of an “other-than-temporary impairment” (“OTTI”) results in a prospective increase or
	decrease in the effective interest rate used to recognize interest income. We have not recognized any significant adverse
	change in future estimated cash flows relating to our investment in NIBs from our inception in 2013 to the period ended June
	30, 2016. During the quarter ended June 30, 2016, and in conjunction with the $1,417,870 cash received in April 2016, the
	Company received updated information from the policy holders regarding reduced management fees relating to maintaining the
	underlying policies, and favorable changes in the senior debt balances and related loan-to-value ratios. These changes
	prompted the Company to reevaluate and make appropriate adjustments to the cash flow models used to calculate accretable
	income, which resulted in an increase to the effective interest rate used to recognize income on the NIBs. The resulting
	increase on the Interest Income on Investment in NIBs for the period ending June 30, 2016 was $265,920 over the accretable
	income that would have been recognized under the prior models. This increase had no significant effect on the Company’s
	earnings per share.

	(5) NOTES PAYABLE AND LINES-OF-CREDIT, RELATED PARTY



	 


	As of June 30, 2016, the Company had borrowed $3,875,178, excluding accrued interest, from related parties
	under notes payable and lines-of-credit agreements that allow for borrowings of up to $5,230,000 through the earlier of August
	31, 2017, or when the Company completes a successful equity raise, at which time principal and interest is due in full. The notes
	payable and lines-of-credit incur interest at 7.5%, allow for origination fees and are collateralized by Investment in NIBs. During
	the three months ended June 30, 2016, the Company borrowed an additional $205,000 under these agreements. The Company also repaid
	$150,000 during the three months ended June 30, 2016. As of August 9, 2016 the Company can still borrow up to $1,097,322 on these
	lines-of-credit. The related parties include a person who is the Chairman of the Board of Directors and a stockholder, and Radiant
	Life, LLC, an entity partially owned by the Chairman of the Board of Directors.


	 





	(6) NOTES PAYABLE TRANSFERRED TO REDEEMED COMMON STOCK PAYABLE



	 


	At March 31, 2014, the Company owed $1,455,904,
	including accrued interest, for notes payable. During the year ended March 31, 2015, the Company had accrued an additional $37,350
	in interest. The note incurred interest at 4%, was collateralized by NIBs and was due in April 2015. During June 2015, the note
	payable and related accrued interest were converted to equity through the issuance of 187,500 shares of common stock and the holder
	was granted the right to require the Company to redeem the common stock for $8.00 per share. On June 9, 2015, the holder exercised
	a portion of the redemption right relating to 93,750 shares and, as a result, the Company paid the holder $750,000 to redeem the
	shares. On March 25, 2016, the holder exercised the redemption right in relation to the remaining shares and on April 12, 2016,
	the Company paid the holder an additional $750,000 to redeem the remaining shares. At March 31, 2016, the $750,000 associated with
	the redemption had been classified on the balance sheet as Mandatorily Redeemable Common Stock.


	 



	(7) CONVERTIBLE DEBENTURE AGREEMENT



	 


	The Company has entered into an 8%
	convertible debenture agreement with Satco International, Ltd., that allows for borrowings of up to $3,000,000. The holder
	originally had the option to convert the outstanding principal and accrued interest to unregistered, restricted common stock
	of the Company on June 2, 2016. Per the agreement, the number of shares issuable at conversion shall be determined by the
	quotient obtained by dividing the outstanding principal and accrued and unpaid interest by 90% of the 90 day average closing
	price of the Company’s common stock from the date the notice of conversion is received; and the price at which the
	Debenture may be converted will be no lower than $1.00 per share. The original maturity date was June 2, 2016, but was later
	extended to May 31, 2017. On June 1, 2016, the Company agreed to amend the 8% Convertible Debenture Agreement that extended
	the due date and conversion rights to August 31, 2017. As of June 30, 2016, the Company owed $700,000 under the agreement,
	excluding accrued interest. As of August 9, 2016, the Company is still able to borrow up to $2,300,000 on this agreement.




	(8)  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS



	 


	Since the Company’s inception on January 31, 2013, its operations have been primarily financed through
	sales of equity, debt financing, lines of credit from related parties and the issuance of notes payable and convertible debentures.
	As of June 30, 2016, the Company had $6,254 of cash assets, compared to $24,717 as of March 31, 2016. As of August 9, 2016, the
	Company has access to draw an additional $1,097,322 on the notes payable and lines-of-credit, related party (see Note 5) and $2,300,000
	on the Convertible Debenture Agreement (See Note 7). The Company’s monthly expenses are between approximately $140,000 and
	$290,000, which includes salaries of our employees, consulting agreements and contract labor, general and administrative expenses
	and estimated legal and accounting expenses. The Company believes that its existing capital resources, together with the issuance
	of additional notes payable and convertible debentures and availability under its existing lines of credit with related

	SUNDANCE

	parties, will be sufficient to fund its operating working capital requirements for at least the next
	12 months, or through August 15, 2017. While the Company believes it has sufficient liquidity and capital resources to fund its
	projected operating requirements through August 15, 2017, it does not anticipate having adequate cash flows from operations for
	three to four years, and until a revenue stream has been established, it will require debt or equity financing to fund its current
	and intended business and any future purchases of NIBs.


	 


	If the Company is unable to raise sufficient
	capital through the planned securities and debt offerings or other alternative sources of financing, management will curtail NIB
	purchases. Under this plan, expenditures for NIBs will be curtailed. 


	 


	The accompanying financial statements have been
	prepared on a going concern basis under which the Company is expected to be able to realize its assets and satisfy its liabilities
	in the normal course of business. To continue as a going concern beyond the period ended June 30, 2017, and in order to continue
	to purchase NIBs, the Company will need to raise additional capital to fund operations and purchase NIBs. Absent additional financing,
	the Company will not have the resources to execute its current business plan and continue operations.


	 



	(9) COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES




	 




	As explained
	in Note 1, the Company is focused on the purchase and sale of NIB’s based on life settlements or life insurance policies.
	The Company does not take possession or control of the policies. The Holder of the life settlements or life insurance policies
	acquire such policies at a discount to their face value. The Holder has available credit to pay premiums and expenses on the underlying
	policies until settlement. On settlement, the Company receives the net insurance benefit after all borrowings, interest and expenses
	have been paid by the Holder out of the settlement proceeds. However, in the event of default of the Holder, the Company may be
	required to expend funds on premiums, interest and servicing costs over the next five years to protect its interest in NIBs, though
	the Company has no legal responsibility nor adequate funds for these payments. In the event that neither party fulfils the financial
	obligations pertaining to the premiums, interest and servicing costs, the Company
	would be required to evaluate its investment in NIBs for possible adverse impairment.






	 







	(10) SUBSEQUENT EVENTS





	 




	Management has
	considered subsequent events through August 9, 2016, the date these financial statements were issued. No events have occurred
	subsequent to June 30, 2016 which would have a material effect on the financial statements of the Company.

	or otherwise.


	The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes
	contained elsewhere in this report and in our other filings with the Commission.





	 




	Overview



	 


	We are engaged in the business of purchasing
	residual economic interests in a portfolio of life settlements. A life settlement is the sale of an existing life insurance policy
	to a third party for more than the policy’s cash surrender value, but less than the face value of the policy benefit. After
	the sale, the new policy holder will pay the premiums due on the policy until maturity and then collect the settlement proceeds
	at maturity.


	 


	We do not purchase or hold life settlement
	or life insurance policies but, rather, hold a contractual right to receive the net insurance benefits, or NIBs, from a portfolio
	of life insurance policies held by a third party. These NIBs represent an indirect, residual ownership interest in a portfolio
	of individual life insurance policies and they allow us to receive a portion of the settlement proceeds from such policies, after
	expenses related to the acquisition, financing, insuring and servicing of the policies underlying our NIBs have been paid.


	 


	We are not responsible for maintaining premiums
	or other expenses related to maintaining the underlying life settlement or life insurance policies. Ownership of the underlying
	life settlement or life insurance policies, and the related obligation to maintain such policies, remains with the entity that
	holds such policies.


	 


	NIBs are generally sold by an entity that
	holds the underlying life settlement or life insurance policies, either directly or indirectly through a subsidiary, such an
	entity being referred to herein as a “Holder.” A Holder, either directly or through a wholly owned subsidiary,
	purchases life insurance policies either from the insured or on the secondary market and aggregates them into a portfolio of
	policies. At the time of purchase, the Holder also (i) contracts with a service provider to manage the servicing of the
	policies until maturity, (ii) purchases mortality re-insurance (“MRI”) coverage under which payments will be made
	to the Holder in the event the insurance policies do not mature according to actuarial life expectancies, and (iii) arranges
	financing to cover the initial purchase of the insurance policies, the servicing of the life insurance policies until
	maturity and the payment of the MRI premiums. The financing obtained by the Holder for a portfolio of life settlement or life
	insurance policies is secured by the insurance policies for which the financing was obtained. After a Holder purchases
	policies, aggregates them into a portfolio and arranges for the servicing, MRI coverage and financing, the Holder contracts
	to sell NIBs related to the policies, which gives the holder of the NIBs the right to receive the proceeds from the
	settlement of the insurance policies after all of the expenses related to such policies have been paid. When an insurance
	policy underlying our NIBs comes to maturity, the insurance proceeds are first used to pay expenses associated with such
	policy. Once all of the expenses have been paid, the Holder will retain a small percentage of the proceeds and then will
	pay the remaining insurance proceeds to us in satisfaction of our related NIBs.


	 


	We began purchasing NIBs during our fiscal year
	ended March 31, 2013.





	13






	 




	 





	 Plan of Operations



	 


	Our plan of operation for the next 12 months is to continue the acquisition and possible sale of NIBs. This
	is not a market sector without competition and, at present, we are a minor competitor. We will need substantial additional funds
	to effectively compete in this industry and no assurance can be given that we will be able to adequately fund our current and intended
	operations, whether through revenues generated from our current interest in our NIBs or through debt or equity financing. We may
	be required to expend funds on premiums, interest and servicing costs over the next five years to protect our interest in NIBs,
	though we have no legal responsibility nor adequate funds for these payments. In the event that neither party fulfils the financial
	obligations pertaining to the premiums, interest and servicing costs,

	we
	would be required to evaluate our investment in NIBs for possible adverse impairment. These payments are currently being made through
	an unrelated senior lending facility.




	 





	 We currently estimate proceeds of approximately
	$107.9 million on the NIBs we owned as of June 30, 2016, and acquired from PCH Financial S.a.r.l., a société à
	responsabilité limitée incorporated and existing under the laws of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg (“PCH”),
	Del Mar Financial S.a.r.l., a société à responsabilité limitée incorporated and existing under
	the laws of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg (“Del Mar”), and HFII Assets Solutions, LLC, a Delaware limited liability
	company (“HFII”).  This amount is based on the estimated proceeds from polices of $402.5 million in face value,
	which includes estimated return of premiums; less the senior loan debt and MRI repayments outstanding of approximately $115.5
	million, expected premium payments of $106.9 million over the life expectancies of the insured persons in these portfolios and
	estimated expenses and interest of approximately $72.1 million over the term of the senior loans.


	 


	We use an estimation methodology to project
	cash flows and returns as presented. The estimation model requires many assumptions, including, but not limited to the following:
	(i) an assumption that the distinct number of lives in our portfolio would exhibit similar experience to a statistically diverse
	portfolio from which mortality tables have been created; (ii) an assumption that the life expectancies (the “LE” or
	“LEs”) provided by LE providers represent the actuarial mean of the life expectancies of the insureds in our portfolio,
	(iii) the weighted average of the LEs provided by the LE providers represents an appropriate method for adjusting for discrepancies
	in the LEs; (iv) life expectancy tables and projections are accurate; (v) the minimum premiums calculated based on the in-force
	illustrations provided by life insurance carriers are accurate and will not change over the course of the lifetime of our portfolio;
	and (vi) the Holders’ Lender fees, MRI fees, and insurance, servicing and custodial fees will not change materially over
	time. While this method of modeling cash flows is helpful in providing a theoretical expectation of potential returns that might
	be produced from our NIBs portfolio, actual cash flows and returns inevitably will be different (possibly materially) due to the
	fact that predicting the exact date of death of any individual is virtually impossible. The provision of a theoretical cash flow
	model is by no means any guarantee of any results. The actual performance of these NIB interests (as well as our future expectations
	as to what such performance might be) may differ substantially from our expectations, especially if any of the assumptions change
	or differ from our initial assumptions. These portfolios currently contain only 130 fractionalized policies on 71 individual insureds,
	though insurance rating agencies have stated that at least 1,000 lives are required to achieve actuarial stability. Many risk factors
	beyond these assumptions may result in our expectations being incorrect; therefore, no assurance can be given that these estimated
	results will occur.


	 



	Results of Operations



	 



	Income Recognition



	 


	At the time of transfer or purchase of an investment
	in NIBs, we estimate the future expected cash flows from such NIBs and determine the effective interest rate that, when applied
	to our initial investment in such NIBs, would yield these estimated cash flows. The Company accrues income on a monthly basis by
	applying this interest rate to our investment in the related NIBs, and such income is recorded as interest income on investment
	in NIBs in the statement of operations. This accretable income is based on the effective yield method and effectively represents
	the total amount of cash flows we expect to receive over the life of each pool of NIBs less the amount of our initial investment
	in such NIBs. Subsequent to the purchase of a given pool of NIBs and on a regular basis, these future





	14






	 




	estimated cash flows are evaluated for changes. If we determine
	that the future estimated cash flows should be significantly adjusted, a revised effective yield is calculated and applied prospectively.
	Any positive or adverse change in cash flows that does not result in the recognition of an “other-than-temporary impairment”
	(“OTTI”) results in a prospective increase or decrease in the effective interest rate used to recognize interest income.
	We have not recognized any significant adverse change in future estimated cash flows relating to our investment in NIBs since inception.  

	 





	 






	Three-Months Ended June 30, 2016 Compared with Three-Months
	Ended June 30, 2015





	 




	Interest Income



	 


	Interest income on investment in NIBs totaled
	$1,453,872 and $824,030 for the three months ended June 30, 2016, and 2015 respectively.  The increase is primarily due to
	the acquisition of additional NIBs in September 2015, and adjustments to the cash flow models during the quarter ended June 30,
	2016, which resulted in an increase to the effective interest rate used to recognize income on the NIBs.


	 



	General & Administrative Expenses



	 



	General and administrative
	expenses totaled $727,443 and $595,954 during the three months ended June 30, 2016, and 2015, respectively.  A significant
	portion of these expenses were professional fees, payroll and travel expenses, and the increase was mainly due to an increase professional
	fees, including accounting and legal fees related to our year-end audit, as well as increased travel expenses


	  


	.



	 



	Other Income and Expenses



	 


	Other income and expenses primarily consist
	of interest on the note payable related-party and convertible debenture, as well as interest income. During the three months ended
	June 30, 2016, and 2015, interest expense has accrued in the amount of $85,882 and $39,202 respectively.  


	 



	Income Taxes



	 



	During the three
	months ended June 30, 2016, and 2015, we recorded net income for financial reporting purposes, but had no income tax expense due
	to the existence of net operating loss carryforwards which are fully reserved with a valuation allowance.



	 



	Liquidity and Capital Resources





	Since our inception
	our operations have been primarily financed through sales of equity, debt financing, lines of credit and notes payable from
	related parties and the issuance of convertible debentures. As of June 30, 2016, we had $6,254 of cash assets, compared to
	$24,717 as of March 31, 2016. Our monthly cash expenses are between approximately $140,000 and $250,000, which includes
	salaries of our employees, consulting agreements and contract labor, general and administrative expenses and estimated legal
	and accounting expenses. We believe that our existing capital resources, together with the issuance of additional notes
	payable and convertible debentures and availability under our existing lines of credit with related parties, will be
	sufficient to fund our operating working capital requirements for at least the next 12 months, or through August 15, 2017.
	While we believe we have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to fund our projected operating requirements through
	August 15, 2017, we do not anticipate having adequate cash flows from operations for three to four years, and until a cash
	flow stream from NIBs has been established. We will require debt or equity financing to fund our current and intended
	business and any future purchases of NIBs.



	As a
	result, we believe that we will need to raise approximately $45 million in additional funds through equity or debt financing
	to fully expand on our business model during 2016 and beyond. Although we are actively pursuing opportunities to raise
	additional equity and debt capital, funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. Also, market
	conditions may prevent us from accessing the debt and equity capital markets. If we do raise additional capital through
	public or private equity offerings, the ownership interest of our existing stockholders






	15






	 




	will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation
	or other preferences or other terms that adversely affect our stockholders’ rights or further complicate raising additional
	capital in the future. If we raise additional capital through debt financing, we may be subject to covenants limiting or restricting
	our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If
	we are unable, for any reason, to raise needed capital, we may need to reduce, or discontinue, operations.


	 



	We raised
	$11,942,500 (gross) in our private placement that commenced in April 2013. During the three months ended June 30, 2016, we
	used $695,000 in financing activities compared to $325,000 net cash provided by financing activities during the three months
	ended June 30, 2015. During the three months ended June 30, 2016, the Company borrowed an additional $205,000 under the Notes
	Payable and Lines of Credit, Related Party agreements. The Company also repaid $150,000 during the three months ended June
	30, 2016. In addition, during the three months ended June 30, 2016, we paid out the $750,000 Mandatorily Redeemable Common
	Stock Payable recorded on the balance sheet as of March 31, 2016.



	 


	During March 2015, we agreed to pay $150,000
	in cash, issue 1,130,000 shares of common stock and forgive a note receivable with an outstanding amount of $150,000 in exchange
	for relief of a $1,493,254 note payable and the receipt of NIBs. The net consideration given for the relief of the note payable
	and receipt of NIBs totaled $1,493,254 and $7,846,746, respectively, for a total of $9,340,000. The holder of the shares issued
	pursuant to the transaction was given the right to require us to redeem 187,500 shares for $8.00 per share ($1,500,000 in total).
	On June 9, 2015, the holder exercised a portion of the redemption right relating to 93,750 shares and, as a result, the Company
	paid the holder $750,000 to redeem the shares. On March 25, 2016, the holder exercised the redemption right in relation to the
	remaining shares and on April 12, 2016, the Company paid the holder an additional $750,000 to redeem the remaining shares. At March
	31, 2016, the $750,000 associated with the redemption had been classified on the balance sheet as Mandatorily Redeemable Common
	Stock.



	For
	the three months ended June 30, 2016 we recorded net cash provided by operating activities of $676,537, compared to $639,419 used
	in operating activities during the three months ended June 30, 2015. The increase in operating cash flows was primarily due to
	the receipt of approximately $1,400,000




	, which
	was an approved distribution from the policy holders as a return on our interest in NIBs. During the three month period ended June
	30, 2016, we had an unusual net inflow of cash from operating activities. However, because we are in the early stages of our accretion
	model, we typically expect to use cash from operating activities during most reporting periods.


	  



	The accompanying financial statements have been
	prepared on a going concern basis under which we are expected to be able to realize our assets and satisfy our liabilities in the
	normal course of business. To continue as a going concern beyond the period ending August 15, 2017 and to continue to acquire NIBs
	we will need to complete securities and debt offerings or obtain alternative sources of financing. Absent additional financing,
	we will not have the necessary resources to execute our business plan.


	 



	Debt



	At June 30, 2016, we owed
	$4,707,548, including accrued interest, for debt obligations, including $3,875,178, excluding accrued interest, pursuant to notes
	payable and lines-of-credits from related parties and $700,000, excluding accrued interest, pursuant to an 8% Convertible Debenture.
	The notes payable and lines-of-credit are due on August 31, 2017, or when the Company completes a successful equity raise, at which
	time principal and interest is due in full, and the convertible debenture is due August 31, 2017. As of August 9, 2016, there was
	$1,097,322 available under the notes payable and lines-of-credit we currently have with related parties and $2,300,000 available
	under the 8% convertible debenture agreement. We may borrow money in the future to finance our operations, but can make no guarantees
	that such credit will be made available to us. Any such borrowing will increase the risk of loss to the debt holder in the event
	we are unsuccessful in repaying such loans.






	The notes payable and lines-of-credit incur
	interest at 7.5 percent, allow for origination fees and are collateralized by Investment in NIBs. During the three months ended
	June 30, 2016, the Company borrowed an additional $205,000 under these agreements. The Company also repaid $150,000 during the
	three months ended





	16






	 




	June 30, 2016. The related parties include a person who is the Chairman
	of the Board of Directors and a stockholder, and Radiant Life, LLC, an entity partially owned by the Chairman of the Board of Directors.


	 



	Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates



	 


	The preparation of our financial statements
	requires that we make estimates and judgments. We base these on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe
	to be reasonable.


	 



	Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements



	 


	We have no off-balance sheet arrangements.



	 





	Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about
	Market Risk



	 



	Our exposure
	to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the valuation of investment in NIBs and related income recognition.
	Increases in general interest rates would similarly increase the interest rates used in our financial models. Such increases would
	result in decreases in the present value of expected future cash flows from our NIBs and, as a result, decrease income accrued
	on our investment in NIBs.




	 





	Item 4.  Controls and Procedures



	 



	Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures



	 



	Our management,
	with the participation of our principal executive and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure
	controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. Based on that evaluation, our President who
	is also deemed to be our acting CFO, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered
	by the Quarterly Report were effective and that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed under the Exchange
	Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and
	(ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our President and our acting CFO, as appropriate to allow timely
	decisions regarding disclosure.  A controls system cannot provide absolute assurance, however, that the objectives of the
	controls system are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of
	fraud, if any, within a company have been detected.




	 




	Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting




	 




	We made
	no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the fiscal
	quarter ended June 30, 2016 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over
	financial reporting.





	 





	PART II - OTHER INFORMATION



	 





	Item 1. Legal Proceedings



	 


	To the best of our knowledge, there are no legal proceedings pending
	or threatened against us; and there are no actions pending or threatened against any of our directors or officers that are adverse
	to us.



	 





	Item 1A.  Risk Factors



	 


	In addition to the other information set forth in this quarterly
	report on Form10-Q, you should carefully consider the risks discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March
	31, 2016, which risks could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. There were no material changes
	during the quarter ended June 30, 2016 to the risk factors disclosed in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
	year ended March 31, 2016. These risks are not the only risks facing our Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently





	17






	 




	known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may
	materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or future results.



	 





	Item 2.  Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and
	Use of Proceeds



	 


	There were no sales by us of unregistered securities during the

	Item 1.  Financial Statements



	 


	The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company required
	to be filed with this Quarterly Report were prepared by management and commence below, together with related notes. In the opinion
	of management, the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements fairly present the financial condition of the Company and include
	all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation of the Company’s Condensed
	Consolidated Financial Statements. The results from operations for the three and nine month periods ended December 31, 2016, are
	not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017. The unaudited Condensed
	Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the March 31, 2016, Consolidated Financial Statements and
	footnotes thereto included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016, which was
	filed with the SEC on June 14, 2016.

	(1) ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION



	 


	The accompanying interim condensed consolidated
	financial statements have been prepared by the Company, without audit, in accordance with the instructions to the Quarterly Report
	on Form 10-Q, and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X promulgated by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”)
	and, therefore, do not include all information and footnotes necessary for a fair presentation of its consolidated financial position,
	results of operations and cash flows in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”).


	 


	In the opinion of management, the unaudited
	financial information for the interim periods presented reflects all adjustments, consisting of only normal and recurring adjustments,
	necessary for a fair presentation of the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.
	These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included
	in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016. Operating results for interim periods
	are not necessarily indicative of operating results for an entire fiscal year.


	 


	The preparation of financial statements in conformity
	with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and the disclosure of contingent
	amounts in the Company’s financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual results could materially differ from those
	estimates. These condensed consolidated unaudited financial statements reflect all adjustments, including normal recurring
	adjustments which, in the opinion of management, are necessary to present fairly the operations and cash flows for the periods
	presented.

	Strategies,” the “Company” or “we”). The Company is engaged in the business of purchasing or acquiring
	and selling life insurance policies and residual interests in or financial products tied to life insurance policies, including
	notes, drafts, acceptances, open accounts receivable and other obligations representing part or all of the sales price of insurance,
	life settlements and related insurance contracts being traded in the secondary marketplace, often referred to as the “life
	settlements market.” Currently, the Company is focused on the purchase of net insurance benefit contracts (“NIBs”)
	based on life settlements or life insurance policies. The Company does not take possession or control of the policies. The owners
	of the life settlements or life insurance policies acquire such policies at a discount to their face value. The owners have available
	credit to pay forecasted premiums and expenses on the underlying policies until settlement. On settlement, the Company receives
	the net insurance benefit after all borrowings, interest and expenses have been paid by the owners out of the settlement proceeds.
	The owners of the Life Insurance Policies are variable interest entities (VIEs), for which the Company has a variable interest, but is not the primary beneficiary. The Company’s investment in NIBs (see Note 4) were issued by the owners (i.e. the VIEs). The Company’s maximum exposure
	to loss in the variable interest entities is limited to the investment in NIBs balance. The Company does not have the power to
	direct activities of the VIEs. Further, the Company does not have the contractual obligation to absorb losses of the VIE, beyond
	the Company’s initial investment.




	 



	The investment
	in NIBs is a residual economic beneficial interest in a portfolio of life insurance contracts that have been financed by an independent
	third party via a loan from a lender and insured via a mortality risk insurance product or mortality re-insurance (“MRI”).


	  


	Future expected cash flow and positive profits
	are defined as the net insurance proceeds from death benefits after senior debt repayment, mortality risk repayment, and service
	provider or other third-party payments.



	 



	NIBs are in the
	form of participating debt certificates (“PDC”). According to the terms of the PDCs, the PDCs provide both variable


	  


	and fixed interest


	  


	return
	to the Company from the owners of the policies


	  


	in
	the form of accrued yield. The variable interest varies by individual PDC, and is calculated as 99% to 100% (depending on the PDC)
	of the positive profits from the life insurance assets held by the owners of the policies. The fixed interest also







	7

	 






	 





	varies by individual PDC, and is either
	1% or 2% per annum of the par value of the PDCs held by the Company. The par value of the PDCs held by the Company is approximately
	$36.8 million. The NIBs agreements between the Company and the owners of the policies contain a provision that allows for the owners
	to redeem the NIBs at any point, conditional upon paying to the Company the par value




	of
	the NIBs, as well as any unpaid accrued yield


	 


	relating
	to fixed and variable interest


	 


	. The par value is
	in excess of the Company’s initial investment. The Company holds between 72.2% and 100% in the NIBs relating to the underlying
	life insurance policies as of December 31, 2016 and March 31, 2016. The Company is not responsible for maintaining premiums or
	other expenses related to maintaining the underlying life insurance contracts. Therefore, the investment in NIBs balance on the
	Company’s balance sheet does not increase when premiums or other expenses are paid




	.



	 


	The Company accounts for its investment in NIBs
	at the initial investment value increased for interest income and decreased for cash receipts received by the Company. At the time
	of transfer or purchase of an investment in NIBs, we estimate the future expected cash flows and determine the effective interest
	rate based on these estimated cash flows and our initial investment. Based on this effective interest rate, the Company calculates
	accretable income, which is recorded as interest income on investment in NIBs in the statement of operations. Subsequent to the
	purchase and on a regular basis, these future estimated cash flows are evaluated for changes. If the determination is made that
	the future estimated cash flows should be significantly adjusted, a revised effective yield is calculated prospectively based on
	the current amortized cost of the investment, including accrued accretion. Our current projections are based off of various
	assumptions including, but not limited to, the amount and timing of projected net cash receipts, expected maturity events, changes
	in discount rates, life expectancy estimates and their relation to premiums, interest, and other costs incurred, among other items.
	These uncertainties and contingencies are difficult to predict and are subject to future events that may impact our estimates and
	interest income. As a result, actual results could differ significantly from these projections. Therefore, subsequent to the purchase
	and on a regular basis, these future estimated cash flows are evaluated for changes. If the determination is made that the future
	estimated cash flows should be significantly adjusted, a revised effective yield is calculated prospectively based on the current
	amortized cost of the investment, including accrued accretion. Any positive or adverse change in cash flows would result in a prospective increase or decrease in the effective
	interest rate used to recognize interest income. Any significant adverse change in the cash flows may result in the recognition
	of an “other-than-temporary impairment” (“OTTI”), and would be evaluated by the Company accordingly.


	 



	We evaluate the
	carrying value of our investment in NIBs for impairment on a regular basis and, if necessary, adjust our total basis in the NIBs
	using new or updated information that affects our assumptions. We recognize impairment on a NIB contract if the fair value of
	the beneficial interest are less than the carrying amount of the investment, plus anticipated undiscounted future premiums and
	direct external costs, if any, and if there are adverse changes in cash flow. We have not recognized any impairment on our investment
	in NIBs from January 31, 2013 (inception), to the periods ended December 31, 2016.



	 


	In estimating these cash flows for purposes
	of interest income and impairment calculations, there are a number of assumptions that are subject to uncertainties and contingencies.
	These include the amount and timing of projected net cash receipts, expected maturity events, counter party performance risk, changes
	to applicable regulation of the investment, shortage of funds needed to maintain the asset until maturity, changes in discount
	rates, life expectancy estimates and their relation to premiums, interest, and other costs incurred, among other items. These uncertainties
	and contingencies are difficult to predict and are subject to future events that may impact our estimates and interest income.
	As a result, actual results could differ significantly from those estimates.


	 




	Correction of an Immaterial Error




	 



	During the
	period


	 


	ended December 31, 2016, the Company
	identified an error related to its Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for both the cash used in Advance for
	Investment in NIBs, as well as proceeds from Refunds on Advance for Investment in NIBs




	. The Company determined that in the prior period reported, these amounts were improperly included in cash inflows
	and outflows as operating activities when they should have been classified as inflows and outflows from investing activities in
	the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. This error did
	not affect net income, assets, liabilities, stockholders' equity, cash flows from financing activities or the net increase or
	decrease in cash and cash equivalents for the period. In accordance with the SEC Staff Accounting
	Bulletin (SAB) No. 99, "Materiality," and SAB No. 108, "Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements
	when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements," we evaluated the materiality of the error from
	qualitative and quantitative perspectives and concluded that the error was immaterial to the current







	8

	 






	 




	and prior periods mentioned above. Consequently, the Consolidated
	Statement of Cash Flows contained in these financial statements have been restated for the nine months ended December 31, 2015.
	The change resulted in a net decrease of $228,006 from cash flows used in operating activities and a corresponding increase
	to cash inflows from investing activities for the period ending December 31, 2015.

	NEW
	ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS



	   



	 


	The Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”)
	issued Accounting Standard Update (“ASU”) 2014-09, 2015-14 and 2016-8, 10,11 and 12 – Revenue from Contracts
	with Customers, which provides a single, comprehensive revenue recognition model for all contracts with customers. The core principal
	of the ASUs is that an entity should recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that
	reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The ASUs also requires
	additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts,
	including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract.
	In July 2015, the FASB deferred the effective date of this standard. As a result, the standard and related amendments will be effective
	for the Company for its fiscal year beginning April 1, 2018, including interim periods within that fiscal year. Early application
	is permitted, but not before the original effective date of April 1, 2017. Entities are allowed to transition to the new standard
	by either retrospective application or recognizing the cumulative effect. The ASUs are not applicable to securitized beneficial
	interests that derive accreted yields and, therefore the Company will continue to follow the guidance in ASC 325-40. The adoption
	of this standard will not have an impact on the consolidated financial statements.


	 


	In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15
	Presentation of Financial Statements—Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity’s
	Ability to Continue as a Going Concern. The new standard provides guidance around management’s responsibility to evaluate
	whether there is substantial doubt about an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote
	disclosures. The new standard is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December
	15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s
	financial statements.


	 


	In December, 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17,
	Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes.  The new standard is designed to simplify the presentation of deferred income
	taxes, and requires all deferred tax liabilities and assets of the same tax jurisdiction or a tax filing group, as well as any
	related valuation allowance, be offset and presented as a single noncurrent amount in a classified balance sheet.  The amendments
	are effective for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after March 31, 2016.  The Company
	does not believe the adoption of this guidance will have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements as the Company
	already reports deferred tax liabilities as long term. 


	 


	In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01
	regarding Financial Instruments, which amended guidance on the classification and measurement of financial instruments. Under the
	new guidance, entities will be required to measure equity investments that are not consolidated or accounted for under the equity
	method at fair value with any changes in fair value recorded in net income, unless the entity has elected the new practicability
	exception. For financial liabilities measured using the fair value option, entities will be required to separately present in other
	comprehensive income the portion of the changes in fair value attributable to instrument-specific credit risk. Additionally, the
	guidance amends certain disclosure requirements associated with the fair value of financial instruments. The standard will be effective
	for the Company’s fiscal year beginning April 1, 2018, including interim reporting periods within that fiscal year. The Company
	is currently evaluating the effect of the adoption of this guidance on the consolidated financial statements.


	 


	In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02
	related to the accounting for leases. This pronouncement requires lessees to record most leases on their balance sheet, while expense
	recognition on the income statement remains similar to current lease accounting guidance. The guidance also eliminates real estate-specific
	provisions and modifies certain aspects of lessor accounting. Under the new guidance, lease classification as either a finance
	lease or an operating lease will determine how lease-related revenue and expense are recognized. The pronouncement is effective
	for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company does not believe
	the adoption of this guidance will have a material effect on the






	9

	 






	 




	consolidated financial statements because leases are month-to-month
	and not material to the Company’s financial statements.


	 


	In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-06 related
	to the embedded derivative analysis for debt instruments with contingent call or put options. This pronouncement clarifies that
	an exercise contingency does not need to be evaluated to determine whether it relates only to interest rates or credit risk. Instead,
	the contingent put or call option should be evaluated for possible bifurcation as a derivative in accordance with the four-step
	decision sequence detailed in FASB ASC 815-15, without regard to the nature of the exercise contingency. The pronouncement is effective
	for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company does not believe
	the adoption of this guidance will have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.


	 


	In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,
	Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. The new standard is designed to simplify the areas of share based payments
	relating to income tax consequences. ASU 2016-09 is effective for the Company for its fiscal year beginning April 1, 2017. The
	Company is currently evaluating the effect of the adoption of this guidance on the consolidated financial statements.


	 


	In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial
	Instruments - Credit Losses. ASU 2016-13 requires entities to report “expected” credit losses on financial instruments
	and other commitments to extend credit rather than the current “incurred loss” model. These expected credit losses
	for financial assets held at the reporting date are to be based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and
	supportable forecasts. This ASU will also require enhanced disclosures relating to significant estimates and judgments used in
	estimating credit losses, as well as the credit quality. The amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December
	15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of ASU
	2016-13 will have on its consolidated financial statements and results of operations.


	 


	In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,
	Statement of Cash Flows - Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments. Historically, there has been a diversity in
	practice in how certain cash receipts/payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. To reduce the existing
	diversity in practice, this update addresses the eight cash flow issues as listed in the pronouncement. The amendments in this
	update are effective for fiscal years beginning April 1, 2018, and interim periods within that fiscal year. Early adoption is permitted.
	The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements.


	 


	In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-17,
	Consolidation - Interests held through Related Parties that are under Common Control, which alters how a decision maker needs to
	consider indirect interests in a variable interest entity (VIE) held through an entity under common control. Under the new ASU,
	if a decision maker is required to evaluate whether it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, it will need to consider only its proportionate
	indirect interest in the VIE held through a common control party. The amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years
	beginning April 1, 2017, including interim periods within that fiscal year. The Company does not believe the adoption of this guidance
	will have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements, as the Company has no related parties under common control
	that have the characteristics of a primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity.


	 



	The Company has
	reviewed all other recently issued, but not yet adopted, accounting standards, in order to determine their effects, if any, on
	its results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Based on that review, the Company believes that none of these pronouncements
	will have a significant effect on its financial statements.


	  




	 




	(3) ADVANCE FOR INVESTMENT IN NET INSURANCE BENEFITS



	 


	On June 7, 2013, the Company entered into an
	Asset Transfer Agreement (the “Del Mar ATA”) with Del Mar Financial, S.a.r.l. (“Del Mar”). As part of the
	Del Mar ATA, the Company entered into a Structuring and Consulting Agreement with Europa Settlement Advisors Ltd. (respectively,
	the “Europa Agreement” and “Europa”).


	 


	The Del Mar ATA involved the purchase of certain
	life settlement assets consisting of the legal and net beneficial ownership interest in a portfolio of life insurance policies
	(the “NIBs”), among other assets that are






	10

	 






	 




	consideration and collateral for certain cash advances and expense
	payments made by the Company. According to the Del Mar ATA, Del Mar, with the assistance of Europa, was obligated to convert the
	NIBs and other newly acquired NIBs into “Qualified NIBS.” As soon as Del Mar met its obligation to provide Qualified
	NIBs to the Company, any remaining NIBs and any other consideration and collateral would be returned or released to Del Mar. The
	original due date for the conversion was December 31, 2013, which date was subsequently extended several times. On April 30, 2015,
	the Company finalized an amendment to the Del Mar ATA and the related Europa Agreement to extend the deadline until August 31,
	2015.


	 


	The remaining consideration and collateral under
	the Del Mar ATA, as of September 1, 2015, primarily consisted of approximately 72.2% of the NIBs associated with a portfolio of
	life settlement policies having a face value that originally totaled $94,000,000. The remaining 27.8% interest in the NIBs were
	held by other parties. During June 2015, one of the life settlement policies matured for $10,000,000 (the “Matured Policy”),
	lowering the remaining face value of such life settlement policies to $84,000,000. The premiums and expenses related to the maintenance
	of these life insurance policies are financed by a loan from a lender.


	 


	As Del Mar was unable to provide the required
	amount of Qualified NIBs by the extended due date of August 31, 2015, effective September 1, 2015, the agreements with Del Mar
	and Europa were cancelled and the Company obtained full ownership and control of the collateral, which included the above mentioned
	approximately 72.2% of the NIBs associated with the $84,000,000 face value of life settlement policies and certain rights to net
	proceeds relating to the Matured Policy.


	 


	On September 30, 2015, the Company transferred
	to Investment in NIBs the remaining balance of advances and expense payments to Del Mar, totaling $3,368,380, which approximates
	fair value. This amount was residing in advance for investment in NIBs before being transferred to investment in NIBs (see Note
	4).


	 



	The bulk of the
	$10,000,000 proceeds paid in connection with the Matured Policy were used to repay loans secured by such Matured Policy. However,
	on September 10, 2015, the Company received $1,094,335 as a result of the rights associated with the Matured Policy. These proceeds
	were allocated $211,000 to pay off a note receivable, $16,428 to pay off accrued interest receivable from prior periods, $11,987
	to pay off interest accrued within the current period, $547,308 to reimburse the Company for expense payments made to or on behalf
	of Del Mar and $307,612 as a refund of advance payments previously made to or on behalf of Del Mar as part of the Del Mar ATA.
	The $547,308 and $307,612 proceeds, which together total $854,920, were applied to reduce Advance for Investment in NIBs.

	During April
	2016, the Company received $1,417,870 in cash proceeds associated with maturities and miscellaneous adjustments to other underlying
	policies. The cash proceeds reduced the carrying value of the Company’s Investment in NIBs.



	 



	During the quarter
	ended June 30, 2016, and in conjunction with the $1,417,870 cash received in April 2016, the Company received updated information
	from the policy owners regarding reduced management fees relating to maintaining the underlying policies, and favorable changes
	in the senior debt balances and related loan-to-value ratios. These changes prompted the Company to reevaluate and make appropriate
	adjustments to the cash flow models used to calculate accretable income, which resulted in an increase to the effective interest
	rate used to recognize income on the NIBs. The resulting increase on the Interest Income on Investment in NIBs for the nine months
	ending December 31, 2016 was $265,920 over the accretable income that would have been recognized under the prior models. This increase
	had no significant effect on the Company’s earnings per share. 


	  




	 




	(5) FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS



	 


	As defined by ASC Topic 820, "Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures"
	("ASC 820"), fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly
	transaction between market participants at the measurement date. ASC 820 also requires the consideration of differing levels of
	inputs in the determination of fair values.


	 


	Those levels of input are summarized as follows:


	 


	• Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets
	and liabilities.


	 


	• Level 2: Observable inputs other than Level 1 quoted prices,
	such as quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets
	that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market.


	 


	• Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are supported by little
	or no market activity. Level 3 assets and liabilities include financial instruments whose value is determined using pricing models,
	discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques as well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires
	significant management judgment or estimation.


	 


	The level in the fair value hierarchy within which a fair value
	measurement in its entirety falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.


	 




	Financial Instruments Not Required To Be Carried at Fair Value





	 




	In accordance with the disclosure
	requirements of ASC Topic 825, "Financial Instruments" ("ASC 825"), the table below summarizes fair value estimates
	for the Company's financial instruments that are not required to be carried at fair value. The total of the fair value calculations
	presented does not represent, and should not be construed to represent, the underlying value of the Company. In estimating


	 


	the
	fair value of the Company’s Investment in NIBs, the rate of return that a market participant would be willing to pay for

	The Company’s recorded values
	of cash and cash equivalents, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their fair values based on their short-term
	nature. The recorded values of the notes payable and convertible debenture approximates the fair values as the interest rate approximates
	market interest rates.


	  



	 



	(6) NOTES PAYABLE, RELATED PARTY



	 



	As of December
	31, 2016 and March 31, 2016, the Company had borrowed $4,799,753 and $3,820,178, respectively, excluding accrued interest, from
	related parties under notes payable agreements that allow for borrowings of up to $5,730,000, exclusive of accrued interest. Of
	the $4,799,753 of notes payable owed as of December 31, 2016, $3,299,753 is due August 31, 2018. The remaining $1,500,000 is due
	November 30, 2018. In the event the Company completes a successful equity raise, principal and interest on notes payable totaling
	$5,039,544 are due in full at that time. The notes payable incur interest at 7.5%, allow for origination fees and are collateralized
	by Investment in NIBs. During the nine months ended December 31, 2016 and year ended March 31, 2016 the Company borrowed under
	these agreements an additional $1,129,576 and $2,520,178 respectively, and repaid $150,000 and $200,000, respectively. As of December
	31, 2016, the Company had availability to borrow up to $1,930,247




	.
	The interest associated with these notes of $239,790 is recorded on the balance sheet as a Long Term Accrued Expense obligation
	at December 31, 2016. The related parties include a person who is the Chairman of the Board of Directors and a stockholder, and
	Radiant Life, LLC, an entity partially owned by the Chairman of the Board of Directors.



	 


	On February 1, 2017, the note payable, related
	party agreement that allowed for borrowings of up to $2,130,000 at December 31, 2016, was amended to extend the due date from November
	30, 2017 to November 30, 2018. Also on February 1, 2017, the note payable, related party agreement that allowed for borrowings
	of up to $3,600,000 at December 31, 2016, was amended to increase the borrowings from $3,600,000 to $4,600,000.


	 



	(7) NOTES PAYABLE TRANSFERRED TO REDEEMED COMMON STOCK PAYABLE



	 


	At March 31, 2014, the Company owed $1,455,904,
	including accrued interest, for notes payable. During the year ended March 31, 2015, the Company had accrued an additional $37,350
	in interest. The note incurred interest at 4%, was collateralized by NIBs and was due in April 2015. During June 2015, the note
	payable and related accrued interest were converted to equity through the issuance of 187,500 shares of common stock and the holder
	was granted the right to require the Company to redeem the common stock for $8.00 per share. On June 9,






	13

	 






	 




	2015, the holder exercised a portion of the redemption right relating
	to 93,750 shares and, as a result, the Company paid the holder $750,000 to redeem the shares. On March 25, 2016, the holder exercised
	the redemption right in relation to the remaining shares and on April 12, 2016, the Company paid the holder an additional $750,000
	to redeem the remaining shares. At March 31, 2016, the $750,000 associated with the redemption had been classified on the balance
	sheet as Mandatorily Redeemable Common Stock.


	 



	(8) CONVERTIBLE DEBENTURE AGREEMENT



	 



	The Company
	has entered into an 8% convertible debenture agreement with Satco International, Ltd., that allows for borrowings of up to $3,000,000.
	The holder originally had the option to convert the outstanding principal and accrued interest to unregistered, restricted common
	stock of the Company on June 2, 2016. Per the agreement, the number of shares issuable at conversion shall be determined by the
	quotient obtained by dividing the outstanding principal and accrued and unpaid interest by 90% of the 90 day average closing price
	of the Company’s common stock from the date the notice of conversion is received; and the price at which the Debenture may
	be converted will be no lower than $1.00 per share. The original maturity date was June 2, 2016, but was later extended to August
	31, 2017. On October 25, 2016, the Company agreed to amend the 8% Convertible Debenture Agreement that extended the due date and
	conversion rights to February 28, 2018. As of December 31 and March 31, 2016 the Company owed $700,000 under the agreement, excluding
	accrued interest. The associated interest of $88,679 at December 31, 2016 and $46,488 at March 31, 2016 is recorded on the balance
	sheet as a Long Term Accrued Expense obligation. As of February 9, 2017, the Company is still able to borrow up to $2,300,000 on
	this agreement.


	   



	On March 15, 2017, the Company agreed to amend
	the 8% Convertible Debenture Agreement to extend the due date and conversion rights to August 31, 2018.


	 




	(9)  LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS



	 


	Since the Company’s inception on January
	31, 2013, its operations have been primarily financed through sales of equity, debt financing from related parties and the issuance
	of notes payable and convertible debentures. As of December 31, 2016, the Company had $30,087 of cash assets, compared to $24,717
	as of March 31, 2016. As of April 13, 2017, the Company had access to draw an additional $1,515,247 on the notes payable, related
	party (see Note 6) and $2,300,000 on the Convertible Debenture Agreement (See Note 8). The Company’s average monthly expenses
	are expected to be approximately $180,000, which includes salaries of our employees, consulting agreements and contract labor,
	general and administrative expenses and estimated legal and accounting expenses. Outstanding Accounts Payable as of December 31,
	2016 totaled $484,413, and other accrued liabilities totaled $316,666. Management has concluded that its existing capital resources,
	future proceeds from Investment in NIBS, issuance of additional notes payable and convertible debentures and availability under
	its existing debt agreements with related parties, will be sufficient to fund its operating working capital requirements for at
	least the next 12 months, or through April 2018. The Company continues to evaluate other debt and equity financing opportunities
	and in August 2016 paid a financing advance of $100,000 to a group for a potential line-of-credit offering.


	 



	The accompanying
	financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis under which the Company is expected to be able to realize its
	assets and satisfy its liabilities in the normal course of business. In order to continue to purchase additional NIBs, the Company
	will likely need to raise additional capital to fund operations.


	  



	 



	(10) COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES




	 



	As explained in Note 1, the Company is focused
	on the purchase of NIB’s based on life settlements or life insurance policies. The Company does not take possession or control
	of the policies. The owners of the life settlements or life insurance policies acquires such policies at a discount to their face
	value. The owners have available credit to pay forecasted premiums and expenses on the underlying policies until settlement. On
	settlement, the Company receives the net insurance benefit after all borrowings, interest and expenses have been paid by the o
	out of the settlement proceeds. However, in the event of default of the owner, the Company may be required to expend funds on premiums,
	interest and servicing costs over the next five years to protect its interest in NIBs, though the Company has no legal responsibility
	nor adequate funds for these payments. In the event that neither






	14

	 






	 




	party fulfils the financial obligations pertaining to the premiums,
	interest and servicing costs, the Company would be required to evaluate its investment in NIBs for possible adverse impairment.
	In addition, see Note 4 relating to associated commitments and contingencies affiliated with life settlements or life insurance
	policies.


	 


	During July 2015 a group of persons located in the United States
	(the “Purchasers”) acquired the entities that owned all of the portfolios of life insurance policies underlying the
	Company’s NIBs.  In connection with this purchase, the Purchasers and the respective owners of these portfolios entered
	into a settlement agreement releasing such owners and their managers from liability related to their ownership and management of
	the entities that owned the respective portfolios of life insurance contracts.  The Company and Purchasers agreed to indemnify
	the prior owners of such portfolios against future claims in connection with the issuance of the NIBs or their ownership or management
	of the entities sold, based on actions that occurred prior to this sale to the Purchasers. The Company and Purchasers further agreed
	to maintain certain liquidity requirements of the entities underlying the NIBs for a period of 15 months following the acquisition
	by the Purchasers, which 15 month period expired in October 2016. If such liquidity was not provided, the Company and Purchasers
	were obligated to indemnify the prior owners and managers of the entities against third party claims for unpaid expenses. Neither
	the purchase of these entities nor the Settlement Agreement resulted in any material change in the Company’s NIBs ownership
	interest. The Company was supportive of the Purchasers acquiring the entities that owned the portfolios of life insurance contracts
	underlying the Company’s NIBs and was willing to provide the indemnification because it believed this ownership change would
	result in a reduction of costs and expenses associated with ownership of the NIBs, which would increase their intrinsic value.
	The Company was made aware by the Purchasers that credit was presently no longer available to pay certain costs to maintain the
	structure of the underlying life insurance policies. The Company’s obligations to provide liquidity under the Settlement
	Agreement have now expired and the Company is not legally obligated for costs incurred by the entities underlying the NIBs. However,
	if credit does not become available to Purchasers from the underlying loans to pay the costs as explained above, whether it be
	by proceeds from a future maturity or other negotiations, the Company may provide such liquidity to protect its investment in the
	NIBs. The total historical unpaid costs incurred prior to the ownership transition and potential unpaid cost incurred after the
	ownership transition approximates $370,000 and $580,000, respectively, for an estimated total of $950,000. The Company believes
	the probable amount it will ultimately pay is approximately $316,667 which relates to unpaid costs incurred prior to the transition.
	Therefore, the Company accrued $316,667 during the three months ended September 30, 2016, to account for this uncertainty. The
	Company anticipates that the total $316,667 will be paid by June 30, 2017, and therefore this amount has been recorded as current
	accrued expense. During the three months ended December 31, 2016, the Company reassessed this uncertainty and determined that no
	further adjustment was needed for the amount accrued. The Company will continue to assess this uncertainty and will adjust the
	amount accrued as more information becomes available.


	 




	(11) EARNINGS (LOSS) PER COMMON
	SHARE



	  



	 


	Earnings (loss) per common share is computed
	based on the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding and, when appropriate, dilutive common stock equivalents outstanding
	during the period. Stock options and warrants are considered to be common stock equivalents. The computation of diluted earnings
	(loss) per common share does not assume exercise or conversion of securities that would have an anti-dilutive effect.


	 


	Basic earnings (loss) per common share is the
	amount of net income (loss) for the period available to each weighted-average share of common stock outstanding during the reporting
	period. Diluted net earnings (loss) per common share is the amount of net income (loss) for the period available to each weighted-average
	share of common stock outstanding during the reporting period and to each common stock equivalent outstanding during the period,
	unless inclusion of common stock equivalents would have an anti-dilutive effect.


	 


	The reconciliations between the basic and diluted
	weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, are as follows:

	In periods with
	a net loss, outstanding options and warrants are not included in the computation of diluted net loss per common share, because
	they were anti-dilutive, and for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2015 totaled 1,785,000 for each period.  For
	the three and nine months ended December 31, 2016, options to exercise 400,000 shares were excluded because they were anti-dilutive.
	In addition, 263,265 shares related to the potential conversion of the convertible debenture were excluded because they were anti-dilutive.



	 



	(12) INCOME TAXES




	 




	At March 31,
	2016 we placed a 100% valuation allowance, totaling approximately $275,000, on the amount our deferred tax assets exceeding our
	deferred tax liabilities. As a result, no income tax expense (benefit) or deferred tax asset or liability was recorded on the
	financial statement. During the nine months ended December 31, 2016, our deferred tax liabilities began to exceed our deferred
	tax assets, which resulted in the recording of income tax expense and a deferred tax liability. As a result, during the nine months
	ended December 31, 2016, the $275,000 valuation allowance was reversed. The deferred tax assets primarily relate to net operating
	loss carryforwards and the deferred tax liabilities primarily relate to revenue recognized for financial reporting purposes, but
	not for tax reporting purposes.





	 




	(13) SUBSEQUENT EVENTS



	  



	 



	As explained in
	Note


	  


	6, on February 1, 2017, the notes payable,
	related party were amended to allow for additional borrowings and to extend a due date.



	 


	As explained in Note 8, on March 15, 2017, the
	Company agreed to amend the 8% Convertible Debenture Agreement to extend the due date and conversion rights to August 31, 2018.





	 




	 






	Item 2. Management’s Discussions and Analysis of Financial
	Condition and Results of Operations.



	 


	This discussion summarizes the significant factors affecting our
	consolidated operating results, financial condition, liquidity and capital resources at and during the three and nine month periods
	ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.  For a complete understanding, this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
	Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with the Financial Statements and Notes to the Financial Statements

	The following discussion should be read in conjunction
	with our financial statements and the related notes contained elsewhere in this report and in our other filings with the Commission.



	 




	Overview



	 


	We are currently focused on the business of
	purchasing residual economic interests in a portfolio of life settlements. A life settlement is the sale of an existing life insurance
	policy to a third party for more than the policy’s cash surrender value, but less than the face value of the policy benefit.
	After the sale, the new policy holder will pay the premiums due on the policy until maturity and then collect the settlement proceeds
	at maturity.


	 


	We currently do not purchase or hold life settlement
	or life insurance policies but, rather, hold a contractual right to receive the net insurance benefits, or NIBs, from a portfolio
	of life insurance policies held by a third party. These NIBs represent an indirect, residual ownership interest in a portfolio
	of individual life insurance policies and they allow us to receive a portion of the settlement proceeds from such policies, after
	expenses related to the acquisition, financing, insuring and servicing of the policies underlying our NIBs have been paid.


	 


	We are not responsible for maintaining premiums
	or other expenses related to maintaining the underlying life settlement or life insurance policies. Ownership of the underlying
	life settlement or life insurance policies, and the related obligation to maintain such policies, remains with the entity that
	holds such policies.


	 


	NIBs are generally sold by an entity that holds
	the underlying life settlement or life insurance policies, either directly or indirectly through a subsidiary, such an entity being
	referred to herein as a “Holder.” A Holder, either directly or through a wholly owned subsidiary, purchases life insurance
	policies either from the insured or on the secondary market and aggregates them into a portfolio of policies. At the time of purchase,
	the Holder also (i) contracts with a service provider to manage the servicing of the policies until maturity, (ii) purchases mortality
	re-insurance (“MRI”) coverage under which payments will be made to the Holder in the event the insurance policies do
	not mature according to actuarial life expectancies, and (iii) arranges financing to cover the initial purchase of the insurance
	policies, the servicing of the life insurance policies until maturity and the payment of the MRI premiums. The financing obtained
	by the Holder for a portfolio of life settlement or life insurance policies is secured by the insurance policies for which the
	financing was obtained. After a Holder purchases policies, aggregates them into a portfolio and arranges for the servicing, MRI
	coverage and financing, the Holder contracts to sell NIBs related to the policies, which gives the holder of the NIBs the right
	to receive the proceeds from the settlement of the insurance






	17

	 






	 




	policies after all of the expenses related to such policies have
	been paid. When an insurance policy underlying our NIBs comes to maturity, the insurance proceeds are first used to pay expenses
	associated with such policy. Once all of the expenses have been paid, the Holder will retain a small percentage of the proceeds
	and then will pay the remaining insurance proceeds to us in satisfaction of our related NIBs.


	 



	We began purchasing
	NIBs during our fiscal year ended March 31, 2013.


	  



	 



	 Plan of Operations



	 


	Our plan of operation for the next 12 months
	is to continue the acquisition of NIBs. This is not a market sector without competition and, at present, we are a minor competitor.
	We will need substantial additional funds to effectively compete in this industry and no assurance can be given that we will be
	able to adequately fund our current and intended operations, whether through revenues generated from our current interest in our
	NIBs or through debt or equity financing. We may be required to expend funds on premiums, interest and servicing costs over the
	next five years to protect our interest in NIBs, though we have no legal responsibility nor adequate funds for these payments.
	In the event that neither party fulfils the financial obligations pertaining to the premiums, interest and servicing costs, we
	would be required to evaluate our investment in NIBs for possible adverse impairment. These payments are currently being made through
	an unrelated senior lending facility.


	 


	 We currently estimate proceeds of approximately
	$106 million on the NIBs we owned as of December 31, 2016, and acquired from PCH Financial S.a.r.l., a société à
	responsabilité limitée incorporated and existing under the laws of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg (“PCH”),
	Del Mar Financial S.a.r.l., a société à responsabilité limitée incorporated and existing under
	the laws of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg (“Del Mar”), and HFII Assets Solutions, LLC, a Delaware limited liability
	company (“HFII”).  This amount is based on the estimated proceeds from polices of $403 million in face value,
	which includes estimated return of premiums; less the senior loan debt and MRI repayments outstanding of approximately $126 million,
	expected premium payments of $102 million over the life expectancies of the insured persons in these portfolios and estimated expenses
	and interest of approximately $69 million over the term of the senior loans.


	 


	We use an estimation methodology to project
	cash flows and returns as presented. The estimation model requires many assumptions, including, but not limited to the following:
	(i) an assumption that the distinct number of lives in our portfolio would exhibit similar experience to a statistically diverse
	portfolio from which mortality tables have been created; (ii) an assumption that the life expectancies (the “LE” or
	“LEs”) provided by LE providers represent the actuarial mean of the life expectancies of the insureds in our portfolio,
	(iii) the weighted average of the LEs provided by the LE providers represents an appropriate method for adjusting for discrepancies
	in the LEs; (iv) life expectancy tables and projections are accurate; (v) the minimum premiums calculated based on the in-force
	illustrations provided by life insurance carriers are accurate and will not change over the course of the lifetime of our portfolio;
	and (vi) the owners’ Lender fees, MRI fees, and insurance, servicing and custodial fees will not change materially over time.
	While this method of modeling cash flows is helpful in providing a theoretical expectation of potential returns that might be produced
	from our NIBs portfolio, actual cash flows and returns inevitably will be different (possibly materially) due to the fact that
	predicting the exact date of death of any individual is virtually impossible. The provision of a theoretical cash flow model is
	by no means any guarantee of any results. The actual performance of these NIB interests (as well as our future expectations as
	to what such performance might be) may differ substantially from our expectations, especially if any of the assumptions change
	or differ from our initial assumptions. These portfolios currently contain only 130 fractionalized policies on 71 individual insureds,
	though insurance rating agencies have stated that at least 1,000 lives are required to achieve actuarial stability. Many risk factors
	beyond these assumptions may result in our expectations being incorrect; therefore, no assurance can be given that these estimated
	results will occur.


	 



	Results of Operations



	 



	Income Recognition



	At the time of transfer
	or purchase of an investment in NIBs, we estimate the future expected cash flows from such NIBs and determine the effective interest
	rate that, when applied to our initial investment in such NIBs,






	18

	 






	 





	would yield these estimated cash flows. We accrue income on a monthly basis by applying this interest rate
	to our investment in the related NIBs, and such income is recorded as interest income on investment in NIBs in the statement of
	operations. This accretable income is based on the effective yield method and effectively represents the total amount of cash flows
	we expect to receive over the life of each pool of NIBs less the amount of our initial investment in such NIBs. Subsequent to the
	purchase of a given pool of NIBs and on a regular basis, these future estimated cash flows are evaluated for changes. If we determine
	that the future estimated cash flows should be significantly adjusted, a revised effective yield is calculated and applied prospectively
	based on the current amortized cost of the investment, including accrued accretion. Any positive or adverse change in cash flows
	would result in a prospective increase or decrease in the effective interest rate used to recognize interest income. Any significant
	adverse change in the cash flows may result in the recognition of an “other-than-temporary impairment” (“OTTI”),
	and would be evaluated by the Company accordingly. 





	Three-Months Ended December 31, 2016
	Compared with Three-Months Ended December 31, 2015





	 




	Interest Income



	 


	Interest income on investment in NIBs totaled
	$1,271,737 and $1,090,031 for the three months ended December 31, 2016, and 2015 respectively.  During the quarter ended June
	30, 2016, we received updated information from the policy owners regarding reduced management fees relating to maintaining the
	underlying policies, and favorable changes in the senior debt balances and related loan-to-value ratios. These changes prompted
	us to reevaluate and make appropriate adjustments to the cash flow models used to calculate accretable income, which resulted in
	an increase to the effective interest rate used to recognize income on the NIBs. The increase in interest income for the three
	month period ending December 31, 2016 is primarily due to these adjustments, which resulted in an increase to the effective interest
	rate used to recognize income on the NIBs.


	 



	General & Administrative Expenses



	 


	General and administrative expenses totaled
	$410,120 and $1,549,676 during the three months ended December 31, 2016, and 2015, respectively. A significant portion of these
	expenses were professional fees, payroll, travel expenses, and policy servicing expenses. During the three months ended December
	31, 2015, the Company accrued $826,665 as a one-time obligation which was a result of a restructuring with the prior owners of
	the underlying life insurance portfolios to our NIBs.


	 



	Other Income and Expenses



	 


	Other expenses primarily consist of interest
	on the notes payable, related party and convertible debenture. During the three months ended December 31, 2016, and 2015, interest
	expense was accrued in the amount of $103,154 and $60,294 respectively. The increase is attributable to higher balances on the
	notes payable, related party.  


	 



	Income Taxes



	 


	During the three months ended December 31, 2016,
	we recorded net income before income taxes of $758,463 and also recorded an income tax expense of $149,741. During the three months
	ended December 31, 2015, we recorded a net loss before income taxes and had no income tax expense.

	 Nine-Months Ended December 31, 2016 Compared with Nine-Months
	Ended December 31, 2015




	 



	Interest Income



	 


	Interest income on investment in NIBs totaled
	$4,145,036 and $2,777,501 for the nine months ended December 31, 2016, and 2015 respectively. During the quarter ended June 30,
	2016, we received updated information from the policy owners regarding reduced management fees relating to maintaining the underlying
	policies, and favorable changes in the senior debt balances and related loan-to-value ratios. These changes prompted the Company
	to reevaluate and make appropriate adjustments to the cash flow models used to calculate accretable income, which resulted in an
	increase to the effective interest rate used to recognize income on the NIBs. The increase in interest income for the three month
	period ending December 31, 2016 is primarily due to these adjustments, which resulted in an increase to the effective interest
	rate used to recognize income on the NIBs, in addition to the acquisition of additional NIBs in September 2015.


	 



	General & Administrative Expenses



	 


	General and administrative expenses totaled
	$2,023,056 and $3,043,267 during the nine months ended December 31, 2016, and 2015, respectively.  A significant portion of
	these expenses were professional fees, payroll travel expenses, and policy servicing expenses. We were made aware that credit was
	presently no longer available to pay certain costs to maintain the structure of the underlying life insurance policies. Although
	we are not legally obligated for costs incurred by the entities underlying the NIBs, if credit does not become available, whether
	it be by proceeds from a future maturity or other negotiations, we may opt to pay certain fees to protect our investment in the
	NIBs. We believe the probable amount of fees we will pay will approximate $316,667. Therefore, we have accrued $316,667 during
	the nine months ended December 31, 2016, to account for this uncertainty. We will assess this uncertainty throughout the year ended
	March 31, 2017, and will adjust the amount accrued as more information becomes available. Policy servicing expenses totaled $431,287
	and $894,689 for the nine months ended December 31, 2016, and 2015, respectively. In September 2016, we completed the amortization
	of our outstanding options and warrants, which contributed to the decrease in our general and administrative expenses.


	During July 2015 a group of persons located
	in the United States (the “Purchasers”) acquired the entities that owned all of the portfolios of life insurance policies
	underlying the Company’s NIBs. We paid certain legal fees to facilitate this restructuring process. The remainder of the
	decrease in general and administrative expense is largely attributable to the one time legal expenses related to this entity restructuring
	that occurred during the nine months ended December 31, 2015.



	Other Income and Expenses



	 


	Other income and expenses primarily consist
	of interest on the notes payable, related party and convertible debenture, as well as interest income. During the nine months ended
	December 31, 2016, and 2015, interest expense has accrued in the amount of $281,982 and $150,887 respectively. The increase is
	attributable to higher balances on the notes payable, related party.  


	 



	Income Taxes



	 




	During the nine months
	ended December 31, 2016, we recorded net income before income taxes of $1,839,998, and also recorded an income tax expense of $411,603.
	During the nine months ended December 31, 2015, we recorded a net loss before income taxes and had no income tax expense or benefit.


	At March 31, 2016 we placed a 100% valuation allowance, totaling approximately $275,000, on the amount our
	deferred tax assets exceeding our deferred tax liabilities. As a result, no income tax expense (benefit) or deferred tax asset
	or liability was recorded on the financial statement. During the nine months ended December 31, 2016, our deferred tax liabilities
	began to exceed our deferred tax assets, which resulted in the recording of income tax expense and a deferred tax liability. As
	a result, during the nine months ended December 31, 2016, the $275,000 valuation allowance was reversed. The deferred tax assets
	primarily relate to net operating loss carryforwards and the deferred tax liabilities primarily relate to revenue recognized for
	financial reporting purposes, but not for tax reporting purposes.

	Liquidity and Capital Resources



	Since our inception our operations have been
	primarily financed through sales of equity instruments, debt financing, lines of credit and notes payable from related parties
	and the issuance of convertible debentures. As of December 31, 2016, we had $30,087 of cash, compared to $24,717 as of March 31,
	2016. Our monthly expenses are approximately $180,000, which includes salaries of our employees, policy servicing expenses, consulting
	agreements and contract labor, general and administrative expenses, estimated legal and accounting expenses, and accruals for certain
	costs associated with the underlying life insurance policies, mentioned above. We believe that our existing capital resources,
	together with the issuance of additional notes payable and convertible debentures and availability under our existing lines of
	credit with related parties will be sufficient to fund our operating working capital requirements for at least the next 12 months,
	or through April 2018. While we believe we have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to fund our projected operating requirements
	through April 2018, we do not anticipate having adequate cash flows from operations for three to four years, and until a cash flow
	stream from NIBs has been established. We will require debt or equity financing to fund our current and intended business and any
	future purchases of NIBs. If we are unable to raise sufficient capital through the planned securities and debt offerings or other
	alternative sources of financing, management will curtail NIB purchases.


	 


	As a result, we believe that we will need to
	raise approximately $45 million in additional funds through equity or debt financing to fully expand on our business model during
	2017 and beyond. Although we are actively pursuing opportunities to raise additional equity and debt capital, funding may not be
	available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. Also, market conditions may prevent us from accessing the debt and equity capital
	markets. If we do raise additional capital through public or private equity offerings, the ownership interest of our existing stockholders
	will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences or other terms that adversely affect
	our stockholders’ rights or further complicate raising additional capital in the future. If we raise additional capital through
	debt financing, we may be subject to covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring
	additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we are unable, for any reason, to raise needed capital,
	we may need to reduce, or discontinue, operations.


	 


	We raised $11,942,500 (gross) in our private
	placement that commenced in April 2013. During the nine months ended December 31, 2016, and 2015, net cash provided by financing
	activities was $129,575 and $1,117,000, respectively. During the nine months ended December 31, 2016, we borrowed an additional
	$1,129,575 under the Notes Payable, Related Party agreements. We also repaid $150,000 during the nine months ended December 31,
	2016. In addition, during the nine months ended December 31, 2016, we paid out the $750,000 Mandatorily Redeemable Common Stock
	Payable recorded on the balance sheet as of March 31, 2016, and we also paid $100,000 as a financing advance.


	 


	During March 2015, we agreed to pay $150,000
	in cash, issue 1,130,000 shares of common stock and forgive a note receivable with an outstanding amount of $150,000 in exchange
	for relief of a $1,493,254 note payable and the receipt of NIBs. The net consideration given for the relief of the note payable
	and receipt of NIBs totaled $1,493,254 and $7,846,746 respectively, for a total of $9,340,000. The holder of the shares issued
	pursuant to the transaction was given the right to require us to redeem 187,500 shares for $8.00 per share ($1,500,000 in total).
	On June 9, 2015, the holder exercised a portion of the redemption right relating to 93,750 shares and, as a result, we paid the
	holder $750,000 to redeem the shares. On March 25, 2016, the holder exercised the redemption right in relation to the remaining
	shares and on April 12, 2016, we paid the holder an additional $750,000 to redeem the remaining shares. At March 31, 2016, the
	$750,000 associated with the redemption had been classified on the balance sheet as Mandatorily Redeemable Common Stock.


	 


	For the nine months ended December 31, 2016
	we recorded net cash used in operating activities of $124,205, compared to $1,818,262 used in operating activities during the nine
	months ended December 31, 2015. The increase in operating cash flows was primarily due to the receipt of approximately $1,400,000,
	which was an approved distribution from the policy owners as a return on our interest in NIBs.


	 


	For the nine months ended December 31, 2016
	no cash was used in or provided by investing activities, compared to $439,006 provided by investing activities during the nine
	months ended December 31, 2015. During






	21

	 






	 




	the nine months ended December 31, 2015, we paid $626,914 in cash
	to Del Mar as Advances for Investment in NIBs (see footnote 3 to our financials).

	During
	September 2015, we obtained ownership and control of a portfolio of policies due to the cancellation of the Del Mar ATA.  On
	September 10, 2015, the Company received $1,094,335 as a result of the rights associated with a matured policy in the newly obtained
	portfolio.  These proceeds were allocated $547,308 to reimburse the Company for expense payments made to or on behalf of Del
	Mar, $239,415 to pay off a note receivable (including interest) and $307,612 as a refund of advance payments previously made to
	or on behalf of Del Mar as part of the Del Mar ATA.



	 


	The accompanying financial statements have been
	prepared on a going concern basis under which we are expected to be able to realize our assets and satisfy our liabilities in the
	normal course of business. To continue as a going concern beyond the period ending December 31, 2017, and to continue to acquire
	NIBs we will need to complete securities and debt offerings or obtain alternative sources of financing. Absent additional financing,
	we will not have the necessary resources to execute our business plan.


	 



	Debt



	At December 31, 2016,
	we owed $5,828,223 including accrued interest, for debt obligations, including $4,799,753, excluding accrued interest, pursuant
	to notes payable from related parties and $700,000, excluding accrued interest, pursuant to an 8% Convertible Debenture. Of the
	$4,799,753 of notes payable currently owed as of December 31, 2016, $3,299,753 is due August 31, 2018. The remaining $1,500,000
	is due November 30, 2018. In the event we complete a successful equity raise, principal and interest on both notes payable are
	due in full at that time. The convertible debenture is due August 31, 2018. As of April 13, 2017, there was $1,515,247
	available under the notes payable we currently have with related parties and $2,300,000 available under the 8% convertible
	debenture agreement. We may borrow money in the future to finance our operations, but can make no guarantees that such credit
	will be made available to us. Any such borrowing will increase the risk of loss to the debt holder in the event we are unsuccessful
	in repaying such loans.


	The notes payable, related
	party incur interest at 7.5 percent and are collateralized by Investment in NIBs. During the nine months ended December 31, 2016,
	we borrowed an additional $1,129,576 under these agreements. We also repaid $150,000 during the nine months ended December 31,
	2016. The related parties include a person who is the Chairman of the Board of Directors and a stockholder, and Radiant Life, LLC,
	an entity partially owned by the Chairman of the Board of Directors.



	Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates



	 



	Estimates,

	The preparation of our financial
	statements requires that we make estimates and judgments. We base these on historical experience and on other assumptions that
	we believe to be reasonable.


	 



	Income Recognition,

	 Interest income
	on investment in NIBs represents the excess of all cash flows attributable to the investment in net insurance benefits greater
	than the initial investment over the life of each pool of net insurance benefits using the effective yield method.  Changes
	in the estimate of expected cash flows from investments in NIBs would be adjusted prospectively. 


	 




	Investment
	in Net Insurance Benefits,

	In addition to the other accounting policies related to the Investment in Net Insurance benefits
	detailed in Note 1


	  


	of the footnotes to the
	financial statements, the estimating of cash flows for purposes of interest income and impairment calculations, there are a number
	of assumptions that are subject to uncertainties and contingencies. These include the amount and timing of projected net cash receipts,
	expected maturity events, counter party performance risk, changes to applicable regulation of the investment, shortage of funds
	needed to maintain the asset until maturity, changes in discount rates, life expectancy estimates and their relation to premiums,
	interest, and other costs incurred, among other items. These uncertainties and contingencies are difficult to predict and are subject
	to future events that may impact our estimates and interest income. As a result, actual results could differ significantly
	from those estimates.



	 



	Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements




	 




	We have no off-balance
	sheet arrangements.

	Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about
	Market Risk



	 



	Our exposure
	to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the valuation of investment in NIBs and related income recognition.
	Increases in general interest rates would similarly increase the interest rates used in our financial models. Such increases would
	result in decreases in the present value of expected future cash flows from our NIBs and, as a result, decrease income accrued
	on our investment in NIBs. The Company’s assessment of market risk as of December 31, 2016 indicates there have been no material
	changes in the quantitative and qualitative disclosures from those in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31,
	2016 filed with the SEC.




	 





	Item 4.  Controls and Procedures




	 










	Limitation
	on the Effectiveness of Controls







	 



	The Company
	maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information, which is required
	to be disclosed timely, is accumulated and communicated to management in a timely fashion. In designing and evaluating such controls
	and procedures, we recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable
	assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Our management is necessarily required to use judgment in evaluating controls
	and procedures.










	 








	Evaluation
	of Controls and Procedures


	 



	 



	Our management,
	with the participation of our principal executive and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure
	controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. Disclosure controls and procedures include,
	without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports
	that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
	in the Commission’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the issuer’s management,
	including its Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate
	to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.










	 












	Identified
	Material Weakness in Internal Controls





	 



	Based
	on that evaluation, our principal executive and principal financial officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and
	procedures as of the end of the period covered by the Quarterly Report were not effective due to a material weakness in the
	design and operating effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting relating to processes and controls over review of information with sufficient precision including proper documentation
	to support accounting conclusions and communication and dissemination of information relevant to financial reporting. As
	defined in SEC Regulation S-X, a material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over
	financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company’s annual
	or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. As a result, even though no material
	misstatement was identified in the financial statements, it was determined that there was a reasonable possibility that a
	material misstatement in the Company’s financial statements would not have been prevented or detected on a timely
	basis.







	 



	Notwithstanding
	the identified material weakness, the Company believes the consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report
	on Form 10-Q fairly represent in all material respects our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows at and for
	the periods presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.




	 










	The
	Company’s Plan to Remediate the Material Weakness






	 

	 



	Our principal executive and principal financial officer is in the preliminary stage of a review of our processes
	and controls over review of information with sufficient precision including proper documentation to support accounting conclusions
	and communication and dissemination of information relevant to financial reporting.  This includes an evaluation of existing
	procedures and controls to formalize, document and implement new policies and procedures for review of our various financial reporting
	processes.








	 










	Changes
	in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting






	 

	 



	Other
	than preceding and as described in Item 4: Disclosure Controls and Procedures, there have been no changes in the Company’s
	internal controls over financial reporting have occurred during the Company’s fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2016 that
	have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting.

	PART II - OTHER INFORMATION



	 





	Item 1. Legal Proceedings



	 


	To the best of our knowledge, there are no legal
	proceedings pending or threatened against us; and there are no actions pending or threatened against any of our directors or officers
	that are adverse to us.



	 






	Item 1A.  Risk Factors



	  



	 


	In addition to the other information set forth
	in this quarterly report on Form10-Q, you should carefully consider the risks discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
	year ended March 31, 2016, which risks could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. There were
	no material changes during the quarter ended December 31, 2016 to the risk factors disclosed in the Company’s Annual Report
	on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2016. These risks are not the only risks facing our Company. Additional risks and uncertainties
	not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial
	condition or future results.


	 






	We have identified a material weaknesses in
	our internal control over financial reporting. Although no material misstatements occurred due to these material weaknesses, we
	have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2016. Our ability to remediate
	these material weaknesses, our discovery of additional weaknesses, and our inability to achieve and maintain effective disclosure
	controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, could adversely affect our results of operations, our stock
	price and investor confidence in our Company.




	 


	Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
	requires that companies evaluate and report on their systems of internal control over financial reporting. As disclosed in more
	detail under Item 4 "Controls and Procedures" of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, we have concluded that our internal
	control over financial reporting was ineffective as of December 31, 2016 due to material weakness in the design and operating effectiveness
	of our internal control over financial reporting as it relates to our lack communication with and documentation from our legal
	department to the President and other financial statements preparers.


	 


	Failure to have effective internal control over
	financial reporting could impair our ability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis and could lead to a restatement
	of our financial statements. If, as a result of deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting, we cannot provide
	reliable financial statements, our business decision processes may be adversely affected, our business and results of operations
	could be harmed, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information and our ability to obtain additional financing,
	or additional financing on favorable terms, could be adversely affected. In addition, failure to maintain effective internal control
	over financial reporting could result in investigations or sanctions by regulatory authorities.


	 


	Our President is currently evaluating options to remediate these material weaknesses, however, remedial actions
	have not started or have only recently been undertaken, and while we expect to implement our remediation plan through 2017, we
	cannot be certain as to when remediation will be fully completed. The material weaknesses will not be considered remediated until
	the remediated controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls
	are operating effectively. Additional details regarding the remediation efforts are disclosed in more detail under Item 4 "Controls
	and Procedures" of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. In addition, we may in the future identify additional internal control
	deficiencies that could rise to the level of a material weakness or uncover errors in financial reporting.
