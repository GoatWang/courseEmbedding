Company Mission & Profile

22nd Century is a plant biotechnology company with an important mission: To Reduce the Harm Caused by Smoking.
Our proprietary genetic engineering technology and plant breeding expertise allow us to regulate the level of nicotine (and other nicotinic alkaloids) in the tobacco plant. As a result of our unique technology, we are able to grow tobacco with up to 97% less nicotine than conventional tobacco – as well as plants with relatively high nicotine levels. The applications for this technology are extraordinary; in independent clinical studies, our very low nicotine (VLN) tobacco has demonstrated remarkable efficacy as a smoking cessation aid. On the other hand, for smokers who do not wish to quit, our high nicotine tobacco enables us to produce a cigarette with what we believe is the world’s lowest tar-to-nicotine ratio.
We have an extensive intellectual property portfolio of issued patents and patent applications relating to the tobacco and cannabis plants.
Goodrich Tobacco Company, LLC, Botanical Genetics, NASCO Products, LLC, and Heracles Pharmaceuticals, LLC are wholly-owned subsidiaries of 22nd Century Group.

Brand A (In Development)













The tobacco in BRAND A contains approximately 95% less nicotine than tobacco in leading cigarette brands. Clinical studies have demonstrated that smokers who smoke very low nicotine (“VLN”) cigarettes containing our proprietary tobacco smoke fewer cigarettes per day resulting in significant reductions in smoke exposure, including “tar,” nicotine and carbon monoxide. Compensatory smoking does not occur with VLN cigarettes containing our proprietary tobacco (Hatsukami  et al. 2010).
In a June 16, 2010 press release, Dr. David Kessler, the former FDA Commissioner, recommended that “[t]he FDA should quickly move to reduce nicotine levels in cigarettes to non-addictive levels. If we reduce the level of the stimulus, we reduce the craving. It is the ultimate harm reduction strategy.” Shortly thereafter in a  Washington Post  newspaper article, Dr. Kessler said that the amount of nicotine in a cigarette should drop from about 10 milligrams to less than 1 milligram. BRAND A  contains approximately 0.7 milligrams of nicotine per cigarette.
A Phase II smoking cessation clinical trial at the University of Minnesota Masonic Comprehensive Cancer Center (Hatsukami  et al. 2010) also measured exposure of various smoke compounds in smokers from smoking a VLN cigarette containing our proprietary tobacco over a six (6)-week period. Smokers significantly reduced their smoking as compared to their usual brand of cigarettes. The number of VLN cigarettes smoked per day on average decreased from 19 (the baseline number of cigarettes of smokers’ usual brand) to 12 by the end of the six (6)-week period, even though participants were instructed to smoke  ad libitum  (as many cigarettes as desired) during treatment. Furthermore, besides significant reductions in other biomarkers, carbon monoxide (CO) levels, an indicator of smoke exposure, significantly decreased from 20 parts per million (baseline) to 15 parts per million. Cotinine, a metabolite and biomarker of nicotine, significantly decreased from 4.2 micrograms/mL (baseline) to 0.2 micrograms/ml. All differences were statistically significant (P<0.05).
A recently completed study led by the University of Pittsburgh directly compared perceptions of and smoking behavior with  SPECTRUM  research cigarettes of different nicotine content produced by us for NIDA in a total of 840 subjects (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01681875). The study included groups of 120 smokers who received VLN cigarettes with the same nicotine level as used in the initial X-22 Phase II-B study or the nicotine level used in the University of Minnesota and Queen Mary University trials.
Utilizing the results of these and other independent clinical trials, we intend to submit to the Center for Tobacco Products (“CTP”) of the FDA an application for  BRAND A  as a Modified Risk Cigarette.
We believe these and other results and future exposure studies the FDA may require will result in a modified risk cigarette claim for  BRAND A. We further believe smokers who desire to smoke fewer cigarettes per day while also satisfying cravings and reducing exposure to nicotine will find  BRAND A  beneficial. There is, however, no guarantee that  BRAND A  will be classified as a Modified Risk Cigarette by the FDA.

Insider Trading Policy









22nd Century Group, Inc.
This Insider Trading Policy (the “Policy”) applies to officers, employees, consultants and directors (the “Associates”) and immediate family members of, and other individuals who share a household with, an Associate (together with the Associates, the “Covered Persons”) of 22nd Century Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company”).
This Policy concerns (a) transactions in the Company’s equity, debt, and derivative securities (collectively, the “Securities”) and (b) the use of Material Nonpublic Information (as defined below) (i) of the Company and (ii) regarding other entities when such Material Nonpublic Information is obtained by an Associate in connection with the Associate’s engagement with the Company.
General Policy
It is the policy of the Company that no Covered Person shall misuse Material Nonpublic Information obtained in connection with the Covered Person’s relationship with the Company.
Mandatory Provisions
1.     No Trading based on Material Nonpublic Information.  No Covered Person shall engage in any transaction involving a purchase or sale of the Company’s Securities (including any offer to purchase or sell) while the Covered Person possesses Material Nonpublic Information concerning the Company.  The period during which this prohibition applies begins on the date that the Covered Person acquires or has access to any Material Nonpublic Information concerning the Company, and ends at the close of business on the second Trading Day (as defined below) following the date of public disclosure of such information, or at such time as such nonpublic information ceases to be material.  The term “Trading Day” means a day on which national stock exchanges and the NASDAQ Stock Market (“NASDAQ”) are open for trading.
2.     Certain Exemptions.  Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 1 hereof, Covered Persons may engage in the following transactions (each, an “Exempt Transaction”) while in possession of Material Nonpublic Information:

Acquisition of the Company’s Securities pursuant to a stock incentive plan or other employee benefit plans (provided, however that this exemption does not apply to the sale of Securities so acquired);
Acquisition of the Company’s Securities pursuant to a previously established election to invest in a Company-sponsored employee benefit plan (provided, however that this exemption does not apply to the sale of Securities so acquired);
Acquisition or disposition of Securities pursuant to a previously established trading plan that complies with the requirements of Rule 10b5-1 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Act”); and
Acquisition or disposition of Securities as a result of a bona fide gift, a transfer by will or the laws of descent.

3.     No Tipping; Confidentiality of Nonpublic Information.  No Covered Person shall disclose to any other person (“Tip”) any Material Nonpublic Information pertaining to the Company.  Further, all nonpublic information relating to the Company is the property of the Company.  The unauthorized disclosure of all such nonpublic information is forbidden regardless of its materiality.
4.     Definition of Material Nonpublic Information.  “Material Nonpublic Information” means information that is both material and nonpublic.  Information should be regarded as “material” if a reasonable person would attach importance to such information in determining whether to buy, sell or hold a company’s equity, debt, or derivative securities.  By way of illustration and not limitation, the following types of information may be material:

Financial results, quarterly or annual reports;
Projections of future earnings or losses;
Pending or proposed mergers, acquisitions, divestitures or joint ventures;
Information regarding a company’s products under development;
Impending bankruptcy or financial liquidity problems;
Gain or loss of a significant customer or supplier;
New product or service announcements of a significant nature;
Significant product or service problems, defects or modifications;
Significant pricing changes;
Stock splits;
New equity or debt offerings;
Actual or threatened litigation; or
Changes in senior management.

Information is considered to be “public” if it has been disseminated such that it is available to investors in the market at large or if it has become a matter of public record as a result of governmental filings.
5.     Prohibition against Short Selling.  No Covered Person may engage in any transaction where the Covered Person may benefit from a decline in the Company’s stock price (a “Short Sale”).  While only officers or directors of the Company are prohibited by law from engaging in Short Sales, the Company has adopted a policy prohibiting all Covered Persons from engaging in such transactions.  Specifically, no Covered Person may, directly or indirectly, sell any Securities of the Company if the Covered Person (i) does not own the Securities sold or (ii) if the Securities are owned, does not either deliver them against such sale within 20 days or does not deposit them in the mail or other usual channels of transportation for such delivery within five (5) days.
6.     Preclearance of Transactions.  All Associates of the Company must consult the Company’s Chief Financial Officer (or individual filling a similar role) before engaging in any acquisition or disposition of the Company’s Securities (“Preclearance”), even during the Window Periods (as defined below).  With regard to transactions pursuant to investment elections in a Company-sponsored employee benefit plan or pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan, Preclearance must be obtained at the time that such election is made or when such trading plan is adopted or amended.
Preclearance is intended to serve the following functions:

Prevent inadvertent insider trading violations;
Assist directors and officers in complying with their reporting obligations under Federal securities laws; and
Verify compliance with any other obligations under applicable laws.

Rule Applicable to Blackout Group
Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, certain Associates (including all officers and directors of the Company) designated in writing from time to time by the Company (collectively, the “Blackout Group”) may not buy or sell the Company’s securities during the “Blackout Periods.”  Members of the Blackout Group may buy or sell Company’s Securities only during Window Periods.  The Blackout Period restrictions do not apply to Exempt Transactions.
Blackout Periods begin on the first day of each new quarter following a Window Period and last until the third business day following the earlier of the issuance of (a) an earnings release for a completed quarter or year, or (b) a periodic report on Form 10-Q or Form 10-K.  For example, if the Company does not file an earnings release for a completed fiscal year and does not file its Form 10-K until April 1st, then the Blackout Period would run from January 1st to the third business day after the Company filed its Form 10-Q for its first quarter which will usually be around May 15th.
Window Periods are the dates that are not included in the Blackout Periods.  Thus, Window Periods run from the third business day following the earlier of (a) the issuance of an earnings release for the most recently completed quarter or year, or (b) the filing of a periodic report on Form 10-Q or 10-K for such most recently completed quarter or year.  Such Window Period would end on the last day of the fiscal quarter or year following the quarter or year to which the periodic report or earnings release related to.  For example, if a Form 10-K is filed on March 1st, then the Window Period would begin three business days after such filing and would end on March 31st.
Trading in the Company’s Securities during Window Periods should not be considered a “safe harbor,” and all Associates should use good judgment at all times.
Recommended Guidelines for the Non-Blackout Group
In addition to the foregoing restrictions on trading, the Company recommends that all Associates who are not included in the Blackout Group only engage in transactions involving Company Securities during a “Window Period” as defined above.
Violations; Penalties
All Associates should consult the Company’s Chief Financial Officer (or individual filling a similar role) with any questions they might have, before engaging in a transaction regarding the Company’s Securities.  Officers and supervisors (each, a “Control Person”) must take reasonable measures to ensure that all Associates under the Control Person’s supervision who are reasonably likely to have access to Material Nonpublic Information are aware of insider trading laws.  Failure to do so can subject the Control Persons to liability.  Any suspected violation of insider trading laws or this Policy must be promptly reported in writing to the Company’s Chief Financial Officer (or individual filling a similar role).  Anyone who violates insider trading laws or this Policy is subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination with cause.
Under Federal securities laws, an individual who engages in insider trading is subject to:

Civil fines by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) of up to three times the profit gained or loss avoided;
Injunctive action by the SEC;
Private actions for rescission or damages; and
Criminal fines up to $5 million and a prison sentence up to 20 years.

The Company, as well as any implicated Control Person, is subject to liability if the Company or the Control Person knew and recklessly disregarded the fact that a person directly or indirectly under the Company’s or the Control Person’s control was likely to engage in insider trading and failed to take appropriate steps to prevent such an act before it occurred.  The Company or a Control Person may face civil liability up to the greater of $1 million or three times the profit gained or loss avoided as a result of the inside trade as well as criminal fines of up to $25 million.
Covered Persons may also be liable for improper transactions by any person (a “Tippee”) to whom they have disclosed Material Nonpublic Information.  The SEC has imposed large penalties even when the disclosing person did not profit from the trading by a Tippee.
Applicability of Policy to Inside Information Regarding Other Companies
This Policy and the guidelines described herein apply to Material Nonpublic Information relating to other publicly traded companies when such information is obtained in connection with a Covered Person’s relationship with the Company.  In addition to civil and criminal penalties, termination of an Associate (with cause) may result from trading on, or providing a Tip with regard to, such Material Nonpublic Information.  All Covered Persons should treat nonpublic information obtained in connection with their relationship with the Company regarding other companies and entities with the same care and confidentiality as they would treat nonpublic information about the Company.
Additional Information – Directors and Officers
Directors and officers of the Company must also comply with the reporting obligations and limitations on short-swing transactions set forth in Section 16 of the Act.  The practical effect of these provisions is that directors and officers who both purchase and sell the Company’s securities within a six (6) month period must disgorge all profits to the Company, whether or not they had any Material Nonpublic Information about the Company.  Under these provisions, and so long as certain other criteria are met, the receipt of an option under the Company’s equity incentive (or similar) plans and the exercise of that option are not deemed “purchases” for the purposes of Section 16; however, the sale of any Securities so acquired are deemed to be “sales” for the purposes of Section 16.
Miscellaneous
Please direct your questions as to any of the matters discussed in this Policy to the Company’s Chief Financial Officer.  Every Associate of the Company has the individual responsibility to comply with this Policy.  The guidelines set forth in this Policy are guidelines only, and appropriate judgment should be exercised in connection with any trade in the Company’s Securities to the extent it is not explicitly prohibited.  An Associate may, from time to time, have to forego a proposed transaction in the Company’s Securities even if he or she planned to make the transaction before learning of the Material Nonpublic Information and even though the Associate believes he or she may suffer an economic loss or forego anticipated profit by waiting.

Company Profile












22nd Century is a plant biotechnology company with an important mission: To Reduce the Harm Caused by Smoking.
Our long-term focus is the research, development, licensing, manufacturing, and worldwide sales and distribution of our important products. 22nd Century Group’s proprietary genetic engineering technology and plant breeding expertise allow us to regulate the level of nicotine (and other nicotinic alkaloids) in the tobacco plant. As a result of our unique technology, we are able to grow tobacco with up to 97% less nicotine than conventional tobacco – as well as plants with relatively high nicotine levels. The applications for this technology are extraordinary; in independent clinical studies, our very low nicotine (VLN) tobacco has demonstrated remarkable efficacy as a smoking cessation aid. On the other hand, for smokers who do not wish to quit, our high nicotine tobacco enables us to produce a cigarette with what we believe is the world’s lowest tar-to-nicotine ratio.
We believe that the tobacco industry is at the beginning of a paradigm shift toward the development and commercialization of reduced-risk tobacco products which represent a significant step toward achieving the public health objective of harm reduction. Our 18 years of research and development on the tobacco plant, mainly on the nicotine biosynthetic pathway, uniquely positions us to become a major benefactor of this paradigm shift developing in the tobacco industry. Our technology has created, and will continue to develop, a pipeline of products. We are primarily involved in the following activities:

The international licensing of 22nd Century Ltd’s technology, proprietary tobaccos, and trademarks
The research and development of potentially reduced-risk or modified risk tobacco products
The development of X-22, a prescription-based smoking cessation aid consisting of very low nicotine cigarettes
The manufacture, marketing and international distribution of RED SUN and MAGIC proprietary cigarettes
The production of SPECTRUM research cigarettes for the National Institute of Drug Abuse (NIDA)
The contract manufacturing of other companies’ branded tobacco products








22nd Century Group is organized around the following wholly-owned operating subsidiaries:

Goodrich Tobacco is focused on commercial tobacco products and potentially less harmful cigarettes.
Botanical Genetics is focused on natural, safe and effective cannabis-based products for human health, well-being and nutrition, in addition to industrial products refined from cannabis.
Heracles Pharmaceuticals is focused on X-22, a prescription smoking cessation aid in development.
NASCO Products is our manufacturing facility located in Mocksville, NC.

22nd Century Group: Big Trouble For Big Tobacco - How The Big Are Falling Behind - 22nd Century Group, Inc. (NYSEMKT:XXII) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»22nd Century Group: Big Trouble For Big Tobacco - How The Big Are Falling BehindFeb.22.17 | About: 22nd Century (XXII) Lost Avenue, L.L.C. Growth, momentum, contrarian, biotechThe Lost AvenueSummaryIndustry wide regulations.New laws, new markets, new products.22nd Century Group patented technology across a wide variety of products.Management team experienced and positioned to drive shareholder value.March 6th 2017 is a big day for the tobacco industry. The FDA tobacco advisory panel meeting is set and will be discussing a slew of information including modified risk tobacco products as well as new statutory regulations. 22nd Century Group Inc, (NYSEMKT:XXII) is uniquely positioned to be both small upstart disruptor, as well as a key driving force across the entire "smoking" industry. Companies like Philip Morris (NYSE:PM), Altria Group (NYSE:MO), British American Tobacco Industries (NYSEMKT:BTI), Reynolds American (NYSE:RAI), and Vector Group (NYSE:VGR), have all been positioning themselves in the ongoing pursuit of a reduced exposure tobacco product, as well as into the emerging cannabis/hemp frontier. PM has gone so far as to outright say they want to eliminate cigarettes altogether. Sort of unbelievable I know, but evidence can be read here. Whether an attempt to push a new product line on the public, or a sincere thought, it is evident that Philip Morris is concerned and positioning themselves for a smoke-free future. BTI's own push for a shift into a sustainable business model can be found here as well. RAI was a step ahead of the game and came out with their attempt at a heat not burn (HNB) product that had a very small group of support in the end. Their 2014 press release gave high praise to the product. If one thing can be learned from previous attempts at the HNB products, it's that something is wrong. From an ex-smoker's perspective the issue lies in the device and process itself. Smokers want to feel something when they are smoking. They enjoy the throaty draw, the feeling of the filter in their fingertips, the sizzle as they inhale, followed by the euphoric rush of nicotine into the blood stream. Lets face it. Heat not burn lacks in all categories. The answer: 22nd Century Group's very high nicotine (VHN) leaf. The patented technology that XXII has allows them to essentially flip the switches of the genes of the plant to allow various levels of nicotine to be present. If you combine the high potency nicotine leaf with the various contraptions marketed to be a healthier alternative you will undoubtedly find something that the consumer actually enjoys.
 The 22nd Century Group's mission is to reduce the harm caused by smoking. Not only will the VHN product play a key role in unlocking the power of the HNB industries for the big tobacco groups, but the proprietary technology also produces a very low nicotine (VLN) leaf. The VLN product, which is currently being studied and tested by numerous research groups including the FDA and the Center for Tobacco Products (NYSEMKT:CTP), boasts a nicotine level less than that of a tomato! XXII is currently in the late stages of development of its smoking cessation aide dubbed X-22. Info on the product can be found here as well as 15 published studies here. The basis of the program, that of which has been proven in the trials, is a step down process that weans the users body off of the need for nicotine. You begin with the average amount of nicotine to be found in a standard cigarette which is between 12-14 mg and slowly work your way down to the VLN product which is a .04 mg product. At .04 mg, the level less than that of a tomato (7.1 ng/g of nicotine), studies have shown that the user gets just enough to be satisfied, but not enough nicotine to become addicted. Again, from an ex-smokers perspective that is beyond words. Oh how I would have loved to have that product instead of cold turkey and withdrawal symptoms. For the big tobacco players that are sitting in the March 6th advisory panel meeting, where they will be discussing reduced exposure, modified risk products, and statutory regulations, that technology is priceless. The World Health Organization (WHO) has a tobacco free initiative aiming to put pressure on regulatory authorities to control and eliminate smoking. If you haven't been made aware you can also read about that here. Countries like New Zealand, who aims to eliminate smoking by 2020, are joining the movement. All around Asia, Europe, Africa and the Americas the push for regulation and more importantly, a choice, is grabbing hold. Not only does XXII hold the patents on the technology to make this possible, it means they are the only entity able to produce products aimed at helping people quit, as well as making smoking a choice, not a need.
 They aren't seeking to just become the first company with an FDA approved cessation product you actually smoke, or a very low nicotine cigarette that can be marketed as such through the first ever modified risk tobacco product approval, but they are shaking up the Hemp and Cannabis worlds as well. Through their wholly owned subsidiary, Botanical Genetics, they have had tremendous breakthroughs in the control of the cannabis plant. Along the same lines as nicotine levels, the company is able to essentially flip the switches on and off of the various alkaloids that make up the cannabis plant to adjust the levels as needed by the end user. The implications in this are massive as we move into a new revolution on the cannabis and hemp front. In the recent years more than 30 states have now passed legislation allowing the cultivation of industrial hemp for commercial, research, and/or pilot programs. Not to mention the 2016 ballot initiatives that were passed making the long list of states allowing recreational and medical marijuana to become legal even longer. Again, this is patent protected technology that XXII owns meaning they are the only company able to provide this service to researches, industrial and commercial cultivators, as well as the medical and recreational fields. XXII is uniquely positioned to help both industries, Hemp and Cannabis, achieve fully legal status across our great nation by being the only company able to provide a 0 THC option. Proof of big tobacco's positioning into the cannabis and hemp world can be found easily. In fact I'll make it easy and offer this. The article details PM's $20m investment into the Israel based company Syqe whose lead product is a medical cannabis inhaler system. As the world progresses, new legislation is expected to reflect its view from the current administration. President Trump has explicitly stated it is the individual State's rights to chose and the Attorney General Sessions has made the comment saying that his job is to enforce the laws of the nation set forth by Congress. To further, he stated that if Congress wanted to make it federally legal then that is what they should do.
 So that is what they are attempting. The Cannabis Caucus which is comprised of both Republicans and Democrats is growing in number. Each administration has seen an easing in the Congress on the topic. A great article supporting these claims can be found here. Normally what is a forward looking field in the world of big tobacco has been caught off guard by the small upstart 22nd Century Group Inc,. As regulation progresses, the world changes, and health is more of a focus, there is no stopping the company from being a powerhouse in multiple billion dollar industries. As of 3Q 2016 the company had $5.1m cash on hand with current annual sales of 11.9m. As value chains are explored the revenue is primed to grow exponentially over the coming months and years making the days current stock price of .93 and market cap of 81.60m a true opportunity for growth.

22nd Century Group, Inc. Key Developments

22nd Century Receives Guidance from FDA on Phase III Clinical Trials
Jun 22 17
22nd Century Group, Inc. announced that on June 20, 2017, the company and its wholly owned subsidiary, Heracles Pharmaceuticals, participated in a meeting with the multi-discipline review team in the Division of Anesthesia, Analgesia, and Addiction Products at the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) of the U.S.  Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regarding the company’s Investigational New Drug Application (IND) for 22nd Century’s X-22prescription-based smoking cessation product in development so that it may become available for doctors to prescribe to help their patients to stop smoking. The meeting with the FDA/CDER was very positive and productive.  FDA/CDER and the company will work to reach agreement on the company’s design and implementation of two parallel, Phase III clinical trials to be conducted by the company in various parts of the United States to show that the company’s X-22prescription-based smoking cessation product will result in a more robust quit rate in smoking as compared to existing smoking cessation products that are already in the market in the U.S. The company believes that it will be able to achieve such robust results.


22nd Century Group, Inc. and The University of Virginia Launch a Project for Utilizing Novel Varieties of Industrial Hemp to Clean Up and Reclaim Abandoned Mine Lands and Other Polluted Areas
Jun 20 17
22nd Century Group, Inc. announced that, together with The University of Virginia (UVA), it has launched a project aimed at utilizing novel varieties of industrial hemp to clean up and reclaim abandoned mine lands and other polluted areas. These polluted lands will be returned to productive use and cultivation through a cost-effective, plant-based process known as “phytoremediation.” 22nd Century has developed proprietary hemp plants that are particularly well-suited for use in phytoremediation. These plants feature rapid growth rates and are highly efficient at absorbing toxins, metals and other soil contaminants. Similar varieties of hemp proved extremely effective in helping to remediate the land after the nuclear accidents at Chernobyl, Ukraine and Fukushima, Japan. In addition to removing contamination, hemp’s deep tap roots alter soil structure, aerate the soil, and add organic matter deep into the soil profile. In the Commonwealth of Virginia and elsewhere throughout the Appalachians, coal mining and other environmentally damaging activities have left behind vast stretches of compacted, polluted and generally untillable soil. This summer, researchers at UVA and its affiliate, UVA at Wise, will begin testing industrial hemp varieties developed by the 22nd Century-UVA partnership to improve soils in Virginia. Because there are more than 30,000 sites that require soil remediation in the United States alone, phytoremediation is expected to become a significant area of business for 22nd Century. UVA and 22nd Century will also investigate other uses of their phytoremediation hemp plants in Virginia, including the production of fiber, oils and other high value products, thus creating lucrative secondary markets for 22nd Century. Based at the UVA-Wise campus, this landmark project reaches beyond conventional hemp remediation applications because UVA and 22nd Century are employing their combined biotechnology expertise to produce improved proprietary hemp varieties that are specifically designed for soil remediation. Such novel and powerful proprietary plants promise to become a central tool in farmland decontamination initiatives around the world.


22nd Century Group, Inc. Meets with FDA on Modified Risk Tobacco Product Application for Nicotine Tobacco Cigarettes
Jun 16 17
22nd Century Group, Inc. announced that the company and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Goodrich Tobacco Company, held a very encouraging and productive meeting with the office of science of the Center for Tobacco Products (CTP) of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Based on written feedback received ahead of the meeting, and on the positive exchange between Goodrich and the FDA at the meeting itself, the company will now move forward with a significantly expanded Modified Risk Tobacco Product (MRTP) application with the CTP/FDA for the company’s BRAND A Very Low Nicotine (VLN) cigarettes.

Getting To The Details At 22nd Century Group, Inc. - 22nd Century Group, Inc. (NYSEMKT:XXII) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Getting To The Details At 22nd Century Group, Inc.Apr.12.17 | About: 22nd Century (XXII) Samuel Rae Currencies, gold, biotech, healthcareSummaryReduced or low nicotine cigarettes are potentially an important part of the future of the tobacco industry.That the FDA now controls the industry (effectively) makes for an uncertain regulatory landscape, but one that will likely favor smoking cessation products.22nd Century Group is one of the most prominent names in this area and it's trying to do what Vector Group failed to do with its lead technology.It's doing this with a second generation version, meaning there's a chance it will succeed where Vector failed.It's a risky allocation, as financing through equity issue is almost an inevitability, but if its Brand A gets a regulatory green light, there's plenty of reward on offer. The reduced nicotine approach smoking cessation has been the subject of hot debate for the past ten years. If a person smokes cigarettes that have a very low nicotine content, this should theoretically reduce their dependence on nicotine, and in turn, their desire to smoke cigarettes (for the purposes of this discussion, we're going to fall in line with the suggestion that it's the nicotine that's the root of addiction, and not alternative theories). It sounds like a decent theory, but there are plenty of counterpoints that opponents to the low nicotine content use to rebuke the implications of any such move. Smokers might consume more cigarettes in an attempt to compensate for the reduced per-smoke amount. The same smokers might over-smoke a cigarette, which studies suggest can result in a threefold increase in the amount of tar inhaled per cigarette. These counterpoints noted, however, there's a lot of evidence that suggests the reduced nicotine hypothesis is well founded. Here's one from 2012, one from 2013 and one from 2014. These are university and cancer center conducted studies, involving anything from 100 to 1,300 participants, all of which have concluded that reducing the nicotine levels in a cigarette can reduce the number of cigarettes a person smokes across a predefined period of time and/or result in an improved quit rate when used in conjunction with standard of care smoking cessation products, as opposed to the latter on their own. The most recent study in the field, and the one generally regarded as a pivotal investigation into the matter, was funded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and conducted at the University of Pittsburgh. It was published in the New England Journal of Medicine in October 2015 (link) and compared the impact of a very low nicotine product to a standard (participant's usual) brand in cigarettes smoked and quit attempts. The study concluded that participants in the active arm (very low nicotine) cigarettes smoked fewer cigarettes per day (14.9) than those in control (22.2). It also concluded that participants in the active arm doubled their quit attempts versus those in control. Again, it's important to note the limitations of this study. Over-smoking, as described above, is tough to qualify conclusively. As is the potential for inaccurate participant self-reporting. Whatever the reality of the dispute, the prevailing trend seems to fall in favor of the suggestion that reduced nicotine can be beneficial. The so-called FDA Deeming Rule, which for those not familiar with it essentially handed over control to the FDA over anything that contains nicotine, reinforces this trend. It came into force in August last year, and the industry has been trying to forecast the impact of said rule ever since. So by now, readers are asking where we're going with this. Well, Big Tobacco has opposing views on the matter. The above-mentioned Deeming Rule is basically the completion of a rule that first hit press back in 2009, on the back of an Obama bill. Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE:MO) supported it. Pretty much every other big player did not. This means that there are companies that are willing to embrace the shift, and indeed, some (read: Altria) that are likely looking to get a jump on the competition because they know it's just a matter of time before the FDA mandates nicotine reduction. So here's the point: If the FDA does mandate said reduction, there's only one company that has the capability to grow tobacco plants that contain nicotine levels at or around the level reported by the WHO as being a threshold for causing addiction. This company is 22nd Century Group, Inc. (NYSEMKT:XXII). Some reading might already be familiar with the name. It's fallen in and out of favor with markets at various points across the last seven years, and a number of Seeking Alpha authors have expressed various, and often opposing, opinions as to its prospects. For those new to the company, however, it's a plant biotechnology company that has developed, and patented, a method of producing tobacco that contains the above-mentioned, below addiction threshold, nicotine concentration. Well, to be a little more accurate, it was developed at North Carolina State University on the back of a funding grant from Joseph Pandolfino, 22nd's founder. It was then sublicensed to Vector Group Ltd. (NYSE:VGR), with the goal of the latter developing a brand (which it did, called Quest) of low nicotine cigarettes and carrying the brand through an FDA approval process so as to allow the company to market Quest as a smoking cessation product. It didn't work out that way. Vector conducted a Phase II study (results here) and then said it wasn't going to push for a Phase III. 22nd Century took Vector to court, got back the rights to the grow process and also won the rights to use the Vector-generated data in its own FDA submissions. During this period, 22nd Century conducted a raft of its own studies (funded by public institutions such as NCSU) and refined its technology. This is very important. The technology that 22nd Century relies on now, and that for which it has a suite of patents, is a so-called second generation technology. This affords it certain advantages over the Quest product that Vector tried to market. The company has taken this technology and produced a branded product called Brand A, which is the very low nicotine product on which the majority of its current valuation lies. Right now, it's trying to get the FDA to approve it as a smoking cessation product by way of an application process that we'll look at shortly. So, the situation is this: 22nd developed the technology with NCSU then licensed it to Vector. Vector branded the Quest product and tried to get it approved as a smoking cessation product. Vector didn't manage to do this, and 22nd Century spent the period in and around Vector's abandoning of the product refining the technology in conjunction with, again, NCSU. It's now taken that refined technology, used it to produce a second generation brand (Brand A) and is trying to do what Vector failed to do, but with a superior product. The company submitted a Modified Risk Tobacco Product (MRTP) application to the FDA in an attempt to achieve this aim, but received feedback earlier this year detailing the agency's requiring of more data to support the very low nicotine claim. Exactly what the agency wants remains unclear (it's rare we get much insight from either a company or the agency in these sorts of situations) but we know that the resubmission needs to "include additional scientific data and information from already completed clinical studies." The implications of this working are, then, that 22nd Century isn't going to have to conduct any more trials to support its application. That's an assumption based on wording, but it's a reasonable one. This is important because additional trials would require funding, and the fewer shares the company has to issue between now and any potential regulatory green light, the better. Regardless, management has decided that on the back of the feedback, it's going to split the MRTP into two parts - a Premarket Tobacco Product (PMT) application and a separate MRTP application. The former is essentially an application that will allow the company to start selling the product (but not label it as a smoking cessation aid), and the time to approval on this is expected to be shorter than that of a combined submission. The next major catalyst, then, is rooted in this application. There was some concern among Big Tobacco that the FDA taking control of the industry would result in the approval for sale of very few new tobacco products. Indeed, there's some suggestion that the above-mentioned support of the initial Bill by Altria was rooted in this concept - no or few new products would essentially monopolize the market for the existing brands. Whatever, the reality, the result of the PMT application will say a lot about how the FDA views the low nicotine cigarette, and specifically, 22nd Century's Brand A. If it gets approval for sale, it suggests that the agency deems it as potentially having a positive impact on the tobacco space from a health perspective. This, in turn, suggests that 22nd Century can get its MRTP approved, even if it takes a little longer, assuming it can provide the data the FDA has requested to bolster the submission. Management initially stated that it expects to submit the revised (and separate) applications at some point this year. In a recent letter to shareholders, CEO Henry Sicignano refined this to a filing of both before the end of the first half of the year. That means we should see submissions this quarter, and serves up the potential for an approval of the PMT (at least) before the end of 2017. If the PMT is approved, the MRTP could (should) follow during 2018, at which point, 22nd Century will become the only company in the US with an FDA approved very low nicotine smoking cessation cigarette. Combine this with the industry trends outlined in the introduction to this piece, and the evidence that supports the impact said type of cigarette can have on smoking habits, and it paints the company as a potential winner. How do things stand financially? The latest report (this 10-K, released March 8, 2017) put cash on hand at a little over $13.46 million at December 31, 2016. Burn comes in at circa $750,000 monthly, and management expects (with these expectations supported by the just mentioned numbers) current cash to last through May 2018. There's the potential for up to $7 million in milestone payments based on a 2013 licensing arrangement with British American Tobacco plc (BTI), which expires this coming October, but the two companies have been tight lipped on how this is progressing and/or will play out. Since information related to this agreement is thin on the ground, it's sensible to exclude the potential for milestone cash from any cash runway calculations. Revenues for the full year 2016 hit $12.27 million, up from $8.52 million in 2015, and net loss for the two years in question came in pretty much unchanged at $11.58 million and $11.03 million respectively. There are a couple of things to note here on these revenue figures. Management, in its latest letter to shareholders, outlined the fact that many of 22nd Century's shareholders would like to see the company reduce (or even terminate) the commercialization efforts it currently undertakes with a few of its legacy tobacco brands. The reduction, these holders argue, would free up resources to focus on the pharmaceutical and regulatory side of things - a side that has the potential to dramatically outweigh the current commercial operations in terms of revenue generation. Again referencing the shareholder letter, CEO Sicignano suggested that the company was taking these shareholder opinions on board (to a degree), and he made reference to regulatory efforts in the UK as representative of this point. This is important, because chances are we're not going to see any substantial rise in revenues over the coming year or two, while the regulatory side of the operations take center stage. The company, in taking this approach, is positioning itself more as a development stage biotechnology company, in the sense that it's focusing capital resources on bringing a product to market and running at a loss, in anticipation of loss recovery once it picks up a regulatory green light. This, of course, increases the risk of dilution. Biotechnology stocks need shareholder cash to get them over the regulatory line, and this shift from commercial to regulatory focus increases the dilution an early position in 22nd Century is going to have to withstand. So, on that note, what are the risks? Well, there are a few, but the primary looks to be financing requirement. We touched on the chances of 22nd Century needing cash to fund any further data collection a little earlier, and while this looks unlikely based on the FDA response wording, it's an uncertainty, and therefore a risk factor. Data collection aside, 22nd Century is almost certainly going to need to raise to fund operational expenses before it can hope to get its MRTP green light, and then again to fund a commercial launch of its Brand A product. All of these issues are going to impact the value of a holding picked up near term. This impact isn't necessarily prohibitive to an exposure, but they need to be considered ahead of taking a position. Add in the fact that this is a small cap play, reliant on an approval pathway that another company has already failed to traverse (albeit with an inferior product) and there's added uncertainty surrounding the potential for regulatory success, and time to said success. Added time amplifies the primary financing risk. All said, however, these are considered risks that come as part and parcel of a development stage healthcare or biotechnology company. The upside potential is real if the regulatory and commercial elements of 22nd Century's pathway combine favorably, and at its current valuation, it's not just real, it's very large. Looking at potential time frames, the current applications with the FDA probably won't come back approved (in their entirety, so we're talking about both the PMT and the MRTP here) before the end of 2018. At this point, the company can start to capitalize on the FDA designation and start to bring in revenues as a cessation product. Of course, cross-referencing this with the above capital requirement risk probably means we're going to see a raise before May 2018, which will bridge the gap to the application-return catalyst, and then a second raise at some point close to the end of next year to raise capital to fund commercialization efforts.

Company Mission & Profile

22nd Century is a plant biotechnology company with an important mission: To Reduce the Harm Caused by Smoking.
Our proprietary genetic engineering technology and plant breeding expertise allow us to regulate the level of nicotine (and other nicotinic alkaloids) in the tobacco plant. As a result of our unique technology, we are able to grow tobacco with up to 97% less nicotine than conventional tobacco – as well as plants with relatively high nicotine levels. The applications for this technology are extraordinary; in independent clinical studies, our very low nicotine (VLN) tobacco has demonstrated remarkable efficacy as a smoking cessation aid. On the other hand, for smokers who do not wish to quit, our high nicotine tobacco enables us to produce a cigarette with what we believe is the world’s lowest tar-to-nicotine ratio.
We have an extensive intellectual property portfolio of issued patents and patent applications relating to the tobacco and cannabis plants.
Goodrich Tobacco Company, LLC, Botanical Genetics, NASCO Products, LLC, and Heracles Pharmaceuticals, LLC are wholly-owned subsidiaries of 22nd Century Group.
