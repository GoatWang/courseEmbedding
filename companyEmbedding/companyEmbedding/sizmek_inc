FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

How Creative Agencies Can Find Success With DCO


Kelsey Meuse



                    Dynamic creative optimisation (DCO) technology combines online media’s rich data resources with creative in an incredibly powerful way. Rather than build one single ad that is delivered to all consumers, creative agencies can develop a number of concepts and use technology to serve different permutations to varying audiences.

What Sizmek Thinks About the New Better Ads Standards


Sizmek



                    From high-impact programmatic executions to advanced data-driven techniques for viewability and verification, advancements in digital advertising are creating new opportunities for creating connection with audiences every day. But this progress means we need to understand and establish standards to create that connection. The Coalition for Better Ads (CBA) recently undertook a first stab at putting together its initial Better Ads Standards—and it’s created some questions that we’d like to help answer.

Dr. Mark Grether, Executive Chairman

Mark is the Executive Chairman of Sizmek, where he is focused on guiding the company and its leadership team and accelerating the growth of the business. Prior to Sizmek, Mark was the cofounder and global Chief Operating Officer of WPP’s Xaxis, which under his leadership grew into the largest programmatic media company in the world, with more than $1 billion in revenue in just five years. Prior to Xaxis, he was Global Development Director of GroupM, the world’s largest media investment group, where he was instrumental in setting up GroupM’s digital trading desk across 10 countries. Mark also spent time in academia, teaching at university in Germany after receiving his PhD in Marketing from the University of Mannheim, until the lure of real-world marketing data drew him onto the ever-compelling advertising technology trajectory. Since 2011, Mark has lived in New York City with his wife and two sons, who he attempts to one up at soccer each weekend—but they’ve got mad skills.










Ken Saunders, Chief Financial Officer

Ken Saunders joined Sizmek as CFO in October 2014. He brings global financial expertise to Sizmek, having served as Chief Financial Officer at a number of technology companies. Prior to Sizmek, Saunders was a Partner at Black Dragon Capital, where he served as CFO of two portfolio companies he helped establish: Fortress Risk Management (a fraud monitoring and compliance solutions company) and Payveris (a next generation payments platform company). Prior to those roles, he was CFO of BeyondTrust Software, where he helped acquire and integrate six companies helping to triple revenues in his first two years with the company. Saunders joined BeyondTrust from Bazaarvoice, Inc., where, as the company's first CFO, he helped establish the company's financial processes and controls, corporate information systems and develop its IT organization, while helping to triple revenues over his tenure.










Rachel Walkden, Chief Operating Officer

Rachel Walkden is Chief Operating Officer of Sizmek. A born productivity buff, Rachel focuses on delivering world-class service and support to Sizmek’s clients around the globe. Whether you drive the platform yourself or Sizmek does it on your behalf, Rachel leads a team of ops ninjas who partner with you every step of the way from day one. Rachel has many years of experience in digital media operations, including leading global operations at Operative, growing the services business there three-fold, and as COO for Ringleader Digital, scaling up the business more than ten-fold. When not focused on figuring out ways for Sizmek to serve its customers better, Rachel likes to be doing something adventurous and vaguely dangerous.










Volker Hatz, Chief Data Officer

As Chief Data Officer, Volker Hatz oversees Sizmek’s fast-growing data business, including data governance solutions and analytics initiatives, and product marketing. Prior to joining Sizmek, Volker was Global Head of SAP XM DMP Solution at SAP Exchange Media. Throughout his career, he’s played key roles in creating groundbreaking technology to bring structure to the stores of data that digital advertising has uncovered, including the first demand-side advertising platform, the first second-party data management platform, and the first real-time cookie-less targeting. When Volker’s not driving innovation in data or spending time with his wife and four children, he’s swinging his nine iron on the golf course, aiming for that elusive hole in one.










Mike Caprio, Chief Growth Officer

As Chief Growth Officer, Mike oversees Sizmek’s partnerships, business development, global holding companies, supply solutions, programmatic business unit, and Peer39.  Mike’s 20-year career spans across traditional and digital advertising, leading companies such as Disney, CBS, and Visible World, and cofounding SWMX, the first demand-side and supply-side platform for buying TV and radio.  When Mike’s not growing new business for Sizmek, you can probably find him making a mean marinara sauce for his wife and two sons down at the Jersey shore or obsessing over the latest Yankees, Giants, Knicks, or Rangers game—Mike’s a superfan and doesn’t take a season off.   










Canaan Schladale-Zink, General Manager, Americas 

Canaan Schladale-Zink is Sizmek’s General Manager of the Americas. With more than a decade of experience in sales and operations, Canaan now leads one of the most dynamic teams in the ad tech industry. Canaan started his career in television advertising at Katz Media Group, where his curiosity and youthful naiveté of corporate red tape led him to selling one of the first online video deals for the organization. At that point, he was hooked on digital advertising, and moved to Eyewonder, which was acquired by Sizmek, and launched him on the trajectory to helping major advertisers and agencies navigate the complex creative, media, and tech landscape across display, mobile, video, social, and programmatic advertising.










Andrew Bloom, General Manager, EMEA

Andrew Bloom is General Manager, EMEA, where he leads Sizmek’s sales teams, publisher business, and business development efforts. Before Andrew acquired so many initials in his title, he was in charge of partner development at Spot Runner and led acquisitions, partnerships, strategy, and innovation at Getty Images. In his previous life, Andrew was also a senior associate at New York-based Accelerator Group, and a corporate lawyer at Davis Polk & Wardwell and Slaughter and May. In his nonworking hours, Andrew loves to obsess over football (a.k.a. “soccer”): coaching his son’s team, playing for Geezer FC every weekend at sunrise, or watching his beloved Arsenal.










Kees de Jong, General Manager, APAC

As Sizmek’s General Manager of APAC, Kees de Jong oversees the growth and development of customer engagement, sales development and innovation, strategic planning, regional presence, and revenue growth in the Asia-Pacific region. Prior to Sizmek, Kees held senior management positions at Facilitate Digital (now Adslot) in Australia, and ran the company’s European operations for two years before establishing the programmatic buying capability for GroupM (now Xaxis). Most recently, he was a consultant, serving large media, tech, and data companies. When Kees isn’t digging up new business innovations, you can find him riding on a large tractor as he farms copious amounts of garlic, ginger, and turmeric on his organic farm near Sydney.
