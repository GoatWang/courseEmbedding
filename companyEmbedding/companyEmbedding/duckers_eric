Eric Duckers, M.D., Joins Okyanos Heart Institute Medical Advisory Council
Dr. Duckers, Head of Molecular Cardiology Laboratory at The Thoraxcenter, Erasmus University Medical Center Rotterdam, to Contribute Expertise on Cell and Molecular Cardiovascular Biology 



 Freeport, Bahamas, The,  July 28, 2012 --(PR.com)-- Okyanos Heart Institute (http://www.okyanos.com/), which brings a new standard of care and a better quality of life to patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) using cardiac cell therapy, has announced the expansion of its medical advisory council with the addition of Eric Duckers, M.D., Ph.D., FESC, FACC. Dr. Duckers serves as an interventional cardiologist and the head of the Molecular Cardiology Laboratory at the Thoraxcenter, Erasmus University Medical Center Rotterdam in the Netherlands. He is the principal investigator of the ADVANCE trial, which treats patients within 24 hours of an acute heart attack using cells from a person’s own fat tissue, known as adipose-derived stem and regenerative cells. Previously, Duckers served as an investigator for the PRECISE trial, which treated patients with chronic coronary artery disease who had exhausted all options from conventional treatment and upon which the Okyanos Heart Institute cardiac cell therapy treatment is based. As a member of the medical advisory council, Duckers will provide extensive insight on cell biology and the mechanisms of action that these cells have on improving heart function and repairing damage to the heart muscle as a result of a heart attack.Duckers obtained his doctorate degree from the Rudolf Magnus Institute in 1993, which preceded his work as a postdoctoral fellow at the Netherlands Institute for Brain Research. He received his Doctorate of Medicine cum laude at the University of Utrecht and has visited various research centers across the United States, including the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute in Bethesda, Md., St. Elizabeth’s Medical Center at Tufts University in Boston and the Cardiovascular Research Center at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, where he worked from 1996 to 1999. Following his studies, he independently established a molecular cardiovascular biology program and a clinical cardiovascular stem cell therapy program for acute and chronic coronary artery disease at the Thoraxcenter, Erasmus University Medical Center Rotterdam.The Okyanos Medical Advisory Council serves as a leadership council to provide medical guidelines and innovation in cardiac cell therapy and to further assist Okyanos Heart Institute in providing the highest standard of care to patients with chronic coronary artery disease.Quotes:“A key opinion leader in cardiac cell therapy research, Dr. Duckers provides an extensive understanding and working knowledge of cell biology and mechanisms as they relate to improving heart function and repairing damaged heart tissue,” said Howard T. Walpole Jr., M.D., MBA, FACC, FACAI, FSCAI and chief medical officer for Okyanos Heart Institute. “We look forward to having Dr. Duckers serve on our medical advisory council, as we expect that he will provide a unique background that will contribute to our commitment to provide superior outcomes for our patients.”“Dr. Duckers’ expertise in molecular cardiovascular biology and his cardiac cell therapy trial experience serve as a valuable asset to Okyanos Heart Institute’s efforts in bringing a new standard of care and a better quality of life to CAD patients,” said Matt Feshbach, co-founder and CEO of Okyanos Heart Institute. “His commitment to the advancement of safe and effective cardiac cell therapy treatments has helped lead the way in this emerging field. We are pleased to have his participation on the Okyanos Medical Advisory Council.”“I am excited to join the Okyanos Medical Advisory Council and have the unique opportunity to work with recognized leaders in the study and practice of cardiovascular treatments to provide CAD patients with a better quality of life,” said Duckers. “Additionally, I look forward to working to advance the science behind Okyanos Heart Institute’s cardiac cell therapy treatments in an effort to improve the lives of individuals suffering from chronic CAD.”New Media Content:Okyanos LinkedIn page:http://www.linkedin.com/company/okyanos-heart-instituteOkyanos Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/OKYANOSOkyanos Twitter page:https://twitter.com/#!/OkyanosHeartAbout Okyanos Heart Institute:Based in Freeport, The Bahamas, the Okyanos Heart Institute is a Center of Excellence (CoE) adhering to U.S. surgical center standards and led by Chief Medical Officer Howard T. Walpole Jr., M.D., MBA, FACC, FACAI, FSCAI, a leader of the American College of Cardiology for many years. The mission of Okyanos Heart Institute is to bring a new standard of care and a better quality of life to patients with chronic coronary artery disease using cardiac cell therapy. The Okyanos Treatment utilizes cardiac cell therapy, a unique blend of stem and regenerative cells to support the growth of new blood vessels and to assist the heart in repairing tissue damaged by heart attack and disease. The Greek god of rivers, “Okyanos” symbolizes the primary mechanism of action that these adult stem cells have on ischemic (lack of blood flow) heart tissue, the result of the plaque deposits in the coronary arteries. The stem cells, derived from a person’s adipose (fat) tissue, create new blood vessels, a process known as angiogenesis. These cells facilitate blood flow in the heart and intake and use of oxygen, as measured by a rigorous clinical trial known as the PRECISE trial, as well as cardiac cell therapy trials at leading research institutions.

Brandon Marshall thought Eric Decker was a 'product of Peyton Manning' - Sportsnaut.com
















 


























 






























NFL
Brandon Marshall thought Eric Decker was a ‘product of Peyton Manning’
June 20, 2016by Rachel Wold






 
Written by Rachel Wold



Ouch. Brandon Marshall did not have much faith in his teammate Eric Decker last year when he first signed on with the New York Jets.                				
This is Decker’s recollection of a conversation between he and Marshall after Marshall was traded to his team.
“Today he told me, ‘I honestly thought you were a product of Peyton [Manning]. Like I didn’t believe you were good,’” Decker said, per Kimberley A. Martin of NewsDay.
Marshall didn’t deny Decker’s remark.
“I did,” Marshall said. “[I used to think] ‘Man, it’s not fair, they have Peyton.”
Decker was quite successful during his last two seasons playing with Manning when he tallied a total of 2,352 yards and 24 touchdowns during the 2013-14 seasons. And, his production notably dropped off during his first year as a Jet with Geno Smith and Michael Vick under center.                				
That said, Decker undeniably returned to his “Peyton” form last year when working alongside Marshall catching passes from Ryan Fitzpatrick. In fact, the pair broke a previous record held by Cris Carter and Randy Moss when they both scored in nine games in 2015. Overall, the duo put 26 touchdowns on the scoreboard last year.
Marshall now heaps his praises on Decker.
“He’s probably one of the better route runners in our league. And I don’t think people really understand it — I didn’t even really . . . And then, probably during the Indy game [in Week Two], I was like, ‘Wow, this dude is pretty good.”
Obviously, both receivers thrived when working with Fitzpatrick. With the Jets and Fitz currently sitting in a contentious stalemate concerning a new deal for the free agent (more on that here), it is looking more like Decker and Marshall will have to work with Smith.
Marshall and Decker combined for whopping 189 total catches and 2,529 yards in 2015. Whether their success is directly tied to Fitz will be seen soon enough.
However the story plays out, fans can be assured both receivers will be diligently practicing and prepared to play with either quarterback this fall.

Brandon Marshall thought Eric Decker was 'a product of Peyton' Manning
After Decker's season catching passes from Ryan Fitzpatrick, he won't be doubted again

  	At this point in his career, Brandon Marshall's played with plenty of quarterbacks. There was Jay Cutler -- on two different teams. Kyle Orton once earned the title of Marshall's top quarterback (according to Marshall). And let's not forget about Chad Henne and Josh McCown. 	Here's the full list as of last summer, which Jared Dubin compiled:  		Jake Plummer, Jay Cutler (twice), Patrick Ramsey, Kyle Orton, Chris Simms, Chad Henne, Tyler Thigpen, Chad Pennington, Matt Moore, J.P. Losman, Jason Campbell, Josh McCown and Jimmy Clausen.Now, we can add Ryan Fitzpatrick and Geno Smith to that list. So, in all of his years (10) and in all of his stops (4) Marshall has never caught passes from an undisputed top quarterback. Still, since entering the league, Marshall's racked up the third-most yards among all receivers. 	 	So, when Marshall joined the Jets ahead of last season, he was a bit skeptical of Eric Decker, who made his name in Denver catching passes from someone named Peyton Manning. In fact, Marshall even told Decker that he thought he was only good because of Manning.


 Via Newsday's Kimberley A. Martin:  		"Today he told me, 'I honestly thought you were a product of Peyton [Manning]. Like I didn't believe you were good,' " Decker says. 	 		Marshall lets out a giggle, demonstrating his guilt. "I did," he says, smiling. "[I used to think] 'Man, it's not fair, they have Peyton," reinforcing the idea that the success of Denver's receivers are "a product of Peyton." 	 	Now? Marshall thinks of Decker a bit differently, per Martin: 	"He's probably one of the better route runners in our league," Marshall says of his buddy. "And I don't think people really understand it -- I didn't even really . . . And then, probably during the Indy game [in Week 2], I was like, 'Wow, this dude is pretty good.' " Decker caught eight passes for 97 yards in the Jets' 20-7 win."  	And that makes sense, largely due to the fact that Marshall and Decker combined for 2,529 yards and 26 touchdowns last year. They also did that with Ryan Fitzpatrick and Geno Smith, occasionally, as their quarterbacks. If anything, both Marshall and Decker are to blame for the Jets' contract tiff with Fitzpatrick, whose stats were inflated due to their ability to win contested passes and rescue inaccurate passes, which has Fitzpatrick feeling like he deserves more money than the Jets have offered. Brandon Marshall has come to appreciate Eric Decker's talent while playing in New York. 
                                                            USATSI
                                                    The best part about this story? Both Marshall and Decker are seemingly desperate for Fitzpatrick to return to them. For some strange reason, neither of them have realized that Fitzpatrick is simply a product of Marshall and Decker.
