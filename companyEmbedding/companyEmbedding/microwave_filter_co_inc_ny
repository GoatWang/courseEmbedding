Microwave Filter
                Company introduces the Model 15863 Diplexer. This product is designed
                for use in WIMAX base stations receiving and transmitting broadband
                information in the (3.4 - 3.43) GHz / (3.5 - 3.53) GHz bands.
These bands
                are mutually isolated by a minimum of 55 dB with a maximum 1 dB
                of insertion loss in each band. The use of modern design &
                production methods yields a compact-sized diplexer with a 4"
                x 3" x 1.25" footprint.

	NOTES
	TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)




	MARCH
	31, 2017




	 




	Note
	1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies




	 




	In
	these notes, the terms “MFC” and “Company” mean Microwave Filter Company, Inc. and its subsidiary companies.




	 




	The
	following condensed balance sheet as of September 30, 2016, which has been derived from audited financial statements, and the
	unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the
	Securities and Exchange Commission. Certain information and note disclosures normally included in annual financial statements
	prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles have been condensed or omitted pursuant to those rules and
	regulations, although the company believes that the disclosures made are adequate to make the information not misleading. In the
	opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation
	have been included. The operating results for the six month period ended March 31, 2017 are not necessarily indicative of the
	results that may be expected for the year ended September 30, 2017. For further information, refer to the consolidated financial
	statements and notes thereto included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10K for the year ended September 30, 2016.




	 




	Note
	2. Industry Segment Data




	 




	The
	Company’s primary business segment involves the operations of Microwave Filter Company, Inc. which designs, develops, manufactures
	and sells electronic filters, both for radio and microwave frequencies, to help process signal distribution and to prevent unwanted
	signals from disrupting transmit or receive operations. Markets served include cable television, television and radio broadcast,
	satellite broadcast, mobile radio, commercial communications and defense electronics.




	 




	Note
	3. Inventories




	 




	Inventories
	are stated at the lower of cost determined on the first-in, first-out method or market.




	 




	Inventories
	net of the reserve for obsolescence consisted of the following:

	The
	Company’s reserve for obsolescence equaled $435,528 at March 31, 2017 and September 30, 2016. The Company provides for a
	valuation reserve for certain inventory that is deemed to be obsolete, of excess quantity or otherwise impaired.




	 




	Note
	4. Income Taxes




	 




	The
	Company accounts for income taxes under FASB ASC 740-10. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are based on the difference between
	the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities as measured by the enacted tax rates which are anticipated to
	be in effect when these differences reverse. The deferred tax provision is the result of the net change in the deferred tax assets
	and liabilities. A valuation allowance is established when it is necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to amounts expected to
	be realized. The Company has provided a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets.




	 




	FASB
	ASC 740-10 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an entity’s financial statements and prescribes
	a recognition threshold and measurement attributes for financial statement disclosure of tax position taken or expected to be
	taken on a tax return. Additionally, it provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting
	in interim periods, disclosure and transition. The Company determined it has no uncertain tax positions and therefore no amounts
	are recorded.




	 




	Note
	5. Legal Matters




	 




	None.




	 




	Note
	6. Fair Value of Financial Instruments




	 




	The
	carrying values of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate fair value
	because of the short maturity of those instruments.




	 




	The
	Company currently does not trade in or utilize derivative financial instruments.




	 




	Note
	7. Significant Customers




	 




	Sales
	to one Original Equipment Manufacturer (“OEM”) customer represented approximately 44% of total sales for the six months
	ended March 31, 2017 and approximately 31% of total sales for the six months ended March 31, 2016. This one customer represented
	approximately 28%, 33% and 25% of total sales for the fiscal years ending September 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. These
	sales are in connection with a multiyear program in which the Company is a subcontractor. A loss of this customer or programs
	related to this customer could materially impact the Company.




	 








	7

	 









	 







	 




	Note
	8. Notes Payable




	 




	On
	July 2, 2013, Microwave Filter Company, Inc. (the “Company”) entered into a Ten Year Term Loan with KeyBank National
	Association in the amount of Five Hundred Thousand and No/100 Dollars ($500,000.00). The amount of all advances outstanding together
	with accrued interest thereon shall be due and payable on July 2, 2023 (“Maturity”). The Company shall pay interest
	on the outstanding principal balance of this Note at the rate per annum equal to 4.5%. The net proceeds from the Term Loan will
	be available to provide working capital as needed. The total amount outstanding as of March 31, 2017 and September 30, 2016 was
	$342,527 and $365,650 respectively. Interest accrued as of March 31, 2017 and September 30, 2016 was $1,239 and $1,280, respectively.




	 




	The
	Company has secured this Note by: (a) a Mortgage, Assignment of Rents, Security Agreement and Fixture Filing which creates a 1

	st

	lien on real property situated in the Town of Dewitt, County of Onondaga, and State of New York and known as 6743 Kinne
	Street, East Syracuse, New York; (b) a General Assignment of Rents and Leases; (c) an Environmental Compliance and Indemnification;
	and (d) such other security as may now or hereafter begiven to Lender as collateral for the loan.




	 




	Note
	9. Earnings Per Share




	 




	The
	Company presents basic earnings per share (“EPS”), computed based on the weighted average number of common shares
	outstanding for the period, and when applicable diluted EPS, which gives the effect to all dilutive potential shares outstanding
	(i.e. options) during the period after restatement for any stock dividends. There were no dividends declared during the quarters
	ended March 31, 2017 and 2016. Income (loss) used in the EPS calculation is net income (loss) for each period. There were no dilutive
	potential shares outstanding for the periods ending March 31, 2017 and 2016.




	 




	Note
	10. Recent Accounting Pronouncements




	 




	Update
	2015-11-

	Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory,

	is effective for fiscal years beginning after
	December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Under the new standard, businesses that use the first-in,
	first-out (FIFO) or average cost method are required to measure inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value (“NRV”),
	as defined, instead of at the lower of cost or market value. Management feels the updated standard, to be adopted on a prospective
	basis, would not represent a material impact to the Company’s financial statements.

	ITEM
	2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS




	 




	Business
	Overview




	 




	Microwave
	Filter Company, Inc. operates primarily in the United States and principally in one industry. The Company extends credit to business
	customers based upon ongoing credit evaluations. Microwave Filter Company, Inc. designs, develops, manufactures and sells electronic
	filters, both for radio and microwave frequencies, to help process signal distribution and to prevent unwanted signals from disrupting
	transmit or receive operations. Markets served include cable television, television and radio broadcast, satellite broadcast,
	mobile radio, commercial communications and defense electronics.




	 




	Critical
	Accounting Policies




	 




	The
	Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements are based on the application of United States generally accepted accounting
	principles (GAAP). GAAP requires the use of estimates, assumptions, judgments and subjective interpretations of accounting principles
	that have an impact on the assets, liabilities, revenue and expense amounts reported. The Company believes its use of estimates
	and underlying accounting assumptions adhere to GAAP and are consistently applied. Valuations based on estimates are reviewed
	for reasonableness and adequacy on a consistent basis throughout the Company. Primary areas where financial information of the
	Company is subject to the use of estimates, assumptions and the application of judgment include revenues, receivables, inventories,
	warranty reserves and taxes. Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal
	year ended September 30, 2016 describes the significant accounting policies used in preparation of the condensed consolidated
	financial statements. The most significant areas involving management judgments and estimates are described below and are considered
	by management to be critical to understanding the financial condition and results of operations of the Company.




	 




	Revenues
	from product sales are recorded as the products are shipped and title and risk of loss have passed to the customer, provided that
	no significant vendor or post-contract support obligations remain and the collection of the related receivable is probable. Billings
	in advance of the Company’s performance of such work are reflected as customer deposits in the accompanying condensed consolidated
	balance sheet.




	 




	Allowances
	for doubtful accounts are based on estimates of losses related to customer receivable balances. The establishment of reserves
	requires the use of judgment and assumptions regarding the potential for losses on receivable balances.




	 




	The
	Company’s inventories are stated at the lower of cost determined on the first-in, first-out method or market. The Company
	uses certain estimates and judgments and considers several factors including product demand and changes in technology to provide
	for excess and obsolescence reserves to properly value inventory.




	 




	The
	Company established a warranty reserve which provides for the estimated cost of product returns based upon historical experience
	and any known conditions or circumstances. The warranty obligation is affected by product that does not meet specifications and
	performance requirements and any related costs of addressing such matters. Product must be returned within one year of the date
	of purchase.

	The
	Company accounts for income taxes under FASB ASC 740-10. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are based on the difference between
	the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities as measured by the enacted tax rates which are anticipated to
	be in effect when these differences reverse. The deferred tax provision is the result of the net change in the deferred tax assets
	and liabilities. A valuation allowance is established when it is necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to amounts expected to
	be realized. The Company has provided a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets.

	Net
	sales for the three months ended March 31, 2017 equaled $825,176, a decrease of $280,677 or 25.4%, when compared to net sales
	of $1,105,853 for the three months ended March 31, 2016. The decrease in sales can primarily be attributed to decreases in the
	Company’s Cable TV and Satellite product sales.




	 




	MFC’s
	Cable TV product sales decreased $156,061 or 70.5% to $65,374 for the three months ended March 31, 2017 when compared to Cable
	TV product sales of $221,435 during the same period last year. The decrease in sales can primarily be attributed to orders from
	two customers with specific cable applications last year. Management continues to project flat or a decrease in demand for standard
	Cable TV products due to the shift from analog to digital television. Due to the inherent nature of digital modulation versus
	analog modulation, fewer filters are required. The Company has developed filters for digital television and there will still be
	requirements for analog filters for limited applications in commercial and private cable systems.




	 




	MFC’s
	Satellite product sales decreased $128,872 or 39.9% to $194,147 for the three months ended March 31, 2017 when compared to Satellite
	product sales of $323,019 during the same period last year. The decrease in sales can be attributed to a decrease in demand for
	the Company’s filters which suppress strong out-of-band interference caused by military and civilian radar systems and other
	sources. Although economic conditions do impact sales, management expects demand for these types of filters to continue with the
	proliferation of earth stations world-wide and increased sources of interference.

	MFC’s
	RF/Microwave product sales increased $11,306 or 2.4% to $481,667 for the three months ended March 31, 2017 when compared to RF/Microwave
	product sales of $470,361 during the same period last year. The Company’s RF/Microwave products are sold primarily to Original
	Equipment Manufacturers that serve the mobile radio, commercial communications and defense electronics markets. Sales to one OEM
	customer increased $29,445 to $376,625, or approximately 46% of total sales for the three months ended March 31, 2017, compared
	to sales of $347,180 or approximately 31% of total sales for the three months ended March 31, 2016. These sales are in connection
	with a multiyear program in which the Company is a subcontractor. The Company continues to invest in production engineering and
	infrastructure development to penetrate OEM market segments as they become popular. MFC is concentrating its technical resources
	and product development efforts toward potential high volume customers as part of a concentrated effort to provide substantial
	long-term growth. Over the last year, MFC, in conjunction with various OEM’s, has developed and supplied prototypes as well
	as small production runs in support of new programs being introduced to the marketplace. It is our belief that a continuation
	of this effort will help increase sales as well as reinforcing MFC’s position as a quality manufacturer of RF filters and
	assemblies.




	 




	MFC’s
	Broadcast TV/Wireless Cable product sales decreased $4,349 or 5.0% to $81,946 for the three months ended March 31, 2017 when compared
	to sales of $86,295 during the same period last year.




	 




	MFC’s
	sales order backlog equaled $608,888 at March 31, 2017 compared to sales order backlog of $733,955 at March 31, 2016. However,
	backlog is not necessarily indicative of future sales. Accordingly, the Company does not believe that its backlog as of any particular
	date is representative of actual sales for any succeeding period. Approximately 70% of the total sales order backlog at March
	31, 2017 is scheduled to ship by September 30, 2017.




	 




	Gross
	profit for the three months ended March 31, 2017 equaled $272,710, a decrease of $179,492 or 39.7%, when compared to gross profit
	of $452,202 for the three months ended March 31, 2016. The decrease in gross profit can primarily be attributed to the lower sales
	volume this year when compared to the same period last year. As a percentage of sales, gross profit equaled 33.0% for the three
	months ended March 31, 2017 compared to 40.9% for the three months ended March 31, 2016. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage
	of sales can primarily be attributed to the lower sales volume this year when compared to the same period last year providing
	a lower base to absorb overhead expenses.




	 




	Selling,
	general and administrative (SGA) expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2017 equaled $320,872, a decrease of $31,485 or
	8.9%, when compared to SGA expenses of $352,357 for the three months ended March 31, 2016. The decrease can primarily be attributed
	to decreases in payroll and payroll related expenses. The Company has been participating in the New York State Shared Work program
	which allows employers to reduce the hours of all or a particular group of employees. The employees whose hours are reduced can
	receive partial unemployment insurance benefits or elect to use accrued vacation. As a percentage of sales, SGA expenses increased
	to 38.9% for the three months ended March 31, 2017 when compared to 31.9% for the three months ended March 31, 2016 primarily
	due to the lower sales volume this year providing a lower base to absorb expenses.




	 




	The
	Company recorded a loss from operations of $48,162 for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to income from operations
	of $99,845 for the three months ended March 31, 2016. The decrease in operating income can primarily be attributed to the lower
	sales volume this year when compared to the same period last year.

	Other
	expense was $2,215 for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to $3,092 for the three months ended March 31, 2016 primarily
	due to interest expense of $3,898 offset by miscellaneous non-operating income of $1,683 for the three months ended March 31,
	2017 and interest expense of $4,460 offset by miscellaneous non-operating income of $1,368 for the three months ended March 31,
	2016. Other income generally consists of interest income, sales of scrap material, the forfeiture of non-refundable deposits and
	other incidental items.




	 




	The
	benefit for income taxes equaled $0 for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and a benefit of $3,000 for the three months ended
	March 31, 2016. The benefit for the three months ended March 31, 2016 can be attributed to a prior year’s federal refund.
	Any benefit for losses has been subject to a valuation allowance since the realization of the deferred tax benefit is not considered
	more likely than not. As required by FASB ASC 740, the Company has evaluated the positive and negative evidence bearing upon the
	realization of its deferred tax assets. The Company has determined that, at this time, it is more likely than not that the Company
	will not realize all of the benefits of federal and state deferred tax assets, and, as a result, a valuation allowance was established.

	of $1,873,400 for the six months ended March 31, 2016.




	 




	MFC’s
	RF/Microwave product sales increased $130,654 or 16.3% to $930,711 for the six months ended March 31, 2017 when compared to RF/Microwave
	product sales of $800,057 during the same period last year. MFC’s RF/Microwave products are sold primarily to OEMs that
	serve the mobile radio, commercial communications and defense electronics markets. Sales to one OEM customer increased $132,880
	to $709,430, or approximately 44% of total sales for the six months ended March 31, 2017, compared to sales of $576,550 or approximately

	MFC’s
	Satellite product sales decreased $216,878 or 37.8% to $356,584 for the six months ended March 31, 2017 when compared to satellite
	product sales of $573,462 during the same period last year. The decrease can be attributed to a decrease in demand for the Company’s
	filters which suppress strong out-of-band interference caused by military and civilian radar systems and other sources. Although
	economics conditions impact sales, management expects demand for these types of filters to continue with the proliferation of
	earth stations




	world-wide
	and increased sources of interference.




	 




	MFC’s
	Cable TV product sales decreased $127,501 or 40.3% to $188,976 for the six months ended March 31, 2017 when compared to Cable
	TV product sales of $316,477 during the same period last year. The decrease in sales can primarily be attributed to orders from
	two customers with specific cable applications last year. Management continues to project flat or a decrease in demand for standard
	Cable TV products due to the shift from analog to digital television. Due to the inherent nature of digital modulation versus
	analog modulation, fewer filters are required. The Company has developed filters for digital television and there will still be

	MFC’s
	Broadcast TV/Wireless Cable product sales decreased $51,666 or 29.3% to $124,851 for the six months ended March 31, 2017 when
	compared to sales of $176,517 during the same period last year. The decrease can primarily be attributed to a decrease in demand
	for wireless diplexers which were sold to one customer last year.




	 




	MFC’s
	sales order backlog equaled $608,888 at March 31, 2017 compared to sales order backlog of $733,955 at March 31, 2016. However,
	backlog is not necessarily indicative of future sales. Accordingly, the Company does not believe that its backlog as of any particular

	Gross
	profit for the six months ended March 31, 2017 equaled $521,811, a decrease of $189,196 or 26.6%, when compared to gross profit
	of $711,007 for the six months ended March 31, 2016. The decrease in gross profit can primarily be attributed to the lower sales
	volume this year when compared to the same period last year. As a percentage of sales, gross profit equaled 32.5% for the six
	months ended March 31, 2017 compared to 38.0% for the six months ended March 31, 2016. The decrease can primarily be attributed
	to the lower sales volume this year when compared to the same period last year providing a lower base to absorb overhead expenses.




	 




	SG&A
	expenses for the six months ended March 31, 2017 equaled $659,623, a decrease of $51,898 or 7.3%, when compared to SG&A expenses
	of $711,521 for the six months ended March 31, 2016. The decrease can primarily be attributed to decreases in payroll and payroll
	related expenses. The Company has been participating in the New York State Shared Work program which allows employers to reduce
	the hours of all or a particular group of employees. The employees whose hours are reduced can receive partial unemployment insurance
	benefits or elect to use accrued vacation. As a percentage of sales, SGA expenses increased to 41.1% for the six months ended
	March 31, 2017 compared to 38.0% for the six months ended March 31, 2016 due primarily to the lower sales volume this year when
	compared to the same period last year.




	 




	The
	Company recorded a loss from operations of $137,812 for the six months ended March 31, 2017 compared to a loss from operations
	of $514 for the six months ended March 31, 2016. The higher loss can primarily be attributed to the lower sales volume this year
	when compared to the same period last year.

	Other
	expense was $5,764 for the six months ended March 31, 2017 compared to $6,084 for the six months ended March 31, 2016 primarily
	due to interest expense of $8,018 offset by miscellaneous non-operating income of $2,254 for the six months ended March 31, 2017
	and interest expense of $9,096 offset by miscellaneous non-operating income of $3,012 for the six months ended March 31, 2016.
	Other income generally consists of interest income, sales of scrap material, the forfeiture of non-refundable deposits and other
	incidental items.




	 




	The
	benefit for income taxes equaled $0 for the six months ended March 31, 2017 and a benefit of $3,000 for the six months ended March
	31, 2016. The benefit for the six months ended March 31, 2016 can be attributed to a prior year’s federal refund. Any benefit

	Off-Balance
	Sheet Arrangements




	 




	At
	March 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company did not have any unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often
	referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which might have been established for the purpose of facilitating
	off-balance sheet arrangements.

	Cash

	September 30, 2016. The decrease was a result of $1,899 in net cash used in operating activities, $52,745 in net cash used for
	capital expenditures, $23,123 in net cash used for repayment of a note payable and $662 used to purchase treasury stock.




	 




	Net
	cash provided by operating activities can fluctuate between periods as a result of differences in net income, the timing of the
	collection of accounts receivable, purchase of inventory and payment of accounts payable. The decrease of $98,667 in accounts
	receivable at March 31, 2017 when compared to September 30, 2016 can primarily be attributed to the timing of shipments and collections.




	 




	The
	capital expenditures of $52,745 consisted primarily of computer hardware and production equipment.




	 




	On
	July 2, 2013, Microwave Filter Company, Inc. entered into a Ten Year Term Loan with KeyBank National Association in the amount
	of Five Hundred Thousand and No/100 Dollars ($500,000.00). The amount of all advances outstanding together with accrued interest
	thereon shall be due and payable on July 2, 2023 (“Maturity”). The Company shall pay interest on the outstanding principal
	balance of this Note at the rate per annum equal to 4.5%. The net proceeds from the Term Loan will be available to provide working
	capital as needed.




	 




	Management
	believes that its working capital requirements for the forseeable future will be met by its existing cash balances and future
	cash flows from operations.

	EVALUATION
	OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES




	 




	Management’s
	responsibility includes establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Company’s management,
	with the participation of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness
	of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange
	Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on such evaluation,
	the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of such period, the
	Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report.




	 




	CHANGES
	IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING




	 




	There
	have been no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)
	under the Exchange Act) during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
	affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
