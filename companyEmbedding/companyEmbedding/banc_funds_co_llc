10 Firms Violated Pay-To-Play Rule by Accepting Pension Fund Fees Campaign Contributions
Jan 17 17
The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that 10 investment advisory firms have agreed to pay penalties ranging from $35,000 to $100,000 to settle charges that they violated the SEC’s investment adviser pay-to-play rule by receiving compensation from public pension funds within two years after campaign contributions made by the firms’ associates. According to the SEC’s orders, investment advisers are subject to a two-year timeout from providing compensatory advisory services either directly to a government client or through a pooled investment vehicle after political contributions were made to a candidate who could influence the investment adviser selection process for a public pension fund or appoint someone with such influence. The SEC’s orders find that these 10 firms violated the two-year timeout by accepting fees from city or state pension funds after their associates made campaign contributions to elected officials or political candidates with the potential to wield influence over those pension funds. The firms are censured and must pay the monetary penalties. For Adams Capital Management penalty is $45,000, Aisling Capital penalty is $70,456, Alta Communications penalty is $35,000, Commonwealth Venture Management Corporation penalty is $75,000, Cypress Advisors penalty is $35,000, FFL Partners penalty is $75,000, Lime Rock Management penalty is $75,000, NGN Capital penalty is $100,000, Pershing Square Capital Management will pay $75,000 and The Banc Funds Company will pay $75,000.
