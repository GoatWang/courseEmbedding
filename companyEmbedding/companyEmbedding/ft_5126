        As described
Good looking image, although thickness is less than desired and thin... picks up excess lint.. Also would be better if available in a size larger...

        Even better than what I imagined
Excellent color saturation and size. Can be used outdoor or indoor. We currently use it as a bath mat. Easy to clean/machine washable.

        Nice entry rug.
Nice door entry rug, but the material was not what I expected. Still, I'm happy with the purchase.

The carpet looks nice and seems to be made of quality material.

Tom Ford FT 5126 Eyeglasses 
                        Find many unisex frames in our selection of Tom Ford eyeglasses. When you want a neutral style, find it out of the many black plastic frames by Tom Ford. Although the brand carries the typical rectangular plastic style, wayfarer and aviator frames, also made from medium-thickness black plastic, are another option. Additionally, the brand has a selection of metal unisex frames, also with a similar angular style. Not all Tom Ford glasses are unisex, and we carry some specific men?s and women?s style. As one of the most well-known high fashion brands, Tom Ford represents sophistication without going over the top, and all of the eyeglasses in our selection capture this.
