"This is a $200 plus stock over the next three years with new management," Ackman said at an investment conference. Ackman's Pershing Square Capital Management is Air Products' biggest shareholder with a 9.71 percent stake. The company has been looking for a new leader since Chief Executive Officer John McGlade said in September that he would retire this year. McGlade plans to stay on as chairman of the board for a limited time as the new CEO settles in. Air Products is one of the world's largest industrial gas companies, breaking down air to form oxygen, nitrogen and other components used in construction, healthcare, oil refining and scores of other industries. McGlade's replacement will have to turn around a corporate culture that has long had a reputation as top-down and bureaucratic. That inefficiency has cost the company market share and dented margins, which badly trail Praxair Inc (PX.N) and other rivals. Air Products also has invested capital in unrelated businesses, including specialty chemicals for electronics makers and liquefied natural gas heat exchangers, that Ackman and others have said diverts the company from its core mission. Since McGlade's announcement, the company's stock price has moved up and down and is now trading only about 2 percent higher at $112.04 then where it was in late September. As an activist investor, Ackman knows firsthand how selecting the right person for the top job can make or break investments. Watching Ron Johnson's vision for remaking J.C.Penney (JCP.N) fall apart cost his hedge fund $500 million, but installing Hunter Harrison at Canadian Pacific (CP.TO) helped him earn more than $2 billion in less than two years. "The risk at Air Products is whether or not they are going to choose the right CEO," Ackman said at the 2014 Harbor Investment Conference, which he runs with Mark Axelowitz. Pershing Square does not sit on the Air Products board and will have no official say in who ends up getting the job, Ackman said. But as the biggest shareholder, the hedge fund does have significant influence over the decision. "No one would be willing to take the job without having the biggest shareholder on their side," Ackman said.

William Albert Ackman (born May 11, 1966) is an American investor, hedge fund manager, and philanthropist. He is the founder and CEO of Pershing Square Capital Management, a hedge fund management company. Ackman is considered a contrarian investor[1][2] but he considers himself an activist investor.[3][4] Research published at The University of Oxford characterizes Bill Ackman's activities with Canadian Pacific Railway as paradigmatic of "engaged activism" – which is longer term in nature with correlated benefits to the real economy, as distinct from shorter term "financial activism".[5]
His investing style and investments have had its fair share of critical praise and criticism from U.S. federal and state government officials, heads of other hedge funds, various retail investors, and the general public. Ackman's most notable market plays include shorting MBIA's bonds during the 2008 financial crisis, his proxy battle with Canadian Pacific Railway, as well as his stakes in the Target Corporation, Valeant Pharmaceuticals, and Chipotle Mexican Grill. Since 2012, he has held a US$1 billion short against the nutrition company Herbalife, claiming the company is a pyramid scheme designed as a multi-level marketing firm.[6]

Early life and education[edit]
Ackman was raised in Chappaqua, New York, the son of Ronnie I. (née Posner) and Lawrence David Ackman, the chairman of a New York real estate financing firm, Ackman-Ziff Real Estate Group.[7][8] His family is Jewish.[9][10]
In 1988, he received a bachelor of arts degree magna cum laude in history from Harvard College. His thesis was "Scaling the Ivy Wall: the Jewish and Asian American Experience in Harvard Admissions."[11] In 1992, he received an MBA from Harvard Business School.[12]
Career[edit]
Gotham Partners[edit]
In 1992, Ackman founded the investment firm Gotham Partners with fellow Harvard graduate David P. Berkowitz. This investment firm made small investments in public companies.[7] In 1995, Ackman partnered with the insurance and real estate firm Leucadia National to bid for Rockefeller Center. Although they did not win the deal, the bid caused increased interest in Gotham Partners from investors, which led to $500 million in assets by 1998.[7] By 2002, Gotham Partners had become entrenched in litigation with various outside shareholders who also owned an interest in the same companies in which Gotham invested.[7]
Despite an ongoing probe of his trading by New York State and federal authorities, Ackman began research challenging MBIA's AAA rating. He was charged fees for copying 725,000 pages of statements regarding the financial services company in his law firm's compliance with a subpoena.[13] Ackman called for a division between MBIA's bond insurers' structured finance business and its municipal bond insurance business.[14] He argued that MBIA was legally restricted from trading billions of dollars of credit default swap (CDS) protection MBIA had sold against various mortgage backed CDOs, and was using a second corporation, LaCrosse Financial Products, which MBIA described as an "orphaned transformer". Ackman bought credit default swaps against MBIA corporate debt and sold the swaps for a large profit during the financial crisis of 2008 He reported covering his short position on MBIA on January 16, 2009, according to the 13D filed with the SEC.[15]
In 2003, a feud developed between Ackman and Carl Icahn over a deal involving Hallwood Realty. They agreed to a "schmuck insurance", which said that if Icahn sold the shares within 3 years and made a profit of 10% or more, he and Ackman would split the proceeds. Carl Icahn paid $80 per share. In April 2004, HRPT Property Trust acquired Hallwood, paying $136.16 per share. Under the terms, Icahn owed Ackman investors about $4.5 million, but refused to pay. Ackman sued. Eight years later, the Court forced Icahn to pay $4.5 million, plus 9% interest per year since the date of the sale.[16][17][18]
Pershing Square Capital Management[edit]
In 2004, with $54 million in funding from his personal funds and from his former business partner, Leucadia National, Ackman started Pershing Square Capital Management.[7] In 2005, Pershing bought a significant share in the fast food chain Wendy's International and successfully pressured it to sell its Tim Hortons doughnut chain. Wendy's spun off Tim Hortons through an IPO in 2006 and raised $670 million for Wendy's investors. After Ackman sold his shares at a substantial profit after a dispute over executive succession, the stock price collapsed, raising criticism that the sale of Wendy's fastest-growing unit left the company in a weaker market position. Ackman blamed the poor performance on their new CEO.[7] Pershing Square Holdings amounted to 22.2% in returns since inception (Dec. 2012 – Dec. 2015) under Ackman’s management, 30% below the S&P 500.[19]
In December 2007, his funds owned a 10% stake in Target Corporation, valued at $4.2 billion[20] through the purchase of stock and derivatives.[21] In December 2010, his funds held a 38% stake in Borders Group and on December 6, 2010, Ackman indicated he would finance a buyout of Barnes & Noble for US$900M.[22]
At a panel meeting discussing Bernie Madoff in January 2009, Ackman defended his longtime friend Ezra Merkin, stating, "Has Ezra committed a crime? I don’t think so,” "I think [Merkin] is an honest person, an intelligent person, an interesting person, a smart investor."[23][24][25] In April 2009, Merkin was charged with civil fraud by the State of New York, for "secretly steering $2.4 billion in client money into Bernard Madoff's Ponzi fraud without their permission."[26] A settlement was reached on June 2012 requiring Merkin to pay $405 million to victims including the Metropolitan Council on Jewish Poverty.[27]
Ackman started buying J. C. Penney shares in 2010, paying an average of $22 for 39 million shares or 18 percent of Penney's stock. In August 2013, Ackman's two-year campaign to transform the department store came to an abrupt end after he decided to step down from the board following an argument with fellow board members.[28] In a statement dated August 27, 2013 Pershing Square reported that it had hired Citigroup to liquidate the 39.1 million shares the firm then owned of the Plano, Texas-based department-store chain at a price of $12.90 per share, resulting in a loss of approximately $500 million to Pershing Square.[29] In January 2015, LCH Investments named Ackman as one of the world's top 20 hedge fund managers after Pershing Square delivered $4.5 billion in net gains for investors in 2014, bringing the fund's lifetime gains to $11.6 billion since its launch in 2004 through year-end 2014.[30]
On April 27, 2016, Ackman along with Valeant Pharmaceuticals' outgoing CEO, J. Michael Pearson, and the company's former interim CEO, Howard Schiller, testified before the United States Senate Special Committee on Aging.[31] The testifying panel answered questions related to the Committee's concerns for repercussions to patients and the health care system posed by Valeant's business model and controversial pricing practices.[32] Ackman sold his remaining 27.2 million share position in Valeant to the Investment Bank Jeffries for about $300 million in March 2017. It has been estimated that the total cost of the position, including direct stock purchases and 9.1 million shares that were underlying stock options traded with Nomura Global Financial Products, was $4.6 billion, leading to a loss greater than 100 percent of the original price of the securities.[33][34]
According to Forbes Magazine, Ackman has a net worth of US$1.4 billion as of February 2017.[35]
Herbalife short[edit]
In December 2012, Ackman issued a research report that was critical of Herbalife's multi-level marketing business model, calling it a pyramid scheme.[36] Ackman disclosed that his hedge fund, Pershing Square Capital Management, sold short the company's shares directly (not with derivatives) starting in May 2012, which led Herbalife's stock price to drop. In 2014, Ackman spent $50 million on a public relations campaign against Herbalife, which was designed to negatively impact the company's stock price.[37][38] Ackman pays about $100 million annually to maintain his short position.[39]
Former Rep. Bob Barr (R-GA) has called on Congress to investigate Ackman's use of public relations and regulatory pressure in his short campaign, and Harvey L. Pitt, a former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, questioned whether Ackman's aims to move the price rather than spread the truth.[40][41] In 2014, Senator Ed Markey wrote letters to federal regulators, including the FTC and the SEC, demanding they open an investigation into Herbalife's business practices. The day the letters were released, the company's stock dropped 14 percent. Markey later told the Boston Globe that his staff had not informed him that Ackman stood to benefit financially from the Senator's actions but defended the letters as a matter of consumer rights.[42]
In March 2014, the New York Times reported that Ackman had employed tactics to undermine public confidence in Herbalife to lower its stock price, including pressuring state and federal regulators to investigate the company, paying individuals to travel to and participate in rallies against the company and boosting its spending on donations to non-profit Latino organizations. According to the article, numerous letters were sent to federal regulators by groups such as the Hispanic Federation and the National Consumers League. "Each person contacted by The Times acknowledged in interviews that they wrote the letters after being lobbied by representatives from Pershing Square, or said they did not remember writing the letters at all. Mr. Ackman's team also then started to make payments totaling about $130,000 to some of these groups, including the Hispanic Federation — money he said was being used to help find victims of Herbalife."[43]
On March 12, 2015, The Wall Street Journal reported that prosecutors in the Manhattan U.S. attorney's office and the FBI were investigating whether people hired by Ackman "made false statements about Herbalife's business model to regulators and others in order to spur investigations into the company and lower its stock price."[44][45] In March 2015, U.S. District Judge Dale Fischer, in Los Angeles, California, dismissed a suit filed by Herbalife investors alleging the company is operating an illegal pyramid scheme. In response to Fischer's ruling, Herbalife stock surged approximately 13 percent.[46] Herbalife and the FTC reached a settlement agreement in July 2016, ending the agency's investigation into the company. On the day of the settlement, Fortune estimated that Ackman lost $500 million.[47]
Ackman's position on Herbalife led to a discussion on live television with Herbalife supporter Carl Icahn for nearly half an hour on CNBC on January 25, 2013.[48][49][50] During the segment, Icahn called Ackman "a crybaby in the schoolyard" and claimed that going public with his short position would eventually force Ackman into the "mother of all short squeezes." On November 22, 2013, he admitted on Bloomberg Television that Pershing Square's open short position in Herbalife was "$400 million to $500 million" in the red, but that he wouldn't be squeezed out and would hold the short "to the end of the earth".[51]
Political and economic views[edit]
He endorsed Michael Bloomberg as a prospective candidate for President of the United States in the 2016 presidential election.[52] After Donald Trump became president Ackman told Andrew Ross Sorkin of The New York Times that he was "bullish" on Trump's presidency.[53]
Philanthropy[edit]
Ackman has given to charitable causes such as the Center for Jewish History to preserve Jewish genealogy[54] where he spearheaded a successful effort to retire their $30 million in debt, personally contributing $6.8 million.[55][56] This donation made with that of Bruce Berkowitz, founder of Fairholme Capital Management, and Joseph Steinberg, president of Leucadia National, were the three largest individual gifts that the center has ever received.[57]
Ackman's foundation donated $1.1 million to the Innocence Project in New York City and Centurion Ministries in Princeton, N.J.[55] He is a signatory of The Giving Pledge, committing himself to give away at least 50% of his wealth to charitable causes.[58]
In 2006, Ackman co-founded The Pershing Square Foundation, alongside his wife at the time Karen, to support innovation in the areas of economic development, education, healthcare, human rights, arts and urban development.[59] Since it was founded, the foundation has committed more than $400 million in grants and social investments. In 2011, the Ackmans were among The Chronicle of Philanthropy’s "Philanthropy 50" list of the most generous donors.[60]
In July 2014, Challenged Athletes Foundation, which provides sports equipment to those with physical disabilities, honored Ackman at a gala fundraiser at the Waldorf Astoria hotel in New York City for helping raise a record $2.3 million.[61]
Personal life[edit]
He married Karen Ann Herskovitz, a graduate of Harvard University and a landscape architect, on July 10, 1994.[62] She is on the board of directors of Human Rights Watch[63] and on the board of Friends of the High Line.[55][64] They have three children.[7] On December 22, 2016 it was reported that the couple had separated.[65][66]

William Albert Ackman (born May 11, 1966) is an American investor, hedge fund manager, and philanthropist. He is the founder and CEO of Pershing Square Capital Management, a hedge fund management company. Ackman is considered a contrarian investor[1][2] but he considers himself an activist investor.[3][4] Research published at The University of Oxford characterizes Bill Ackman's activities with Canadian Pacific Railway as paradigmatic of "engaged activism" – which is longer term in nature with correlated benefits to the real economy, as distinct from shorter term "financial activism".[5]
His investing style and investments have had its fair share of critical praise and criticism from U.S. federal and state government officials, heads of other hedge funds, various retail investors, and the general public. Ackman's most notable market plays include shorting MBIA's bonds during the 2008 financial crisis, his proxy battle with Canadian Pacific Railway, as well as his stakes in the Target Corporation, Valeant Pharmaceuticals, and Chipotle Mexican Grill. Since 2012, he has held a US$1 billion short against the nutrition company Herbalife, claiming the company is a pyramid scheme designed as a multi-level marketing firm.[6]

Early life and education[edit]
Ackman was raised in Chappaqua, New York, the son of Ronnie I. (née Posner) and Lawrence David Ackman, the chairman of a New York real estate financing firm, Ackman-Ziff Real Estate Group.[7][8] His family is Jewish.[9][10]
In 1988, he received a bachelor of arts degree magna cum laude in history from Harvard College. His thesis was "Scaling the Ivy Wall: the Jewish and Asian American Experience in Harvard Admissions."[11] In 1992, he received an MBA from Harvard Business School.[12]
Career[edit]
Gotham Partners[edit]
In 1992, Ackman founded the investment firm Gotham Partners with fellow Harvard graduate David P. Berkowitz. This investment firm made small investments in public companies.[7] In 1995, Ackman partnered with the insurance and real estate firm Leucadia National to bid for Rockefeller Center. Although they did not win the deal, the bid caused increased interest in Gotham Partners from investors, which led to $500 million in assets by 1998.[7] By 2002, Gotham Partners had become entrenched in litigation with various outside shareholders who also owned an interest in the same companies in which Gotham invested.[7]
Despite an ongoing probe of his trading by New York State and federal authorities, Ackman began research challenging MBIA's AAA rating. He was charged fees for copying 725,000 pages of statements regarding the financial services company in his law firm's compliance with a subpoena.[13] Ackman called for a division between MBIA's bond insurers' structured finance business and its municipal bond insurance business.[14] He argued that MBIA was legally restricted from trading billions of dollars of credit default swap (CDS) protection MBIA had sold against various mortgage backed CDOs, and was using a second corporation, LaCrosse Financial Products, which MBIA described as an "orphaned transformer". Ackman bought credit default swaps against MBIA corporate debt and sold the swaps for a large profit during the financial crisis of 2008 He reported covering his short position on MBIA on January 16, 2009, according to the 13D filed with the SEC.[15]
In 2003, a feud developed between Ackman and Carl Icahn over a deal involving Hallwood Realty. They agreed to a "schmuck insurance", which said that if Icahn sold the shares within 3 years and made a profit of 10% or more, he and Ackman would split the proceeds. Carl Icahn paid $80 per share. In April 2004, HRPT Property Trust acquired Hallwood, paying $136.16 per share. Under the terms, Icahn owed Ackman investors about $4.5 million, but refused to pay. Ackman sued. Eight years later, the Court forced Icahn to pay $4.5 million, plus 9% interest per year since the date of the sale.[16][17][18]
Pershing Square Capital Management[edit]
In 2004, with $54 million in funding from his personal funds and from his former business partner, Leucadia National, Ackman started Pershing Square Capital Management.[7] In 2005, Pershing bought a significant share in the fast food chain Wendy's International and successfully pressured it to sell its Tim Hortons doughnut chain. Wendy's spun off Tim Hortons through an IPO in 2006 and raised $670 million for Wendy's investors. After Ackman sold his shares at a substantial profit after a dispute over executive succession, the stock price collapsed, raising criticism that the sale of Wendy's fastest-growing unit left the company in a weaker market position. Ackman blamed the poor performance on their new CEO.[7] Pershing Square Holdings amounted to 22.2% in returns since inception (Dec. 2012 – Dec. 2015) under Ackman’s management, 30% below the S&P 500.[19]
In December 2007, his funds owned a 10% stake in Target Corporation, valued at $4.2 billion[20] through the purchase of stock and derivatives.[21] In December 2010, his funds held a 38% stake in Borders Group and on December 6, 2010, Ackman indicated he would finance a buyout of Barnes & Noble for US$900M.[22]
At a panel meeting discussing Bernie Madoff in January 2009, Ackman defended his longtime friend Ezra Merkin, stating, "Has Ezra committed a crime? I don’t think so,” "I think [Merkin] is an honest person, an intelligent person, an interesting person, a smart investor."[23][24][25] In April 2009, Merkin was charged with civil fraud by the State of New York, for "secretly steering $2.4 billion in client money into Bernard Madoff's Ponzi fraud without their permission."[26] A settlement was reached on June 2012 requiring Merkin to pay $405 million to victims including the Metropolitan Council on Jewish Poverty.[27]
Ackman started buying J. C. Penney shares in 2010, paying an average of $22 for 39 million shares or 18 percent of Penney's stock. In August 2013, Ackman's two-year campaign to transform the department store came to an abrupt end after he decided to step down from the board following an argument with fellow board members.[28] In a statement dated August 27, 2013 Pershing Square reported that it had hired Citigroup to liquidate the 39.1 million shares the firm then owned of the Plano, Texas-based department-store chain at a price of $12.90 per share, resulting in a loss of approximately $500 million to Pershing Square.[29] In January 2015, LCH Investments named Ackman as one of the world's top 20 hedge fund managers after Pershing Square delivered $4.5 billion in net gains for investors in 2014, bringing the fund's lifetime gains to $11.6 billion since its launch in 2004 through year-end 2014.[30]
On April 27, 2016, Ackman along with Valeant Pharmaceuticals' outgoing CEO, J. Michael Pearson, and the company's former interim CEO, Howard Schiller, testified before the United States Senate Special Committee on Aging.[31] The testifying panel answered questions related to the Committee's concerns for repercussions to patients and the health care system posed by Valeant's business model and controversial pricing practices.[32] Ackman sold his remaining 27.2 million share position in Valeant to the Investment Bank Jeffries for about $300 million in March 2017. It has been estimated that the total cost of the position, including direct stock purchases and 9.1 million shares that were underlying stock options traded with Nomura Global Financial Products, was $4.6 billion, leading to a loss greater than 100 percent of the original price of the securities.[33][34]
According to Forbes Magazine, Ackman has a net worth of US$1.4 billion as of February 2017.[35]
Herbalife short[edit]
In December 2012, Ackman issued a research report that was critical of Herbalife's multi-level marketing business model, calling it a pyramid scheme.[36] Ackman disclosed that his hedge fund, Pershing Square Capital Management, sold short the company's shares directly (not with derivatives) starting in May 2012, which led Herbalife's stock price to drop. In 2014, Ackman spent $50 million on a public relations campaign against Herbalife, which was designed to negatively impact the company's stock price.[37][38] Ackman pays about $100 million annually to maintain his short position.[39]
Former Rep. Bob Barr (R-GA) has called on Congress to investigate Ackman's use of public relations and regulatory pressure in his short campaign, and Harvey L. Pitt, a former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, questioned whether Ackman's aims to move the price rather than spread the truth.[40][41] In 2014, Senator Ed Markey wrote letters to federal regulators, including the FTC and the SEC, demanding they open an investigation into Herbalife's business practices. The day the letters were released, the company's stock dropped 14 percent. Markey later told the Boston Globe that his staff had not informed him that Ackman stood to benefit financially from the Senator's actions but defended the letters as a matter of consumer rights.[42]
In March 2014, the New York Times reported that Ackman had employed tactics to undermine public confidence in Herbalife to lower its stock price, including pressuring state and federal regulators to investigate the company, paying individuals to travel to and participate in rallies against the company and boosting its spending on donations to non-profit Latino organizations. According to the article, numerous letters were sent to federal regulators by groups such as the Hispanic Federation and the National Consumers League. "Each person contacted by The Times acknowledged in interviews that they wrote the letters after being lobbied by representatives from Pershing Square, or said they did not remember writing the letters at all. Mr. Ackman's team also then started to make payments totaling about $130,000 to some of these groups, including the Hispanic Federation — money he said was being used to help find victims of Herbalife."[43]
On March 12, 2015, The Wall Street Journal reported that prosecutors in the Manhattan U.S. attorney's office and the FBI were investigating whether people hired by Ackman "made false statements about Herbalife's business model to regulators and others in order to spur investigations into the company and lower its stock price."[44][45] In March 2015, U.S. District Judge Dale Fischer, in Los Angeles, California, dismissed a suit filed by Herbalife investors alleging the company is operating an illegal pyramid scheme. In response to Fischer's ruling, Herbalife stock surged approximately 13 percent.[46] Herbalife and the FTC reached a settlement agreement in July 2016, ending the agency's investigation into the company. On the day of the settlement, Fortune estimated that Ackman lost $500 million.[47]
Ackman's position on Herbalife led to a discussion on live television with Herbalife supporter Carl Icahn for nearly half an hour on CNBC on January 25, 2013.[48][49][50] During the segment, Icahn called Ackman "a crybaby in the schoolyard" and claimed that going public with his short position would eventually force Ackman into the "mother of all short squeezes." On November 22, 2013, he admitted on Bloomberg Television that Pershing Square's open short position in Herbalife was "$400 million to $500 million" in the red, but that he wouldn't be squeezed out and would hold the short "to the end of the earth".[51]
Political and economic views[edit]
He endorsed Michael Bloomberg as a prospective candidate for President of the United States in the 2016 presidential election.[52] After Donald Trump became president Ackman told Andrew Ross Sorkin of The New York Times that he was "bullish" on Trump's presidency.[53]
Philanthropy[edit]
Ackman has given to charitable causes such as the Center for Jewish History to preserve Jewish genealogy[54] where he spearheaded a successful effort to retire their $30 million in debt, personally contributing $6.8 million.[55][56] This donation made with that of Bruce Berkowitz, founder of Fairholme Capital Management, and Joseph Steinberg, president of Leucadia National, were the three largest individual gifts that the center has ever received.[57]
Ackman's foundation donated $1.1 million to the Innocence Project in New York City and Centurion Ministries in Princeton, N.J.[55] He is a signatory of The Giving Pledge, committing himself to give away at least 50% of his wealth to charitable causes.[58]
In 2006, Ackman co-founded The Pershing Square Foundation, alongside his wife at the time Karen, to support innovation in the areas of economic development, education, healthcare, human rights, arts and urban development.[59] Since it was founded, the foundation has committed more than $400 million in grants and social investments. In 2011, the Ackmans were among The Chronicle of Philanthropy’s "Philanthropy 50" list of the most generous donors.[60]
In July 2014, Challenged Athletes Foundation, which provides sports equipment to those with physical disabilities, honored Ackman at a gala fundraiser at the Waldorf Astoria hotel in New York City for helping raise a record $2.3 million.[61]
Personal life[edit]
He married Karen Ann Herskovitz, a graduate of Harvard University and a landscape architect, on July 10, 1994.[62] She is on the board of directors of Human Rights Watch[63] and on the board of Friends of the High Line.[55][64] They have three children.[7] On December 22, 2016 it was reported that the couple had separated.[65][66]

William Albert Ackman (born May 11, 1966) is an American investor, hedge fund manager, and philanthropist. He is the founder and CEO of Pershing Square Capital Management, a hedge fund management company. Ackman is considered a contrarian investor[1][2] but he considers himself an activist investor.[3][4] Research published at The University of Oxford characterizes Bill Ackman's activities with Canadian Pacific Railway as paradigmatic of "engaged activism" – which is longer term in nature with correlated benefits to the real economy, as distinct from shorter term "financial activism".[5]
His investing style and investments have had its fair share of critical praise and criticism from U.S. federal and state government officials, heads of other hedge funds, various retail investors, and the general public. Ackman's most notable market plays include shorting MBIA's bonds during the 2008 financial crisis, his proxy battle with Canadian Pacific Railway, as well as his stakes in the Target Corporation, Valeant Pharmaceuticals, and Chipotle Mexican Grill. Since 2012, he has held a US$1 billion short against the nutrition company Herbalife, claiming the company is a pyramid scheme designed as a multi-level marketing firm.[6]

Early life and education[edit]
Ackman was raised in Chappaqua, New York, the son of Ronnie I. (née Posner) and Lawrence David Ackman, the chairman of a New York real estate financing firm, Ackman-Ziff Real Estate Group.[7][8] His family is Jewish.[9][10]
In 1988, he received a bachelor of arts degree magna cum laude in history from Harvard College. His thesis was "Scaling the Ivy Wall: the Jewish and Asian American Experience in Harvard Admissions."[11] In 1992, he received an MBA from Harvard Business School.[12]
Career[edit]
Gotham Partners[edit]
In 1992, Ackman founded the investment firm Gotham Partners with fellow Harvard graduate David P. Berkowitz. This investment firm made small investments in public companies.[7] In 1995, Ackman partnered with the insurance and real estate firm Leucadia National to bid for Rockefeller Center. Although they did not win the deal, the bid caused increased interest in Gotham Partners from investors, which led to $500 million in assets by 1998.[7] By 2002, Gotham Partners had become entrenched in litigation with various outside shareholders who also owned an interest in the same companies in which Gotham invested.[7]
Despite an ongoing probe of his trading by New York State and federal authorities, Ackman began research challenging MBIA's AAA rating. He was charged fees for copying 725,000 pages of statements regarding the financial services company in his law firm's compliance with a subpoena.[13] Ackman called for a division between MBIA's bond insurers' structured finance business and its municipal bond insurance business.[14] He argued that MBIA was legally restricted from trading billions of dollars of credit default swap (CDS) protection MBIA had sold against various mortgage backed CDOs, and was using a second corporation, LaCrosse Financial Products, which MBIA described as an "orphaned transformer". Ackman bought credit default swaps against MBIA corporate debt and sold the swaps for a large profit during the financial crisis of 2008 He reported covering his short position on MBIA on January 16, 2009, according to the 13D filed with the SEC.[15]
In 2003, a feud developed between Ackman and Carl Icahn over a deal involving Hallwood Realty. They agreed to a "schmuck insurance", which said that if Icahn sold the shares within 3 years and made a profit of 10% or more, he and Ackman would split the proceeds. Carl Icahn paid $80 per share. In April 2004, HRPT Property Trust acquired Hallwood, paying $136.16 per share. Under the terms, Icahn owed Ackman investors about $4.5 million, but refused to pay. Ackman sued. Eight years later, the Court forced Icahn to pay $4.5 million, plus 9% interest per year since the date of the sale.[16][17][18]
Pershing Square Capital Management[edit]
In 2004, with $54 million in funding from his personal funds and from his former business partner, Leucadia National, Ackman started Pershing Square Capital Management.[7] In 2005, Pershing bought a significant share in the fast food chain Wendy's International and successfully pressured it to sell its Tim Hortons doughnut chain. Wendy's spun off Tim Hortons through an IPO in 2006 and raised $670 million for Wendy's investors. After Ackman sold his shares at a substantial profit after a dispute over executive succession, the stock price collapsed, raising criticism that the sale of Wendy's fastest-growing unit left the company in a weaker market position. Ackman blamed the poor performance on their new CEO.[7] Pershing Square Holdings amounted to 22.2% in returns since inception (Dec. 2012 – Dec. 2015) under Ackman’s management, 30% below the S&P 500.[19]
In December 2007, his funds owned a 10% stake in Target Corporation, valued at $4.2 billion[20] through the purchase of stock and derivatives.[21] In December 2010, his funds held a 38% stake in Borders Group and on December 6, 2010, Ackman indicated he would finance a buyout of Barnes & Noble for US$900M.[22]
At a panel meeting discussing Bernie Madoff in January 2009, Ackman defended his longtime friend Ezra Merkin, stating, "Has Ezra committed a crime? I don’t think so,” "I think [Merkin] is an honest person, an intelligent person, an interesting person, a smart investor."[23][24][25] In April 2009, Merkin was charged with civil fraud by the State of New York, for "secretly steering $2.4 billion in client money into Bernard Madoff's Ponzi fraud without their permission."[26] A settlement was reached on June 2012 requiring Merkin to pay $405 million to victims including the Metropolitan Council on Jewish Poverty.[27]
Ackman started buying J. C. Penney shares in 2010, paying an average of $22 for 39 million shares or 18 percent of Penney's stock. In August 2013, Ackman's two-year campaign to transform the department store came to an abrupt end after he decided to step down from the board following an argument with fellow board members.[28] In a statement dated August 27, 2013 Pershing Square reported that it had hired Citigroup to liquidate the 39.1 million shares the firm then owned of the Plano, Texas-based department-store chain at a price of $12.90 per share, resulting in a loss of approximately $500 million to Pershing Square.[29] In January 2015, LCH Investments named Ackman as one of the world's top 20 hedge fund managers after Pershing Square delivered $4.5 billion in net gains for investors in 2014, bringing the fund's lifetime gains to $11.6 billion since its launch in 2004 through year-end 2014.[30]
On April 27, 2016, Ackman along with Valeant Pharmaceuticals' outgoing CEO, J. Michael Pearson, and the company's former interim CEO, Howard Schiller, testified before the United States Senate Special Committee on Aging.[31] The testifying panel answered questions related to the Committee's concerns for repercussions to patients and the health care system posed by Valeant's business model and controversial pricing practices.[32] Ackman sold his remaining 27.2 million share position in Valeant to the Investment Bank Jeffries for about $300 million in March 2017. It has been estimated that the total cost of the position, including direct stock purchases and 9.1 million shares that were underlying stock options traded with Nomura Global Financial Products, was $4.6 billion, leading to a loss greater than 100 percent of the original price of the securities.[33][34]
According to Forbes Magazine, Ackman has a net worth of US$1.4 billion as of February 2017.[35]
Herbalife short[edit]
In December 2012, Ackman issued a research report that was critical of Herbalife's multi-level marketing business model, calling it a pyramid scheme.[36] Ackman disclosed that his hedge fund, Pershing Square Capital Management, sold short the company's shares directly (not with derivatives) starting in May 2012, which led Herbalife's stock price to drop. In 2014, Ackman spent $50 million on a public relations campaign against Herbalife, which was designed to negatively impact the company's stock price.[37][38] Ackman pays about $100 million annually to maintain his short position.[39]
Former Rep. Bob Barr (R-GA) has called on Congress to investigate Ackman's use of public relations and regulatory pressure in his short campaign, and Harvey L. Pitt, a former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, questioned whether Ackman's aims to move the price rather than spread the truth.[40][41] In 2014, Senator Ed Markey wrote letters to federal regulators, including the FTC and the SEC, demanding they open an investigation into Herbalife's business practices. The day the letters were released, the company's stock dropped 14 percent. Markey later told the Boston Globe that his staff had not informed him that Ackman stood to benefit financially from the Senator's actions but defended the letters as a matter of consumer rights.[42]
In March 2014, the New York Times reported that Ackman had employed tactics to undermine public confidence in Herbalife to lower its stock price, including pressuring state and federal regulators to investigate the company, paying individuals to travel to and participate in rallies against the company and boosting its spending on donations to non-profit Latino organizations. According to the article, numerous letters were sent to federal regulators by groups such as the Hispanic Federation and the National Consumers League. "Each person contacted by The Times acknowledged in interviews that they wrote the letters after being lobbied by representatives from Pershing Square, or said they did not remember writing the letters at all. Mr. Ackman's team also then started to make payments totaling about $130,000 to some of these groups, including the Hispanic Federation — money he said was being used to help find victims of Herbalife."[43]
On March 12, 2015, The Wall Street Journal reported that prosecutors in the Manhattan U.S. attorney's office and the FBI were investigating whether people hired by Ackman "made false statements about Herbalife's business model to regulators and others in order to spur investigations into the company and lower its stock price."[44][45] In March 2015, U.S. District Judge Dale Fischer, in Los Angeles, California, dismissed a suit filed by Herbalife investors alleging the company is operating an illegal pyramid scheme. In response to Fischer's ruling, Herbalife stock surged approximately 13 percent.[46] Herbalife and the FTC reached a settlement agreement in July 2016, ending the agency's investigation into the company. On the day of the settlement, Fortune estimated that Ackman lost $500 million.[47]
Ackman's position on Herbalife led to a discussion on live television with Herbalife supporter Carl Icahn for nearly half an hour on CNBC on January 25, 2013.[48][49][50] During the segment, Icahn called Ackman "a crybaby in the schoolyard" and claimed that going public with his short position would eventually force Ackman into the "mother of all short squeezes." On November 22, 2013, he admitted on Bloomberg Television that Pershing Square's open short position in Herbalife was "$400 million to $500 million" in the red, but that he wouldn't be squeezed out and would hold the short "to the end of the earth".[51]
Political and economic views[edit]
He endorsed Michael Bloomberg as a prospective candidate for President of the United States in the 2016 presidential election.[52] After Donald Trump became president Ackman told Andrew Ross Sorkin of The New York Times that he was "bullish" on Trump's presidency.[53]
Philanthropy[edit]
Ackman has given to charitable causes such as the Center for Jewish History to preserve Jewish genealogy[54] where he spearheaded a successful effort to retire their $30 million in debt, personally contributing $6.8 million.[55][56] This donation made with that of Bruce Berkowitz, founder of Fairholme Capital Management, and Joseph Steinberg, president of Leucadia National, were the three largest individual gifts that the center has ever received.[57]
Ackman's foundation donated $1.1 million to the Innocence Project in New York City and Centurion Ministries in Princeton, N.J.[55] He is a signatory of The Giving Pledge, committing himself to give away at least 50% of his wealth to charitable causes.[58]
In 2006, Ackman co-founded The Pershing Square Foundation, alongside his wife at the time Karen, to support innovation in the areas of economic development, education, healthcare, human rights, arts and urban development.[59] Since it was founded, the foundation has committed more than $400 million in grants and social investments. In 2011, the Ackmans were among The Chronicle of Philanthropy’s "Philanthropy 50" list of the most generous donors.[60]
In July 2014, Challenged Athletes Foundation, which provides sports equipment to those with physical disabilities, honored Ackman at a gala fundraiser at the Waldorf Astoria hotel in New York City for helping raise a record $2.3 million.[61]
Personal life[edit]
He married Karen Ann Herskovitz, a graduate of Harvard University and a landscape architect, on July 10, 1994.[62] She is on the board of directors of Human Rights Watch[63] and on the board of Friends of the High Line.[55][64] They have three children.[7] On December 22, 2016 it was reported that the couple had separated.[65][66]

William Albert Ackman (born May 11, 1966) is an American investor, hedge fund manager, and philanthropist. He is the founder and CEO of Pershing Square Capital Management, a hedge fund management company. Ackman is considered a contrarian investor[1][2] but he considers himself an activist investor.[3][4] Research published at The University of Oxford characterizes Bill Ackman's activities with Canadian Pacific Railway as paradigmatic of "engaged activism" – which is longer term in nature with correlated benefits to the real economy, as distinct from shorter term "financial activism".[5]
His investing style and investments have had its fair share of critical praise and criticism from U.S. federal and state government officials, heads of other hedge funds, various retail investors, and the general public. Ackman's most notable market plays include shorting MBIA's bonds during the 2008 financial crisis, his proxy battle with Canadian Pacific Railway, as well as his stakes in the Target Corporation, Valeant Pharmaceuticals, and Chipotle Mexican Grill. Since 2012, he has held a US$1 billion short against the nutrition company Herbalife, claiming the company is a pyramid scheme designed as a multi-level marketing firm.[6]

Early life and education[edit]
Ackman was raised in Chappaqua, New York, the son of Ronnie I. (née Posner) and Lawrence David Ackman, the chairman of a New York real estate financing firm, Ackman-Ziff Real Estate Group.[7][8] His family is Jewish.[9][10]
In 1988, he received a bachelor of arts degree magna cum laude in history from Harvard College. His thesis was "Scaling the Ivy Wall: the Jewish and Asian American Experience in Harvard Admissions."[11] In 1992, he received an MBA from Harvard Business School.[12]
Career[edit]
Gotham Partners[edit]
In 1992, Ackman founded the investment firm Gotham Partners with fellow Harvard graduate David P. Berkowitz. This investment firm made small investments in public companies.[7] In 1995, Ackman partnered with the insurance and real estate firm Leucadia National to bid for Rockefeller Center. Although they did not win the deal, the bid caused increased interest in Gotham Partners from investors, which led to $500 million in assets by 1998.[7] By 2002, Gotham Partners had become entrenched in litigation with various outside shareholders who also owned an interest in the same companies in which Gotham invested.[7]
Despite an ongoing probe of his trading by New York State and federal authorities, Ackman began research challenging MBIA's AAA rating. He was charged fees for copying 725,000 pages of statements regarding the financial services company in his law firm's compliance with a subpoena.[13] Ackman called for a division between MBIA's bond insurers' structured finance business and its municipal bond insurance business.[14] He argued that MBIA was legally restricted from trading billions of dollars of credit default swap (CDS) protection MBIA had sold against various mortgage backed CDOs, and was using a second corporation, LaCrosse Financial Products, which MBIA described as an "orphaned transformer". Ackman bought credit default swaps against MBIA corporate debt and sold the swaps for a large profit during the financial crisis of 2008 He reported covering his short position on MBIA on January 16, 2009, according to the 13D filed with the SEC.[15]
In 2003, a feud developed between Ackman and Carl Icahn over a deal involving Hallwood Realty. They agreed to a "schmuck insurance", which said that if Icahn sold the shares within 3 years and made a profit of 10% or more, he and Ackman would split the proceeds. Carl Icahn paid $80 per share. In April 2004, HRPT Property Trust acquired Hallwood, paying $136.16 per share. Under the terms, Icahn owed Ackman investors about $4.5 million, but refused to pay. Ackman sued. Eight years later, the Court forced Icahn to pay $4.5 million, plus 9% interest per year since the date of the sale.[16][17][18]
Pershing Square Capital Management[edit]
In 2004, with $54 million in funding from his personal funds and from his former business partner, Leucadia National, Ackman started Pershing Square Capital Management.[7] In 2005, Pershing bought a significant share in the fast food chain Wendy's International and successfully pressured it to sell its Tim Hortons doughnut chain. Wendy's spun off Tim Hortons through an IPO in 2006 and raised $670 million for Wendy's investors. After Ackman sold his shares at a substantial profit after a dispute over executive succession, the stock price collapsed, raising criticism that the sale of Wendy's fastest-growing unit left the company in a weaker market position. Ackman blamed the poor performance on their new CEO.[7] Pershing Square Holdings amounted to 22.2% in returns since inception (Dec. 2012 – Dec. 2015) under Ackman’s management, 30% below the S&P 500.[19]
In December 2007, his funds owned a 10% stake in Target Corporation, valued at $4.2 billion[20] through the purchase of stock and derivatives.[21] In December 2010, his funds held a 38% stake in Borders Group and on December 6, 2010, Ackman indicated he would finance a buyout of Barnes & Noble for US$900M.[22]
At a panel meeting discussing Bernie Madoff in January 2009, Ackman defended his longtime friend Ezra Merkin, stating, "Has Ezra committed a crime? I don’t think so,” "I think [Merkin] is an honest person, an intelligent person, an interesting person, a smart investor."[23][24][25] In April 2009, Merkin was charged with civil fraud by the State of New York, for "secretly steering $2.4 billion in client money into Bernard Madoff's Ponzi fraud without their permission."[26] A settlement was reached on June 2012 requiring Merkin to pay $405 million to victims including the Metropolitan Council on Jewish Poverty.[27]
Ackman started buying J. C. Penney shares in 2010, paying an average of $22 for 39 million shares or 18 percent of Penney's stock. In August 2013, Ackman's two-year campaign to transform the department store came to an abrupt end after he decided to step down from the board following an argument with fellow board members.[28] In a statement dated August 27, 2013 Pershing Square reported that it had hired Citigroup to liquidate the 39.1 million shares the firm then owned of the Plano, Texas-based department-store chain at a price of $12.90 per share, resulting in a loss of approximately $500 million to Pershing Square.[29] In January 2015, LCH Investments named Ackman as one of the world's top 20 hedge fund managers after Pershing Square delivered $4.5 billion in net gains for investors in 2014, bringing the fund's lifetime gains to $11.6 billion since its launch in 2004 through year-end 2014.[30]
On April 27, 2016, Ackman along with Valeant Pharmaceuticals' outgoing CEO, J. Michael Pearson, and the company's former interim CEO, Howard Schiller, testified before the United States Senate Special Committee on Aging.[31] The testifying panel answered questions related to the Committee's concerns for repercussions to patients and the health care system posed by Valeant's business model and controversial pricing practices.[32] Ackman sold his remaining 27.2 million share position in Valeant to the Investment Bank Jeffries for about $300 million in March 2017. It has been estimated that the total cost of the position, including direct stock purchases and 9.1 million shares that were underlying stock options traded with Nomura Global Financial Products, was $4.6 billion, leading to a loss greater than 100 percent of the original price of the securities.[33][34]
According to Forbes Magazine, Ackman has a net worth of US$1.4 billion as of February 2017.[35]
Herbalife short[edit]
In December 2012, Ackman issued a research report that was critical of Herbalife's multi-level marketing business model, calling it a pyramid scheme.[36] Ackman disclosed that his hedge fund, Pershing Square Capital Management, sold short the company's shares directly (not with derivatives) starting in May 2012, which led Herbalife's stock price to drop. In 2014, Ackman spent $50 million on a public relations campaign against Herbalife, which was designed to negatively impact the company's stock price.[37][38] Ackman pays about $100 million annually to maintain his short position.[39]
Former Rep. Bob Barr (R-GA) has called on Congress to investigate Ackman's use of public relations and regulatory pressure in his short campaign, and Harvey L. Pitt, a former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, questioned whether Ackman's aims to move the price rather than spread the truth.[40][41] In 2014, Senator Ed Markey wrote letters to federal regulators, including the FTC and the SEC, demanding they open an investigation into Herbalife's business practices. The day the letters were released, the company's stock dropped 14 percent. Markey later told the Boston Globe that his staff had not informed him that Ackman stood to benefit financially from the Senator's actions but defended the letters as a matter of consumer rights.[42]
In March 2014, the New York Times reported that Ackman had employed tactics to undermine public confidence in Herbalife to lower its stock price, including pressuring state and federal regulators to investigate the company, paying individuals to travel to and participate in rallies against the company and boosting its spending on donations to non-profit Latino organizations. According to the article, numerous letters were sent to federal regulators by groups such as the Hispanic Federation and the National Consumers League. "Each person contacted by The Times acknowledged in interviews that they wrote the letters after being lobbied by representatives from Pershing Square, or said they did not remember writing the letters at all. Mr. Ackman's team also then started to make payments totaling about $130,000 to some of these groups, including the Hispanic Federation — money he said was being used to help find victims of Herbalife."[43]
On March 12, 2015, The Wall Street Journal reported that prosecutors in the Manhattan U.S. attorney's office and the FBI were investigating whether people hired by Ackman "made false statements about Herbalife's business model to regulators and others in order to spur investigations into the company and lower its stock price."[44][45] In March 2015, U.S. District Judge Dale Fischer, in Los Angeles, California, dismissed a suit filed by Herbalife investors alleging the company is operating an illegal pyramid scheme. In response to Fischer's ruling, Herbalife stock surged approximately 13 percent.[46] Herbalife and the FTC reached a settlement agreement in July 2016, ending the agency's investigation into the company. On the day of the settlement, Fortune estimated that Ackman lost $500 million.[47]
Ackman's position on Herbalife led to a discussion on live television with Herbalife supporter Carl Icahn for nearly half an hour on CNBC on January 25, 2013.[48][49][50] During the segment, Icahn called Ackman "a crybaby in the schoolyard" and claimed that going public with his short position would eventually force Ackman into the "mother of all short squeezes." On November 22, 2013, he admitted on Bloomberg Television that Pershing Square's open short position in Herbalife was "$400 million to $500 million" in the red, but that he wouldn't be squeezed out and would hold the short "to the end of the earth".[51]
Political and economic views[edit]
He endorsed Michael Bloomberg as a prospective candidate for President of the United States in the 2016 presidential election.[52] After Donald Trump became president Ackman told Andrew Ross Sorkin of The New York Times that he was "bullish" on Trump's presidency.[53]
Philanthropy[edit]
Ackman has given to charitable causes such as the Center for Jewish History to preserve Jewish genealogy[54] where he spearheaded a successful effort to retire their $30 million in debt, personally contributing $6.8 million.[55][56] This donation made with that of Bruce Berkowitz, founder of Fairholme Capital Management, and Joseph Steinberg, president of Leucadia National, were the three largest individual gifts that the center has ever received.[57]
Ackman's foundation donated $1.1 million to the Innocence Project in New York City and Centurion Ministries in Princeton, N.J.[55] He is a signatory of The Giving Pledge, committing himself to give away at least 50% of his wealth to charitable causes.[58]
In 2006, Ackman co-founded The Pershing Square Foundation, alongside his wife at the time Karen, to support innovation in the areas of economic development, education, healthcare, human rights, arts and urban development.[59] Since it was founded, the foundation has committed more than $400 million in grants and social investments. In 2011, the Ackmans were among The Chronicle of Philanthropy’s "Philanthropy 50" list of the most generous donors.[60]
In July 2014, Challenged Athletes Foundation, which provides sports equipment to those with physical disabilities, honored Ackman at a gala fundraiser at the Waldorf Astoria hotel in New York City for helping raise a record $2.3 million.[61]
Personal life[edit]
He married Karen Ann Herskovitz, a graduate of Harvard University and a landscape architect, on July 10, 1994.[62] She is on the board of directors of Human Rights Watch[63] and on the board of Friends of the High Line.[55][64] They have three children.[7] On December 22, 2016 it was reported that the couple had separated.[65][66]

William Albert Ackman (born May 11, 1966) is an American investor, hedge fund manager, and philanthropist. He is the founder and CEO of Pershing Square Capital Management, a hedge fund management company. Ackman is considered a contrarian investor[1][2] but he considers himself an activist investor.[3][4] Research published at The University of Oxford characterizes Bill Ackman's activities with Canadian Pacific Railway as paradigmatic of "engaged activism" – which is longer term in nature with correlated benefits to the real economy, as distinct from shorter term "financial activism".[5]
His investing style and investments have had its fair share of critical praise and criticism from U.S. federal and state government officials, heads of other hedge funds, various retail investors, and the general public. Ackman's most notable market plays include shorting MBIA's bonds during the 2008 financial crisis, his proxy battle with Canadian Pacific Railway, as well as his stakes in the Target Corporation, Valeant Pharmaceuticals, and Chipotle Mexican Grill. Since 2012, he has held a US$1 billion short against the nutrition company Herbalife, claiming the company is a pyramid scheme designed as a multi-level marketing firm.[6]

Early life and education[edit]
Ackman was raised in Chappaqua, New York, the son of Ronnie I. (née Posner) and Lawrence David Ackman, the chairman of a New York real estate financing firm, Ackman-Ziff Real Estate Group.[7][8] His family is Jewish.[9][10]
In 1988, he received a bachelor of arts degree magna cum laude in history from Harvard College. His thesis was "Scaling the Ivy Wall: the Jewish and Asian American Experience in Harvard Admissions."[11] In 1992, he received an MBA from Harvard Business School.[12]
Career[edit]
Gotham Partners[edit]
In 1992, Ackman founded the investment firm Gotham Partners with fellow Harvard graduate David P. Berkowitz. This investment firm made small investments in public companies.[7] In 1995, Ackman partnered with the insurance and real estate firm Leucadia National to bid for Rockefeller Center. Although they did not win the deal, the bid caused increased interest in Gotham Partners from investors, which led to $500 million in assets by 1998.[7] By 2002, Gotham Partners had become entrenched in litigation with various outside shareholders who also owned an interest in the same companies in which Gotham invested.[7]
Despite an ongoing probe of his trading by New York State and federal authorities, Ackman began research challenging MBIA's AAA rating. He was charged fees for copying 725,000 pages of statements regarding the financial services company in his law firm's compliance with a subpoena.[13] Ackman called for a division between MBIA's bond insurers' structured finance business and its municipal bond insurance business.[14] He argued that MBIA was legally restricted from trading billions of dollars of credit default swap (CDS) protection MBIA had sold against various mortgage backed CDOs, and was using a second corporation, LaCrosse Financial Products, which MBIA described as an "orphaned transformer". Ackman bought credit default swaps against MBIA corporate debt and sold the swaps for a large profit during the financial crisis of 2008 He reported covering his short position on MBIA on January 16, 2009, according to the 13D filed with the SEC.[15]
In 2003, a feud developed between Ackman and Carl Icahn over a deal involving Hallwood Realty. They agreed to a "schmuck insurance", which said that if Icahn sold the shares within 3 years and made a profit of 10% or more, he and Ackman would split the proceeds. Carl Icahn paid $80 per share. In April 2004, HRPT Property Trust acquired Hallwood, paying $136.16 per share. Under the terms, Icahn owed Ackman investors about $4.5 million, but refused to pay. Ackman sued. Eight years later, the Court forced Icahn to pay $4.5 million, plus 9% interest per year since the date of the sale.[16][17][18]
Pershing Square Capital Management[edit]
In 2004, with $54 million in funding from his personal funds and from his former business partner, Leucadia National, Ackman started Pershing Square Capital Management.[7] In 2005, Pershing bought a significant share in the fast food chain Wendy's International and successfully pressured it to sell its Tim Hortons doughnut chain. Wendy's spun off Tim Hortons through an IPO in 2006 and raised $670 million for Wendy's investors. After Ackman sold his shares at a substantial profit after a dispute over executive succession, the stock price collapsed, raising criticism that the sale of Wendy's fastest-growing unit left the company in a weaker market position. Ackman blamed the poor performance on their new CEO.[7] Pershing Square Holdings amounted to 22.2% in returns since inception (Dec. 2012 – Dec. 2015) under Ackman’s management, 30% below the S&P 500.[19]
In December 2007, his funds owned a 10% stake in Target Corporation, valued at $4.2 billion[20] through the purchase of stock and derivatives.[21] In December 2010, his funds held a 38% stake in Borders Group and on December 6, 2010, Ackman indicated he would finance a buyout of Barnes & Noble for US$900M.[22]
At a panel meeting discussing Bernie Madoff in January 2009, Ackman defended his longtime friend Ezra Merkin, stating, "Has Ezra committed a crime? I don’t think so,” "I think [Merkin] is an honest person, an intelligent person, an interesting person, a smart investor."[23][24][25] In April 2009, Merkin was charged with civil fraud by the State of New York, for "secretly steering $2.4 billion in client money into Bernard Madoff's Ponzi fraud without their permission."[26] A settlement was reached on June 2012 requiring Merkin to pay $405 million to victims including the Metropolitan Council on Jewish Poverty.[27]
Ackman started buying J. C. Penney shares in 2010, paying an average of $22 for 39 million shares or 18 percent of Penney's stock. In August 2013, Ackman's two-year campaign to transform the department store came to an abrupt end after he decided to step down from the board following an argument with fellow board members.[28] In a statement dated August 27, 2013 Pershing Square reported that it had hired Citigroup to liquidate the 39.1 million shares the firm then owned of the Plano, Texas-based department-store chain at a price of $12.90 per share, resulting in a loss of approximately $500 million to Pershing Square.[29] In January 2015, LCH Investments named Ackman as one of the world's top 20 hedge fund managers after Pershing Square delivered $4.5 billion in net gains for investors in 2014, bringing the fund's lifetime gains to $11.6 billion since its launch in 2004 through year-end 2014.[30]
On April 27, 2016, Ackman along with Valeant Pharmaceuticals' outgoing CEO, J. Michael Pearson, and the company's former interim CEO, Howard Schiller, testified before the United States Senate Special Committee on Aging.[31] The testifying panel answered questions related to the Committee's concerns for repercussions to patients and the health care system posed by Valeant's business model and controversial pricing practices.[32] Ackman sold his remaining 27.2 million share position in Valeant to the Investment Bank Jeffries for about $300 million in March 2017. It has been estimated that the total cost of the position, including direct stock purchases and 9.1 million shares that were underlying stock options traded with Nomura Global Financial Products, was $4.6 billion, leading to a loss greater than 100 percent of the original price of the securities.[33][34]
According to Forbes Magazine, Ackman has a net worth of US$1.4 billion as of February 2017.[35]
Herbalife short[edit]
In December 2012, Ackman issued a research report that was critical of Herbalife's multi-level marketing business model, calling it a pyramid scheme.[36] Ackman disclosed that his hedge fund, Pershing Square Capital Management, sold short the company's shares directly (not with derivatives) starting in May 2012, which led Herbalife's stock price to drop. In 2014, Ackman spent $50 million on a public relations campaign against Herbalife, which was designed to negatively impact the company's stock price.[37][38] Ackman pays about $100 million annually to maintain his short position.[39]
Former Rep. Bob Barr (R-GA) has called on Congress to investigate Ackman's use of public relations and regulatory pressure in his short campaign, and Harvey L. Pitt, a former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, questioned whether Ackman's aims to move the price rather than spread the truth.[40][41] In 2014, Senator Ed Markey wrote letters to federal regulators, including the FTC and the SEC, demanding they open an investigation into Herbalife's business practices. The day the letters were released, the company's stock dropped 14 percent. Markey later told the Boston Globe that his staff had not informed him that Ackman stood to benefit financially from the Senator's actions but defended the letters as a matter of consumer rights.[42]
In March 2014, the New York Times reported that Ackman had employed tactics to undermine public confidence in Herbalife to lower its stock price, including pressuring state and federal regulators to investigate the company, paying individuals to travel to and participate in rallies against the company and boosting its spending on donations to non-profit Latino organizations. According to the article, numerous letters were sent to federal regulators by groups such as the Hispanic Federation and the National Consumers League. "Each person contacted by The Times acknowledged in interviews that they wrote the letters after being lobbied by representatives from Pershing Square, or said they did not remember writing the letters at all. Mr. Ackman's team also then started to make payments totaling about $130,000 to some of these groups, including the Hispanic Federation — money he said was being used to help find victims of Herbalife."[43]
On March 12, 2015, The Wall Street Journal reported that prosecutors in the Manhattan U.S. attorney's office and the FBI were investigating whether people hired by Ackman "made false statements about Herbalife's business model to regulators and others in order to spur investigations into the company and lower its stock price."[44][45] In March 2015, U.S. District Judge Dale Fischer, in Los Angeles, California, dismissed a suit filed by Herbalife investors alleging the company is operating an illegal pyramid scheme. In response to Fischer's ruling, Herbalife stock surged approximately 13 percent.[46] Herbalife and the FTC reached a settlement agreement in July 2016, ending the agency's investigation into the company. On the day of the settlement, Fortune estimated that Ackman lost $500 million.[47]
Ackman's position on Herbalife led to a discussion on live television with Herbalife supporter Carl Icahn for nearly half an hour on CNBC on January 25, 2013.[48][49][50] During the segment, Icahn called Ackman "a crybaby in the schoolyard" and claimed that going public with his short position would eventually force Ackman into the "mother of all short squeezes." On November 22, 2013, he admitted on Bloomberg Television that Pershing Square's open short position in Herbalife was "$400 million to $500 million" in the red, but that he wouldn't be squeezed out and would hold the short "to the end of the earth".[51]
Political and economic views[edit]
He endorsed Michael Bloomberg as a prospective candidate for President of the United States in the 2016 presidential election.[52] After Donald Trump became president Ackman told Andrew Ross Sorkin of The New York Times that he was "bullish" on Trump's presidency.[53]
Philanthropy[edit]
Ackman has given to charitable causes such as the Center for Jewish History to preserve Jewish genealogy[54] where he spearheaded a successful effort to retire their $30 million in debt, personally contributing $6.8 million.[55][56] This donation made with that of Bruce Berkowitz, founder of Fairholme Capital Management, and Joseph Steinberg, president of Leucadia National, were the three largest individual gifts that the center has ever received.[57]
Ackman's foundation donated $1.1 million to the Innocence Project in New York City and Centurion Ministries in Princeton, N.J.[55] He is a signatory of The Giving Pledge, committing himself to give away at least 50% of his wealth to charitable causes.[58]
In 2006, Ackman co-founded The Pershing Square Foundation, alongside his wife at the time Karen, to support innovation in the areas of economic development, education, healthcare, human rights, arts and urban development.[59] Since it was founded, the foundation has committed more than $400 million in grants and social investments. In 2011, the Ackmans were among The Chronicle of Philanthropy’s "Philanthropy 50" list of the most generous donors.[60]
In July 2014, Challenged Athletes Foundation, which provides sports equipment to those with physical disabilities, honored Ackman at a gala fundraiser at the Waldorf Astoria hotel in New York City for helping raise a record $2.3 million.[61]
Personal life[edit]
He married Karen Ann Herskovitz, a graduate of Harvard University and a landscape architect, on July 10, 1994.[62] She is on the board of directors of Human Rights Watch[63] and on the board of Friends of the High Line.[55][64] They have three children.[7] On December 22, 2016 it was reported that the couple had separated.[65][66]

"This is a $200 plus stock over the next three years with new management," Ackman said at an investment conference. Ackman's Pershing Square Capital Management is Air Products' biggest shareholder with a 9.71 percent stake. The company has been looking for a new leader since Chief Executive Officer John McGlade said in September that he would retire this year. McGlade plans to stay on as chairman of the board for a limited time as the new CEO settles in. Air Products is one of the world's largest industrial gas companies, breaking down air to form oxygen, nitrogen and other components used in construction, healthcare, oil refining and scores of other industries. McGlade's replacement will have to turn around a corporate culture that has long had a reputation as top-down and bureaucratic. That inefficiency has cost the company market share and dented margins, which badly trail Praxair Inc (PX.N) and other rivals. Air Products also has invested capital in unrelated businesses, including specialty chemicals for electronics makers and liquefied natural gas heat exchangers, that Ackman and others have said diverts the company from its core mission. Since McGlade's announcement, the company's stock price has moved up and down and is now trading only about 2 percent higher at $112.04 then where it was in late September. As an activist investor, Ackman knows firsthand how selecting the right person for the top job can make or break investments. Watching Ron Johnson's vision for remaking J.C.Penney (JCP.N) fall apart cost his hedge fund $500 million, but installing Hunter Harrison at Canadian Pacific (CP.TO) helped him earn more than $2 billion in less than two years. "The risk at Air Products is whether or not they are going to choose the right CEO," Ackman said at the 2014 Harbor Investment Conference, which he runs with Mark Axelowitz. Pershing Square does not sit on the Air Products board and will have no official say in who ends up getting the job, Ackman said. But as the biggest shareholder, the hedge fund does have significant influence over the decision. "No one would be willing to take the job without having the biggest shareholder on their side," Ackman said.

Ackman talks Herbalife, P&G, Target, Air Products

Bill Ackman


  Herbalife is now a "levered pyramid scheme" because of new financing; Target has "lost some of its magic;" Procter & Gamble is a "phenomenal business with an enormous opportunity;" and Air Products and Chemicals will "make a lot of money." 
  Those are some of the views expressed Wednesday by hedge fund manager Bill Ackman at a charity event in New York City. 
  The founder of $12 billion Pershing Square Capital Management gave answers to a wide-ranging set of questions from members of the audience at The Harbor Investment Conference, which also featured Jonathan Gray of Blackstone Group, Philip Hilal of Kingdon Capital Management, Stephen Errico of Locust Wood Capital Advisers and others. 

  On Herbalife, Ackman weighed in on the multilevel marketing company's recent round of financing, which included a stock buyback and debt offering. He dismissed the move as just an addition to Herbalife's balance sheet. 
  "The company is now a levered pyramid scheme," Ackman said to laughs. "We like that."

            The latest Herbalife twist   
			                        Monday,  3 Feb 2014 |  2:10  PM ET 




  Herbalife has aggressively fought Ackman's characterization of the company. 
  Ackman famously made a $1 billion short bet in December 2012.  He said his firm has yet to make money on the wager but that its short position is notionally larger today than ever before because of options on the stock.  
  Herbalife traded at about $42 just before Ackman's position was disclosed. It's now at around $65, but down 16.6 percent this year. A spokesman for the firm declined to comment.

  On Target, Ackman warned that the company had lost the buzz that once surrounded it and is likely to lose additional sales to online retailers like Amazon. 
  "It's a well-run retailer but it has lost some of its magic," Ackman said. "It seems to have lost some of its brand appeal. It's become more of a commodity retailer. It's selling food. It seems more like a slightly higher-end Wal-Mart. That's a bit of a risky place to be in the world." 
  Ackman also said the recent data breach of customer information at Target had done damage. 
  "Security of your data is something people feel strongly about, and they really have hurt their reputation and will have to do some things to win their customers back," he said. 
  Ackman does not appear to have a position in Target. He previously invested in the stock, but sold out in 2011 after losing a proxy fight with the company in 2009. 
  On Procter & Gamble, Ackman said the company had huge potential. 
  "There's an enormous, enormous opportunity there," Ackman said of rehired chief executive A.G. Lafley's potential to improve the business and cut costs. 
  "It's one of the great businesses of the world," he added, noting that brands like Crest, Tide and Gillette have "robust little minimonopolies" in their respective product sectors. 
  Pershing Square is a P&G shareholder, but recently cut its stake.

  Ackman also discussed Air Products, a large Pershing Square position representing 9.7 percent of the company. 
  He said the company, which makes various gas and chemical products that serve steel and other industries, was a stable, predictable business that would benefit as the world continues to industrialize. 
  "This is a great emerging market play," Ackman said. 
  He said Air Products should be a $200 or more stock in the next three years. Shares now trade around $111. Air Produts is in the process of selecting a new chief executive after the old CEO, John McGlade, stepped down in September under pressure from Pershing Square. 
  "The issue is it has not performed as well as the best-run peer," Ackman said in reference to Praxair. "If they can close the gap, if they can be a little more disciplined about allocating capital, they can make a lot of money."

  While the conference was effectively a love fest for Ackman, a small band of union protesters were positioned on the sidewalk near the entrance as attendees filed in. 
  Members of the International Union of Painters and Allied Trades District Council 15 held signs alleging that construction workers on the Las Vegas site of a Howard Hughes Corp. development--which Pershing owns a big chunk of--were being underpaid. 
  "Bill Ackman & [Howard Hughes CEO] David Weinreb's profits are robbed from construction workers wages & benefit," a flier alleged.  
  Union members said they could not discuss the matter with the media. Ackman and Weinreb, who also spoke at the event, didn't discuss the issue in their remarks. 
  The event, co-chaired by Ackman and UBS Private Wealth Management executive Mark Axelowitz, benefits the Boys & Girls Harbor, a nonprofit that provides education and other services to children in New York.

Bill Ackman Wins Air Products Management Shakeup






Antoine Gara



Sep 26, 2013 1:11 PM EDT













 




























































  Updated from 8:20 a.m. to include Valence Group comments and share prices. NEW YORK ( TheStreet) -- Air Products ( APD) will replace its CEO John E. McGlade in 2014 and elect three new independent directors to its Board of Directors, after Bill Ackman of Pershing Square Capital Management took a large stake in the chemicals manufacturer and pressed for change. The management and board shakeup at Air Products is Ackman's first successful activist move since he resigned from J.C. Penney's ( JCP) board of directors in August and sold Pershing's stake in the struggling retail chain for a loss of more then half a billion dollars. Ackman's Air Products campaign also comes as the hedgie continues to press a $1 billion short position in Herbalife ( HLF) that has drawn criticism from peers such as Carl Icahn of Icahn Associates and Dan Loeb of Third Point Capital Management. The unsuccessful campaign to turn J.C. Penney around and a controversial short position in Herbalife has caused some in the media to treat Ackman as a spectacle and question whether he has lost his clout on Wall Street. Ackman's involvement in the shakeup at Air Products, however, indicates that he still holds significant influence as an activist investor and has the ability to impact change on large corporations. "While we can debate whether Ackman's authority as an activist was tarnished after his J.C. Penney and Herbalife setbacks, Air Products proves that he still wields clout," Alex Khutorsky, managing director of The Valence Group, an M&A advisory investment bank focused on the chemical industry, said in an e-mail. "The avoidance of a noisy fight should satisfy shareholders who have benefited from Ackman's investment in the firm, and for the moment, appease Ackman," he added. Pershing Square built an over $2.2 billion stake in Air Products, about 10% of the company's outstanding shares, and advocated for management and board change after the company fell short on targets on its strategic initiative to grow revenue to $15 billion by 2015. Air Products currently has a market capitalization of over $22 billion and the company's over 27% year-to-date stock gain, largely influenced by Ackman's investment, is a turn from a spell of underperformance. Pershing Square also appears to have had an influence in change atop other prominent corporations this year. Earlier in 2013, Dow Jones Industrial Average component Procter & Gamble ( PG) replaced its CEO with A.G. Lafley, in a move cheered on by Ackman after Pershing took a large stake in the consumer products giant. Air Products said in a Thursday statement that the retirement of current CEO John E. McGlade in 2014, taken with its board change, will ensure that the company has appropriate experience and expertise to deliver long-term value for shareholders. "We invested in Air Products because it is a great business in an industry with excellent long-term prospects. In recent weeks, we have been delighted to get to know John and the rest of the board working with them on their mission of continuous improvement and long-term shareholder value creation," Bill Ackman said in a statement. "We look forward to a successful long-term partnership." The three new independent directors will join Air Products' board immediately. As part of the board change, Pershing Square has agreed to vote in favor of an Air Products slate of nominees recommended by the board at the company's 2014 annual meeting. Two of Air Products' new independent directors, Edward Monser and Matthew Paull, will stand for election at the 2014 meeting, while Seifi Ghasemi, will stand for election at the 2015 meeting.

It is going from bad to worse for Bill Ackman

  It is not Bill Ackman's week.


  Another one of the hedge fund titan's big stock holdings is
  taking a hit. 


  Platform Specialty Products fell 9.8% to about $10.40 per share
  after the company said that its CEO, Dan Leever, will retire.


Ackman's Pershing Square Capital owns 42,737,394 shares, or
  a 20.3% stake in the company.


He publicly disclosed the stake 
  on June 29. The share-price close that day was $29.59,
  valuing his position at the time at $1.2 billion. The position
  now is worth about $496.5 million.



The stock is down about 18% this week. Year to date,
  the stock is down more than 55%. The stock is down more than 61%
  since Ackman 
revealed his
  position.



Ackman is an activist investor who's primarily a long-only
  investor, though he's been shorting Herbalife for nearly three
  years. He's known for taking a handful of large positions in
  companies and pushing for changes from management. 


Ackman has suffered huge losses this week on 
  his biggest position, Valeant Pharmaceuticals.


  Here's the press release from Platform: 


  Platform Specialty Products Corporation (NYSE:PAH)
  ("Platform"), a global specialty chemicals company, announced
  today that Daniel H. Leever, Chief Executive Officer of the
  company, has indicated his intention to retire from the company
  once a suitable successor has been hired. Until such appointment,
  the Company's senior management, including Benjamin H. Gliklich,
  Chief Operating Officer, and Sanjiv Khattri, Chief Financial
  Officer, will report to the Office of the Chairman, comprised of
  Martin E. Franklin, Platform's Founder and Chairman, and Mr.
  Leever.


  Martin E. Franklin commented, "Dan has played a pivotal role in
  the creation of Platform and it is a testament to his energy,
  passion and "builder" mentality that Platform's annualized, pro
  forma revenues will have grown five fold from 2013 to 2015,
  including the impending acquisitions of OMG and Alent. With the
  upcoming closing of the Alent transaction, we respect Dan's
  decision that it is the right time for a new generation of
  leadership to continue the vision. Dan has contributed enormously
  to Platform's early success, and the values and performance of
  our first acquisition, the MacDermid business, set a high
  standard for all the other specialty chemical businesses within
  our group. A sign of a great leader is that he helps find a
  successor who can continue the positive momentum in the business
  and Dan is fully engaged in helping identify a new, extremely
  high caliber CEO for Platform."


  Daniel H. Leever added, "It is with very mixed feelings that I
  reached the decision that this is the best time for the business
  and me personally to retire from the responsibilities involved
  with day to day operations. I believe in Martin's vision for
  Platform and am proud that I have been able to contribute to its
  past success and help lay a strong foundation for its continued
  success. While I'll surely miss the day to day interactions with
  the incredible employees who lay the foundation for all of
  Platform's success, I strongly believe that it is the right time
  for a new person to take over the reins of day to day operations
  and to be able to set out a clear execution strategy for the next
  years of consistent, profitable growth."

Fallon, Bloomberg)CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORENEW YORK -- Hedge fund investor Bill Ackman is not giving up on his bet against Herbalife despite major losses to his hedge fund and a report that the criminal probe into the health drink company has collapsed.The head of Pershing Square Capital Management on Tuesday released a new video titled "The American Dream Denied,” featuring people who lost significant amounts of money selling the nutritional shakes. The people also claim they were not been properly warned about the risks involved.USA TODAYHedgie icon Ackman explains his very bad yearAckman has accused the Los Angeles-based company of running an illegal pyramid scheme that makes money by enrolling people into the act of selling its shakes rather than through the sale of the product itself.But his efforts to profit off the allegations by selling the stock short, or betting it will go down, have proven elusive.Herbalife has vehemently denied the allegations and accused Ackman of stock manipulation. Last month, the Wall Street Journal reported that the Department of Justice probe into Herbalife's business practices, as well as allegations of stock manipulation, fizzled due to insufficient evidence of criminal wrongdoing.In Tuesday's video, former Herbalife sales people discussed their losses compared to the promises made to them when they joined the company.One woman said she lost $62,000 despite being told she could make $5,000 a month by recruiters. She also claimed she had not seen a disclosure document saying that the vast majority of people, or 89%, do not make any money selling Herbalife products."Herbalife claims that it has cleaned up its act," the video said. "Herbalife victims from around the country reveal a different story," said the video, which Ackman posted to his web site, Factsaboutherbalife.com.On Tuesday, shares of the Los Angeles-based company traded down slightly to $43.17 a share. Over the last 12 months, however, the stock is up 24% at a time when stocks in other sectors, like energy, financials and even tech, are struggling.Ackman, who made a $1 billion bet on the stock's decline in 2012, shorted the shares at around $47 a share. In order to profit from the stock's decline, he needs it to fall much further given the millions he has spent on legal fees and other expenses that have kept the return on investment down.Ackman came closest to cashing in at the start of 2015 when Herbalife's stock had fallen to around $30 a share.Other outstanding investigations include the Securities and Exchange Commission probes into both Herbalife's business practices and Herbalife's allegations of stock manipulation. The Federal Trade Commission is also investigating Herbalife's business model amid allegations by Ackman that the company is a pyramid scheme.Follow USA TODAY reporter Kaja Whitehouse on Twitter: @kajawhitehouseCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1TaLBhG


Ackman's Pershing Square takes $2.2 billion stake in Air Products | Reuters

The activist investor's Pershing Square Capital Management now owns 9.8 percent of the industrial gas maker, making it the company's biggest shareholder. Pershing Square might have bought even more, but Air Products adopted a "poison pill" defense to prevent a takeover after some on Wall Street began wondering whether the company might be in Ackman's sights. Speculation mounted earlier this month that Ackman, who tends to make only a few concentrated bets at a time, was laying the groundwork for something big when he set out to raise as much as $1 billion to invest in a company that he called strong but lagging its peers and declined to name. Pershing Square began buying Air Products stock in early June and Ackman said in a filing that he believes the company to be "undervalued" and an "attractive investment." In some ways, Air Products may look a little like Canadian Pacific Railway, which the hedge fund also described as a rock solid company that was woefully underperforming. In the 21 months since Ackman took on Canada's second-largest railway with a $1.4 billion investment, he got seven new directors elected to the board, replaced the chief executive and scored one of his biggest investment successes, making some $2 billion in profit in less than two years. "We like Air Products because of its defensive characteristics which are beneficial in times of slower economic growth," said James Sheehan, an analyst at SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. But he also said, "the company does lag on several metrics and this is where an activist investor could really improve things." As word spread on Wall Street that Ackman was trimming his position in Canadian Pacific and readying another big bet, the fund still managed to keep the target's name secret until it had completed buying on Tuesday. It announced the news on Wednesday in a regulatory filing within the 10 calendar day window of owning 5 percent or more in publicly traded company. To build the new bet quickly, Ackman relied on seven holding companies Pershing Square incorporated in Delaware according to the SEC filing. Most of the entities were incorporated in June. Over the years, Ackman has used similar entities to accumulate shares in target companies, such as for the big stake he bought in Fortune Brands in 2010. Air Products, whose rivals include Praxair Inc (PX.N), France's Air Liquide SA (AIRP.PA) and Germany's Linde AG (LING.DE), said in a statement that it has not been in touch with Ackman, but looks forward to engaging with Pershing Square to understand its views. Apparently, the Air Products board realized that Ackman - or someone - was interested in the company, in light of heavy stock buying; it adopted a "poison pill" takeover defense. "The board was paying attention," said Keith Gottfried, a partner at law firm Alston & Bird. "They acted quickly and thoughtfully to protect their shareholders and create a little bit of breathing room." Traditionally, Ackman starts off with politely worded suggestions for change out of the media's glare, but if his past record sheds any light on the future, he can quickly become demanding. Three chief executives - at JC Penney, Canadian Pacific and Procter & Gamble - lost their jobs not long after the hedge fund manager appeared. In order to assemble as much financial firepower as possible, Ackman asked his current investors, including pension funds in Massachusetts, New Jersey and Arkansas and Blackstone Group, to consider sending more money for the unnamed target. He offered a fee cut in exchange for locking up investors' money for three years, suggesting he might need time for his new investment to play out, investors said. Ackman calls himself a long-term, strategic investor who often sticks with a bet for as much as four years. The fact that this bet did not leak underscores how skillful some hedge fund managers have become in placing bets and asking to delay the disclosure process by requesting "confidential treatment" from the SEC, under the argument that disclosure might interfere with a business strategy. Pershing Square has made use of this argument, most recently when it revealing that it had 5.9 million shares of Mondelez International (MDLZ.O). For Ackman, the Air Products disclosure comes at a critical time, as he rides a $1 billion short bet against Herbalife Ltd (HLF.N), which Reuters reported is costing the fund some $300 million in unrealized losses. On Wednesday, as Air Products rising share price helped buoy returns, Ackman was also losing more money on Herbalife amid news that billionaire investor George Soros, a sometime tennis partner of Ackman's, had taken a large long position in the nutrition and supplements company. Billionaire Carl Icahn, a long-time rival, also holds a large long position in Herbalife, which Ackman says is a pyramid scheme. Ailing retailer JC Penney has also weighed on this year's returns, investors have said. With Air Products shares closing at $108.64 Wednesday - up 2.9 percent on the day and up about 16 percent over the last month - Ackman might be able to show his investors gains for the month and boost his year-to-date performance. Other winners in the portfolio include Procter & Gamble (PG.N), Canadian Pacific Railway (CP.TO) and Howard Hughes Corp (HHC.N). What Ackman may like about Air Products is that the company has few rivals, and its industrial gas business has lucrative, long-term contracts. However, in recent months it has been hit by high exposure to sluggish growth in Europe, and analysts say it should divest its non-core gas businesses. Those non-core businesses account for roughly 20 percent of the company's sales, including a chemicals unit and one that caters to computer chip makers.

WASHINGTON — At a Midtown Manhattan steakhouse last June, William A. Ackman, the activist hedge fund manager who had bet a billion dollars on the collapse of the nutritional supplement company Herbalife, offered his latest evidence to a handful of other hedge fund managers about why the company’s stock could soon plummet.Mr. Ackman told his dinner companions that Representative Linda T. Sánchez, Democrat of California, had sent a letter to the Federal Trade Commission the previous day calling for an investigation of the company.The commission had not yet stamped the letter as received, nor had it been made public. But Mr. Ackman, who had personally lobbied Ms. Sánchez and stood to profit if the company’s stock dropped as a result of the call for an inquiry, already knew what it said, and read from a copy of it that he had on his cellphone.When Ms. Sánchez’s office ultimately issued a news release a month later, it was backdated as though it had been made public the day before Mr. Ackman’s dinner talk.


            Letter From Linda Sánchez        








Representative Linda T. Sánchez, Democrat of California, sent a letter to the F.T.C. asking it to investigate Herbalife. Mr. Ackman obtained a copy of the letter before it was made public.





 



The letter was a small hint of Mr. Ackman’s extraordinary attempt to leverage the corridors of power — in Washington, state capitols and city halls — for his hedge fund’s profit after taking a $1 billion financial position called a short, a bet that will pay off only if Herbalife’s stock drops.

Corporate money is forever finding new ways to influence government. But Mr. Ackman’s campaign to take this fight “to the end of the earth,” using every weapon in the arsenal that Washington offers in an attempt to bring ruin to one company, is a novel one, fusing the financial markets with the political system.

Others have criticized the business practices of Herbalife, a company that sells vitamins and other health supplements through independent distributors, many of whom are lower-income Latinos or African-Americans. But Mr. Ackman’s attack is unprecedented in its scale, and Herbalife officials strongly deny his accusations that the company is a pyramid scheme that stays afloat by constantly recruiting new distributors.To pressure state and federal regulators to investigate Herbalife, an act that alone could cause its stock to dive, his team has helped organize protests, news conferences and letter-writing campaigns in California, Nevada, Connecticut, New York and Illinois, although several of the people who signed the letters to state and federal officials say they do not remember sending them, an investigation by The New York Times has found.His team has also paid civil rights organizations at least $130,000 to join his effort by helping him collect the names of people who claimed they were victimized by Herbalife in order to send the leads to regulators, the investigation found. Mr. Ackman’s team also provided the money used by some of these individuals to travel to Washington to participate in a rally against Herbalife last month.

                The Herbalife War            

                A look at the war waged by William A. Ackman against Herbalife, and the few hints of the effort by the company to fight back.            








                    OPEN Document                




Herbalife has mobilized its own army of lobbyists to defend itself against Mr. Ackman’s charges. “These accusations are provably false,” said Herbalife’s chief financial officer, John G. DeSimone. “And they can all be traced back to the same source: hedge fund billionaire Bill Ackman, who is motivated by one thing — getting even richer by winning a billion-dollar bet he made against our company, by any means possible, no matter how unscrupulous.”The feud has touched off a bidding war of sorts, emails obtained by The Times show, as the advocacy groups have in some cases pressed Mr. Ackman’s team and Herbalife to contribute more money in exchange for their allegiance.Mr. Ackman is not new to playing chess on a billionaire’s scale. The brash 47-year-old, a graduate of Harvard Business School, built his $12 billion, New York City-based hedge fund, Pershing Square Capital Management, on enormous, risky bets on companies like Jim Beam and Canadian Pacific Rail that earned billions for him and his clients. He has had some big losses too, including an estimated $473 million last August on an investment in J. C. Penney, the struggling retailer.Regulators frequently get entreaties from financiers urging action for their own financial gain, like the hedge fund executives who in 2010 tried to secretly push Obama administration officials to investigate for-profit colleges, again citing fraudulent industry practices, after betting that their stocks would decline.But Mr. Ackman’s efforts illustrate how Washington is increasingly becoming a battleground of Wall Street’s financial titans, whose interest in influencing public policy is driven primarily by a desire for profit — part of an expanding practice in the nation’s capital, with corporations, law firms and lobbying practices establishing political intelligence units to gather news they can trade on.

So far, Mr. Ackman has persuaded four members of Congress, a New York State senator, a City Council member in Boston, the majority leader of the Nevada Senate and other elected officials in California to join the cause. Prominent consumer advocates in Washington, as well as leaders of well-respected Hispanic and African-American community groups who have been lobbied by Mr. Ackman’s team, have also written regulators demanding action.Mr. Ackman has trumpeted the news conferences and protests to create the image that the walls were closing in on Herbalife, a company no stranger to controversy, whose sales reached a record $4.8 billion last year.He has argued that he is trying to protect Hispanics, who he says are most frequently recruited by Herbalife as distributors, only to find out that there is little money to be made.Yet Mr. Ackman’s staff acknowledges that this crusade is really rooted in one goal: finding a way to undermine public confidence in Herbalife so that his $1 billion bet will produce an equally enormous return. Mr. Ackman has said he will donate any profits he personally earns to charity, calling it “blood money.” The clients who invest in his hedge fund, however, would still benefit enormously.Brent A. Wilkes, the national executive director of the Washington-based League of United Latin American Citizens, or Lulac, rejected any suggestion that he had become Mr. Ackman’s tool — even though his organization accepted a $10,000 contribution early last year, and since then has taken a position at the forefront of the anti-Herbalife campaign.

Instead, Mr. Ackman’s bet is just helping draw attention to longstanding abusive practices by Herbalife, said Mr. Wilkes, who acknowledged that he had never previously focused on the issue.“It’s not the Latino groups that are helping Bill Ackman,” Mr. Wilkes said. “Bill Ackman is helping the Latino groups. He has elevated this battle.” On Sunday evening, after questions from The Times, Mr. Wilkes said he had decided to return the donation, so there was no chance anyone could suspect he had undertaken the effort “for a mere $10,000 table purchase” at one of his fund-raising events.Harvey L. Pitt, a former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, said that Mr. Ackman’s campaign was starting “to look like an effort to move the price rather than spread the truth.”

“If you are trying to spread the truth, that is O.K.,” Mr. Pitt said. “If you are trying to move the price of a stock to vindicate your investment philosophy, that’s not O.K.”Mr. Ackman rejected the assertions that he had done anything wrong.“Our goal here is to shine a spotlight on Herbalife and let the government know all the facts and motivate them to do something,” Mr. Ackman said in an interview on Sunday.So far, Mr. Ackman has little to show for his efforts. Herbalife’s stock has climbed higher, in part because the billionaire investor Carl C. Icahn decided to buy a large stake in the company, and the regulators lobbied by Mr. Ackman have not taken any formal action against the company.That has not deterred Mr. Ackman, who is not known to retreat from a risky investment without a fight, even if it takes years.In February, 14 months after he announced he had wagered big money on the collapse of Herbalife, and with around $500 million in paper losses so far, he announced that instead of backing down, he had made his bet even bigger.If Herbalife “were to disappear tomorrow, we’d make a lot more than had it just blown up the day after I gave my last presentation — although life would be a little easier,” he told an audience of Wall Street investors and media attending an investor conference last month. Pitches to RegulatorsOne of Mr. Ackman’s first stops in his crusade to bring Herbalife down was a meeting at the regional field headquarters of the S.E.C. in Lower Manhattan, where more than 400 enforcement lawyers, accountants, investigators and other staff members work to police some of the nation’s biggest corporate players.He presented investigators in New York with a year’s worth of financial research that he said showed that Herbalife was misleading investors by failing to properly disclose that most of its sales were generated by simply recruiting more distributors, rather than by selling large amounts of its product to consumers.

Mr. Ackman, according to people who were present at the briefing, pointed to internal company records that showed a large share of these distributors, recruited to join the sales teams based on extravagant predictions, quickly gave up.

He made other presentations, to investigators from the F.T.C. and state authorities, because he knew regulatory action would be among the quickest ways to make good on his prediction that the company’s stock was going to crash.“So the risk we took in making this investment was could we get the world to focus on a company, could it get enough of a spotlight so that the S.E.C., the F.T.C., the 50 attorney generals around the country, the equivalent regulators in 87 countries, if any one of them, or at least any powerful member of that group, could we get them interested?” Mr. Ackman explained at the investors conference in February, 14 months after he made his bet on Herbalife public. “And I think that was the biggest risk we took in going short” on Herbalife.Mr. Ackman once made a similar bet against the bond insurer MBIA, one that reaped him and his investors a $1.1 billion return. In a book about his MBIA wager called “Confidence Game,” the reporter-turned-financial analyst Christine S. Richard chronicled how he fought with regulators for seven years before his prediction that MBIA stock would “spiral downward” came true. In a twist, it was Ms. Richard, who left Bloomberg News to work at the Wall Street research shop Indago Group, who gave Mr. Ackman the idea to short Herbalife.After listening to Mr. Ackman’s pitch, S.E.C. investigators moved almost immediately last January to begin an inquiry into Herbalife — which newspapers reported, creating the coverage that Mr. Ackman needed to fuel his strategy.From there, his team worked to create outside pressure, assigning lobbying, public relations and so-called grass-roots advocacy teams to attempt to build support across the country.The team includes lobbying firms run by two former members of Congress: Toby Moffett, a Democrat who once represented Connecticut, and Robert S. Walker, a Republican from Pennsylvania. Mr. Ackman also hired firms run by former top White House aides for President Obama and President Clinton. Jim Papa, who handled legislative affairs for the Obama White House, also joined the effort, with his firm, Global Strategy Group, a longtime consultant to Mr. Ackman.In some cases, the hiring was even more strategic. In Massachusetts, Mr. Ackman’s firm hired the lobbyist Larry Rasky, who was an aide to Senator Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, when Mr. Markey was a member of the House. Another lobbyist, Malcolm Grace, is a former aide to Ms. Sánchez. Both Mr. Markey and Ms. Sánchez would ultimately play critical roles in the effort.

Mr. Ackman also retained the Dewey Square Group, a Washington-based firm that specializes in “grass-roots advocacy,” to influence officials by recruiting surrogates to speak out against Herbalife in emails, tweets, letters or rallies.

He employed Dewey Square to focus on Hispanic and black community leaders and politicians based on a belief that because many of the individuals who are recruited as distributors by Herbalife are minorities, taking on the company might in some way help the Latino community. Separately, the lobbyists and grass-roots organizers set up meetings with major consumer groups. Enlisting Allies A wave of additional letters started to be sent to federal regulators by groups like the Hispanic Federation and the National Consumers League. Each person contacted by The Times acknowledged in interviews that they wrote the letters after being lobbied by representatives from Pershing Square, or said they did not remember writing the letters at all. Mr. Ackman’s team also then started to make payments totaling about $130,000 to some of these groups, including the Hispanic Federation — money he said was being used to help find victims of Herbalife. The pitch by Mr. Ackman peaked in early February, when nearly 30 people affiliated with Latino advocacy and church groups, several of whom had joined the cause after being briefed by consultants hired by Mr. Ackman, flew to Washington to meet with members of Congress and the head of the F.T.C., again pressing for investigators to take action against the company.Three of the nonprofit group leaders who participated in the event, from Massachusetts, Illinois and Washington, said they took part because they also believed that Herbalife was taking advantage of the working class and poor.“At the end of the day, these people are becoming millionaires off the back of the people in the shadows,” said Julie Contreras, the president of the Lulac chapter in Waukegan, Ill., who traveled to Washington for the event, adding that she had not taken any money from Mr. Ackman or anyone on his team.

Mr. Ackman did not publicize his role in helping generate these letters or rallies, or the fact that his consultants in many cases wrote the language that is used in these letters, but his team still issued news releases noting that yet another group had called for an investigation.In Washington, Mr. Ackman’s efforts bore fruit on Jan. 23, when Mr. Markey’s office, which Mr. Ackman had lobbied himself and which had been provided with detailed information about Herbalife by Mr. Ackman’s team, sent letters to the S.E.C. and F.T.C., calling for investigations of the company. A little more than a half-hour after the stock began trading that day its value fell by 14 percent.The letter sent by Ms. Sánchez in June, which Mr. Ackman discussed at the dinner, did not move the stock. Ms. Sánchez’s office acknowledges that it sent a copy of this letter to Mr. Ackman’s team a month before it issued its news release on the matter, and says that it backdated the letter when making it public because The New York Post reported its existence a week after the dinner. The dinner itself was reported in August by The Wall Street Journal.A spokeswoman for Ms. Sánchez said backdating the news release was not inappropriate, as the office considered the document public when it was sent to the F.T.C.

Despite his efforts, Herbalife’s stock over the last 14 months has actually gone up. But Mr. Ackman, at least publicly, has tried to maintain the confidence of his investors, telling them last summer that he was confident he had made “material progress” in his attempts to persuade regulators to crack down on the company — an act that would be certain to hurt its stock price.

“We believe that the probability of timely, aggressive regulatory intervention has increased materially,” he said in the letter. A Lack of VictimsThe Nevada attorney general, Catherine Cortez Masto, was among the many officials who found herself enmeshed in the debate. But as the fight unfolded, with Latino groups holding a news conference in East Las Vegas demanding that she investigate Herbalife, she had some questions.She says she was struck by the appeals for an investigation of Herbalife, at first directly from representatives for Mr. Ackman’s firm and then from others: All three of the letters from nonprofit groups demanding an investigation were identical — except they were signed by three different Hispanic community leaders, each on a different letterhead.When Ms. Masto invited the Hispanic leaders to meet with her individually, none of them could identify a victim of abusive practices.“We are not going to move forward unless we have victims,” she told the community leaders.In Nevada, the Ramirez Group, a political consulting firm run by a former aide to the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, helped line up Hispanic groups and then contacted local reporters to attend a news conference, emails obtained by The New York Times show.The attorney general in Connecticut, George Jepsen, said he had a similar experience. He received five letters with almost identical text. “Herbalife is a complex and abusive pyramid scheme,” the letters each said. “Herbalife unfairly targets minority groups and falsely markets itself as an easy business opportunity.”One came from the mayor of the city of Waterbury, another from a former state legislator that Mr. Ackman had hired as a lobbyist, and a third from Israel Alvarez, a Puerto Rican-born hairstylist in Hartford.

            Five Nearly Identical Letters        







Five Nearly Identical Letters
Five people in Connecticut sent letters with very similar language urging the Federal Trade Commission to open an investigation into Herbalife.





Evelyn C. Mantilla
Ms. Mantilla’s government relations firm was hired by Global Strategy Group, which Mr. Ackman’s firm had retained to discredit Herbalife. Her letter does not mention her connection to Mr. Ackman.





Israel Alvarez
Mr. Alvarez, a hairstylist in Hartford, said he never wrote the letter signed in his name and did not know anybody who had been harmed by Herbalife.





Mary Ann Turner
Ms. Turner declined to say who asked her to send the letter.  “I don't remember anything,” she said. Asked how it could have been identical to others, she said: “It is just something I wrote. I guess we are really smart.”





Neil O’Leary
Mr. O’Leary, the mayor of Waterbury, Conn., does not recall who contacted him about the letter, his chief of staff said.





Liliana Madrid
Could not be reached for comment.











 






In a telephone interview, Mr. Alvarez said he did not recall writing the letter. Asked if he had ever heard of the company named Herbalife, he said it was “a vitamin thing, and food thing.”

None of the letters cited any specific victims of Herbalife’s business practices. In fact, only one person had filled out a formal complaint form with the Connecticut attorney general’s office. State investigators were ultimately unable to substantiate the person’s claim that he lost $1,500 through the company five years ago.The effort reached the West Coast as well. In California, Mr. Ackman’s team sent Minyon Moore, a former senior Clinton White House aide, to host a meeting in October at the landmark West Angeles Church of God in Christ in the city’s predominantly black South Central neighborhood. Ms. Moore detailed what she said were Herbalife’s deceptive sales techniques, participants in the meeting said.

Within a matter of weeks, Mr. Ackman’s consultants had helped organize a demonstration outside an Herbalife conference in Los Angeles and helped persuade nearly two dozen prominent Latin American and black community leaders to send letters to state and federal officials demanding action — letters that are now posted on an anti-Herbalife website that Mr. Ackman’s consultants control.Najee Ali, a longtime activist in Los Angeles who attended the meeting at the church and then wrote one of the letters to California’s attorney general, said he was moved by Ms. Moore’s appeal.“Her remarks were very touching and compelling, and her credibility across black America — it is unquestioned, so I really took to heart her argument,” Mr. Ali said.But he had no idea that Ms. Moore was working on behalf of a hedge fund manager who had made a bet on Herbalife’s stock — and that his letter had become part of a lobbying strategy.“Have I become an instrument in some billionaire’s investment campaign?” he said, adding that he now regrets sending the letter. “I don’t want to be an unwitting pawn, and that is how I am feeling right now.”Pershing Square and its lobbyists argue that many of Herbalife’s victims are afraid to come forward because they are undocumented. “It’s a problem that we haven’t been able to find victims to come out,” said Maria Cardona at Dewey Square, who specializes in appeals to Hispanic Americans.

But Mr. Ackman once again had a solution: Pay nonprofit groups across the United States to find the victims Mr. Ackman knew he needed to compel the regulators to act.So Global Strategy Group, a consulting firm helping Mr. Ackman conduct the campaign, began to make such payments, including about $120,000 to the Hispanic Federation and another $10,000 to Make the Road New York.

Make the Road New York, a nonprofit advocacy group for Latinos, promoted this video showing people who said they were hurt by Herbalife. The video encourages people to report their own complaints about Herbalife to a toll-free number.
Make the Road doesn’t disclose that it received a $10,000 payment from Mr. Ackman’s firm. The toll-free number plays a recording nearly identical to hotlines in California, Illinois and Nevada.

Other leaders of prominent Hispanic nonprofit groups said that a New York-based lobbyist hired by Mr. Ackman, Luis A. Miranda Jr., had also been holding a series of meetings offering payments at the same time that he was asking for their help in the anti-Herbalife campaign. Mr. Miranda denied these allegations, but emails obtained by The Times include discussions of possible support for programs run by groups whose leaders he had just approached for help on the Herbalife campaign.The effort to find Herbalife victims now also includes toll-free numbers set up in at least four states, with recordings in English and Spanish urging people to report wrongdoing by the company.“If you, a loved one or a friend have fallen for Herbalife’s deceptive marketing practices, we need you to share your story,” the recording says. “Every story can make a difference.” A Global PowerhouseHerbalife, according to the company’s official history, was born out of the trunk of a car in 1980, when a 24-year-old California man, Mark R. Hughes, began selling a protein shake that he had concocted, he said, after his mother had died of an accidental overdose of diet pills.

The company has grown into a global powerhouse, with a worldwide team of more than three million so-called members and distributors who operate as independent contractors through a system that rewards many of them not only based on actual sales, but also on their ability to recruit more distributors.The sales tactic, popular with many nutritional supplement companies, has frequently been the target of criticism. In 1986, California authorities issued an order prohibiting Herbalife from making false claims about the weight-loss powers of its nutritional drinks.

But never before has the company met an opponent quite like Mr. Ackman. In fact, company executives acknowledge that they underestimated just how far-reaching his effort would be.Herbalife’s opinion changed on Jan. 23, when Mr. Ackman’s campaign scored its biggest hit yet: a United States senator, Mr. Markey, sent letters to the S.E.C. and the F.T.C., and Herbalife’s stock fell.

            A Senator’s Letter, and a Stock’s Fall        












A Senator’s Letter, and a Stock’s Fall
On Jan. 23, Senator Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts sent letters asking the F.T.C. and S.E.C. to look into Herbalife. The letters were based at least in part on research that William A. Ackman’s firm provided. Herbalife stock fell by 14 percent.






 






Mr. Ackman’s anti-Herbalife website originally posted copies of the letters dated Jan. 22, while Mr. Markey’s office sent them out to the public dated Jan. 23. Mr. Markey’s office attributed this to a clerical mistake and added that Mr. Ackman’s office had merely obtained early versions of their letters from Mr. Markey’s website.Herbalife, after Mr. Ackman announced his bet, had already expanded its own lobbying team, hiring, among others, the Glover Park Group, founded by former top Clinton administration aides, and the Podesta Group, run by Tony Podesta, who is known for his close ties to the Obama White House. With help from this team, last month the company held a private briefing for more than 30 Capitol Hill aides, defending itself against Mr. Ackman’s charges — and the echo chamber they argue he has manufactured.They also retained the law firm Dickstein Shapiro, which has a large practice that specializes in lobbying attorneys general around the United States. Herbalife was so determined to force Mr. Ackman to back down it asked an investment adviser it retains, Moelis & Company, to approach some of the investors in Mr. Ackman’s fund, suggesting that his bet was dangerous and could cost them dearly.To counteract the appeals Mr. Ackman had made to Latino groups, it also decided to significantly boost its spending on donations to such nonprofits, such as a $25,000 payment to the National Puerto Rican Coalition. Its president, Rafael A. Fantauzzi, was among the signers of a letter sent in February from a group that called itself Friends of Herbalife, which defended the company’s business practices.Dueling DonationsIn recent weeks, the back-and-forth donations by the two sides have generated something of a bidding war.For example, a top executive at the United States Hispanic Leadership Institute informed a member of Mr. Ackman’s consulting team in late February that he had already received a $30,000 donation from Herbalife. He then solicited payment of the same amount from Pershing Square in exchange for the group remaining “neutral.”

Continue reading the main story

“Are you able to match the $30K we have received from Herbalife?” Juan Andrade Jr., the president of the Institute, wrote to the consultant. “If Herbalife says neutrality is unacceptable and wants their money back, are you able to replace it?”One of Mr. Ackman’s consultants at Dewey Square suggested in a note to Mr. Ackman’s lawyer that “I think it would be worthwhile to keep them neutral.” But a spokesman for Mr. Ackman said that the company refused to pay Mr. Andrade’s group, arguing that he is paying groups to help find victims, not for their allegiance to his cause.For now Mr. Ackman shows no sign of backing down. In fact, he has just agreed to increase the payments for the victim identification effort.

Mr. Ackman said that even if he decides at some point in the future to shift his investments and financially back out of the fight with Herbalife, he is not going to give up on the campaign.“I am going to personally pursue the Herbalife matter to the end of the earth — meaning I think this company is a criminal operation, I think they are harming people,” Mr. Ackman said. “This is something that angers me. I am going to pursue that.”

 Correction: March 12, 2014  
An article on Monday about an effort by a New York hedge fund executive, William A. Ackman, to push regulators to investigate Herbalife misidentified one of the groups that wrote a letter urging an investigation. It is the National Consumers League — not the Consumer Federation (formally known as the Consumer Federation of America). The article also misstated the position at the Indago Group held by Christine Richard, who did research on Herbalife that helped inspire Mr. Ackman. She worked there, but she did not set up the company. An earlier version of this correction referred incorrectly to the Consumer Federation.  It is formally — not “formerly” — known as the Consumer Federation of America.

William Albert Ackman (born May 11, 1966) is an American investor, hedge fund manager, and philanthropist. He is the founder and CEO of Pershing Square Capital Management, a hedge fund management company. Ackman is considered a contrarian investor[1][2] but he considers himself an activist investor.[3][4] Research published at The University of Oxford characterizes Bill Ackman's activities with Canadian Pacific Railway as paradigmatic of "engaged activism" – which is longer term in nature with correlated benefits to the real economy, as distinct from shorter term "financial activism".[5]
His investing style and investments have had its fair share of critical praise and criticism from U.S. federal and state government officials, heads of other hedge funds, various retail investors, and the general public. Ackman's most notable market plays include shorting MBIA's bonds during the 2008 financial crisis, his proxy battle with Canadian Pacific Railway, as well as his stakes in the Target Corporation, Valeant Pharmaceuticals, and Chipotle Mexican Grill. Since 2012, he has held a US$1 billion short against the nutrition company Herbalife, claiming the company is a pyramid scheme designed as a multi-level marketing firm.[6]

Early life and education[edit]
Ackman was raised in Chappaqua, New York, the son of Ronnie I. (née Posner) and Lawrence David Ackman, the chairman of a New York real estate financing firm, Ackman-Ziff Real Estate Group.[7][8] His family is Jewish.[9][10]
In 1988, he received a bachelor of arts degree magna cum laude in history from Harvard College. His thesis was "Scaling the Ivy Wall: the Jewish and Asian American Experience in Harvard Admissions."[11] In 1992, he received an MBA from Harvard Business School.[12]
Career[edit]
Gotham Partners[edit]
In 1992, Ackman founded the investment firm Gotham Partners with fellow Harvard graduate David P. Berkowitz. This investment firm made small investments in public companies.[7] In 1995, Ackman partnered with the insurance and real estate firm Leucadia National to bid for Rockefeller Center. Although they did not win the deal, the bid caused increased interest in Gotham Partners from investors, which led to $500 million in assets by 1998.[7] By 2002, Gotham Partners had become entrenched in litigation with various outside shareholders who also owned an interest in the same companies in which Gotham invested.[7]
Despite an ongoing probe of his trading by New York State and federal authorities, Ackman began research challenging MBIA's AAA rating. He was charged fees for copying 725,000 pages of statements regarding the financial services company in his law firm's compliance with a subpoena.[13] Ackman called for a division between MBIA's bond insurers' structured finance business and its municipal bond insurance business.[14] He argued that MBIA was legally restricted from trading billions of dollars of credit default swap (CDS) protection MBIA had sold against various mortgage backed CDOs, and was using a second corporation, LaCrosse Financial Products, which MBIA described as an "orphaned transformer". Ackman bought credit default swaps against MBIA corporate debt and sold the swaps for a large profit during the financial crisis of 2008 He reported covering his short position on MBIA on January 16, 2009, according to the 13D filed with the SEC.[15]
In 2003, a feud developed between Ackman and Carl Icahn over a deal involving Hallwood Realty. They agreed to a "schmuck insurance", which said that if Icahn sold the shares within 3 years and made a profit of 10% or more, he and Ackman would split the proceeds. Carl Icahn paid $80 per share. In April 2004, HRPT Property Trust acquired Hallwood, paying $136.16 per share. Under the terms, Icahn owed Ackman investors about $4.5 million, but refused to pay. Ackman sued. Eight years later, the Court forced Icahn to pay $4.5 million, plus 9% interest per year since the date of the sale.[16][17][18]
Pershing Square Capital Management[edit]
In 2004, with $54 million in funding from his personal funds and from his former business partner, Leucadia National, Ackman started Pershing Square Capital Management.[7] In 2005, Pershing bought a significant share in the fast food chain Wendy's International and successfully pressured it to sell its Tim Hortons doughnut chain. Wendy's spun off Tim Hortons through an IPO in 2006 and raised $670 million for Wendy's investors. After Ackman sold his shares at a substantial profit after a dispute over executive succession, the stock price collapsed, raising criticism that the sale of Wendy's fastest-growing unit left the company in a weaker market position. Ackman blamed the poor performance on their new CEO.[7] Pershing Square Holdings amounted to 22.2% in returns since inception (Dec. 2012 – Dec. 2015) under Ackman’s management, 30% below the S&P 500.[19]
In December 2007, his funds owned a 10% stake in Target Corporation, valued at $4.2 billion[20] through the purchase of stock and derivatives.[21] In December 2010, his funds held a 38% stake in Borders Group and on December 6, 2010, Ackman indicated he would finance a buyout of Barnes & Noble for US$900M.[22]
At a panel meeting discussing Bernie Madoff in January 2009, Ackman defended his longtime friend Ezra Merkin, stating, "Has Ezra committed a crime? I don’t think so,” "I think [Merkin] is an honest person, an intelligent person, an interesting person, a smart investor."[23][24][25] In April 2009, Merkin was charged with civil fraud by the State of New York, for "secretly steering $2.4 billion in client money into Bernard Madoff's Ponzi fraud without their permission."[26] A settlement was reached on June 2012 requiring Merkin to pay $405 million to victims including the Metropolitan Council on Jewish Poverty.[27]
Ackman started buying J. C. Penney shares in 2010, paying an average of $22 for 39 million shares or 18 percent of Penney's stock. In August 2013, Ackman's two-year campaign to transform the department store came to an abrupt end after he decided to step down from the board following an argument with fellow board members.[28] In a statement dated August 27, 2013 Pershing Square reported that it had hired Citigroup to liquidate the 39.1 million shares the firm then owned of the Plano, Texas-based department-store chain at a price of $12.90 per share, resulting in a loss of approximately $500 million to Pershing Square.[29] In January 2015, LCH Investments named Ackman as one of the world's top 20 hedge fund managers after Pershing Square delivered $4.5 billion in net gains for investors in 2014, bringing the fund's lifetime gains to $11.6 billion since its launch in 2004 through year-end 2014.[30]
On April 27, 2016, Ackman along with Valeant Pharmaceuticals' outgoing CEO, J. Michael Pearson, and the company's former interim CEO, Howard Schiller, testified before the United States Senate Special Committee on Aging.[31] The testifying panel answered questions related to the Committee's concerns for repercussions to patients and the health care system posed by Valeant's business model and controversial pricing practices.[32] Ackman sold his remaining 27.2 million share position in Valeant to the Investment Bank Jeffries for about $300 million in March 2017. It has been estimated that the total cost of the position, including direct stock purchases and 9.1 million shares that were underlying stock options traded with Nomura Global Financial Products, was $4.6 billion, leading to a loss greater than 100 percent of the original price of the securities.[33][34]
According to Forbes Magazine, Ackman has a net worth of US$1.4 billion as of February 2017.[35]
Herbalife short[edit]
In December 2012, Ackman issued a research report that was critical of Herbalife's multi-level marketing business model, calling it a pyramid scheme.[36] Ackman disclosed that his hedge fund, Pershing Square Capital Management, sold short the company's shares directly (not with derivatives) starting in May 2012, which led Herbalife's stock price to drop. In 2014, Ackman spent $50 million on a public relations campaign against Herbalife, which was designed to negatively impact the company's stock price.[37][38] Ackman pays about $100 million annually to maintain his short position.[39]
Former Rep. Bob Barr (R-GA) has called on Congress to investigate Ackman's use of public relations and regulatory pressure in his short campaign, and Harvey L. Pitt, a former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, questioned whether Ackman's aims to move the price rather than spread the truth.[40][41] In 2014, Senator Ed Markey wrote letters to federal regulators, including the FTC and the SEC, demanding they open an investigation into Herbalife's business practices. The day the letters were released, the company's stock dropped 14 percent. Markey later told the Boston Globe that his staff had not informed him that Ackman stood to benefit financially from the Senator's actions but defended the letters as a matter of consumer rights.[42]
In March 2014, the New York Times reported that Ackman had employed tactics to undermine public confidence in Herbalife to lower its stock price, including pressuring state and federal regulators to investigate the company, paying individuals to travel to and participate in rallies against the company and boosting its spending on donations to non-profit Latino organizations. According to the article, numerous letters were sent to federal regulators by groups such as the Hispanic Federation and the National Consumers League. "Each person contacted by The Times acknowledged in interviews that they wrote the letters after being lobbied by representatives from Pershing Square, or said they did not remember writing the letters at all. Mr. Ackman's team also then started to make payments totaling about $130,000 to some of these groups, including the Hispanic Federation — money he said was being used to help find victims of Herbalife."[43]
On March 12, 2015, The Wall Street Journal reported that prosecutors in the Manhattan U.S. attorney's office and the FBI were investigating whether people hired by Ackman "made false statements about Herbalife's business model to regulators and others in order to spur investigations into the company and lower its stock price."[44][45] In March 2015, U.S. District Judge Dale Fischer, in Los Angeles, California, dismissed a suit filed by Herbalife investors alleging the company is operating an illegal pyramid scheme. In response to Fischer's ruling, Herbalife stock surged approximately 13 percent.[46] Herbalife and the FTC reached a settlement agreement in July 2016, ending the agency's investigation into the company. On the day of the settlement, Fortune estimated that Ackman lost $500 million.[47]
Ackman's position on Herbalife led to a discussion on live television with Herbalife supporter Carl Icahn for nearly half an hour on CNBC on January 25, 2013.[48][49][50] During the segment, Icahn called Ackman "a crybaby in the schoolyard" and claimed that going public with his short position would eventually force Ackman into the "mother of all short squeezes." On November 22, 2013, he admitted on Bloomberg Television that Pershing Square's open short position in Herbalife was "$400 million to $500 million" in the red, but that he wouldn't be squeezed out and would hold the short "to the end of the earth".[51]
Political and economic views[edit]
He endorsed Michael Bloomberg as a prospective candidate for President of the United States in the 2016 presidential election.[52] After Donald Trump became president Ackman told Andrew Ross Sorkin of The New York Times that he was "bullish" on Trump's presidency.[53]
Philanthropy[edit]
Ackman has given to charitable causes such as the Center for Jewish History to preserve Jewish genealogy[54] where he spearheaded a successful effort to retire their $30 million in debt, personally contributing $6.8 million.[55][56] This donation made with that of Bruce Berkowitz, founder of Fairholme Capital Management, and Joseph Steinberg, president of Leucadia National, were the three largest individual gifts that the center has ever received.[57]
Ackman's foundation donated $1.1 million to the Innocence Project in New York City and Centurion Ministries in Princeton, N.J.[55] He is a signatory of The Giving Pledge, committing himself to give away at least 50% of his wealth to charitable causes.[58]
In 2006, Ackman co-founded The Pershing Square Foundation, alongside his wife at the time Karen, to support innovation in the areas of economic development, education, healthcare, human rights, arts and urban development.[59] Since it was founded, the foundation has committed more than $400 million in grants and social investments. In 2011, the Ackmans were among The Chronicle of Philanthropy’s "Philanthropy 50" list of the most generous donors.[60]
In July 2014, Challenged Athletes Foundation, which provides sports equipment to those with physical disabilities, honored Ackman at a gala fundraiser at the Waldorf Astoria hotel in New York City for helping raise a record $2.3 million.[61]
Personal life[edit]
He married Karen Ann Herskovitz, a graduate of Harvard University and a landscape architect, on July 10, 1994.[62] She is on the board of directors of Human Rights Watch[63] and on the board of Friends of the High Line.[55][64] They have three children.[7] On December 22, 2016 it was reported that the couple had separated.[65][66]

He is the founder and CEO of Pershing Square Capital Management, a hedge fund management company. Ackman is considered a contrarian investor[1][2] but he considers himself an activist investor.[3][4] Research published at The University of Oxford characterizes Bill Ackman's activities with Canadian Pacific Railway as paradigmatic of "engaged activism" – which is longer term in nature with correlated benefits to the real economy, as distinct from shorter term "financial activism".[5]
His investing style and investments have had its fair share of critical praise and criticism from U.S. federal and state government officials, heads of other hedge funds, various retail investors, and the general public. Ackman's most notable market plays include shorting MBIA's bonds during the 2008 financial crisis, his proxy battle with Canadian Pacific Railway, as well as his stakes in the Target Corporation, Valeant Pharmaceuticals, and Chipotle Mexican Grill. Since 2012, he has held a US$1 billion short against the nutrition company Herbalife, claiming the company is a pyramid scheme designed as a multi-level marketing firm.[6]

Early life and education[edit]
Ackman was raised in Chappaqua, New York, the son of Ronnie I. (née Posner) and Lawrence David Ackman, the chairman of a New York real estate financing firm, Ackman-Ziff Real Estate Group.[7][8] His family is Jewish.[9][10]
In 1988, he received a bachelor of arts degree magna cum laude in history from Harvard College. His thesis was "Scaling the Ivy Wall: the Jewish and Asian American Experience in Harvard Admissions."[11] In 1992, he received an MBA from Harvard Business School.[12]
Career[edit]
Gotham Partners[edit]
In 1992, Ackman founded the investment firm Gotham Partners with fellow Harvard graduate David P. Berkowitz. This investment firm made small investments in public companies.[7] In 1995, Ackman partnered with the insurance and real estate firm Leucadia National to bid for Rockefeller Center. Although they did not win the deal, the bid caused increased interest in Gotham Partners from investors, which led to $500 million in assets by 1998.[7] By 2002, Gotham Partners had become entrenched in litigation with various outside shareholders who also owned an interest in the same companies in which Gotham invested.[7]
Despite an ongoing probe of his trading by New York State and federal authorities, Ackman began research challenging MBIA's AAA rating. He was charged fees for copying 725,000 pages of statements regarding the financial services company in his law firm's compliance with a subpoena.[13] Ackman called for a division between MBIA's bond insurers' structured finance business and its municipal bond insurance business.[14] He argued that MBIA was legally restricted from trading billions of dollars of credit default swap (CDS) protection MBIA had sold against various mortgage backed CDOs, and was using a second corporation, LaCrosse Financial Products, which MBIA described as an "orphaned transformer". Ackman bought credit default swaps against MBIA corporate debt and sold the swaps for a large profit during the financial crisis of 2008 He reported covering his short position on MBIA on January 16, 2009, according to the 13D filed with the SEC.[15]
In 2003, a feud developed between Ackman and Carl Icahn over a deal involving Hallwood Realty. They agreed to a "schmuck insurance", which said that if Icahn sold the shares within 3 years and made a profit of 10% or more, he and Ackman would split the proceeds. Carl Icahn paid $80 per share. In April 2004, HRPT Property Trust acquired Hallwood, paying $136.16 per share. Under the terms, Icahn owed Ackman investors about $4.5 million, but refused to pay. Ackman sued. Eight years later, the Court forced Icahn to pay $4.5 million, plus 9% interest per year since the date of the sale.[16][17][18]
Pershing Square Capital Management[edit]
In 2004, with $54 million in funding from his personal funds and from his former business partner, Leucadia National, Ackman started Pershing Square Capital Management.[7] In 2005, Pershing bought a significant share in the fast food chain Wendy's International and successfully pressured it to sell its Tim Hortons doughnut chain. Wendy's spun off Tim Hortons through an IPO in 2006 and raised $670 million for Wendy's investors. After Ackman sold his shares at a substantial profit after a dispute over executive succession, the stock price collapsed, raising criticism that the sale of Wendy's fastest-growing unit left the company in a weaker market position. Ackman blamed the poor performance on their new CEO.[7] Pershing Square Holdings amounted to 22.2% in returns since inception (Dec. 2012 – Dec. 2015) under Ackman’s management, 30% below the S&P 500.[19]
In December 2007, his funds owned a 10% stake in Target Corporation, valued at $4.2 billion[20] through the purchase of stock and derivatives.[21] In December 2010, his funds held a 38% stake in Borders Group and on December 6, 2010, Ackman indicated he would finance a buyout of Barnes & Noble for US$900M.[22]
At a panel meeting discussing Bernie Madoff in January 2009, Ackman defended his longtime friend Ezra Merkin, stating, "Has Ezra committed a crime? I don’t think so,” "I think [Merkin] is an honest person, an intelligent person, an interesting person, a smart investor."[23][24][25] In April 2009, Merkin was charged with civil fraud by the State of New York, for "secretly steering $2.4 billion in client money into Bernard Madoff's Ponzi fraud without their permission."[26] A settlement was reached on June 2012 requiring Merkin to pay $405 million to victims including the Metropolitan Council on Jewish Poverty.[27]
Ackman started buying J. C. Penney shares in 2010, paying an average of $22 for 39 million shares or 18 percent of Penney's stock. In August 2013, Ackman's two-year campaign to transform the department store came to an abrupt end after he decided to step down from the board following an argument with fellow board members.[28] In a statement dated August 27, 2013 Pershing Square reported that it had hired Citigroup to liquidate the 39.1 million shares the firm then owned of the Plano, Texas-based department-store chain at a price of $12.90 per share, resulting in a loss of approximately $500 million to Pershing Square.[29] In January 2015, LCH Investments named Ackman as one of the world's top 20 hedge fund managers after Pershing Square delivered $4.5 billion in net gains for investors in 2014, bringing the fund's lifetime gains to $11.6 billion since its launch in 2004 through year-end 2014.[30]
On April 27, 2016, Ackman along with Valeant Pharmaceuticals' outgoing CEO, J. Michael Pearson, and the company's former interim CEO, Howard Schiller, testified before the United States Senate Special Committee on Aging.[31] The testifying panel answered questions related to the Committee's concerns for repercussions to patients and the health care system posed by Valeant's business model and controversial pricing practices.[32] Ackman sold his remaining 27.2 million share position in Valeant to the Investment Bank Jeffries for about $300 million in March 2017. It has been estimated that the total cost of the position, including direct stock purchases and 9.1 million shares that were underlying stock options traded with Nomura Global Financial Products, was $4.6 billion, leading to a loss greater than 100 percent of the original price of the securities.[33][34]
According to Forbes Magazine, Ackman has a net worth of US$1.4 billion as of February 2017.[35]
Herbalife short[edit]
In December 2012, Ackman issued a research report that was critical of Herbalife's multi-level marketing business model, calling it a pyramid scheme.[36] Ackman disclosed that his hedge fund, Pershing Square Capital Management, sold short the company's shares directly (not with derivatives) starting in May 2012, which led Herbalife's stock price to drop. In 2014, Ackman spent $50 million on a public relations campaign against Herbalife, which was designed to negatively impact the company's stock price.[37][38] Ackman pays about $100 million annually to maintain his short position.[39]
Former Rep. Bob Barr (R-GA) has called on Congress to investigate Ackman's use of public relations and regulatory pressure in his short campaign, and Harvey L. Pitt, a former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, questioned whether Ackman's aims to move the price rather than spread the truth.[40][41] In 2014, Senator Ed Markey wrote letters to federal regulators, including the FTC and the SEC, demanding they open an investigation into Herbalife's business practices. The day the letters were released, the company's stock dropped 14 percent. Markey later told the Boston Globe that his staff had not informed him that Ackman stood to benefit financially from the Senator's actions but defended the letters as a matter of consumer rights.[42]
In March 2014, the New York Times reported that Ackman had employed tactics to undermine public confidence in Herbalife to lower its stock price, including pressuring state and federal regulators to investigate the company, paying individuals to travel to and participate in rallies against the company and boosting its spending on donations to non-profit Latino organizations. According to the article, numerous letters were sent to federal regulators by groups such as the Hispanic Federation and the National Consumers League. "Each person contacted by The Times acknowledged in interviews that they wrote the letters after being lobbied by representatives from Pershing Square, or said they did not remember writing the letters at all. Mr. Ackman's team also then started to make payments totaling about $130,000 to some of these groups, including the Hispanic Federation — money he said was being used to help find victims of Herbalife."[43]
On March 12, 2015, The Wall Street Journal reported that prosecutors in the Manhattan U.S. attorney's office and the FBI were investigating whether people hired by Ackman "made false statements about Herbalife's business model to regulators and others in order to spur investigations into the company and lower its stock price."[44][45] In March 2015, U.S. District Judge Dale Fischer, in Los Angeles, California, dismissed a suit filed by Herbalife investors alleging the company is operating an illegal pyramid scheme. In response to Fischer's ruling, Herbalife stock surged approximately 13 percent.[46] Herbalife and the FTC reached a settlement agreement in July 2016, ending the agency's investigation into the company. On the day of the settlement, Fortune estimated that Ackman lost $500 million.[47]
Ackman's position on Herbalife led to a discussion on live television with Herbalife supporter Carl Icahn for nearly half an hour on CNBC on January 25, 2013.[48][49][50] During the segment, Icahn called Ackman "a crybaby in the schoolyard" and claimed that going public with his short position would eventually force Ackman into the "mother of all short squeezes." On November 22, 2013, he admitted on Bloomberg Television that Pershing Square's open short position in Herbalife was "$400 million to $500 million" in the red, but that he wouldn't be squeezed out and would hold the short "to the end of the earth".[51]
Political and economic views[edit]
He endorsed Michael Bloomberg as a prospective candidate for President of the United States in the 2016 presidential election.[52] After Donald Trump became president Ackman told Andrew Ross Sorkin of The New York Times that he was "bullish" on Trump's presidency.[53]
Philanthropy[edit]
Ackman has given to charitable causes such as the Center for Jewish History to preserve Jewish genealogy[54] where he spearheaded a successful effort to retire their $30 million in debt, personally contributing $6.8 million.[55][56] This donation made with that of Bruce Berkowitz, founder of Fairholme Capital Management, and Joseph Steinberg, president of Leucadia National, were the three largest individual gifts that the center has ever received.[57]
Ackman's foundation donated $1.1 million to the Innocence Project in New York City and Centurion Ministries in Princeton, N.J.[55] He is a signatory of The Giving Pledge, committing himself to give away at least 50% of his wealth to charitable causes.[58]
In 2006, Ackman co-founded The Pershing Square Foundation, alongside his wife at the time Karen, to support innovation in the areas of economic development, education, healthcare, human rights, arts and urban development.[59] Since it was founded, the foundation has committed more than $400 million in grants and social investments. In 2011, the Ackmans were among The Chronicle of Philanthropy’s "Philanthropy 50" list of the most generous donors.[60]
In July 2014, Challenged Athletes Foundation, which provides sports equipment to those with physical disabilities, honored Ackman at a gala fundraiser at the Waldorf Astoria hotel in New York City for helping raise a record $2.3 million.[61]
Personal life[edit]
He married Karen Ann Herskovitz, a graduate of Harvard University and a landscape architect, on July 10, 1994.[62] She is on the board of directors of Human Rights Watch[63] and on the board of Friends of the High Line.[55][64] They have three children.[7] On December 22, 2016 it was reported that the couple had separated.[65][66]

William Albert Ackman (born May 11, 1966) is an American investor, hedge fund manager, and philanthropist. He is the founder and CEO of Pershing Square Capital Management, a hedge fund management company. Ackman is considered a contrarian investor[1][2] but he considers himself an activist investor.[3][4] Research published at The University of Oxford characterizes Bill Ackman's activities with Canadian Pacific Railway as paradigmatic of "engaged activism" – which is longer term in nature with correlated benefits to the real economy, as distinct from shorter term "financial activism".[5]
His investing style and investments have had its fair share of critical praise and criticism from U.S. federal and state government officials, heads of other hedge funds, various retail investors, and the general public. Ackman's most notable market plays include shorting MBIA's bonds during the 2008 financial crisis, his proxy battle with Canadian Pacific Railway, as well as his stakes in the Target Corporation, Valeant Pharmaceuticals, and Chipotle Mexican Grill. Since 2012, he has held a US$1 billion short against the nutrition company Herbalife, claiming the company is a pyramid scheme designed as a multi-level marketing firm.[6]

Early life and education[edit]
Ackman was raised in Chappaqua, New York, the son of Ronnie I. (née Posner) and Lawrence David Ackman, the chairman of a New York real estate financing firm, Ackman-Ziff Real Estate Group.[7][8] His family is Jewish.[9][10]
In 1988, he received a bachelor of arts degree magna cum laude in history from Harvard College. His thesis was "Scaling the Ivy Wall: the Jewish and Asian American Experience in Harvard Admissions."[11] In 1992, he received an MBA from Harvard Business School.[12]
Career[edit]
Gotham Partners[edit]
In 1992, Ackman founded the investment firm Gotham Partners with fellow Harvard graduate David P. Berkowitz. This investment firm made small investments in public companies.[7] In 1995, Ackman partnered with the insurance and real estate firm Leucadia National to bid for Rockefeller Center. Although they did not win the deal, the bid caused increased interest in Gotham Partners from investors, which led to $500 million in assets by 1998.[7] By 2002, Gotham Partners had become entrenched in litigation with various outside shareholders who also owned an interest in the same companies in which Gotham invested.[7]
Despite an ongoing probe of his trading by New York State and federal authorities, Ackman began research challenging MBIA's AAA rating. He was charged fees for copying 725,000 pages of statements regarding the financial services company in his law firm's compliance with a subpoena.[13] Ackman called for a division between MBIA's bond insurers' structured finance business and its municipal bond insurance business.[14] He argued that MBIA was legally restricted from trading billions of dollars of credit default swap (CDS) protection MBIA had sold against various mortgage backed CDOs, and was using a second corporation, LaCrosse Financial Products, which MBIA described as an "orphaned transformer". Ackman bought credit default swaps against MBIA corporate debt and sold the swaps for a large profit during the financial crisis of 2008 He reported covering his short position on MBIA on January 16, 2009, according to the 13D filed with the SEC.[15]
In 2003, a feud developed between Ackman and Carl Icahn over a deal involving Hallwood Realty. They agreed to a "schmuck insurance", which said that if Icahn sold the shares within 3 years and made a profit of 10% or more, he and Ackman would split the proceeds. Carl Icahn paid $80 per share. In April 2004, HRPT Property Trust acquired Hallwood, paying $136.16 per share. Under the terms, Icahn owed Ackman investors about $4.5 million, but refused to pay. Ackman sued. Eight years later, the Court forced Icahn to pay $4.5 million, plus 9% interest per year since the date of the sale.[16][17][18]
Pershing Square Capital Management[edit]
In 2004, with $54 million in funding from his personal funds and from his former business partner, Leucadia National, Ackman started Pershing Square Capital Management.[7] In 2005, Pershing bought a significant share in the fast food chain Wendy's International and successfully pressured it to sell its Tim Hortons doughnut chain. Wendy's spun off Tim Hortons through an IPO in 2006 and raised $670 million for Wendy's investors. After Ackman sold his shares at a substantial profit after a dispute over executive succession, the stock price collapsed, raising criticism that the sale of Wendy's fastest-growing unit left the company in a weaker market position. Ackman blamed the poor performance on their new CEO.[7] Pershing Square Holdings amounted to 22.2% in returns since inception (Dec. 2012 – Dec. 2015) under Ackman’s management, 30% below the S&P 500.[19]
In December 2007, his funds owned a 10% stake in Target Corporation, valued at $4.2 billion[20] through the purchase of stock and derivatives.[21] In December 2010, his funds held a 38% stake in Borders Group and on December 6, 2010, Ackman indicated he would finance a buyout of Barnes & Noble for US$900M.[22]
At a panel meeting discussing Bernie Madoff in January 2009, Ackman defended his longtime friend Ezra Merkin, stating, "Has Ezra committed a crime? I don’t think so,” "I think [Merkin] is an honest person, an intelligent person, an interesting person, a smart investor."[23][24][25] In April 2009, Merkin was charged with civil fraud by the State of New York, for "secretly steering $2.4 billion in client money into Bernard Madoff's Ponzi fraud without their permission."[26] A settlement was reached on June 2012 requiring Merkin to pay $405 million to victims including the Metropolitan Council on Jewish Poverty.[27]
Ackman started buying J. C. Penney shares in 2010, paying an average of $22 for 39 million shares or 18 percent of Penney's stock. In August 2013, Ackman's two-year campaign to transform the department store came to an abrupt end after he decided to step down from the board following an argument with fellow board members.[28] In a statement dated August 27, 2013 Pershing Square reported that it had hired Citigroup to liquidate the 39.1 million shares the firm then owned of the Plano, Texas-based department-store chain at a price of $12.90 per share, resulting in a loss of approximately $500 million to Pershing Square.[29] In January 2015, LCH Investments named Ackman as one of the world's top 20 hedge fund managers after Pershing Square delivered $4.5 billion in net gains for investors in 2014, bringing the fund's lifetime gains to $11.6 billion since its launch in 2004 through year-end 2014.[30]
On April 27, 2016, Ackman along with Valeant Pharmaceuticals' outgoing CEO, J. Michael Pearson, and the company's former interim CEO, Howard Schiller, testified before the United States Senate Special Committee on Aging.[31] The testifying panel answered questions related to the Committee's concerns for repercussions to patients and the health care system posed by Valeant's business model and controversial pricing practices.[32] Ackman sold his remaining 27.2 million share position in Valeant to the Investment Bank Jeffries for about $300 million in March 2017. It has been estimated that the total cost of the position, including direct stock purchases and 9.1 million shares that were underlying stock options traded with Nomura Global Financial Products, was $4.6 billion, leading to a loss greater than 100 percent of the original price of the securities.[33][34]
According to Forbes Magazine, Ackman has a net worth of US$1.4 billion as of February 2017.[35]
Herbalife short[edit]
In December 2012, Ackman issued a research report that was critical of Herbalife's multi-level marketing business model, calling it a pyramid scheme.[36] Ackman disclosed that his hedge fund, Pershing Square Capital Management, sold short the company's shares directly (not with derivatives) starting in May 2012, which led Herbalife's stock price to drop. In 2014, Ackman spent $50 million on a public relations campaign against Herbalife, which was designed to negatively impact the company's stock price.[37][38] Ackman pays about $100 million annually to maintain his short position.[39]
Former Rep. Bob Barr (R-GA) has called on Congress to investigate Ackman's use of public relations and regulatory pressure in his short campaign, and Harvey L. Pitt, a former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, questioned whether Ackman's aims to move the price rather than spread the truth.[40][41] In 2014, Senator Ed Markey wrote letters to federal regulators, including the FTC and the SEC, demanding they open an investigation into Herbalife's business practices. The day the letters were released, the company's stock dropped 14 percent. Markey later told the Boston Globe that his staff had not informed him that Ackman stood to benefit financially from the Senator's actions but defended the letters as a matter of consumer rights.[42]
In March 2014, the New York Times reported that Ackman had employed tactics to undermine public confidence in Herbalife to lower its stock price, including pressuring state and federal regulators to investigate the company, paying individuals to travel to and participate in rallies against the company and boosting its spending on donations to non-profit Latino organizations. According to the article, numerous letters were sent to federal regulators by groups such as the Hispanic Federation and the National Consumers League. "Each person contacted by The Times acknowledged in interviews that they wrote the letters after being lobbied by representatives from Pershing Square, or said they did not remember writing the letters at all. Mr. Ackman's team also then started to make payments totaling about $130,000 to some of these groups, including the Hispanic Federation — money he said was being used to help find victims of Herbalife."[43]
On March 12, 2015, The Wall Street Journal reported that prosecutors in the Manhattan U.S. attorney's office and the FBI were investigating whether people hired by Ackman "made false statements about Herbalife's business model to regulators and others in order to spur investigations into the company and lower its stock price."[44][45] In March 2015, U.S. District Judge Dale Fischer, in Los Angeles, California, dismissed a suit filed by Herbalife investors alleging the company is operating an illegal pyramid scheme. In response to Fischer's ruling, Herbalife stock surged approximately 13 percent.[46] Herbalife and the FTC reached a settlement agreement in July 2016, ending the agency's investigation into the company. On the day of the settlement, Fortune estimated that Ackman lost $500 million.[47]
Ackman's position on Herbalife led to a discussion on live television with Herbalife supporter Carl Icahn for nearly half an hour on CNBC on January 25, 2013.[48][49][50] During the segment, Icahn called Ackman "a crybaby in the schoolyard" and claimed that going public with his short position would eventually force Ackman into the "mother of all short squeezes." On November 22, 2013, he admitted on Bloomberg Television that Pershing Square's open short position in Herbalife was "$400 million to $500 million" in the red, but that he wouldn't be squeezed out and would hold the short "to the end of the earth".[51]
Political and economic views[edit]
He endorsed Michael Bloomberg as a prospective candidate for President of the United States in the 2016 presidential election.[52] After Donald Trump became president Ackman told Andrew Ross Sorkin of The New York Times that he was "bullish" on Trump's presidency.[53]
Philanthropy[edit]
Ackman has given to charitable causes such as the Center for Jewish History to preserve Jewish genealogy[54] where he spearheaded a successful effort to retire their $30 million in debt, personally contributing $6.8 million.[55][56] This donation made with that of Bruce Berkowitz, founder of Fairholme Capital Management, and Joseph Steinberg, president of Leucadia National, were the three largest individual gifts that the center has ever received.[57]
Ackman's foundation donated $1.1 million to the Innocence Project in New York City and Centurion Ministries in Princeton, N.J.[55] He is a signatory of The Giving Pledge, committing himself to give away at least 50% of his wealth to charitable causes.[58]
In 2006, Ackman co-founded The Pershing Square Foundation, alongside his wife at the time Karen, to support innovation in the areas of economic development, education, healthcare, human rights, arts and urban development.[59] Since it was founded, the foundation has committed more than $400 million in grants and social investments. In 2011, the Ackmans were among The Chronicle of Philanthropy’s "Philanthropy 50" list of the most generous donors.[60]
In July 2014, Challenged Athletes Foundation, which provides sports equipment to those with physical disabilities, honored Ackman at a gala fundraiser at the Waldorf Astoria hotel in New York City for helping raise a record $2.3 million.[61]
Personal life[edit]
He married Karen Ann Herskovitz, a graduate of Harvard University and a landscape architect, on July 10, 1994.[62] She is on the board of directors of Human Rights Watch[63] and on the board of Friends of the High Line.[55][64] They have three children.[7] On December 22, 2016 it was reported that the couple had separated.[65][66]

William Albert Ackman (born May 11, 1966) is an American investor, hedge fund manager, and philanthropist. He is the founder and CEO of Pershing Square Capital Management, a hedge fund management company. Ackman is considered a contrarian investor[1][2] but he considers himself an activist investor.[3][4] Research published at The University of Oxford characterizes Bill Ackman's activities with Canadian Pacific Railway as paradigmatic of "engaged activism" – which is longer term in nature with correlated benefits to the real economy, as distinct from shorter term "financial activism".[5]
His investing style and investments have had its fair share of critical praise and criticism from U.S. federal and state government officials, heads of other hedge funds, various retail investors, and the general public. Ackman's most notable market plays include shorting MBIA's bonds during the 2008 financial crisis, his proxy battle with Canadian Pacific Railway, as well as his stakes in the Target Corporation, Valeant Pharmaceuticals, and Chipotle Mexican Grill. Since 2012, he has held a US$1 billion short against the nutrition company Herbalife, claiming the company is a pyramid scheme designed as a multi-level marketing firm.[6]

Early life and education[edit]
Ackman was raised in Chappaqua, New York, the son of Ronnie I. (née Posner) and Lawrence David Ackman, the chairman of a New York real estate financing firm, Ackman-Ziff Real Estate Group.[7][8] His family is Jewish.[9][10]
In 1988, he received a bachelor of arts degree magna cum laude in history from Harvard College. His thesis was "Scaling the Ivy Wall: the Jewish and Asian American Experience in Harvard Admissions."[11] In 1992, he received an MBA from Harvard Business School.[12]
Career[edit]
Gotham Partners[edit]
In 1992, Ackman founded the investment firm Gotham Partners with fellow Harvard graduate David P. Berkowitz. This investment firm made small investments in public companies.[7] In 1995, Ackman partnered with the insurance and real estate firm Leucadia National to bid for Rockefeller Center. Although they did not win the deal, the bid caused increased interest in Gotham Partners from investors, which led to $500 million in assets by 1998.[7] By 2002, Gotham Partners had become entrenched in litigation with various outside shareholders who also owned an interest in the same companies in which Gotham invested.[7]
Despite an ongoing probe of his trading by New York State and federal authorities, Ackman began research challenging MBIA's AAA rating. He was charged fees for copying 725,000 pages of statements regarding the financial services company in his law firm's compliance with a subpoena.[13] Ackman called for a division between MBIA's bond insurers' structured finance business and its municipal bond insurance business.[14] He argued that MBIA was legally restricted from trading billions of dollars of credit default swap (CDS) protection MBIA had sold against various mortgage backed CDOs, and was using a second corporation, LaCrosse Financial Products, which MBIA described as an "orphaned transformer". Ackman bought credit default swaps against MBIA corporate debt and sold the swaps for a large profit during the financial crisis of 2008 He reported covering his short position on MBIA on January 16, 2009, according to the 13D filed with the SEC.[15]
In 2003, a feud developed between Ackman and Carl Icahn over a deal involving Hallwood Realty. They agreed to a "schmuck insurance", which said that if Icahn sold the shares within 3 years and made a profit of 10% or more, he and Ackman would split the proceeds. Carl Icahn paid $80 per share. In April 2004, HRPT Property Trust acquired Hallwood, paying $136.16 per share. Under the terms, Icahn owed Ackman investors about $4.5 million, but refused to pay. Ackman sued. Eight years later, the Court forced Icahn to pay $4.5 million, plus 9% interest per year since the date of the sale.[16][17][18]
Pershing Square Capital Management[edit]
In 2004, with $54 million in funding from his personal funds and from his former business partner, Leucadia National, Ackman started Pershing Square Capital Management.[7] In 2005, Pershing bought a significant share in the fast food chain Wendy's International and successfully pressured it to sell its Tim Hortons doughnut chain. Wendy's spun off Tim Hortons through an IPO in 2006 and raised $670 million for Wendy's investors. After Ackman sold his shares at a substantial profit after a dispute over executive succession, the stock price collapsed, raising criticism that the sale of Wendy's fastest-growing unit left the company in a weaker market position. Ackman blamed the poor performance on their new CEO.[7] Pershing Square Holdings amounted to 22.2% in returns since inception (Dec. 2012 – Dec. 2015) under Ackman’s management, 30% below the S&P 500.[19]
In December 2007, his funds owned a 10% stake in Target Corporation, valued at $4.2 billion[20] through the purchase of stock and derivatives.[21] In December 2010, his funds held a 38% stake in Borders Group and on December 6, 2010, Ackman indicated he would finance a buyout of Barnes & Noble for US$900M.[22]
At a panel meeting discussing Bernie Madoff in January 2009, Ackman defended his longtime friend Ezra Merkin, stating, "Has Ezra committed a crime? I don’t think so,” "I think [Merkin] is an honest person, an intelligent person, an interesting person, a smart investor."[23][24][25] In April 2009, Merkin was charged with civil fraud by the State of New York, for "secretly steering $2.4 billion in client money into Bernard Madoff's Ponzi fraud without their permission."[26] A settlement was reached on June 2012 requiring Merkin to pay $405 million to victims including the Metropolitan Council on Jewish Poverty.[27]
Ackman started buying J. C. Penney shares in 2010, paying an average of $22 for 39 million shares or 18 percent of Penney's stock. In August 2013, Ackman's two-year campaign to transform the department store came to an abrupt end after he decided to step down from the board following an argument with fellow board members.[28] In a statement dated August 27, 2013 Pershing Square reported that it had hired Citigroup to liquidate the 39.1 million shares the firm then owned of the Plano, Texas-based department-store chain at a price of $12.90 per share, resulting in a loss of approximately $500 million to Pershing Square.[29] In January 2015, LCH Investments named Ackman as one of the world's top 20 hedge fund managers after Pershing Square delivered $4.5 billion in net gains for investors in 2014, bringing the fund's lifetime gains to $11.6 billion since its launch in 2004 through year-end 2014.[30]
On April 27, 2016, Ackman along with Valeant Pharmaceuticals' outgoing CEO, J. Michael Pearson, and the company's former interim CEO, Howard Schiller, testified before the United States Senate Special Committee on Aging.[31] The testifying panel answered questions related to the Committee's concerns for repercussions to patients and the health care system posed by Valeant's business model and controversial pricing practices.[32] Ackman sold his remaining 27.2 million share position in Valeant to the Investment Bank Jeffries for about $300 million in March 2017. It has been estimated that the total cost of the position, including direct stock purchases and 9.1 million shares that were underlying stock options traded with Nomura Global Financial Products, was $4.6 billion, leading to a loss greater than 100 percent of the original price of the securities.[33][34]
According to Forbes Magazine, Ackman has a net worth of US$1.4 billion as of February 2017.[35]
Herbalife short[edit]
In December 2012, Ackman issued a research report that was critical of Herbalife's multi-level marketing business model, calling it a pyramid scheme.[36] Ackman disclosed that his hedge fund, Pershing Square Capital Management, sold short the company's shares directly (not with derivatives) starting in May 2012, which led Herbalife's stock price to drop. In 2014, Ackman spent $50 million on a public relations campaign against Herbalife, which was designed to negatively impact the company's stock price.[37][38] Ackman pays about $100 million annually to maintain his short position.[39]
Former Rep. Bob Barr (R-GA) has called on Congress to investigate Ackman's use of public relations and regulatory pressure in his short campaign, and Harvey L. Pitt, a former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, questioned whether Ackman's aims to move the price rather than spread the truth.[40][41] In 2014, Senator Ed Markey wrote letters to federal regulators, including the FTC and the SEC, demanding they open an investigation into Herbalife's business practices. The day the letters were released, the company's stock dropped 14 percent. Markey later told the Boston Globe that his staff had not informed him that Ackman stood to benefit financially from the Senator's actions but defended the letters as a matter of consumer rights.[42]
In March 2014, the New York Times reported that Ackman had employed tactics to undermine public confidence in Herbalife to lower its stock price, including pressuring state and federal regulators to investigate the company, paying individuals to travel to and participate in rallies against the company and boosting its spending on donations to non-profit Latino organizations. According to the article, numerous letters were sent to federal regulators by groups such as the Hispanic Federation and the National Consumers League. "Each person contacted by The Times acknowledged in interviews that they wrote the letters after being lobbied by representatives from Pershing Square, or said they did not remember writing the letters at all. Mr. Ackman's team also then started to make payments totaling about $130,000 to some of these groups, including the Hispanic Federation — money he said was being used to help find victims of Herbalife."[43]
On March 12, 2015, The Wall Street Journal reported that prosecutors in the Manhattan U.S. attorney's office and the FBI were investigating whether people hired by Ackman "made false statements about Herbalife's business model to regulators and others in order to spur investigations into the company and lower its stock price."[44][45] In March 2015, U.S. District Judge Dale Fischer, in Los Angeles, California, dismissed a suit filed by Herbalife investors alleging the company is operating an illegal pyramid scheme. In response to Fischer's ruling, Herbalife stock surged approximately 13 percent.[46] Herbalife and the FTC reached a settlement agreement in July 2016, ending the agency's investigation into the company. On the day of the settlement, Fortune estimated that Ackman lost $500 million.[47]
Ackman's position on Herbalife led to a discussion on live television with Herbalife supporter Carl Icahn for nearly half an hour on CNBC on January 25, 2013.[48][49][50] During the segment, Icahn called Ackman "a crybaby in the schoolyard" and claimed that going public with his short position would eventually force Ackman into the "mother of all short squeezes." On November 22, 2013, he admitted on Bloomberg Television that Pershing Square's open short position in Herbalife was "$400 million to $500 million" in the red, but that he wouldn't be squeezed out and would hold the short "to the end of the earth".[51]
Political and economic views[edit]
He endorsed Michael Bloomberg as a prospective candidate for President of the United States in the 2016 presidential election.[52] After Donald Trump became president Ackman told Andrew Ross Sorkin of The New York Times that he was "bullish" on Trump's presidency.[53]
Philanthropy[edit]
Ackman has given to charitable causes such as the Center for Jewish History to preserve Jewish genealogy[54] where he spearheaded a successful effort to retire their $30 million in debt, personally contributing $6.8 million.[55][56] This donation made with that of Bruce Berkowitz, founder of Fairholme Capital Management, and Joseph Steinberg, president of Leucadia National, were the three largest individual gifts that the center has ever received.[57]
Ackman's foundation donated $1.1 million to the Innocence Project in New York City and Centurion Ministries in Princeton, N.J.[55] He is a signatory of The Giving Pledge, committing himself to give away at least 50% of his wealth to charitable causes.[58]
In 2006, Ackman co-founded The Pershing Square Foundation, alongside his wife at the time Karen, to support innovation in the areas of economic development, education, healthcare, human rights, arts and urban development.[59] Since it was founded, the foundation has committed more than $400 million in grants and social investments. In 2011, the Ackmans were among The Chronicle of Philanthropy’s "Philanthropy 50" list of the most generous donors.[60]
In July 2014, Challenged Athletes Foundation, which provides sports equipment to those with physical disabilities, honored Ackman at a gala fundraiser at the Waldorf Astoria hotel in New York City for helping raise a record $2.3 million.[61]
Personal life[edit]
He married Karen Ann Herskovitz, a graduate of Harvard University and a landscape architect, on July 10, 1994.[62] She is on the board of directors of Human Rights Watch[63] and on the board of Friends of the High Line.[55][64] They have three children.[7] On December 22, 2016 it was reported that the couple had separated.[65][66]

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million
Updated: June 9, 2013
Data Format: CSV
License: CC-BY

2 GB gzip8 GB uncompressed

Download



The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
