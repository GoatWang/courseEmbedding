Early life and education[edit]
Halvorsen was born in Norway in 1961. He graduated from the Norwegian Naval Academy and then served as a leader of a Norwegian SEAL team.[9]
Halvorsen attended Williams College, where he was a member of the ski team, and graduated in 1986 with a degree in economics. He went on to receive his MBA from the Stanford University School of Business in 1990.[10] [11] At Stanford, he was decorated with the Alexander A. Robichek Award and was decorated as an Arjay Miller Scholar.[12] Halvorsen is now on Williams' Board of Trustees.[13]
Investment career[edit]
Halvorsen worked in the investment banking division of Morgan Stanley after finishing his studies. Then he moved to Tiger Management Corp, where he was a senior managing director, as well as an analyst and director of equities, and a member of the management committee. He sat on Tiger's advisory board, and on the supervisory board of the firm's largest fund, Jaguar Fund N.V..[14]
In 1999, Halvorsen left Tiger to co-found Viking Global Investors, an investment firm managing in excess of $30 billion capital, of which he is currently the CEO, alongside David Ott and Brian Olson.[15][16] Halvorsen, Ott, and Olson are part of the group known as "Tiger Cubs," former employees of Julian Robertson's Tiger Management Corporation now working as hedge fund managers on their own.[17] Viking Global's main operations cover public equity and hedge funds on the international market.[18]
Personal life[edit]
He is married to Diane Halvorsen and they have three children and live in Darien, Connecticut.[1][19]

Halvorsen attended Williams College, where he was a member of the ski team, and graduated in 1986 with a degree in economics. He went on to receive his MBA from the Stanford University School of Business in 1990.[10] [11] At Stanford, he was decorated with the Alexander A.

Andreas Halvorsen — Viking Global




Andreas Halvorsen — Viking Global
Andreas Halvorsen — Viking Global
Andreas Halvorsen launched Viking Global Investors in 1999. The firm now manages $30 billion in assets. The Norwegian-born Halvorsen is based in Greenwich, Connecticut. Prior to Viking, Halvorsen was a senior managing director at Tiger Management Corp. as well as an analyst and director of equities, and a member of the Management Committee. He sat on Tiger’s Advisory Board and on the Supervisory Board of Jaguar Fund N.V., the firm’s largest fund. Prior to joining Tiger, Halvorsen worked in the Investment Banking Division of Morgan Stanley. An officer on the Seal Team in the Royal Norwegian Navy, Halvorsen is a graduate of Williams College and the Stanford Graduate School of Business, where he was an Arjay Miller Scholar and received the Alexander A. Robichek Award.
Viking Global returned 13.4% net of fees in 2014. By the middle of 2014, Viking managed $20.6 billion in long-short hedge fund assets and more than $8 billion in long-only strategies. Viking Global returned an astonishing 89% after fees in its first full year in business (1999).Viking is a long/short global equity fund with a bottom-up stock picking approach.
Andreas Halvorsen’s performance during 2011 helped him claim the title of one of the world’s highest earning hedge fund managers. Halvorsen earned $200 million during 2011 and is considered to be one of the best Tiger alumni.
During 2014, led by Andreas Halvorsen, Viking Global sought to raise up to $2 billion for the Viking Global Opportunities fund, a new fund set to focus on illiquid investments. Investing in private companies and public ones that are difficult to trade quickly isn’t new for Viking. It has previously invested in First Data and Alibaba, for example. The new fund reflects Viking’s desire to have a vehicle structured specifically for illiquid assets and increased opportunities in the sector.
Andreas Halvorsen: Investment philosophy
Like many of the Tiger Cubs, Andreas Halvorsen is a stock picker. He believes that thoughtful analysis and disciplined valuation over time yield a diversified portfolio of longs and shorts, whose stock price developments will deviate from each other and provide a profitable spread. Since inception, Viking Global’s average annual long-short spread has been 24%, although there is significant quarterly variability underlying this average ranging from a high of 24% to a low of -15%.
Andreas Halvorsen notes that his greatest alpha generation has been in his highest conviction ideas. Of 921 long and short investments made by Viking over a five-year period — from 2006 to 2011 — 59% were profitable. Of the 56 investments that resulted in a profit or a loss exceeding 100 basis points, 75% were profitable. The top ten longs returned 28% per annum, outperforming the remaining longs by over 12 percentage points per annum on an unlevered basis. Over the same period, the MSCI World and S&P 500 indices returned 1.5% and 0.4%, respectively, per annum. During 2014, Viking’s top 20 longs appreciated by 26.5%.
Andreas Halvorsen likes to place large bets on high conviction companies. At the end of 2014 across Viking’s funds, the ten largest holding comprised nearly 40% of capital. The largest position, Illumina accounted for 5% of this. Gross exposure was 153%, and net exposure came in at 40%. Average gross and net exposures for the year were 173% and 48%, respectively.
Viking focuses on fundamental business factors to find companies to short or buy. Young analysts are encouraged to become industry specialists so they can be intimately involved in picking stocks, not relegated to writing reports.
As a starting point or “base case,” the fund typically tilts its portfolio 40% percent more to the long side than to the short side. But the size of the long-side tilt ebbs and flows based on Viking’s individual stock picks, not based on an overarching view of the market.
The following were Viking’s top ten longs, in order of size, at the end of 2014:

Illumina Inc. (ILMN.O)
AstraZeneca PLC (AZN.L)
Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. (WBA.O)
Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. (VRX.N)
Actavis plc (ACT.N)
Pioneer Natural Resources Company (PXD.N)
China Mobile Ltd. (0941.HK)
Intesa Sanpaolo SpA (ISP.MI)
Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd. (CP.N)
Air Products & Chemicals Inc. (APD.N)

Largest five individual stock positions are Alphabet Inc., Allergan plc, Walgreens Boots Alliance, Amazon.com, and Broadcom Corporation and they add up to just over one-third the entire portfolio.
Ole Andreas Halvorsen is one of the most successful "tiger cubs" (protégés of Julian Robertson & his legendary Tiger Fund). To know more about "tiger cubs", check out the book Julian Robertson: A Tiger in the Land of Bulls and Bears.
New Stakes:
Broadcom Corporation (BRCM): BRCM is a large (top five) 4.65% of the portfolio stake purchased this quarter at prices between $47.19 and $53.80. The stock is now at $53.33. It is a merger arbitrage stake. Avago Technologies is set to acquire BRCM. Halvorsen also has a fairly large position in Avago.
Note: A 11/9/2015 13G filing shows Viking owning 29.7M shares (5.3% of the business). This is compared to 23.6M shares in the 13F.

Hilton Worldwide (NYSE:HLT), Laboratory Corp of America Holdings (NYSE:LH), Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), Starwood Hotels & Resorts (HOT), and Teva Pharmaceuticals (NYSE:TEVA): These small stakes (less than ~2% of the portfolio each) were established during the quarter.
Note 1: Marriott International (NYSE:MAR) announced the acquisition of Starwood Hotels & Resorts last week in a stock-and-cash deal valued at ~$80 per share.
Note 2: A 10/13/2015 13G filing shows Viking owning 5.4M shares (5.3% of the business) of Laboratory Corp of America Holdings. This is compared to 5M shares reported in the 13F.
Eaton Corporation (NYSE:ETN), eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY), Nike Inc. (NYSE:NKE), and Textron Inc. (NYSE:TXT): These are very small positions (less than ~1% of the portfolio each) purchased this quarter.
Stake Disposals:
Baidu Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU): The ~1% BIDU position was first purchased in Q3 2013 at prices between $91 and $158. The stake was reduced by ~63% in Q3 2014 at prices between $182 and $229. Q4 2014 saw an about-turn: 68% increase at prices between $199 and $250. Q1 2015 saw a ~16% reduction at prices between $203 and $233 and that was followed by a ~47% reduction last quarter at prices between $189 and $221. The elimination this quarter happened at prices between $132 and $208. It currently trades at $207. Halvorsen harvested huge gains from this position.
Metlife (NYSE:MET): MET is a 2.49% stake bought in Q1 2015 at prices between $46.50 and $54.09 and increased by ~77% last quarter at prices between $50.25 and $57.70. The position was sold this quarter at prices between $46.07 and $57.70. It trades currently at $50.69.
Aon plc (NYSE:AON), Avis Budget Group (NASDAQ:CAR), Biogen Inc. (NASDAQ:BIIB), Cigna Inc. (NYSE:CI), NXP Semiconductors NV (NASDAQ:NXPI), Receptos Inc. (RCPT), Twenty First Century Fox (NASDAQ:FOXA), and Universal Health Services (NYSE:UHS): These very small stakes (less than ~1% of the portfolio each) were sold out during the quarter. The position sizes were too small to indicate a clear bias.

Stake Increases:
Allergan plc (NYSE:AGN) previously Actavis: AGN was first purchased in Q2 2013 and more than doubled the next quarter at prices between $97 and $147. The stake was reduced by ~70% in Q1 2014 at prices between $177 and $221. Q3 2014 saw the position doubled at prices between $203 and $248 and that was followed by a ~80% increase in Q4 2014 at prices between $217 and $270. Q1 2015 saw an additional one-third increase at prices between $255 and $317. Last two quarters have also seen minor increases. It is now Halvorsen's second largest position at 7.50% of the US long portfolio. The stock currently trades at $302.
Note: Part of the increase in Q1 2015 was due to the acquisition of Allergan by Actavis. Viking Global held ~2M shares of Allergan for which they received around 725K shares of Actavis. Actavis plc was later renamed Allergan plc.
Air Products & Chemicals (NYSE:APD): APD is a medium-sized 2.89% of the US long portfolio position. It was first purchased in Q3 2014 at prices between $128 and $137 and increased by ~50% the following quarter at prices between $119 and $149. Q1 2015 saw a further ~46% increase at prices between $139 and $158. Last quarter the pattern reversed: ~25% reduction at prices between $137 and $153. The stock currently trades at $140. This quarter saw a marginal increase.
Note: The business has seen activist involvement: Bill Ackman (Pershing Square) has a huge stake.
American International Group (NYSE:AIG): AIG was a 1.79% stake established in Q1 2015 at prices between $48.87 and $56.42.
