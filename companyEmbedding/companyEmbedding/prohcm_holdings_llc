ProHCM Adds Seventeen New Broker Partners




 Wrentham, MA,  January 31, 2017 --(PR.com)-- ProHCM, a leading HR and benefits technology and services organization, has added 17 new benefit broker partners since the start of January. This represents the fastest expansion since ProHCM launched in the summer of 2016. The new locations include: Atlanta, GA; Boston, MA; Chicago, IL; Cincinnati, OH; Denver, CO; Hartford, CT; Miami, FL; New York, NY; Portland, ME; San Francisco, CA; Seattle, WA; Syracuse NY; Tampa, FL; and Manchester, NH.“I attribute the growth to our unique model and value proposition for the independent benefits broker,” says Joe Markland, ProHCM’s CEO. “We see this as the Uber of the benefits business. The combination of centralized technology and services with local, vested sales and service providers (our broker partners) enables smaller, independent brokers to compete effectively in a rapidly changing market.”ProHCM launched in the summer of 2016 as a franchise model of a combined human capital management (HCM) company and benefits organization. The model was designed to help small to mid-sized employers elevate HR to new heights by leveraging market leading technology with a combination of centralized and local services. The service model fills the void in the market where employers desire to make HR better but often lack the capacity, capability, and vision to achieve their objectives.According to the Starr Conspiracy, the SMB HCM market is a $96 billion market. However, there is a large gap between the services the technology vendors deliver and what most employers need. ProHCM provides personalized services around the market leading vendors including ADP, Kronos, Ultimate Software, Ceridian, and more."Most technology vendors, and even Benefits Brokers, deliver technology to employers but don't deliver the needed services," says John Jakiemiec, a ProHCM partner. “Employers need help. It's like employers are playing a baseball game with 5 players, and the market delivers more baseball gloves. What the employers really need is more players."The ProHCM launch and expansion comes at a time when even larger employers are looking to outsource HR. Walmart has recently announced that they are laying off over a thousand employees and outsourcing their HR functions. (Source: Fortune: http://fortune.com/2017/01/10/walmart-jobs-layoffs/ ) "If firms like Walmart think they can reduce costs and improve their HR through outsourcing, smaller employers will certainly start considering it, too," says Markland.ProHCM expects to add 100 benefits brokers in 2017 covering all U.S. Markets. ProHCM is also launching a proprietary web product that expands employee benefit offerings for employees through a Microsoft Dynamics platform that integrates with ADP and Kronos by this coming July.About ProHCMProHCM Holdings, LLC (www.prohcm.com) is a human capital management technology and services company that is focused on creating a better world in HR by combining market-leading technology and centralized human capital management services from experts, delivered through local HR and Benefits Consulting Partners.

ProHCM cost-effectively helps employers simplify the complex by delivering a structured and highly functional HR ecosystem.

“The average employer is working with anywhere from 10 – 20 different vendors who provide some product or service to manage HR for the benefit of employees,” says Shaun Dolan, a ProHCM benefits partner. “The problem is that these vendors are all disconnected. It is like having the best musicians in the world on the same stage, but if they don’t play the same song, you get a bad result.” ProHCM helps employers manage all the moving parts so that they work seamlessly together and employers get the results they desire.

The ProHCM Service Center staff consists of industry experts with a wide range of experience, including HR Consultants, workforce optimization experts, benefits advisors, HCM technology professionals, consultants, and employment law attorneys. ProHCM provides services around market-leading technology vendors, including ADP, Kronos, Ultimate Software, and more. Local service is provided by ProHCM HR and Benefits Consulting Partners. Offices are now located in more than 50 markets across the U.S. with an expectation of coverage in 100 markets by the end of 2016.
