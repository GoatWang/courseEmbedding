 How High will our Loonie Soar? 

Posted on July 7th, 2017 by David Baskin 

  Elections. Sports events. Stock prices. There are a lot of things in the world that are hard to predict. Among them, and high on the list, is the value of currencies. Forecasters, traders and economists spill oceans of ink and spend hours of time trying to guess (really, it is a guess) if the […]

 Why airline stocks are ready to takeoff 

Posted on June 26th, 2017 by Ernest Wong 

  Our recent investment in Delta Airlines has puzzled some of our clients. Given our strategy of buying and holding superior companies forever, why are we now investing in a highly cyclical industry with a well-known history of capital destruction? Let’s start with a brief history of the North American airline industry. In 1978, President […]

 What I Learned About Investing from Dungeons & Dragons 

Posted on June 21st, 2017 by Benjamin Klein 

    One of my hobbies is playing board games. I am an avid player of Settlers of Catan, Carcassonne, Ticket to Ride, and Lords of Waterdeep, and classics like Risk and Trivial Pursuit. While playing Dungeons & Dragons with a group of friends, I recalled an important investing lesson. For those who don’t know, […]

 Our mobile addiction 

Posted on June 8th, 2017 by Cheryl Kaplan 

  Last week at the gym, I struck up a conversation with the gentleman working out next to me. He expressed his frustration with the folks around us who were checking their phones constantly. I sympathized with his irritation but I had to admit that I am also guilty of this transgression. Admit it…You do […]

 Thoughts on customer concentration 

Posted on May 15th, 2017 by Ernest Wong 

  “Tell me where I’m going to die, so I’ll never go there.”- Charlie Munger A large part of successful investing lies in not being stupid, as opposed to being smart. It is usually much easier to avoid an obstacle course rather than fight your way through it.  Since the most important part of our […]

Welcome to Baskin Wealth Management

We are an independently owned investment management firm providing customized wealth management to a select group of Canadians, committed to meeting the needs of our clients by endeavouring to protect their capital and by building their wealth over time.
Our long-term performance is based upon our strict adherence to three investment principles:
Focus on what we know. We believe that the more knowledge we have, the better we can fully participate in growth in the up years, and experience lower volatility in the down years.
Use fundamental analysis to identify opportunities. We pay close ongoing attention to economic indicators, sector outlooks, company results and competitive positioning to identify underpriced securities and to avoid those that are overpriced.
Value is recognized over time. Our focus and fundamental analysis give us the confidence to take a position in a security when we feel it is undervalued and to hold it as the market comes to agree with our assessment of its true value.
These principles, coupled with a close attention to client service, help us to offer clients a unique discretionary investment
management experience. Unlike the big banks or other larger investment firms, at Baskin Wealth Management, our clients have direct access to the top people at the company. We offer discretionary management appropriate to our clients’ individual needs with a straightforward and easy to understand low fee schedule.
Our goal is to provide all our clients with managed growth and peace of mind.
