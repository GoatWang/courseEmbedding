                                Two-Rams for large-scale non-ferrous applications
            


            March 14, 2008
        






















International Baler’s Two-Ram line is ideal for large-scale non-ferrous high-speed, high-volume applications. These heavy-duty balers feature fully automatic operation, multi-material capability, and are easy to operate. Key features include: heavy-duty welded construction; a T8 and T10 Regen hydraulic system; integrated disconnect providing for lock-out/ tag-out procedures; adjustable shear blades; “touch screen” controls; adjustable photo cell control; quick material change over; an exclusive “removable” chamber wall; and a baler door system. These balers meet or exceed all current ANSI Z 245.5 safety standards and use a UL-listed PLC-equipped electrical panel. Options include Hydra Kleen oil filtration and feed hopper extensions.

Pyrotite® Technology

                        Pyrotite is a non-combustible, non-toxic, inorganic material designed to prevent ignition and inhibit the spread of flames. The patented, cementitious compound releases water when exposed to the heat of fire, absorbing and cooling the heat of a fire.
                        Product research and testing has utilized Pyrotite material as a coating, an integral treatment, a structural laminate, a foam, and a cured and pulverized powder, mostly in applications to enhance the fire retardant properties of wood construction materials.
Barrier's first commercial application of Pyrotite material is as a coating on plywood and oriented strand board to create a fire-rated structural wood sheathing branded as Blazeguard.
Pyrotite coating has potential application to engineered woods, paint, plastics, and expanded polystyrene.  Barrier provides consulting services to help determine how Pyrotite coating applies to your substrate and how coating services for your substrates can be performed at its new manufacturing facility. 
For application and licensing inquiries, please contact Dr. Michael Huddy, President, at 1-800-638-4570.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Barrier obtained the license rights to the patented Pyrotite technology in 1986 with the goal to develop economically feasible alternatives to fire treated wood building products. After an initial R&D phase where an effective fire barrier laminate was developed for use with wood panel products, Barrier began an association with the Weyerhaeuser Company late in 1989. The association with Weyerhaeuser resulted in the development of the first surface applied fire treatment to pass the stringent fire testing requirements for a ?structural? building sheathing. Weyerhaeuser, as part of this endeavor, tested over 80 other emerging technologies for fire treated wood and concluded Pyrotite technology was superior.      Blazeguard? fire rated sheathing was first introduced to the US building products market by Weyerhaeuser in 1990. In honor of Blazeguard?s? innovative approach to fire treatment, Barrier and Weyerhaeuser received the coveted ?Best of What?s New? award for new technology by Popular Science in 1991. As part of a cyclical restructuring in 1992, Weyerhaeuser released, and sold to Barrier all of its rights to the Pyrotite technology and the Blazeguard? product.     Barrier manufactures Blazeguard? in a newly constructed manufacturing facility in Watkins, Minnesota. Current markets include: multifamily roof deck applications; the thermal barrier for structural insulated panels (SIPs); commercial roof deck applications; fire-rated wall assemblies and, specialty markets such as electrical panel boxes for the telecommunications industry
