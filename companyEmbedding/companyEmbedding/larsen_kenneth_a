Physician Star Rating Description


Each patient's experience at our practice is important to us. As we strive to provide the highest level of care, we value feedback on all aspects of the patient experience. This Medical GPS patient experience survey measures patient satisfaction from the time the appointment was made to the time the patient spent with the provider.


Visit preparation: The visit preparation rating will tell you how prepared the office is for patients, friends and family members.
                

Provider explanation: The provider explanation measures if patients agree they understood the outcomes of their visit.
                

Office wait time: The office wait time rates patient satisfaction for wait time during their visit.
                

Patient recommendation: The patient recommendation shows how many patients would recommend this provider after their visit.
