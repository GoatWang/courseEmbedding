	 TRIAN PARTNERS NOMINATES NELSON PELTZ
	FOR ELECTION TO PROCTER & GAMBLE BOARD





	 






	Files Preliminary Proxy Statement for
	P&G’s 2017 Annual Meeting







	 







	Shareholder Materials Available at RevitalizePG.com







	 






	NEW YORK, July 17, 2017—

	Trian Fund Management, L.P.
	(“Trian”), whose investment funds beneficially own approximately $3.3 billion of shares of The Procter & Gamble
	Company (NYSE: PG) (“P&G” or the “Company”), today filed a preliminary proxy statement with the Securities
	and Exchange Commission for the election of Nelson Peltz, its Chief Executive Officer and Founding Partner, to P&G’s
	Board of Directors at the 2017 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. As one of P&G’s largest shareholders, and given P&G’s
	disappointing results over the past decade, Trian has a keen interest in helping the Company address the challenges it is facing,
	which include:




	 






	Weak Total Shareholder Returns


	– Over the
	past decade, P&G has underperformed relative to both its peers and the S&P 500.


	1


	Over a 10-year period, P&G’s total return to shareholders was less than half that of its peers and has
	been in the bottom quartile over most recent time frames.


	2


	Trian believes P&G needs to address the factors contributing to this consistent underperformance, including:






	Deteriorating Market Share


	– Over the past
	five years, P&G’s organic sales growth has decelerated and the Company has lost market share across most of its categories.


	3







	·



	Organic sales and volume growth have been well below that of traditional large-cap consumer packaged goods peers.





	·



	Disruptive and existential threats are impacting the entire consumer packaged goods industry, including changes in technology and consumer behavior, and P&G must act with the greatest possible urgency to address the market share it is losing to both its peers and smaller local competitors, who are adapting to industry changes more effectively than P&G.




	 




















	Excessive Cost and Bureaucracy


	– P&G management
	acknowledges the need to reduce cost and bureaucracy,


	4


	but it is clear to Trian that these critical issues have not been sufficiently addressed.





	·

	 


	Trian’s analysis shows that P&G’s $10 billion cost-cutting program, launched in 2012, has had no discernible impact on profits or sales growth.




	 




	 



	o


	 



	To the extent savings were reinvested to drive growth, there was little impact on organic volume growth, which was among the worst in class relative to peers from 2012 to 2016, and market shares declined.




	 



	o



	 


	Savings did not drive earnings growth given that operating profit was
	essentially flat from 2012 to 2016.


	5






	 





	·

	 


	Although P&G has stated that it has identified up to $13 billion of additional cost savings, given the Company’s track record, Trian is concerned that this initiative will be as ineffective as the 2012 program in driving sales growth, earnings growth and shareholder value creation.  





	·

	 


	P&G has an overly complex organizational structure and a slow moving and insular culture.




	 




	 



	o

	 


	Structural and organizational bureaucracy prevents management
	from identifying and responding to commercial opportunities in a timely manner, hinders product innovation and dampens sales
	growth.


	6






	 


	While P&G leadership says they are addressing the underperformance
	issue, shareholders have heard similar promises in the past and results have not improved.  Trian believes P&G must take
	decisive action that goes above and beyond what P&G has presently committed to do.






	 









	 






	 




	Adding Nelson Peltz to the Board Will Help P&G Address
	These Challenges


	– Trian believes that Mr. Peltz’s significant expertise and long track record of working successfully
	with management teams and boards to turn around consumer companies and drive sustainable long-term shareholder value will be invaluable
	to P&G as it works to overcome its challenges.





	·

	 


	At consumer companies where Mr. Peltz has served on the
	Board of Directors, earnings-per-share growth has outpaced the S&P 500


	7


	by an average of 780 basis points annually.


	8







	·

	 


	Total shareholder returns at consumer companies where Mr. Peltz has
	served on the Board of Directors have outperformed the S&P 500 by an average of 880 basis points annually.


	9






	 


	Trian believes that P&G’s challenges stem in large part
	from its organizational structure and culture, which can be highly resistant to change. Therefore, it is Trian’s strong view
	that the addition of a motivated independent director that has a material ownership stake and relevant industry experience can
	be a valuable resource for overcoming the root causes of these challenges.


	 




	What Trian is NOT Pushing For

	–

	Trian believes
	strongly in P&G’s potential, and as a long-term shareowner, its objective is to create sustainable long term shareholder
	value for all P&G shareholders. That means Trian is:





	·

	 


	NOT advocating for the break-up of the Company





	·

	 


	NOT suggesting that the CEO be replaced





	·

	 


	NOT seeking to replace directors





	·

	 


	NOT advocating taking on excessive leverage





	·

	 


	NOT seeking to cut pension benefits





	·

	 


	NOT suggesting that research & development, marketing expense or capital expenditures be reduced




	 


	Trian has made the decision to nominate Mr. Peltz for election
	to the Board at the 2017 Annual Meeting so that he can act as a catalyst for faster and more significant change at P&G. In
	connection with this nomination, Trian has filed a preliminary proxy statement with the SEC and launched the website www.RevitalizePG.com,
	which contains a brief shareholder presentation and other materials.


	 


	“Trian believes the job of a highly engaged shareowner in
	the boardroom is to foster a true sense of ownership among directors and inspire the board to take decisive and timely action to
	create sustainable, long-term value for both the company and its shareholders,” said Mr. Peltz. “As a member of the
	Board, it would be my goal to help improve performance by increasing sales and profits and regaining lost market share. I also
	believe the Board must address the company’s structure and culture. I can add far more value operating within the P&G
	boardroom than by merely looking in from the outside.”


	 


	Wishing to avoid a proxy contest, Trian had numerous constructive
	meetings and discussions with P&G management and a few Board members over the course of the past four months. Trian is disappointed
	that the Company has rejected Trian’s request to expand the Board by adding Mr. Peltz, who would be a representative of all
	shareholders. Trian still hopes to avoid the distraction of a proxy contest for the sake of all constituencies. However, it feels
	compelled to advocate for the changes it believes are necessary at P&G in order to enhance long-term value and return P&G
	to its position as the best-in-class consumer packaged goods company in terms of growing both market share and financial performance.
	Should Mr. Peltz be elected to a seat on P&G’s Board at its Annual Meeting, as a director, his first action






	 









	 






	would be to propose that the Board immediately re-appoint to the
	Board whichever current director has not been re-elected.

	Nelson Peltz is the Chief Executive Officer & Founding Partner
	of Trian, a highly regarded investment management firm formed in 2005. Over the course of his career, he has served on a number

	References to the S&P 500 throughout this press release refer to the S&P 500 Total Return Index, which includes
	the price changes of all underlying stocks and all dividends reinvested. S&P 500 data is obtained from Bloomberg using the
	SPX ticker with the inclusion of dividend re-investment.




	2


	Source: Capital IQ, SEC filings and annual reports. Total shareholder return of the S&P 500, the Company and
	its peers measured through June 15, 2017, one day before rumors surfaced of Trian seeking P&G Board representation. Trian
	considers the Company’s peers to include Beiersdorf, Church & Dwight, Clorox, Colgate, Edgewell Personal Care, Henkel,
	Kimberly-Clark, L’Oreal, Reckitt Benckiser and Unilever. We believe this peer group is relevant because each is domiciled
	in the United States or Europe, has a significant market capitalization and generates a significant portion of its sales in categories
	in which P&G competes.




	3


	Source: Company SEC filings. The Company’s organic sales growth was 0% in FY2016 and 2% year-to-date in FY2017,
	compared with a compound annual growth rate of 4% for organic sales from FY2006 through FY2011. In addition, the Company’s
	volume growth has trailed the average volume growth of its peers which disclose this data in four out of the five most recently
	completed years (indicating a loss of market share).




	4


	As referenced above, P&G announced a goal to reduce costs by $10 billion dollars by 2016 at the Consumer Analyst
	Group of New York Conference held on February 23, 2013. In addition, P&G identified an additional savings opportunity of up
	to $13 billion at the Deutsche Bank Global Consumer Conference held on June 15, 2017.




	5


	Source: Company SEC filings. From FY2012 through FY 2016, the Company grew sales volumes at a compound annual growth
	rate of 0.6% and grew operating profit at a compound annual growth rate of -0.1%.




	6


	Trian believes that P&G’s organizational structure is overly “matrixed,” which we believe impedes
	growth by adding unnecessary complexity and cost. We understand that there are three overlapping organizational structures at
	P&G (Global Business Units as defined by category, Selling and Marketing Operations, and Corporate Functions), and in our
	view, these overlapping structures obscure accountability, increase bureaucracy and slow decision-making and impede sales growth
	and market shares.




	7


	We highlight the S&P 500 here only as a widely recognized index, however, for various reasons the performance
	of the index and that of Trian’s Engaged Consumer Investments (defined in footnote 8 below) may not be comparable. While
	Trian believes that earnings per share growth at Trian’s Engaged Consumer Investments was attributable in large part to
	the cumulative effects of the implementation of operational and strategic initiatives during the period of Trian’s active
	involvement and beyond, there is no objective method to confirm what portion of such growth was attributable to Trian’s
	efforts and what may have been attributable to other factors. This press release does not provide the performance of Trian’s
	funds or the performance of individual fund investments.

	versus the S&P 500’s annual EPS growth during the time that Trian held the investment. Trian’s Engaged Consumer
	Investments” includes all of Trian’s food, beverage, restaurant, and retail-focused portfolio companies across all
	of our equity investment vehicles since inception that were held for one year or longer and where Trian also (x) had a designee
	or nominee on the Board, (y) was a Schedule 13D filer, and/or (z) wrote a “white paper” and met with management. Such
	investments do not represent all of the investments purchased or sold for Trian’s clients and it should not be assumed that
	any or all of these investments were or will be profitable.




	9


	Represents average total shareholder return (TSR) outperformance for the relevant companies vs. the S&P 500’s TSR from
	the date of Trian’s first purchase through the earlier of June 20, 2017, or the last day that the company’s shares
	were publicly traded. The TSR analysis reflects the change in the stock price of each of Trian’s Engaged Consumer Investments
	plus the effect of dividends received over the relevant time period. The TSR outperformance figures should not be construed as
	an indication of the performance of the funds managed by Trian and it should not be assumed that any or all of Trian’s Engaged
	Consumer Investments were or will be profitable in any of the funds managed by Trian.

Item 3 of the Schedule 13D is hereby amended and supplemented by adding the following information:


Since the filing of Amendment No. 2, TPSIF II, Strategic Fund-D, Strategic Fund-G II and Strategic Fund-K have collectively purchased 1,307,421 Shares in the open market for an aggregate purchase price of $59,028,430 (including commissions).   The source of funding for such transactions was the respective general working capital of the purchasers.


On November 4, 2015, Coinvest Fund-A exercised all of its Options to purchase 649,500 Shares for an aggregate exercise price of $24,854,539.  (See Schedule A to the Original Statement for additional detail regarding these Options.)  The source of funding for such transaction was the general working capital of Coinvest Fund A.


On December 8, 2015 and December 9, 2015, TPSIF II acquired Options entitling it to the same economic gain or loss as if it had purchased 585,540 Shares.  These Options were exercisable on or prior to December 31, 2017 and otherwise had substantially similar terms and conditions as the Options described on Schedule A of the Original Statement.  On March 3, 2016, TPSIF exercised all of these Options to purchase 585,540 Shares for an aggregate exercise price of $23,949,781. The source of funding for such transaction was the general working capital of TPSIF II.

Peltz and Frank received matching grants from the Issuer equal to 50% of the amounts described above, and therefore received an additional 160 Director Shares on September 30, 2015, 150 Director Shares on December 31, 2015, and 134 Director Shares on March 31, 2016.  Finally, in connection with their service on the Issuer’s Board of Directors, on November 17, 2015 each of Messrs.

					About				







Trian is a highly engaged shareowner, bringing a private equity mindset to the public markets





From Left to Right: Nelson Peltz, Ed Garden and Peter May
Founded in 2005, Trian Fund Management, L.P. (“Trian”) is a multi-billion dollar investment management firm with over 50 employees. Trian is a highly engaged shareowner that combines concentrated public equity ownership with operational expertise. Leveraging the 40+ years’ operating experience of our Principals, Nelson Peltz, Ed Garden and Peter May, Trian seeks to invest in high quality but undervalued and underperforming public companies and to work collaboratively with management teams and boards of those companies to execute operational and strategic initiatives designed to drive long-term sustainable earnings growth for the benefit of all shareholders.




Feedback From Our Portfolio Companies





“Trian has a strong track record of working with companies to build long-term shareholder value, and has been an engaged shareholder. We appreciate their perspectives and look forward to a constructive ongoing dialogue with Trian as we execute our strategy to reshape the Company.” 1
– Jeffrey R. Immelt (Chairman and CEO of General Electric) 












“We believe that Nelson will be a valuable addition to our Board. We respect his more than 40 years of business and investment experience as well as his expertise helping consumer products companies leverage their brands and improve operating and financial performance.  We welcome his input as we deliver superior shareholder returns.” 2
– Irene Rosenfeld (Chairman and CEO of Mondelēz)












“Ed brings to our Board the perspective of a large and engaged shareholder in BNY Mellon and has a track record of working collaboratively with other boards and management teams. We welcome him and we look forward to benefiting from Trian’s insights and contributions as we continue to build value for our clients and shareholders.” 3
– Gerald Hassell (Chairman and CEO of BNY Mellon)












“We are firmly committed to enhancing value for all Sysco shareholders and always welcome constructive input toward driving long-term shareholder value.  Nelson and Josh will bring our Board an informed perspective based on their significant experience in the food products industry.

– Jackie Ward (non-executive chairman of Sysco’s Board of Directors)
