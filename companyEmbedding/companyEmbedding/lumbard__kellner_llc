January 15, 2013:A Million-Dollar Bill:If you know a high school or college student who might like to receive a $1,000,000 bill�with an inscription about saving a million dollars by foregoing a latte and a muffin each day�give us a call at 1-800-Lumbard and we�ll send one to you.  The bill is featured on page 4 of the January, 2013 issue of our newsletter, Insight. 






September 30, 2011:John Lumbard Interviewed on Atlanta�s Butler on Business:There's no need to worry that Europe is dragging us into a recession;  this fear emerges every few months, and it�s been wrong every time, for good reasons.  On the other hand there's not much reason to hope for strong growth, because in the near term we're suffering from fiscal drag�the depressing effect caused by the end of the stimulus programs and the shrinkage of state and local governments.  In the longer term we have to worry that we�re now very much like Greece and the other Southern European nations.




 


 






September 9, 2010:Magic - Follow the lead of the world�s biggest and best corporations. Sell their bonds, and buy their stocks.We can�t emphasize enough the magic that occurs when a company buys back shares at a ridiculously-low price. If a company sells at ten times earnings�that is, the stock sells for $10 and the earnings are $1�those earnings are 10% of the price of the stock. ... Full Article




 


 












Summer 2010:Congratulations to Drew Kellner, who passed the third and final level of CFA exams this summer. Only 46% of the candidates passed this level, and just 20% made it all the way through.  And we�re not talking about an average sample of college graduates;  the nation�s best and brightest have been dashing themselves against these rocks for many years.
In fact, hopes are regularly dashed all over the world.  This year thousands of candidates sat for exams in London, Tokyo, Singapore, Geneva, Amsterdam, and Frankfurt, and there were many thousands more in locations as far flung as Kathmandu, Jakarta, Sao Paolo, and Hanoi.

For many years we�ve been tracking the performance of a real client account that we call our �Benchmark Account�.  We have to meet very stringent standards when reporting performance�we have to be able to produce all the pages of every statement�so even though the account opened in 1990 we can only show you its growth since January 1, 1998.  The account pays fees based on Lumbard & Kellner, LLC�s fee schedule from the 1990s, when the top rate was 1%.  The performance numbers presented below are net of fees and expenses�which means that the performance numbers you see have been reduced by the collection of our fees. Otherwise, the Benchmark Account has not had any additions or withdrawals since inception. Dividends and other earnings have been reinvested.On June 30, 2017, the account was valued at $1,116,833;  up from $$1,027,110 at the end of 2016, and $241,129 on December 31, 1998.  The compound annual growth rate from December 31, 1998 to the last day of 2016 was 8.38%.The performance results for the Benchmark Account (abbreviated to �Bench� in the tables below) were calculated by U.S. Bank, the custodian for Lumbard & Kellner, LLC�s client accounts.  Prior to 2004 State Street was the custodian, and calculated the returns. Actual returns for individual client portfolios managed by Lumbard & Kellner, LLC may vary and will not necessarily coincide exactly with the returns for the �Benchmark Account.�Compound Annual Growth Rate 1999-2016

Lumbard & Kellner Investment Counseling Fees 800.586.2273



























Lower fees mean better portfolio performance.

Our client accounts are held in custody by U.S. Bank, and we absorb the substantial cost.  The assets held for you by our custodian are legally yours: that might seem obvious, but it is not the case for assets held in a margin account by a brokerage firm. You also benefit from lower brokerage commissions (which result from trading in large blocks that include dozens of clients at a time);  and you�ll be pleased to receive the comprehensive tax report (individually-reviewed by a U.S. Bank tax expert) that the bank provides at the end of each year.







First

Next


$ 1,000,000

Above


$ 1,500,000


1/2 of 1%




*The minimum portfolio is $1,500,000.




The fee on the first $500,000 is 1.1% per annum, regardless of the size of the relationship.  A family of accounts can be combined for fee purposes.







Fees are collected in twelve installments, at the end of each month. The minimum portfolio is $1,500,000. There is no termination fee, but we expect our clients to join us as long-term investors. Two years is a reasonable trial period for client and manager to evaluate performance, service, and compatibility.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year
