Carel-- You've been here for three weeks now! We hope your profiles are starting to come together and that you've enjoyed getting to know all of us a little better. 
You're probably getting a good feel for the collaborative nature of WikiTree by now. We know that collaboration isn't always easy. So, we've put together a few pointers that can make working in this type of environment a little easier: How to be a Successful WikiTreer.

Carel  -- You are now a confirmed member, and you can get started adding your family members. As we've said, WikiTree is quite different from other genealogy sites. So, we've put together a guided tour to help you learn how to use it. Your first stop is How to Start Climbing Our Tree. 
Tomorrow, you'll hear from a Mentor who will check in to see how you're doing and answer any questions you might have. 
Next week, you'll get another message with your next stop on the guided tour. 
You can also meet some of our members by joining in the fun with our Question of the Week in the G2G forum What traditions does your family observe for Father’s Day?
Welcome!

Hello Carel, welcome to WikiTree! The email we just sent has helpful links to get you started.
WikiTree is different because our goal is to have one profile per person, and that means we share ancestors and work together as a BIG collaborative team!
What brings you to WikiTree? Do you have research you’d like to share? Are you interested in how your family fits into the big tree? 
When you confirm your email address, you’ll be given an opportunity to volunteer to help document our collective family history. Use the Tags and comments to tell us about your genealogical interests. 
When you volunteer, one of our Greeters will confirm your membership. Then you'll be able to add your family to the tree! 
We're really glad you're here!
