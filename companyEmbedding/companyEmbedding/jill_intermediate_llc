      On May 8, 2015, JJill Holdings and JJill Topco Holdings completed the 
      acquisition of the Company (the “Acquisition”). Due to the change in the 
      basis of accounting resulting from the Acquisition, our GAAP statement 
      of operations for the 2015 fiscal year is split into two periods, the 
      Predecessor period from February 1, 2015 to May 7, 2015 and the 
      Successor period from May 8, 2015 to January 30, 2016, which are not 
      necessarily comparable. For comparability, we are also presenting 
      supplemental pro forma financial information for the 2015 fiscal year, 
      giving effect to the Acquisition as if it had occurred on February 1, 
      2015.
    

* Non-GAAP financial measures. Please see “Non-GAAP Financial 
      Measures” and “Reconciliation of GAAP Net Income to Adjusted EBITDA and 
      Adjusted Net Income” for more information.
    

Outlook


      For the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we expect total comparable sales 
      to increase in the high single digits. GAAP diluted earnings per share 
      are expected to be in the range of $0.14 to $0.16. Adjusted diluted 
      earnings per share, which excludes approximately $2.2 million of 
      non-recurring expenses associated with the company’s initial public 
      offering, are expected to be in the range of $0.17 to $0.19. Both GAAP 
      and adjusted diluted earnings per share include approximately $0.4 
      million of public company costs not incurred in 2016. This guidance 
      assumes 43.7 million shares outstanding and a 40.0% income tax expense 
      rate.
    

      For the full 2017 fiscal year, on a 52-week basis, we expect total 
      comparable sales to increase in the high single digits. GAAP diluted 
      earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $0.71 to $0.75. 
      Adjusted diluted earnings per share, which excludes approximately $2.8 
      million of non-recurring expenses associated with the company’s initial 
      public offering, are expected to be in the range of $0.75 to $0.79. Both 
      GAAP and adjusted diluted earnings per share include approximately $1.4 
      million of public company costs not incurred in 2016. This guidance 
      assumes 43.7 million shares outstanding and a 40.0% income tax expense 
      rate. The 53rd week of fiscal 2017 is expected to contribute 
      an additional $9.0 million in sales and approximately $0.01 of earnings 
      per share.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures


      To supplement our unaudited consolidated financial statements presented 
      in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), we 
      use the following non-GAAP measures of financial performance:
    


        Adjusted EBITDA, which represents net income (loss) plus interest 
        expense, provision (benefit) for income taxes, depreciation and 
        amortization, the amortization of the step-up to fair value of 
        merchandise inventory resulting from the application of a purchase 
        accounting adjustment related to the Acquisition, certain 
        Acquisition-related expenses, sponsor fees, equity-based compensation 
        expense, write-off of property and equipment, prior period adjustment 
        for tenant allowances, and other non-recurring expenses, primarily 
        consisting of outside legal and professional fees associated with 
        certain non-recurring transactions and events. We present Adjusted 
        EBITDA on a consolidated basis because our management uses it as a 
        supplemental measure in assessing our operating performance, and we 
        believe that it is helpful to investors, securities analysts and other 
        interested parties as a measure of our comparative operating 
        performance from period to period. We also use Adjusted EBITDA as one 
        of the primary methods for planning and forecasting overall expected 
        performance of our business and for evaluating on a quarterly and 
        annual basis actual results against such expectations. Further, we 
        recognize Adjusted EBITDA as a commonly used measure in determining 
        business value and as such, use it internally to report results.
      

        Adjusted Net Income, which represents net income (loss) plus prior 
        period adjustment for tenant allowances and other non-recurring 
        expenses, primarily consisting of outside legal and professional fees 
        associated with certain non-recurring transactions and events. We 
        present Adjusted Net Income on a consolidated basis because our 
        management uses it as a supplemental measure in assessing our 
        operating performance, and we believe that it is helpful to investors, 
        securities analysts and other interested parties as a measure of our 
        comparative operating performance from period to period.
      

        Adjusted Earnings per Share (“Adjusted EPS”), which represents 
        Adjusted Net Income divided by the number of shares outstanding. 
        Adjusted EPS is presented as a supplemental measure in assessing our 
        operating performance, and we believe that it is helpful to investors, 
        securities analysts and other interested parties as a measure of our 
        comparative operating performance from period to period.
      


      While we believe that Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, and Adjusted 
      EPS are useful in evaluating our business, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net 
      Income, and Adjusted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures that have 
      limitations as analytical tools. Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, 
      and Adjusted EPS should not be considered alternatives to, or 
      substitutes for, net income (loss) or EPS, which are calculated in 
      accordance with GAAP. In addition, other companies, including companies 
      in our industry, may calculate Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, and 
      Adjusted EPS differently or not at all, which reduces the usefulness of 
      Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, and Adjusted EPS as tools for 
      comparison. We recommend that you review the reconciliation and 
      calculation of Adjusted EBITDA , Adjusted Net Income, and Adjusted EPS 
      to net income (loss) and EPS, the most directly comparable GAAP 
      financial measures, under “Reconciliation of GAAP Net Income to Adjusted 
      EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income” and not rely solely on Adjusted EBITDA, 
      Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted EPS, or any single financial measure to 
      evaluate our business.

Supplemental Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information


      The unaudited pro forma consolidated statement of operations for the 
      year ended January 30, 2016 has been derived from our consolidated 
      audited statements of operations and represents the addition of the 
      Predecessor period from February 1, 2015 through May 7, 2015 and the 
      Successor period from May 8, 2015 through January 30, 2016, and gives 
      effect to the following as if they had occurred on February 1, 2015:
    


        JJill Holdings’ acquisition of approximately 94% of the outstanding 
        interests of Jill Intermediate LLC and JJill Topco Holdings’ 
        acquisition of approximately 6% of the outstanding interests of Jill 
        Intermediate LLC and our election to push down the effects of the 
        Acquisition to our consolidated financial statements; and
      

        The related Acquisition financing as provided for under the Term Loan 
        for $250.0 million and the ABL Facility for $40.0 million (the 
        “Financing”).
      


      The unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information presented is 
      based on available information and assumptions we believe are reasonable 
      and does not include the impacts of any revenue, cost, or other 
      operating synergies that may result from the acquisition. The unaudited 
      pro forma consolidated statement of operations is presented for 
      illustrative purposes and does not purport to represent what the results 
      of operations would actually have been if the Acquisition and the 
      Financing had occurred as of the dates indicated or what the results of 
      operations would be for any future periods.

          (1)
        

           
        

          Represents the elimination of the increase in cost of goods sold

          merchandise inventory reflected in the purchase price allocation at 
          the date of the Acquisition.
        



          (2)
        



          Represents the incremental depreciation expense resulting from the 
          increase in fair value of certain fixed assets, reflected in the 
          purchase price allocation at the date of the Acquisition.
        



          (3)
        



          Represents the incremental amortization expense resulting from the 
          increase in fair value of certain definite-lived intangible assets,

          Acquisition.
        



          (4)
        



          Represents the elimination of the management fee charged by our 
          previous equity sponsor for the period from February 1, 2015 through

          (5)
        



          Represents the net decrease in amortization expense related to

          (6)
        



          Represents incremental pro forma deferred rent expense resulting

          (7)
        



          Represents the incremental compensation expense related to certain

          Acquisition.
        



          (8)

          Notes to the three months ended January 28, 2017 adjusted net income 
          and adjusted EBITDA adjustments:
        



          (a)
        

           
        

          The tax provision adjustment for adjusted net income is estimated by 
          applying the full year effective tax rate of 40.9% to the 
          adjustments.
        



          (b)
        



          Represents expenses associated with equity incentive units granted 
          to our management. Prior to the Acquisition, incentive units were 
          accounted for as a liability-classified award and the related 
          compensation expense was recognized based on changes in the 
          intrinsic value of the award at each reporting period. Subsequent to 
          the Acquisition, new incentive units were granted to management and 
          are accounted for as equity-classified awards with the related 
          compensation expense recognized based on fair value at the date of 
          the grants.
        



          (c)
        



          Represents net gain or loss on the disposal of fixed assets.
        



          (d)
        



          Represents items management believes are not indicative of ongoing 
          operating performance. These expenses are primarily composed of 
          legal and professional fees associated with non-recurring events. 
          The pro forma fiscal year 2015 expenses are primarily due to legal, 
          accounting, and professional fees incurred in connection with the 
          initial public offering.
        



          (e)
        



          Represents the prior period correction to recognize lease incentives 
          as reductions of rental expense by the lessee on a straight-line 
          basis over the term of the new lease, in accordance with ASC 840.

          (a)
        

           
        

          The tax provision adjustment for adjusted net income is estimated by 
          applying the full year effective tax rate of 40.9% to the

          (c)
        



          Represents transaction costs incurred in connection with the 
          Acquisition, consisting substantially of legal and advisory fees,

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as the information presented under "Selected Financial Data." The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and assumptions. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause such differences are discussed in the sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K titled "Risk Factors" and "Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements."  We operate on a 52- or 53-week fiscal year that ends on the Saturday that is closest to January 31. Each fiscal year generally is comprised of four 13-week fiscal quarters, although in the years with 53 weeks, the fourth quarter represents a 14-week period. Fiscal year 2016, pro forma fiscal year 2015 and fiscal year 2014 ended on January 28, 2017, January 30, 2016 and January 31, 2015, respectively, and were each comprised of 52 weeks.  Overview  J.Jill is a nationally recognized women's apparel brand focused on a loyal, engaged and affluent customer in the attractive 40-65 age segment. The J.Jill brand represents an easy, relaxed and inspired style that reflects the confidence and comfort of a woman with a rich, full life. We operate a highly profitable omni-channel platform that is well diversified across our direct (43% of net sales for fiscal year 2016) and retail (57% of net sales for fiscal year 2016) channels. We began as a catalog company and have been a pioneer of the omni-channel model with a compelling presence across stores, website and catalog since 1999. We have developed an industry-leading customer database that allows us to match approximately 97% of transactions to an identifiable customer. We take a data-centric approach, in which we leverage our database and apply our insights to manage our business as well as to acquire and engage customers to drive optimum value and productivity. Our goals are to Create a great brand, to Build a successful business and to Make J.Jill a great place to work. To achieve this, we have aligned our strategy and team around four guiding pillars-Brand, Customer, Product and Channel.  Factors Affecting Our Operating Results  Various factors are expected to continue to affect our results of operations going forward, including the following:  Overall Economic Trends. Consumer purchases of clothing and other merchandise generally decline during recessionary periods and other periods when disposable income is adversely affected, and consequently our results of operations may be affected by general economic conditions. For example, reduced consumer confidence and lower availability and higher cost of consumer credit may reduce demand for our merchandise and may limit our ability to increase or sustain prices. The growth rate of the market could be affected by macroeconomic conditions in the United States.  Consumer Preferences and Fashion Trends. Our ability to maintain our appeal to existing customers and attract new customers depends on our ability to anticipate fashion trends. During periods in which we have successfully anticipated fashion trends, we have generally had more favorable results.  Competition. The retail industry is highly competitive and retailers compete based on a variety of factors, including design, quality, price and customer service. Levels of competition and the ability of our competitors to more accurately predict fashion trends and otherwise attract customers through competitive pricing or other factors may impact our results of operations.  Our Strategic Initiatives. We are in the process of implementing significant business initiatives that have had and will continue to have an impact on our results of operations, including our brand voice and customer  Table of Contents  segmentation initiatives. Although these initiatives are designed to create growth in our business and continuing improvement in our operating results, the timing of expenditures related to these initiatives, as well as the achievement of returns on our investments, may affect our results of operation in future periods.  Pricing and Changes in Our Merchandise Mix. Our product offering changes from period to period, as do the prices at which goods are sold and the margins we are able to earn from the sales of those goods. The levels at which we are able to price our merchandise are influenced by a variety of factors, including the quality of our products, cost of production, prices at which our competitors are selling similar products and the willingness of our customers to pay for products.  How We Assess the Performance of Our Business  In assessing the performance of our business, we consider a variety of financial and operating metrics, including GAAP and non-GAAP measures, including the following:  Net sales consists primarily of revenues, net of merchandise returns and discounts, generated from the sale of apparel and accessory merchandise through our direct channel and retail channel. Net sales also include shipping and handling fees collected from customers. Revenue from our retail channel is recognized at the time of sale and revenue from our direct channel is recognized upon receipt of merchandise by the customer.  Net sales are impacted by the size of our active customer base, product assortment and availability, marketing and promotional activities and the spending habits of our customers. Net sales are also impacted by the migration of single-channel customers to omni-channel customers who, on average, spend nearly three times more than single-channel customers.  Total company comparable sales includes net sales from our full-price stores that have been open for more than 52 weeks and from our direct channel. This measure highlights the performance of existing stores open during the period, while excluding the impact of new store openings and closures. When a store in the total company comparable store base is temporarily closed for remodeling or other reasons, it is included in total company comparable sales only using the full weeks it was open. Certain of our competitors and other retailers may calculate total company comparable sales differently than we do. As a result, the reporting of our total company comparable sales may not be comparable to sales data made available by other companies.  Number of stores reflects all stores open at the end of a reporting period. In connection with opening new stores, we incur pre-opening costs. Pre-opening costs include expenses incurred prior to opening a new store and primarily consist of payroll, travel, training, marketing, initial opening supplies and costs of transporting initial inventory and fixtures to store locations, as well as occupancy costs incurred from the time of possession of a store site to the opening of that store. These pre-opening costs are included in selling, general and administrative expenses and are generally incurred and expensed within 30 days of opening a new store.  Gross profit is equal to our net sales less costs of goods sold. Gross profit as a percentage of our net sales is referred to as gross margin. Costs of goods sold includes the direct costs of sold merchandise, inventory shrinkage, and adjustments and reserves for excess, aged and obsolete inventory. We review our inventory levels on an ongoing basis to identify slow-moving merchandise and use product markdowns to efficiently sell these products. Changes in the assortment of our products may also impact our gross profit. The timing and level of markdowns are driven by customer acceptance of our merchandise. Certain of our competitors and other retailers may report costs of goods sold differently than we do. As a result, the reporting of our gross profit and gross margin may not be comparable to other companies.  The primary drivers of the costs of goods sold are raw materials, which fluctuate based on certain factors beyond our control, including labor conditions, transportation or freight costs, energy prices, currency fluctuations and commodity prices. We place orders with merchandise suppliers in United States dollars and, as a result, are not exposed to significant foreign currency exchange risk.  Table of Contents  Selling, general and administrative expenses include all operating costs not included in costs of goods sold. These expenses include all payroll and related expenses, occupancy costs and other operating expenses related to our stores and to our operations at our headquarters, including utilities, depreciation and amortization. These expenses also include marketing expense, including catalog production and mailing costs, warehousing, distribution and shipping costs, customer service operations, consulting and software services, professional services and other administrative costs.  Our historical revenue growth has been accompanied by increased selling, general and administrative expenses. The most significant increases were in occupancy costs associated with retail store expansion, and in marketing and payroll investments. While we expect these expenses to increase as we continue to open new stores, increase brand awareness and grow our business, we believe these expenses will decrease as a percentage of net sales over time.  As a public company, we will incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. We expect that compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, as well as rules and regulations subsequently implemented by the Securities and Exchange Commission, will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time consuming and costly. In addition, we expect that our management and other personnel will need to devote substantial time to these public company requirements. In particular, we expect to incur significant expenses and devote substantial management effort toward ensuring compliance with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. In that regard, we expect to hire additional accounting and financial staff with appropriate public company experience and technical accounting knowledge.  Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin. Adjusted EBITDA represents net income (loss) plus interest expense, provision (benefit) for income taxes, depreciation and amortization, the amortization of the step-up to fair value of merchandise inventory resulting from the application of a purchase accounting adjustment related to the Acquisition, certain Acquisition-related expenses, sponsor fees, equity-based compensation expense, write-off of property and equipment, prior period adjustment for tenant allowances, and other non-recurring expenses, primarily consisting of outside legal and professional fees associated with certain non-recurring transactions and events. We present Adjusted EBITDA on a consolidated basis because our management uses it as a supplemental measure in assessing our operating performance, and we believe that it is helpful to investors, securities analysts and other interested parties as a measure of our comparative operating performance from period to period. We also use Adjusted EBITDA as one of the primary methods for planning and forecasting overall expected performance of our business and for evaluating on a quarterly and annual basis actual results against such expectations. Further, we recognize Adjusted EBITDA as a commonly used measure in determining business value and as such, use it internally to report results. Adjusted EBITDA margin represents, for any period, Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net sales.  While we believe that Adjusted EBITDA is useful in evaluating our business, Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that has limitations as an analytical tool. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered an alternative to, or substitute for, net income (loss), which is calculated in accordance with GAAP. In addition, other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently or not at all, which reduces the usefulness of Adjusted EBITDA as a tool for comparison. We recommend that you review the reconciliation and calculation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin to net income (loss), the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, below and not rely solely on Adjusted EBITDA or any single financial measure to evaluate our business.  Table of Contents  Reconciliation of Net Income to Adjusted EBITDA and Calculation of Adjusted EBITDA Margin The following table provides a reconciliation of net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA and the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA margin for the periods presented: Successor Predecessor Pro Forma Predecessor For the For the Period from For the For the Fiscal Year May 8, 2015 Period from For the Fiscal Year Ended to February 1, 2015 Year Ended Ended January 28, January 30, to January 30, January 31, (in thousands, except share and per share data) 2017 2016 May 7, 2015 2016 2015 Statements of Operations Data: Net income (loss) $ 24,075 $ 4,306 $ (1,901 ) $ 14,295 $ 10,296 Interest expense 18,670 11,893 4,599 16,893 17,895 Provision for income taxes 16,669 2,322 1,499 10,223 10,860 Depreciation and amortization 36,219 28,702 5,147 37,802 19,051 Inventory step-up (a) - 10,471 - - - Acquisition-related expenses (b) - - 13,341 - - Sponsor fees (c) - - 250 - 1,000 Equity-based compensation expense (d) 624 168 441 609 5,152 Write-off of property and equipment (e) 385 237 112 349 58 Other non-recurring expenses (f) 9,741 1,600 184 1,784 1,408 Prior period adjustment for tenant allowance (g) (163 ) - - - - Adjusted EBITDA $ 106,220 $ 59,699 $ 23,672 $ 81,955 $ 65,720 Net sales $ 639,056 $ 420,094 $ 141,921 $ 562,015 $ 483,400 Adjusted EBITDA margin 16.6 % 14.2 % 16.7 % 14.6 % 13.6 %  (a) Represents the impact to costs of goods sold resulting from the amortization of the step-up to fair value of merchandise inventory resulting from the application of a purchase accounting adjustment related to the Acquisition.  (b) Represents transaction costs incurred in connection with the Acquisition, consisting substantially of legal and advisory fees, which are not expected to recur.  (c) Represents management fees charged by our previous equity sponsors.  (d) Represents expenses associated with equity incentive units granted to our management. Prior to the Acquisition, incentive units were accounted for as a liability-classified award and the related compensation expense was recognized based on changes in the intrinsic value of the award at each reporting period. Subsequent to the Acquisition, new incentive units were granted to management and are accounted for as equity-classified awards with the related compensation expense recognized based on fair value at the date of the grants.  (e) Represents the net loss on the disposal of fixed assets.  (f) Represents items management believes are not indicative of ongoing operating performance. These expenses are primarily composed of legal and professional fees associated with non-recurring events. The fiscal year 2014 expenses were primarily related to legal and professional services associated with the Company's evaluation of a sale of the business. The pro forma fiscal year 2015 expenses are primarily due to legal, accounting, and professional fees incurred in connection with the initial public offering of our common shares in March 2017.  (g) Represents the prior period correction to recognize lease incentives as reductions of rental expense by the lessee on a straight-line basis over the term of the new lease, in accordance with ASC 840.  Table of Contents  Factors Affecting the Comparability of our Results of Operations  On May 8, 2015, an investment vehicle of investment funds affiliated with TowerBrook Capital Partners L.P. acquired all of our outstanding equity interests through the newly formed entities JJill Holdings, Inc. ("JJill Holdings") and JJill Topco Holdings, LP ("JJill Topco Holdings"). We refer to such acquisition and the related financing transactions as the "Acquisition." JJill Holdings acquired approximately 94% of the outstanding interests of Jill Intermediate LLC, our predecessor entity, and JJill Topco Holdings acquired the remaining 6% of the outstanding interests of Jill Intermediate LLC in the Acquisition. The purchase price was $396.4 million, which consisted of $386.3 million of cash consideration and $10.1 million of noncash consideration in the form of an equity rollover by Jill Intermediate LLC's predecessor management owners. The Acquisition was funded through an equity contribution by JJill Holdings and JJill Topco Holdings and borrowings under our seven-year $250.0 million Term Loan, as described under "Credit Facilities" below.  JJill Holdings accounted for the Acquisition as a business combination under the acquisition method of accounting. Accordingly, the purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of Acquisition.  We have elected to push down the effects of the Acquisition to our consolidated financial statements. As such, the financial information provided in this Annual Report on Form 10-K is presented as "Predecessor" or "Successor" to indicate whether they relate to the period preceding the Acquisition or the period succeeding the Acquisition, respectively. The financial information for all periods after May 7, 2015 represents the financial information of the Successor. Prior to, and including, May 7, 2015, the consolidated financial statements, included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, include the accounts of the Predecessor.  Due to the change in the basis of accounting resulting from the Acquisition, the Predecessor's consolidated financial statements and the Successor's consolidated financial statements, included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, are not comparable. See our historical audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding the Acquisition.  On February 24, 2017, we completed a conversion from a Delaware limited liability company named Jill Intermediate LLC into a Delaware corporation and changed our name to J.Jill, Inc. In conjunction with the conversion, all of our outstanding equity interests converted into shares of common stock. Accordingly, all historical earnings per share amounts presented in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements have been adjusted retroactively to reflect our conversion from a limited liability company to a corporation.  Following our conversion from a limited liability company to a corporation, J.Jill, Inc. merged with and into its direct parent company, JJill Holdings, on February 24, 2017, with J.Jill, Inc. continuing as the surviving entity. JJill Holdings did not have operations of its own, except for buyer transaction costs of $8,560 incurred to execute the Acquisition.  On May 27, 2016, we entered into an agreement to amend our Term Loan to borrow an additional $40.0 million. The other terms and conditions of the Term Loan remained substantially unchanged, as discussed in "-Liquidity and Capital Resources-Credit Facilities." We used the additional loan proceeds, along with cash on hand, to fund a $70.0 million dividend to the partners of JJill Topco Holdings, which was approved by the members of Jill Intermediate LLC and the board of directors of JJill Topco Holdings on May 27, 2016.  On January 18, 2017, we made a voluntary prepayment of $10.1 million, including accrued interest, on our Term Loan.  Table of Contents  Results of Operations  Fiscal Year Ended January 28, 2017 (Successor) Compared to the Period from May 8, 2015 through January 30, 2016 (Successor) and the Period from February 1, 2015 to May 7, 2015 (Predecessor)  The following table summarizes our consolidated results of operations for the periods indicated:   Successor Predecessor For the Fiscal Year For the Period For the Period Ended January 28, May 8, 2015 to February 1, 2015 to 2017 January 30, 2016 May 7, 2015 % of % of % of Net Net Net (in thousands) Dollars Sales Dollars Sales Dollars Sales Net sales $ 639,056 100.0 % $ 420,094 100.0 % $ 141,921 100.0 % Costs of goods sold 211,117 33.0 % 155,091 36.9 % 44,232 31.2 % Gross profit 427,939 67.0 % 265,003 63.1 % 97,689 68.8 % Selling, general and administrative expenses 368,525 57.7 % 246,482 58.7 % 80,151 56.5 % Acquisition-related expenses - - - - 13,341 9.4 % Operating income 59,414 9.3 % 18,521 4.4 % 4,197 2.9 % Interest expense 18,670 2.9 % 11,893 2.8 % 4,599 3.2 % Income (loss) before provision for income taxes 40,744 6.4 % 6,628 1.6 % (402 ) (0.3 )% Provision for income taxes 16,669 2.6 % 2,322 0.6 % 1,499 1.0 % Net income (loss) $ 24,075 3.8 % $ 4,306 1.0 % $ (1,901 ) (1.3 )%  Net Sales  Net sales were $639.1 million for the Successor fiscal year ended January 28, 2017 ("fiscal year 2016") compared to $420.1 million for the Successor period from May 8, 2015 to January 30, 2016 ("2015 Successor Period") and $141.9 million for the Predecessor period from February 1, 2015 to May 7, 2015 ("2015 Predecessor Period"). At the end of those same periods, we operated 275, 261 and 250 retail stores, respectively.  Our direct channel was responsible for 43% of our net sales in fiscal year 2016, 41% in the 2015 Successor Period and 37% in the 2015 Predecessor Period. Our retail channel was responsible for 57% of our net sales in fiscal year 2016, 59% in the 2015 Successor Period and 63% in the 2015 Predecessor Period. The increase in net sales in fiscal year 2016 was due to an increase in total comparable company sales, driven by an increase in our active customer base, and an increase in store count.  Gross Profit and Costs of Goods Sold  Gross profit was $427.9 million for fiscal year 2016 compared to $265.0 million for the 2015 Successor Period and $97.7 million for the 2015 Predecessor Period. The increase in fiscal year 2016 was primarily due to an increase in net sales and an increase in costs of goods sold during the 2015 Successor Period resulting from the amortization of the fair value step-up of merchandise inventory reflected in the purchase price allocation at the date of the Acquisition.  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses  Selling, general and administrative expenses were $368.5 million for fiscal year 2016 compared to $246.5 million for the 2015 Successor Period and $80.2 million for the 2015 Predecessor Period. The increase in fiscal year 2016 included higher sales related expenses, increased marketing and corporate expenses to support business growth, and costs associated with our initial public offering in March 2017. These increases are partially offset by lower incentive compensation expense.  Table of Contents  As a percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses were 57.7% in fiscal year 2016 compared to 58.7% for the 2015 Successor Period and 56.5% for the 2015 Predecessor Period.  Acquisition-Related Expenses  We incurred acquisition-related expenses of $13.3 million during the 2015 Predecessor Period, consisting primarily of legal and advisory fees. No such costs were incurred during fiscal year 2016 or the 2015 Successor Period.  Interest Expense  Interest expense was $18.7 million for fiscal year 2016 compared to $11.9 million for the 2015 Successor Period and $4.6 million for the 2015 Predecessor Period. The increase in fiscal year 2016 is due to the addition of $40.0 million to our Term Loan pursuant to an amendment on May 27, 2016 and an acceleration of the amortization of deferred financing costs due to a voluntary prepayment on our Term Loan on January 18, 2017.

The selling stockholder is selling all of the shares of our common stock being
sold in this offering, including any shares that may be sold in connection with
the exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares. 
Accordingly, we will not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares of our
common stock in this offering. We will bear all costs, fees and expenses in
connection with this offering, which are estimated to be $6.1 million.


The women’s apparel industry is highly competitive. We compete with local,
national and international retail chains and department stores, specialty and
discount stores, catalogs and internet businesses offering similar categories of
merchandise. We compete primarily on the basis of design, service, quality and
value. We believe our distinct combination of design, service, quality and value
allows us to compete effectively and we believe we differentiate ourselves from
competitors based on the strength of our brand, our industry-leading
omni-channel platform, our strong data capabilities, our loyal customer base,
our customer-focused product assortment and our highly experienced leadership
team. Our competitors range from smaller, growing companies to considerably
larger players with substantially greater financial, marketing and other
resources.


Company Description
J.Jill is a nationally recognized women’s apparel brand focused on a loyal,
engaged and affluent customer in the attractive 40-65 age segment. The J.Jill
brand represents an easy, relaxed and inspired style that reflects the
confidence and comfort of a woman with a rich, full life. We operate a


 highly
profitable omni-channel platform that is well diversified across our direct (42%
of net sales for the twelve months ended October 29, 2016) and retail (58% of
net sales for the twelve months ended October 29, 2016) channels. We began as a
catalog company and have been a pioneer of the omni-channel model with a
compelling presence across stores, website and catalog since 1999. We have
developed an industry-leading customer database that allows us to match
approximately 97% of transactions to an identifiable customer. We take a
data-centric approach, in which we leverage our database and apply our insights
to manage our business as well as to acquire and engage customers to drive
optimum value and productivity. Our goals are to Create a great brand, to Build
a successful business and to Make J.Jill a great place to work. To achieve this,
we have aligned our strategy and team around four guiding pillars – Brand,
Customer, Product and Channel.

Brand and Customer. Our brand promise to the J.Jill woman is to delight her with
great wear-now product, to inspire her confidence through J.Jill’s approach to
dressing and to provide her with friendly, guiding service wherever and whenever
she chooses to shop. While we find that women of all ages are attracted to our
brand, our typical customer is 40-65 years old, is college educated and has an
annual household income that exceeds $150,000. She leads a busy, yet balanced
life, as she works outside the home, is involved in her community and has a
family with children. She engages across both our direct and retail channels and
is highly loyal, as evidenced by the fact that approximately 70% of our gross
sales in pro forma fiscal year 2015 came from customers that have been shopping
with J.Jill for at least five years.

Product. Our customers strongly associate our products with a modern balance of
style, quality, comfort and ease suitable for a broad range of occasions at
accessible prices. Our product assortment is marketed under the J.Jill brand
name, sold exclusively through our direct and retail channels, and includes knit
and woven tops, bottoms and dresses as well as sweaters, outerwear and
accessories across a full range of sizes, including Misses, Petites, Women’s and
Tall. We also offer most of these products across our two sub-brands, Pure Jill
and Wearever. We design and merchandise our products in-house around clear
product stories, grounded with essential yet versatile styles and fabrications
updated each month with fresh colors, layering options, novelty and fashion.
Each of our monthly merchandised collections includes approximately 40% new
styles, which provides a consistent flow of fresh product.

Channel. We operate an omni-channel platform that delivers a seamless experience
to our customer wherever and whenever she chooses to shop across our website,
retail stores and catalog. Driven by our direct-to-consumer heritage, we have a
highly profitable omni-channel platform that is well-diversified across our
direct and retail channels. As of January 28, 2017, our retail store portfolio
consists of 275 stores in 43 states. Of these stores, 273 are full-price
locations averaging approximately 3,750 square feet, with approximately half of
our stores located in lifestyle centers and approximately half in premium malls.
Our stores have produced strong and consistent performance, with 98% of our
full-price locations generating positive 4-wall contribution in pro forma fiscal
year 2015. Our new store openings have produced an average payback of
approximately two years. We introduced a new store design in 2013 that showcases
our brand concept and elevates, yet simplifies the J.Jill shopping experience.
Within our direct channel, E-commerce represented 88% of net sales for the
twelve months ended October 29, 2016 and catalog orders represented 12% of net
sales for the twelve months ended October 29, 2016. Our website provides
customers with continuous access to the entire J.Jill product offering and
features rich content, including updates on new collections and guidance on how
to wear and wardrobe our styles, as well as the ability to chat live with a
customer service representative. We produce 25 annual editions of our catalog
and circulated 57 million copies in 2015. Our catalog, combined with an
increased investment in online marketing, drives customer acquisition and
engagement across all of our channels. Our omni-channel approach allows us to
drive customer response and purchasing behavior in all channels.
---

We were originally organized as Jill Intermediate LLC, a Delaware limited
liability company, in February 2011. On February 24, 2017, we completed
transactions pursuant to which we converted into a Delaware corporation and
changed our name to J.Jill, Inc. Our principal executive office is located at 4
Batterymarch Park, Quincy, MA 02169, and our telephone number is (617) 376-4300.
Our website address is www.jjill.com.

If this is your company...



We may be able to find you a more suitable carrier for your business insurance.  We have extensive data on carriers, their coverage, and company rates.  Rather than having an agent sell you, why not find which carrier is best for your business and approach them?  Contact Us to see if there is a better fit for your business.  We are not insurance agents, and are not trying to sell you anything.  We will simply tell you some carriers that may be better suited, and suggest agents in your area.

What is an Experience Mod Rating?



The Mod Rating is one of the two most important factors that effect a carrier's premium for workers comp insurance.  Each business in a state is provided a mod rating by the state's rating bureau which is a reflection of the amount of workers comp claims they have had.  If someone has an accident at work, your mod rating will increase and so will your premium.

What is an LCM?



A Loss Cost Multiplier, or LCM, is a rating for an insurance carrier that reflects their overhead in providing coverage for workers comp insurance.  It is one of the two main ratings that effect an insurance premium.  You are more likely to get a better premium from a carrier with a lower LCM, so it is important to know what your carrier's LCM is.  While a premium is generally the result of a formula, carriers are able to deviate plus or minus 25% from that formula.
