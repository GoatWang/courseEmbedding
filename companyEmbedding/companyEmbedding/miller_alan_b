Early years[edit]
Miller was born in Brooklyn, New York City, New York on August 17, 1937. His father owned a dry cleaner store and his mother worked for a millinery company. As a youth, Miller was active in sports but also worked after-school jobs as a delivery clerk for a grocery store and for Western Union.[3]
Miller is six foot-five inch height, and basketball skills helped lead his high school team to an undefeated season and a New York City championship in 1954. He received a full scholarship to the University of Utah.[3]
Military service[edit]
While he was in college, Miller joined the U.S. Army Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC), and was commissioned as a Captain in the U.S. Army and served in the 77th Infantry Division after he completed his education.
Early career[edit]
Miller began his career in the advertising industry at Young & Rubicam in New York, one of the industry’s largest advertising agencies. As the agency’s youngest vice president, Miller learned about entrepreneurship and risk-taking as he worked with his clients. For example, while he was at Y&R, Miller was instrumental in developing one of the first nationally syndicated television programs, a show called “Cooking With Graham Kerr.”
When his former Wharton roommate came to him in 1969 with an idea for a business, Miller decided to leave the advertising industry for a new venture. His new company, called American Medicorp, would build privately owned hospitals in high growth areas—such as California, Nevada, Texas and Florida—that had few hospitals.
Four years later, in 1973, the company was in financial trouble and Miller’s partner had left the company. Miller took over as CEO of American Medicorp and engineered a turnaround that brought attention within the healthcare industry. American Medicorp became the target of a hostile takeover by Humana in 1978.[3]
Faced with losing the company, Miller fought Humana’s takeover bid. While he was ultimately not able to thwart the takeover, he did force Humana to raise the price it paid for American Medicorp, and generated additional money for all company shareholders.

Career[edit]
As his college athletics had taught him, Miller knew that whenever he got knocked down, the best thing he could do was get back up and start over. So the day after he lost American Medicorp to a hostile takeover, Alan B. Miller started a new company in the same industry. The new company was called Universal Health Services, Inc. (UHS) and was started with funding from venture capitalists, along with money put up by himself and several former American Medicorp employees who decided to follow Miller into his new venture.
Following the same formula for success that had helped him rebuild American Medicorp, Miller has transformed Universal Health Services, Inc. from a start-up company that had six employees and zero revenue in 1979 into a Fortune 500 company that is one of the nation’s largest healthcare corporations. The company currently owns more than 240 acute care hospitals, behavioral health facilities and ambulatory units,[4] has more than 74,000 employees[5] and generates annual revenues of more than $9.0 billion.[6]
Current position[edit]
Universal Health Services, Inc., has consistently been among the healthcare industry’s top performers. For example, in the face of a slowing national economy and difficult conditions in the healthcare industry, UHS recorded all-time high earnings results.
The company has consistently been a top performer on Wall Street and was named the Top Healthcare Provider by Fortune in 2003 for its compounded 20-percent annual growth from 1992 to 2002. UHS has also been named to the Forbes magazine Platinum 400 list of best large companies in America for profitability and growth.
Miller has said that he makes integrity and ethics a foundation for himself and the company he runs. “I believe that reputation is one of the most important assets for any business and should be guarded carefully,” he says. “While it takes a lifetime to build a good reputation, it can vanish overnight.”
In addition to his work with UHS, Miller serves on the boards of directors of The Penn Mutual Life Insurance Company and Broadlane.
Key civic affiliations and known philanthropic activities[edit]
Throughout his career, Alan Miller has been an ardent supporter of education for students of all economic backgrounds. He served on the executive board of the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, and is currently a member of The Board of Overseers of the internationally known business school.
He has served as a trustee of The College of William & Mary Endowment Fund and is a life member of the college's President's Council. In 2007, the College of William & Mary announced the creation of the Alan B. Miller Entrepreneurship Center in recognition of Miller's extensive support for his alma mater. The center, as well as the entire Mason School of Business at the College of William & Mary, will be housed in the new Alan B. Miller Hall. Miller has also served as trustee of the William & Mary Endowment Fund and Is a life member of the school's President's Council.
In addition to his work with the business school at the College of William & Mary, Miller also funded the construction of the campus gymnasium and established liberal arts and basketball scholarships to honor his parents, Mary and Manuel. Miller's involvement is not limited to colleges where he studied. For example, when the University of South Carolina Aiken needed help persuading the state legislature to fund the construction of a new building for its nursing school, he provided a significant financial gift that made it possible to get the remainder of the money it needed from the state of South Carolina. Today, the Alan B. Miller Nursing Building stands on the campus as a reminder of Alan's spirit of community involvement. In 1995 Miller received an Honorary Doctorate in Business Administration from the University of South Carolina Aiken.
He has also served as the chairman of the Philadelphia United Negro College Fund Corporate Campaign, and received that organizations Chairman's Award in 1996. The Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, an organization in which he was active for years, has also honored Miller.

Early years[edit]
Miller was born in Brooklyn, New York City, New York on August 17, 1937. His father owned a dry cleaner store and his mother worked for a millinery company. As a youth, Miller was active in sports but also worked after-school jobs as a delivery clerk for a grocery store and for Western Union.[3]
Miller is six foot-five inch height, and basketball skills helped lead his high school team to an undefeated season and a New York City championship in 1954. He received a full scholarship to the University of Utah.[3]
Military service[edit]
While he was in college, Miller joined the U.S. Army Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC), and was commissioned as a Captain in the U.S. Army and served in the 77th Infantry Division after he completed his education.

Early years[edit]
Miller was born in Brooklyn, New York City, New York on August 17, 1937. His father owned a dry cleaner store and his mother worked for a millinery company. As a youth, Miller was active in sports but also worked after-school jobs as a delivery clerk for a grocery store and for Western Union.[3]
Miller is six foot-five inch height, and basketball skills helped lead his high school team to an undefeated season and a New York City championship in 1954. He received a full scholarship to the University of Utah.[3]
Military service[edit]
While he was in college, Miller joined the U.S. Army Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC), and was commissioned as a Captain in the U.S. Army and served in the 77th Infantry Division after he completed his education.
Early career[edit]
Miller began his career in the advertising industry at Young & Rubicam in New York, one of the industry’s largest advertising agencies. As the agency’s youngest vice president, Miller learned about entrepreneurship and risk-taking as he worked with his clients. For example, while he was at Y&R, Miller was instrumental in developing one of the first nationally syndicated television programs, a show called “Cooking With Graham Kerr.”
When his former Wharton roommate came to him in 1969 with an idea for a business, Miller decided to leave the advertising industry for a new venture. His new company, called American Medicorp, would build privately owned hospitals in high growth areas—such as California, Nevada, Texas and Florida—that had few hospitals.
Four years later, in 1973, the company was in financial trouble and Miller’s partner had left the company. Miller took over as CEO of American Medicorp and engineered a turnaround that brought attention within the healthcare industry. American Medicorp became the target of a hostile takeover by Humana in 1978.[3]
Faced with losing the company, Miller fought Humana’s takeover bid. While he was ultimately not able to thwart the takeover, he did force Humana to raise the price it paid for American Medicorp, and generated additional money for all company shareholders.

Career[edit]
As his college athletics had taught him, Miller knew that whenever he got knocked down, the best thing he could do was get back up and start over. So the day after he lost American Medicorp to a hostile takeover, Alan B. Miller started a new company in the same industry. The new company was called Universal Health Services, Inc. (UHS) and was started with funding from venture capitalists, along with money put up by himself and several former American Medicorp employees who decided to follow Miller into his new venture.
Following the same formula for success that had helped him rebuild American Medicorp, Miller has transformed Universal Health Services, Inc. from a start-up company that had six employees and zero revenue in 1979 into a Fortune 500 company that is one of the nation’s largest healthcare corporations. The company currently owns more than 240 acute care hospitals, behavioral health facilities and ambulatory units,[4] has more than 74,000 employees[5] and generates annual revenues of more than $9.0 billion.[6]
Current position[edit]
Universal Health Services, Inc., has consistently been among the healthcare industry’s top performers. For example, in the face of a slowing national economy and difficult conditions in the healthcare industry, UHS recorded all-time high earnings results.
The company has consistently been a top performer on Wall Street and was named the Top Healthcare Provider by Fortune in 2003 for its compounded 20-percent annual growth from 1992 to 2002. UHS has also been named to the Forbes magazine Platinum 400 list of best large companies in America for profitability and growth.
Miller has said that he makes integrity and ethics a foundation for himself and the company he runs. “I believe that reputation is one of the most important assets for any business and should be guarded carefully,” he says. “While it takes a lifetime to build a good reputation, it can vanish overnight.”
In addition to his work with UHS, Miller serves on the boards of directors of The Penn Mutual Life Insurance Company and Broadlane.

Early years[edit]
Miller was born in Brooklyn, New York City, New York on August 17, 1937. His father owned a dry cleaner store and his mother worked for a millinery company. As a youth, Miller was active in sports but also worked after-school jobs as a delivery clerk for a grocery store and for Western Union.[3]
Miller is six foot-five inch height, and basketball skills helped lead his high school team to an undefeated season and a New York City championship in 1954. He received a full scholarship to the University of Utah.[3]
Military service[edit]
While he was in college, Miller joined the U.S. Army Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC), and was commissioned as a Captain in the U.S. Army and served in the 77th Infantry Division after he completed his education.
Early career[edit]
Miller began his career in the advertising industry at Young & Rubicam in New York, one of the industry’s largest advertising agencies. As the agency’s youngest vice president, Miller learned about entrepreneurship and risk-taking as he worked with his clients. For example, while he was at Y&R, Miller was instrumental in developing one of the first nationally syndicated television programs, a show called “Cooking With Graham Kerr.”
When his former Wharton roommate came to him in 1969 with an idea for a business, Miller decided to leave the advertising industry for a new venture. His new company, called American Medicorp, would build privately owned hospitals in high growth areas—such as California, Nevada, Texas and Florida—that had few hospitals.
Four years later, in 1973, the company was in financial trouble and Miller’s partner had left the company. Miller took over as CEO of American Medicorp and engineered a turnaround that brought attention within the healthcare industry. American Medicorp became the target of a hostile takeover by Humana in 1978.[3]
Faced with losing the company, Miller fought Humana’s takeover bid. While he was ultimately not able to thwart the takeover, he did force Humana to raise the price it paid for American Medicorp, and generated additional money for all company shareholders.

Career[edit]
As his college athletics had taught him, Miller knew that whenever he got knocked down, the best thing he could do was get back up and start over. So the day after he lost American Medicorp to a hostile takeover, Alan B. Miller started a new company in the same industry. The new company was called Universal Health Services, Inc. (UHS) and was started with funding from venture capitalists, along with money put up by himself and several former American Medicorp employees who decided to follow Miller into his new venture.
Following the same formula for success that had helped him rebuild American Medicorp, Miller has transformed Universal Health Services, Inc. from a start-up company that had six employees and zero revenue in 1979 into a Fortune 500 company that is one of the nation’s largest healthcare corporations. The company currently owns more than 240 acute care hospitals, behavioral health facilities and ambulatory units,[4] has more than 74,000 employees[5] and generates annual revenues of more than $9.0 billion.[6]
Current position[edit]
Universal Health Services, Inc., has consistently been among the healthcare industry’s top performers. For example, in the face of a slowing national economy and difficult conditions in the healthcare industry, UHS recorded all-time high earnings results.
The company has consistently been a top performer on Wall Street and was named the Top Healthcare Provider by Fortune in 2003 for its compounded 20-percent annual growth from 1992 to 2002. UHS has also been named to the Forbes magazine Platinum 400 list of best large companies in America for profitability and growth.
Miller has said that he makes integrity and ethics a foundation for himself and the company he runs. “I believe that reputation is one of the most important assets for any business and should be guarded carefully,” he says. “While it takes a lifetime to build a good reputation, it can vanish overnight.”
In addition to his work with UHS, Miller serves on the boards of directors of The Penn Mutual Life Insurance Company and Broadlane.
Key civic affiliations and known philanthropic activities[edit]
Throughout his career, Alan Miller has been an ardent supporter of education for students of all economic backgrounds. He served on the executive board of the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, and is currently a member of The Board of Overseers of the internationally known business school.
He has served as a trustee of The College of William & Mary Endowment Fund and is a life member of the college's President's Council. In 2007, the College of William & Mary announced the creation of the Alan B. Miller Entrepreneurship Center in recognition of Miller's extensive support for his alma mater. The center, as well as the entire Mason School of Business at the College of William & Mary, will be housed in the new Alan B. Miller Hall. Miller has also served as trustee of the William & Mary Endowment Fund and Is a life member of the school's President's Council.
In addition to his work with the business school at the College of William & Mary, Miller also funded the construction of the campus gymnasium and established liberal arts and basketball scholarships to honor his parents, Mary and Manuel. Miller's involvement is not limited to colleges where he studied. For example, when the University of South Carolina Aiken needed help persuading the state legislature to fund the construction of a new building for its nursing school, he provided a significant financial gift that made it possible to get the remainder of the money it needed from the state of South Carolina. Today, the Alan B. Miller Nursing Building stands on the campus as a reminder of Alan's spirit of community involvement. In 1995 Miller received an Honorary Doctorate in Business Administration from the University of South Carolina Aiken.
He has also served as the chairman of the Philadelphia United Negro College Fund Corporate Campaign, and received that organizations Chairman's Award in 1996. The Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, an organization in which he was active for years, has also honored Miller.
A lover of the opera, Miller is chairman emeritus of the Opera Company of Philadelphia and also serves as a director of the Kimmel Center for the Performing Arts in Philadelphia.
Awards[edit]
In April 1999, Miller received the first Lifetime Achievement Award from the Federation of American Hospitals in recognition of his work. Miller also received the FAHS Award for leadership in 1978. He was named Master Entrepreneur of the Year in 1991, an award sponsored by Ernst & Young and Merrill Lynch, and Financial World magazine listed him among the Outstanding 1000 CEOs in 1995 and 1996. He has also been one of Modern Healthcare magazine’s "100 Most Powerful People in Healthcare" every year since 2003.
In 1992, he was awarded an Honorary Doctorate from the University of South Carolina, and was awarded the Ellis Island Medal of Honor in recognition of his "exceptional humanitarian efforts and outstanding contributions to the country" through healthcare.

She knows my history, which in turn makes my current medical needs easier to diagnosis/treat. Did You Know?Physicians and surgeons help to keep people - from infants to the elderly - as healthy as possible. These individuals provide diagnoses and treatments for a wide variety of ailments, and preventative care and early detection for more serious illnesses. Whether you love or hate going to the doctor, the fact is your physician is there to listen to your health concerns, take preventative measures against diseases and advise you on your options for staying in tip-top shape.In 2013, there were more than 1 million doctors of medicine in the U.S., over 854,000 of which were active. Additionally, in 2012, there were about 18,000 active general surgeons in the country. It's important to know which type of physician or surgeon you need, how to choose the best one, and account for other considerations in order to stay healthy.Different Types of PhysiciansPatients can choose from a wide variety of physicians depending on doctor specialty and what problems they are experiencing. Here are a few of the most common types of physicians that you may see in your lifetime:General Practitioner
Your GP is the doctor that you go to for regular checkups, vaccines and to identify health issues. GPs can treat many different illnesses and injuries, from the common cold to a broken arm. If your health requires a second opinion or expert care, the GP will refer you to a specialist who has the skills to focus in on the issue.Cardiologist
Heart attacks and heart disease are some of the most common afflictions seen across the country, making cardiologists important to your long-term health. These physicians specialize in studying and treating the heart and related diseases.Dentist
Other than a GP, the dentist is likely the most common physician you'll ever see. These professionals work with the human mouth, ensuring that your teeth and gum health are up to par. Patients typically go to the dentist twice a year.Dermatologist
Dermatologists are focused on skin-related issues and diseases, from skin cancers, to acute acne, eczema, psoriasis, and general cosmetic concerns like aging and scars. Most will also perform annual or semi-annual mole checks to screen for any signs of melanoma, the most serious form of skin cancer.ENT
If you have a number of sinus infections or have had your tonsils taken out, you've likely seen an ENT specialist. ENTs handle ailments related to the ear, nose and throat, often related to taking out tonsils and treating hearing issues.OB/GYN
For many women, their gynecologist and obstetrician are the same person. These professionals work with the female reproductive system to focus on reproductive health, fertility issues, prenatal care, options for new and expectant mothers, neonatal care and childbirth. OB/GYNs can also help in the early detection of breast or cervical cancer.Choosing a PhysicianThere are obviously a number of physicians that you can choose from, but how do you know if they're the best choice for you? Here are a few considerations to help you pick a physician:Look at Your Insurance
Before you get down to the details, you need to verify which doctors are covered by your insurance and whether they are in or out of your carrier's network. Rates may be cheaper if the doc is in network – a doctor can be covered by your insurance but not necessarily in network. Out of network is typically more expensive. Doctors often add and drop plans, so it's important to ensure that your options are compatible with your insurance plan. Doing your homework will help you avoid unexpected expenses. Check for Board Certification
Your physician should be certified through the American Board of Medical Specialties. Doctors must earn a medical degree from a qualified school, complete three to seven years of residency training, be licensed by a state medical board and pass one or more ABMS exams to be certified.Examine the Reviews
Reviews of a doctor can reveal a lot about what your experience may be like. People may grade on staff friendliness, availability and effectiveness of treatment. Looking at these evaluations and getting recommendations from family and friends can direct you toward a physician for your needs.Choosing a SurgeonSurgeons can literally hold your life in their hands, and it's important to find the best one that can put you at ease and treat you effectivelyCompatibility Factor
You need to feel comfortable with your surgeon. It's important to communicate your concerns and that your surgeon can respond adequately. Surgeons should be willing to go over the details of your procedure and answer any questions that you may have. They must take the time to discuss and address your worries.Expertise Level
If you're going in for surgery, you want someone that knows what they're doing and has a high success rate. Ask how often the surgeon performs this surgery and try to find one that regularly does it. This will give you peace of mind that you're in capable hands.Understanding Your InsuranceYour decision on a physician or surgeon can be majorly affected by the insurance plan you have. You may have insurance through employment, your spouse, your parents if you're under 26, or the marketplace if the previous options don't apply to you. It's important to understand how your insurance works to have the full picture of what you'll need to pay for.Your insurance will have a deductible, which is the amount that you're responsible to pay for covered medical expenses. Some plans have coinsurances, where you must pay a certain percentage of the bill, and insurance will cover the rest. Co-pays state a flat rate for certain services, like paying $20 when you visit your GP or a $100 co-pay for an emergency room visit. Once you reach your out-of-pocket maximum, which will differ if you're an individual or within a family plan, your insurance may pay for 100 percent of covered medical expenses for the rest of the plan year.If you plan to go to the doctor, need medication or have been recommended for surgery, call your insurance provider or go online to see what your plan covers. You can choose the best doctor for your needs, understand your options and prevent yourself from being blindsided by medical expenses.Setting Your AppointmentMost doctors require a phone call for an appointment, although some may provide online scheduling as well. Be sure to have your insurance card with you when you set an appointment, and to bring it with you to the actual appointment. They need the ID numbers to verify your coverage, and will usually make a copy of the card for their files so you don't have to show it again unless your insurance changes.When you call, let them know if you're a new patient, as this will require you to complete some paperwork for your first visit. Tell them the reason for your visit, such as your symptoms if you're feeling sick. It's also important to inform them if you have Medicaid and to find out if you need to bring anything to the visit, like current medications or medical records.From here, the receptionist will likely ask what dates and times work best for you. During your call, it's important to be honest about your symptoms and the reason for your visit. This information will help the doctor treat you and give him or her an idea of what to expect. Your appointment may progress faster as a result, and the doctor can come prepared with a list of options to better care for you.RisksDoctors see a number of patients in a day, sometimes in 15-minute increments in areas where the physicians are in high demand. This can leave little time for doctors to perform thorough examinations, and they can end up missing certain problem indicators. While some problems, like a cold or flu, can be diagnosed in this time, more complex ailments require attention, which takes up time. Reviews can illuminate which doctors actively spend the necessary time with their patients and which ones are pressed against the clock to meet demand.Surgery has some more dire risks attached to it, so be sure to talk to your surgeon about the potential issues that can come up as a result of your procedure. If a patient has a reaction to anesthesia, it can cause very serious complications, but this is an uncommon occurrence. Blood clots can be a significant problem after surgery, often caused by inactivity during recovery. Infections, numbness, scarring, swelling and death are all possible, but the likelihood of these issues will vary depending on the type of surgery you're undergoing. Talk to your doctor about your concerns and your risk potential.AftercareSurgery affects people in different ways, but as you begin to emerge from anesthesia, you'll want to alert your nurse to any issues you may have. The nurse will tell you how the procedure went, what effect it will have on your condition, what to expect when you get home and how long it will take to get back to normal. If you start feeling pain, the nurse may give you medication to stop it from getting worse. When possible, it's also advised to move around to avoid blood clots from developing in your legs. This can be as simple as occasionally flexing your knee or rotating your foot. Some surgeries are outpatient procedures, where people are released the same day. For major surgeries, patients may stay at the hospital for a few days to be monitored and address any concerns before being sent home. Discuss with your surgeon the projected length of the hospital stay and what you need to bring.Recovery and Follow-upYour recovery time and follow-up expectations will vary depending on your procedure. For example, you can be expected to be on your feet within a few days of having your wisdom teeth taken out, but it may be weeks before you have fully recovered from a broken foot or heart-valve surgery. Your surgeon will give you a list of things that you'll need to do during this time, including what medications to take and when you'll be able to get back to work and other activities.Every surgery will have a follow-up call or appointment to discuss your recovery and allow you to ask any questions about unusual symptoms or changes in your overall health. If you have a major operation, like heart surgery, it's important to make regular checkups with your doctor or a specialist to ensure that everything is normal. Visiting a doctor will help deter infection and verify that everything is healing as expected. These appointments will give you peace of mind about your state of health and ensure that any issues are caught early on.
