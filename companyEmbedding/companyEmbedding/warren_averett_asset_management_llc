Family Office


Helping high performing families reach higher.
Warren Averett Family Office manages your investment portfolio, estate planning, real estate, staff and other provisions for you and your family. We are your family’s CFO—coordinating your day-to-day accounting, payroll, taxes, bill payment, charitable giving and succession planning. The more we do for you, the more time you gain to pursue your passions and interests, and the less you have to worry about. Advising on assets in excess of $1.7 billion, Warren Averett Asset Management is a smart family office choice for smart families. We are affiliated with Warren Averett, one of the largest CPA and Advisory firms in the Southeast. We are able to leverage a wealth of tax and financial services experience to provide unique solutions to meet your family’s needs.
WHY WE SERVE
With one team, you can protect your wealth through comprehensive planning and risk management, make an impact through philanthropy planning, live life to the fullest with a personal financial team behind you, and leave a legacy through family education, estate and  succession planning. An old proverb says that there are but three generations from shirt-sleeves to shirt-sleeves. Research suggests that for the overwhelming majority of families with a net worth in excess of $25 million, their wealth is consumed before the third generation receives its benefit. Whether your family’s wealth is derived from a significant liquidity event, through generational wealth building or as a result of an ultra-high earner (professional athlete, corporate executive, etc.), Warren Averett Family Office aims to educate future generations and design a plan that will have a lasting impact.
HOW WE DELIVER
Your dedicated Warren Averett Family Office team includes at least two senior advisors and a family coordinator. Our team coordinates the delivery of customized services—calling on team members from Certified Financial Planners (CFP) and Chartered Financial Analysts (CFA) to Certified Public Accountants (CPA) and attorneys (JD). We have only a select number of Family Office clients, so that we can provide each client highly personalized attention.
SERVICES INCLUDE (but are not limited to)

Asset Management
Estate, Tax & Financial Planning
Client Education & Family Meetings
Philanthropy Planning
Concierge Services
Cash Flow Management & Recordkeeping
Risk Management Review

Please click the “Related Professionals” link for a listing of our Family Office advisors.
Please Note: The scope of the services to be provided depends upon the needs of the client and the terms of the engagement.

Reward your Employees


Preparing employees for a better retirement can help your company improve employee performance and build an attractive, competitive workplace.
If you ask business leaders, “What makes a company competitive?” their response will almost always be “people.” Your employees are the cornerstone and lifeblood of your organization. They satisfy your customers, drive revenue and support your business goals. Shouldn’t they have the peace of mind that comes with having a financially secure retirement?
Offering a defined-benefit plan or a defined-contribution plan is a great way to reward employees for a job well done. It can also help you attract and retain qualified personnel to improve your company’s competitive advantage and profitability. No matter what your goals for employee retirement planning, Warren Averett can help.
401(k) Complete
With 401(k) Complete, our comprehensive retirement planning solution, we offer organizations a single solution for all of their bundled retirement services, including:

Benefits administration
Consulting services
Retirement investment advice

We can help you increase employee plan contributions, develop a recordkeeping system, provide plan information to employees and navigate your investment options, all while minimizing your liability and expenses.
When you take care of the people who take care of your customers, everybody wins.
