PRICING OPTIONS






PDF Set$3515.00
A full set of construction drawings in an electronic format provides many advantages over printed blueprint packages and reproducible masters.  You can make multiple copies at a local copy center using the paper size your choice.  If you need to make modifications, a design professional can do so typically the same way a reproducible master would be modified.  The PDF File Set can be emailed directly to you - often the same day or within 1 business day of your order. Purchase of this PDF File Set constitutes a license to build a single house only.





CAD Set$4995.00
For use by design professionals. This file includes one copy of all CAD files for your house plan. This allows for more extensive plan modifications and enables the desginer/architect to begin working from the existing file rather than redraw the plan. The cost for the CAD file offsets some of the labor costs a designer would charge if the plan were redrawn. Purchase of this CAD File constitutes a license to build a single house only.

What's included in this plan set
See a sample plan set

Cover Sheet:  The cover sheet features an elevation of the home, sheet number index for the plan, and contact information.

Foundation:  These drawings will detail and illustrate the foundation of the home, exterior and interior footings to support the floors and structure above.  If a basement is purchased, it will show the stairs, bearing walls, and basement windows and doors.

First Floor Plan:  This page is drawn to ¼”=1’-0” scale and includes exterior dimensions to build the home.  The notes are precise directions for your builder.  Important features such as built-ins, niches, and appliances are noted.  Doors and windows are identified and specific sizing can be found on window and door schedules. *Framing is not included.

Second Floor Plan:  The second floor includes stair details.  Often the reflective roof detail is shown legibly over the second floor plan.  This is helpful for the framing contractor. *Framing is not included.

Lighting and Electrical:  On this sheet you have a schematic of the lights, electrical plugs, phone location, and code items such as smoke detectors.  It is common place to build with your builder and/or electrician before the work starts to review this plan.  Careful planning can make your home special and convenient for your family.

Second Floor Lighting:  The same details as provided for the first floor.

Front and Rear Elevations:  The front and rear elevations may be on separate pages depending on the size of the house.  This page comes with exterior dimensions and notes required to complete construction.  This is where the windows, doors, and interior trim details are illustrated, as well as wall heights, roof pitches and ridge heights.

Right and Left Elevations:  The right and left elevations provide the same details as the front and rear elevations.

Roof Plan:  This drawing, usually at ¼”=1’-0” scale, will be a bird’s eye view of the home.  It will show the ridges, hips, and valleys.  This page will show a beautifully designed roof.*Framing is not included.

Cross-Sections:  Sections are used to further describe any architectural intent necessary for the builder or framer.  This drawing will illustrate important changes in the floor, ceiling, and roof heights.

Cabinet Elevations*:  Cabinet elevations are provided with your plans, and like the electrical plan, they are mainly a guide for estimating purposes.  Cabinets are an area that is easy to customize and your builder or cabinet maker will work with you early on in the process to ensure that the correct cabinets are specified.  Archival Designs believes cabinets should reflect your taste and budget. After framing and sheet rock installation sizes of walls may change slightly.  The cabinet maker must take as built measurements to properly size your cabinets. **NOTE: The majority of house plans will include cabinet elevations in construction set; however, not all will include.

General Notes:  Separate sheets that provide standard construction notes, in addition included are the details required to comply with International Residential Code (IRC)  & Southern Building Code (SBC).

Important Information



  All sales on house plans and customization/modifications are final. No refunds or exchanges can be given once your order has started the fulfillment process.


  All house plans from Houseplans are designed to conform to the local codes when and where the original house was constructed.


  In addition to the house plans you order, you may also need a site plan that shows where the house is going to be located on the property. You might also need beams sized to accommodate roof loads specific to your region. Your home builder can usually help you with this. You may also need a septic design unless your lot is served by a sanitary sewer system. Many areas now have area-specific energy codes that also have to be followed. This normally involves filling out a simple form providing documentation that your house plans are in compliance.


  In some regions, there is a second step you will need to take to insure your house plans are in compliance with local codes. Some areas of North America have very strict engineering requirements. Examples of this would be, but not limited to, earthquake-prone areas of California and the Pacific Coast, hurricane risk areas of the Florida, Gulf & Carolina Coasts. New York, New Jersey, Nevada, and parts of Illinois require review by a local professional as well. If you are building in these areas, it is most likely you will need to hire a state licensed structural engineer to analyze the design and provide additional drawings and calculations required by your building department. If you aren’t sure, building departments typically have a handout they will give you listing all of the items they require to submit for and obtain a building permit.


  Additionally, stock plans do not have a professional stamp attached. If your building department requires one, they will only accept a stamp from a professional licensed in the state where you plan to build. In this case, you will need to take your house plans to a local engineer or architect for review and stamping. In addition, plans which are used to construct homes in Nevada are required to be drawn by a licensed Nevada architect.

Best Price Policy



  Some of our plans are also available on other websites and in printed catalogs. We are committed to selling these plans at or below the lowest price available elsewhere. If you find a regularly priced plan (not “on-sale”) for a lower price, we'll beat the advertised price by 5%. We will match the price for any on-sale plans.


  Once our staff is able to verify that the same plan is offered at a lower published price, Houseplans will offer the plan for sale at the lower published price less 5%. Our discount is available for immediate plan purchase only. Please call us at 1-800-913-2350.


  The advertised item must be the same plan as the product being purchased, including set type (5-copy, 8-copy, Reproducible, or CAD Set), foundation options, and any miscellaneous details. Advertised prices must be in the same currency that the original product was purchased in. Our Price Guarantee does not apply to advertising errors or misprints, special prices, restricted offers, mail order offers, rebates, coupons, premiums, free or bonus offers, OEM products, limited or minimum quantity or limited time offers, close-outs, liquidations, clearances, and special financing offers.
