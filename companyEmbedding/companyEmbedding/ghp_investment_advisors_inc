 Many of our clients use the tax services of GHP Horwath, P.C. The tax professionals at GHP Horwath are just down the hall from us, so it is all integrated. With us, your investment advisor really does talk to your accountant.



Portfolio Management–
Take Control of Your Wealth
“WHAT ABOUT the things that keep me up at night? Like will my family be secure even if the market isn’t?” Once we have created your comprehensive financial plan, we begin our rigorous portfolio management process.
First, we customize a portfolio strategy based on your plan, focusing on long-term returns while being keenly aware of short-term market volatility (which can be hard to predict) and the fundamental relationship between your potential risk and reward. In developing your investment strategy, we take into account a number of factors including your investment goals, time horizon, liquidity needs, risk tolerance, tax impact, economic conditions, and international exposure.

Our investment strategy and distinct investment philosophy are based on a custom asset allocation model that spreads your risks over principally four asset types: fixed income securities, real estate investment trusts (REITs), U.S. equities and international equities .
Then, we help you choose from a wide range of investment options. Since we are independent, we are free to consider all of the thousands of investment alternatives available today — and tomorrow.
Once your portfolio is invested, we provide Financial Concierge Services to help you manage your assets — and perhaps something even more valuable — your time.

Diverse Experience – All Under One Roof
To understand who we are and what makes us different, we think you need to get to know us. Here is our story, as told by Brian Friedman, GHP Investment Advisors (GHPIA) President.
“It was the mid-1980s, and CPAs Robert Hochstadt and Steven Levey had been offering comprehensive financial plans for their clients for years. Their firm, Gelfond Hochstadt Pangburn, P.C., now called GHP Horwath, P.C., had become one of the first accounting firms nationally to have a stand-alone financial planning division. Bob encouraged long-time friend and partner Steve to get accredited in all aspects of financial planning. Steve became one of the first CPAs in the U.S. to earn a Personal Financial Specialist (PFS) designation, and not long after that, Bob earned his PFS. While both had earned national recognition with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and had clients around the world, they did not like relying on commission-based stockbrokers to implement the investment portion of the plan. This is where I came in.
As a CFA charter holder with extensive experience in investment management and economic research, I was looking to combine my experience with a quality CPA firm. I had just read a Forbes Magazine article that featured Steve, and the firm of Gelfond Hochstadt Pangburn, P.C. and realized that I  knew Bob — he was a good friend of my father’s and I knew his oldest son growing up in Denver. I sought out Bob, and discovered that he and Steve had recently formed GHPIA and were ready to take it to the next level. All three of us were already thinking about the opportunity to create a comprehensive wealth management firm — so the timing could not have been more perfect. GHP had been offering financial planning services to its clients for years, so it had a decided advantage when CPA firms were allowed to also offer investment management services in the mid-1990s. I joined GHPIA in 1999 with Bob, Steve, and other GHP Horwath directors as my partners. The rest is history, or rather, history in the making.” — Brian

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
