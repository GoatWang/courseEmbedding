MAKING PAYROLL HUMAN







“I’m very pleased we made the switch from Paychex. I like the responsiveness of the entire ConnectPay team, and am saving a lots of money on Workers’ Comp insurance through your ConnectComp program”
Ed Penta, MCKINNON'S SUPERMARKET
 




“Everyone I deal with at ConnectPay is so patient and helps me navigate through any problems I’ve had doing manual checks for 3 years.
 
 
I like that I have flexibility with your service, like when I’m on vacation, I can’t have anyone in my office run payroll due to sensitivity, so it all gets done through ConnectPay’s back office support. 
Oh, and I’m so relieved that your system is very user friendly and that our taxes are done in a timely manner, even working directly with my bookkeeper.
Hannah Downing, QUINN & MORRIS, PC
 








“From the very beginning I’ve never had one payroll complaint from our accountant. My client service rep, Steve always knows what I’m talking about when I ask questions, which I do a lot. Actually everyone I’ve ever spoken to is knowledgeable and cheerful. ConnectPay must leave their bad moods at home.”
Anne Rosenthal, BROOKLINE PERIODONTAL ASSOCIATES
 




“When we transitioned to ConnectPay, I did not go along happily because I thought my situation was fine. Much to my surprise, Steve made my job so much easier. He took the time to learn about our office, provides various options to situations I’ve had, and never gave me the feeling that a question was unnecessary. He’s extremely patient and upbeat… I can not say enough good things about Steve and ConnectPay!”
Sharyn LaClair, PEDIATRIC DENTAL HEALTHCARE
 








“Over the years with ConnectPay, the checks come on time so I know what to expect. My dedicated rep Melissa has been on top of everything and responds immediately if I have a question, so I consider her a part of my inner circle.”
Mike Colombo, REAL LIVING REALTY GROUP
 




“I like not worrying about payroll and taxes anymore. We were with a large company and didn’t get the level of service we expected before moving to ConnectPay. Now it’s such a different experience because I feel like an important client when they take the time to call every week.”
Matt Kelly, THE PROPERTY MANAGERS

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
