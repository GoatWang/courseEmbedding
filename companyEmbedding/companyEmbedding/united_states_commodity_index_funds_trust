History[edit]
United States Commodity Funds LLC is an issuer of exchange traded commodity products (ETPs). It was founded in 2005 in Alameda, CA. The first fund it launched, in 2006, was United States Oil Fund, LP. USO was the first commodity ETF based on crude oil launched in the United States. USO was the fourth commodity ETP launched in the United States, after the SPDR Gold Shares Trust (ticker: GLD), the iShares COMEX Gold Trust (ticker: IAU), and the Powershares DB Commodity Index Fund (ticker: DBC).[2] USO is the largest and most actively traded oil-based ETP in the United States.[3]
In 2007, USCF launched United States Natural Gas Fund, LP, the first natural gas based ETP. UNG is the largest and most actively traded natural gas commodity ETP in the United States. USCF also launched the first gasoline based commodity ETP, United States Gasoline Fund, LP (ticker:UGA), and the first heating oil based commodity ETP, the United States Heating Oil Fund, LP, both in 2008. In 2010, USCF launched the first commodity ETP in the United States that invested in Brent crude oil (ticker:BNO), although previously a Brent crude oil based commodity ETP had been launched in London.[1]
In 2010, USCF launched its first non-energy specific commodity ETP, United States Commodity Index Fund (ticker:USCI), which holds a diversified basket of commodity futures based on the SummerHaven Dynamic Commodity Index ("SDCI"). The SDCI is the first broadly diversified commodity index whose commodity weightings are not fixed, but which instead are adjusted to reflect market conditions.[4]
USCF's commodity exchange traded products are all listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Prior to the merger of the American Stock Exchange with the New York Stock Exchange, all of USCF's products were listed for trading on the American Stock Exchange.[1]
On October 6, 2010, commodity index provider SummerHaven Index Management announced that USCF had licensed two new indexes from SummerHaven.[5]
Funds[edit]
The ETPs offered by USCF include eight single commodity funds, each based on an energy related commodity, and three commodity funds based on an indexes licensed by SummerHaven Index Management. The full listing of USCF funds is:

United States Oil Fund, LP (ticker: USO)
United States Natural Gas Fund, LP (ticker: UNG)

United States Commodity Funds LLC (USCF) is a US company based in Oakland, CA, specializing in managing exchange-traded commodity funds, which are often referred to as commodity-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs).[1] USCF was one of the earliest issuers of exchange-traded commodity funds in the United States. It is best known for launching in 2006 the first crude oil based exchange traded commodity fund in the United States, United States Oil Fund, LP (ticker: USO), as well as launching in 2007 the first natural gas exchange traded commodity fund, United States Natural Gas Fund, LP (ticker: UNG).[2] USO and UNG are two of the most actively traded ETFs in the United States.[3] As of June 30, 2016[update], USCF managed eleven different exchange traded commodity funds with total assets of approximately $5 billion.[1]

History[edit]
United States Commodity Funds LLC is an issuer of exchange traded commodity products (ETPs). It was founded in 2005 in Alameda, CA. The first fund it launched, in 2006, was United States Oil Fund, LP. USO was the first commodity ETF based on crude oil launched in the United States. USO was the fourth commodity ETP launched in the United States, after the SPDR Gold Shares Trust (ticker: GLD), the iShares COMEX Gold Trust (ticker: IAU), and the Powershares DB Commodity Index Fund (ticker: DBC).[2] USO is the largest and most actively traded oil-based ETP in the United States.[3]
In 2007, USCF launched United States Natural Gas Fund, LP, the first natural gas based ETP. UNG is the largest and most actively traded natural gas commodity ETP in the United States. USCF also launched the first gasoline based commodity ETP, United States Gasoline Fund, LP (ticker:UGA), and the first heating oil based commodity ETP, the United States Heating Oil Fund, LP, both in 2008. In 2010, USCF launched the first commodity ETP in the United States that invested in Brent crude oil (ticker:BNO), although previously a Brent crude oil based commodity ETP had been launched in London.[1]
In 2010, USCF launched its first non-energy specific commodity ETP, United States Commodity Index Fund (ticker:USCI), which holds a diversified basket of commodity futures based on the SummerHaven Dynamic Commodity Index ("SDCI"). The SDCI is the first broadly diversified commodity index whose commodity weightings are not fixed, but which instead are adjusted to reflect market conditions.[4]
USCF's commodity exchange traded products are all listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Prior to the merger of the American Stock Exchange with the New York Stock Exchange, all of USCF's products were listed for trading on the American Stock Exchange.[1]
On October 6, 2010, commodity index provider SummerHaven Index Management announced that USCF had licensed two new indexes from SummerHaven.[5]
Funds[edit]
The ETPs offered by USCF include eight single commodity funds, each based on an energy related commodity, and three commodity funds based on an indexes licensed by SummerHaven Index Management. The full listing of USCF funds is:

United States Oil Fund, LP (ticker: USO)
United States Natural Gas Fund, LP (ticker: UNG)
United States 12 Month Oil Fund, LP (ticker: USL)
United States Gasoline Fund, LP (ticker: UGA)
United States Heating Oil Fund, LP (ticker: UHN)
United States Short Oil Fund, LP (ticker: DNO)
United States 12 Month Natural Gas Fund, LP (ticker: UNL)
United States Brent Oil Fund, LP (ticker: BNO)
United States Commodity Index Fund (ticker: USCI)
United States Copper Index Fund (ticker: CPER)
United States Agricultural Index Fund (ticker: USAG)

United States Commodity Funds LLC (USCF) is a US company based in Oakland, CA, specializing in managing exchange-traded commodity funds, which are often referred to as commodity-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs).[1] USCF was one of the earliest issuers of exchange-traded commodity funds in the United States. It is best known for launching in 2006 the first crude oil based exchange traded commodity fund in the United States, United States Oil Fund, LP (ticker: USO), as well as launching in 2007 the first natural gas exchange traded commodity fund, United States Natural Gas Fund, LP (ticker: UNG).[2] USO and UNG are two of the most actively traded ETFs in the United States.[3] As of June 30, 2016[update], USCF managed eleven different exchange traded commodity funds with total assets of approximately $5 billion.[1]

History[edit]
United States Commodity Funds LLC is an issuer of exchange traded commodity products (ETPs). It was founded in 2005 in Alameda, CA. The first fund it launched, in 2006, was United States Oil Fund, LP. USO was the first commodity ETF based on crude oil launched in the United States. USO was the fourth commodity ETP launched in the United States, after the SPDR Gold Shares Trust (ticker: GLD), the iShares COMEX Gold Trust (ticker: IAU), and the Powershares DB Commodity Index Fund (ticker: DBC).[2] USO is the largest and most actively traded oil-based ETP in the United States.[3]
In 2007, USCF launched United States Natural Gas Fund, LP, the first natural gas based ETP. UNG is the largest and most actively traded natural gas commodity ETP in the United States. USCF also launched the first gasoline based commodity ETP, United States Gasoline Fund, LP (ticker:UGA), and the first heating oil based commodity ETP, the United States Heating Oil Fund, LP, both in 2008. In 2010, USCF launched the first commodity ETP in the United States that invested in Brent crude oil (ticker:BNO), although previously a Brent crude oil based commodity ETP had been launched in London.[1]
In 2010, USCF launched its first non-energy specific commodity ETP, United States Commodity Index Fund (ticker:USCI), which holds a diversified basket of commodity futures based on the SummerHaven Dynamic Commodity Index ("SDCI"). The SDCI is the first broadly diversified commodity index whose commodity weightings are not fixed, but which instead are adjusted to reflect market conditions.[4]
USCF's commodity exchange traded products are all listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Prior to the merger of the American Stock Exchange with the New York Stock Exchange, all of USCF's products were listed for trading on the American Stock Exchange.[1]
On October 6, 2010, commodity index provider SummerHaven Index Management announced that USCF had licensed two new indexes from SummerHaven.[5]
Funds[edit]
The ETPs offered by USCF include eight single commodity funds, each based on an energy related commodity, and three commodity funds based on an indexes licensed by SummerHaven Index Management. The full listing of USCF funds is:

United States Oil Fund, LP (ticker: USO)
United States Natural Gas Fund, LP (ticker: UNG)
United States 12 Month Oil Fund, LP (ticker: USL)
United States Gasoline Fund, LP (ticker: UGA)
United States Heating Oil Fund, LP (ticker: UHN)
United States Short Oil Fund, LP (ticker: DNO)
United States 12 Month Natural Gas Fund, LP (ticker: UNL)
United States Brent Oil Fund, LP (ticker: BNO)
United States Commodity Index Fund (ticker: USCI)
United States Copper Index Fund (ticker: CPER)
United States Agricultural Index Fund (ticker: USAG)

Overview of the Direxion Auspice Broad Commodity Strategy ETF | Direxion


























 






























The Easier, More Adaptive Way to Diversify with Commodities.
Most traditional commodity funds provide long only exposure to commodities. This limits their potential to contribute to a portfolio’s long-term performance because they only benefit if commodity prices rise.
Long-only commodity strategies have shown to be inconsistent over time because:

Commodity returns are typically cyclical and sporadic
Individual commodity sub-sectors tend to perform dissimilarly in different market environments
Significant draw-downs can be damaging to the long-term performance of a portfolio

Within the inherently volatile commodity markets, a long/flat approach is potentially more adaptive to whip-sawing market conditions.
Introducing The Direxion Auspice Broad Commodity Strategy ETF
The Direxion Auspice Broad Commodity Strategy ETF (Ticker: COM) allows investors to take advantage of rising commodity prices, in addition to mitigate risk by going flat (cash) when individual commodities are experiencing downward trends. It seeks to potentially provide commodity investment returns with lower risk characteristics than long-only commodity strategies.
The fund seeks to provide total return that exceeds that of the Auspice Broad Commodity Index over a complete market cycle. There is no guarantee the fund will meet its stated investment objectives.

* The Net Expense Ratio includes management fees, other operating expenses and Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses. If Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses were excluded, the Net Expense Ratio would be 0.70%. The Fund’s Adviser, Rafferty Asset Management, LLC (“Rafferty”), has entered into an Operating Expense Limitation Agreement with the Fund, under which Rafferty has contractually agreed to cap all or a portion of its management fee and/or reimburse the Fund for Other Expenses through September 1, 2018, to the extent that the Fund’s Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses exceed 0.70% of the Fund’s daily net assets other than the following: taxes, swap financing and related costs, acquired fund fees and expenses, dividends or interest on short positions, other interest expenses, brokerage commissions and extraordinary expenses. If these expenses were included, the expense ratio would be higher.
The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. For the most recent month-end performance please visit the funds website at www.direxioninvestments.com.
Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus.

 United States Commodity Index Funds Trust (Form: 424B3, Received: 05/01/2014 16:39:48) 












	Table of Contents





	Filed pursuant to Rule 424(b)(3)






	SEC File No. 333-187515






	PROSPECTUS






	United States Commodity Index Fund

	®

	*






	35,749,980 Shares






	*Principal U.S. Listing Exchange: NYSE Arca, Inc.





	The United States Commodity Index Fund (USCI), a series of the United States Commodity Index Funds Trust, is an exchange traded fund that issues shares that trade on the NYSE Arca stock
	exchange (NYSE Arca). USCIs investment objective is for the daily changes in percentage terms of its shares net asset value to reflect the daily changes in percentage terms of the SummerHaven Dynamic Commodity Index Total
	Return (the SDCI), less USCIs expenses. The SDCI is designed to reflect the performance of a diversified group of commodities. The SDCI is owned and maintained by SummerHaven Index Management, LLC, and calculated and published by
	Bloomberg, L.P. USCI pays its sponsor, United States Commodity Funds LLC (USCF), a limited liability company, a management fee and incurs operating costs. USCF and USCI are located at 1999 Harrison Street, Suite 1530, Oakland, CA 94612.
	The telephone number for both USCF and USCI is 510.522.9600. Currently, USCF employs SummerHaven Investment Management, LLC (SummerHaven), a limited liability company, as a commodity trading advisor to USCI. SummerHaven is located at
	1266 E. Main Street, Soundview Plaza, Fourth Floor, Stamford, CT 06902. SummerHavens telephone number is 203.352.2700. In order for a hypothetical investment in shares to break even over the next 12 months, assuming a selling price of $56.00
	(the price as of January 31, 2014), the investment would have to generate a 0.88% return or $0.49.




	USCI is an exchange
	traded fund. This means that most investors who decide to buy or sell shares of USCI place their trade orders through their brokers and may incur customary brokerage commissions and charges. Shares trade on the NYSE Arca under the ticker symbol
	USCI and are bought and sold throughout the trading day at bid and ask prices like other publicly traded securities.




	Shares trade on the NYSE Arca after they are initially purchased by Authorized Purchasers, institutional firms that purchase shares in blocks of 50,000 shares called baskets
	through USCIs marketing agent, ALPS Distributors, Inc. (the Marketing Agent). The price of a basket is equal to the net asset value of 50,000 shares on the day that the order to purchase the basket is accepted by the Marketing
	Agent. The offering of USCIs shares is a best efforts offering, which means that neither the Marketing Agent nor any Authorized Purchaser is required to purchase a specific number or dollar amount of shares. USCF pays the Marketing
	Agent a marketing fee consisting of a fixed annual amount plus an incentive fee based on the amount of shares sold. Authorized Purchasers will not receive from USCI, USCF or any of their affiliates any fee or other compensation in connection with
	the sale of shares. Aggregate compensation paid to the Marketing Agent and any affiliate of USCF for distribution-related services in connection with this offering of shares will not exceed 10% of the gross proceeds of the offering.




	Investors who buy or sell shares during the day from their broker may do so at a premium or discount relative to the market value of the
	underlying commodity futures contracts in which USCI invests due to supply and demand forces at work in the secondary trading market for shares that are closely related to, but not identical to, the same forces influencing the prices of the
	commodity futures contracts that serve as USCIs investment benchmark. Investing in USCI involves risks similar to those involved with an investment directly in the commodity market, the correlation risk described above, and other significant
	risks. See 

	Risk Factors Involved with an Investment in USCI

	 beginning on page 5.




	The offering of
	USCIs shares is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in accordance with the Securities Act of 1933 (the 1933 Act). The offering is intended to be a continuous offering and is not expected to
	terminate until all of the registered shares have been sold or three years from the date of the original offering, whichever is earlier, although the offering may be temporarily suspended if and when no suitable investments for USCI are available or
	practicable. USCI is not a mutual fund registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (1940 Act) and is not subject to regulation under such Act.





	NEITHER THE SEC NOR ANY STATE SECURITIES COMMISSION HAS APPROVED OR DISAPPROVED OF THE SECURITIES OFFERED IN THIS PROSPECTUS, OR DETERMINED IF THIS PROSPECTUS IS TRUTHFUL OR COMPLETE. ANY
	REPRESENTATION TO THE CONTRARY IS A CRIMINAL OFFENSE.





	USCI is a commodity pool and USCF is a commodity pool operator
	subject to regulation by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the National Futures Association (NFA) under the Commodities Exchange Act.





	THE COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING COMMISSION HAS NOT PASSED UPON THE MERITS OF PARTICIPATING IN THIS POOL NOR HAS THE COMMISSION PASSED ON THE ADEQUACY OR ACCURACY OF THIS DISCLOSURE DOCUMENT.






	The date of this prospectus is May 1, 2014.








	Table of Contents





	COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING COMMISSION






	RISK DISCLOSURE STATEMENT






	YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER WHETHER YOUR FINANCIAL CONDITION PERMITS YOU TO PARTICIPATE IN A COMMODITY POOL. IN SO DOING, YOU SHOULD BE AWARE THAT COMMODITY INTEREST TRADING CAN QUICKLY LEAD TO LARGE
	LOSSES AS WELL AS GAINS. SUCH TRADING LOSSES CAN SHARPLY REDUCE THE NET ASSET VALUE OF THE POOL AND CONSEQUENTLY THE VALUE OF YOUR INTEREST IN THE POOL. IN ADDITION, RESTRICTIONS ON REDEMPTIONS MAY AFFECT YOUR ABILITY TO WITHDRAW YOUR PARTICIPATION
	IN THE POOL.






	FURTHER, COMMODITY POOLS MAY BE SUBJECT TO SUBSTANTIAL CHARGES FOR MANAGEMENT, AND ADVISORY AND BROKERAGE
	FEES. IT MAY BE NECESSARY FOR THOSE POOLS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO THESE CHARGES TO MAKE SUBSTANTIAL TRADING PROFITS TO AVOID DEPLETION OR EXHAUSTION OF THEIR ASSETS. THIS DISCLOSURE DOCUMENT CONTAINS A COMPLETE DESCRIPTION OF EACH EXPENSE TO BE CHARGED
	THIS POOL AT PAGE 35 AND A STATEMENT OF THE PERCENTAGE RETURN NECESSARY TO BREAK EVEN, THAT IS, TO RECOVER THE AMOUNT OF YOUR INITIAL INVESTMENT, AT PAGE 35.






	THIS BRIEF STATEMENT CANNOT DISCLOSE ALL THE RISKS AND OTHER FACTORS NECESSARY TO EVALUATE YOUR PARTICIPATION IN THIS COMMODITY POOL. THEREFORE, BEFORE YOU DECIDE TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS COMMODITY POOL,
	YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY STUDY THIS DISCLOSURE DOCUMENT, INCLUDING A DESCRIPTION OF THE PRINCIPAL RISK FACTORS OF THIS INVESTMENT, AT PAGE 5.






	YOU SHOULD ALSO BE AWARE THAT THIS COMMODITY POOL MAY TRADE FOREIGN FUTURES OR OPTIONS CONTRACTS. TRANSACTIONS ON MARKETS LOCATED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, INCLUDING MARKETS FORMALLY LINKED TO A
	UNITED STATES MARKET, MAY BE SUBJECT TO REGULATIONS WHICH OFFER DIFFERENT OR DIMINISHED PROTECTION TO THE POOL AND ITS PARTICIPANTS. FURTHER, UNITED STATES REGULATORY AUTHORITIES MAY BE UNABLE TO COMPEL THE ENFORCEMENT OF THE RULES OF REGULATORY
	AUTHORITIES OR MARKETS IN NON-UNITED STATES JURISDICTIONS WHERE TRANSACTIONS FOR THE POOL MAY BE EFFECTED.






	SWAPS
	TRANSACTIONS, LIKE OTHER FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS, INVOLVE A VARIETY OF SIGNIFICANT RISKS. THE SPECIFIC RISKS PRESENTED BY A PARTICULAR SWAP TRANSACTION NECESSARILY DEPEND UPON THE TERMS OF THE TRANSACTION AND YOUR CIRCUMSTANCES. IN GENERAL, HOWEVER,
	ALL SWAPS TRANSACTIONS INVOLVE SOME COMBINATION OF MARKET RISK, CREDIT RISK, COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISK, FUNDING RISK, LIQUIDITY RISK, AND OPERATIONAL RISK.






	HIGHLY CUSTOMIZED SWAPS TRANSACTIONS IN PARTICULAR MAY INCREASE LIQUIDITY RISK, WHICH MAY RESULT IN A SUSPENSION OF REDEMPTIONS. HIGHLY LEVERAGED TRANSACTIONS MAY EXPERIENCE SUBSTANTIAL GAINS OR LOSSES
	IN VALUE AS A RESULT OF RELATIVELY SMALL CHANGES IN THE VALUE OR LEVEL OF AN UNDERLYING OR RELATED MARKET FACTOR.






	IN
	EVALUATING THE RISKS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH A PARTICULAR SWAP TRANSACTION, IT IS IMPORTANT TO CONSIDER THAT A SWAP TRANSACTION MAY BE MODIFIED OR TERMINATED ONLY BY MUTUAL CONSENT OF THE ORIGINAL PARTIES AND SUBJECT TO AGREEMENT
	ON INDIVIDUALLY NEGOTIATED TERMS. THEREFORE, IT MAY NOT BE POSSIBLE FOR THE COMMODITY POOL OPERATOR TO MODIFY, TERMINATE, OR OFFSET THE POOLS OBLIGATIONS OR THE POOLS EXPOSURE TO THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH A TRANSACTION PRIOR TO ITS
	SCHEDULED TERMINATION DATE.

	PROSPECTUS SUMMARY






	This is only a summary of the prospectus and, while it contains material information about USCI and its shares, it does not contain or
	summarize all of the information about USCI and the shares contained in this prospectus that is material and/or which may be important to you. You should read this entire prospectus, including Risk Factors Involved with an Investment in
	USCI? beginning on page 5, before making an investment decision about the shares. For a glossary of defined terms, see Appendix A.








	The Trust and USCI





	The United States Commodity Index Funds Trust (the Trust) is a Delaware statutory trust formed on December 21, 2009. The Trust is a series trust formed pursuant to the Delaware Statutory
	Trust Act and is organized into four separate series (each series, a Fund and collectively, the Funds). The United States Commodity Index Fund (USCI), formed on April 1, 2010, is a series of the Trust and is
	a commodity pool that issues common shares of beneficial interest that may be purchased and sold on the NYSE Arca stock exchange (NYSE Arca). The Trust and USCI operate pursuant to the Trusts Third Amended and Restated Declaration
	of Trust and Trust Agreement (the Trust Agreement), dated as of March 22, 2013. Wilmington Trust Company is the Delaware trustee of the Trust. USCI and the Trust are managed and controlled by USCF. USCF is a limited liability
	company formed in Delaware on May 10, 2005, that is registered as a commodity pool operator (CPO) with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and is a member of the National Futures Association
	(NFA).










	USCIs Investment Objective and Strategy





	The investment objective of USCI is for the daily changes in percentage terms of its shares per share net asset value
	(NAV) to reflect the daily changes in percentage terms of the SummerHaven Dynamic Commodity Index Total Return (the SDCI), less USCIs expenses.



	 





	What is the SummerHaven Dynamic Commodity Index Total Return?




	 


	 



	The SDCI is designed to reflect the performance of a diversified group of commodities.
	The SDCI is owned and maintained by SummerHaven Indexing and is calculated by the NYSE Arca. Futures contracts for the commodities comprising the SDCI are traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX), ICE Futures (ICE
	Futures), Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT), Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), London Metal Exchange (LME), and Commodity Exchange, Inc. (COMEX) (the NYMEX, ICE Futures, CBOT, CME, LME and COMEX,
	collectively, the Futures Exchanges) and are collectively referred to herein as Futures Contracts. The Futures Contracts that at any given time make up the SDCI are referred to herein as Benchmark Component Futures
	Contracts. The relative weighting of the Benchmark Component Futures Contracts will change on a monthly basis, based on quantitative formulas relating to the prices of the Benchmark Component Futures Contracts developed by SummerHaven
	Indexing.





	USCI seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing to the fullest extent possible in the Benchmark
	Component Futures Contracts. Then, if constrained by regulatory requirements or in view of market conditions, USCI will invest next in other Futures Contracts based on the same commodity as the futures contracts subject to such regulatory
	constraints or market conditions, and finally, to a lesser extent, in other exchange-traded futures contracts that are economically identical or substantially similar to the Benchmark Component Futures Contracts if one or more other Futures
	Contracts is not available. When USCI has invested to the fullest extent possible in exchange-traded futures contracts, USCI may then invest in other contracts and instruments based on the Benchmark Component Futures Contracts, other Futures
	Contracts or the commodities included in the SDCI, such as cash-settles options, forward contracts, cleared swap contracts and swap contracts other than cleared

	swap contracts. Other exchange-traded futures contracts that are economically identical or substantially similar to the Benchmark Component Futures Contracts and other contracts and instruments
	based on the Benchmark Component Futures Contracts, as well as metals included in the SDCI, are collectively referred to as Other Commodity-Related Investments, and together with Benchmark Component Futures Contracts and other Futures
	Contracts, Commodity Interests.




	USCI seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing so that the average
	daily change in USCIs NAV for any period of 30 successive days will be within plus/minus 10 percent of the average daily percentage change in the price of the SDCI over the same period. USCF believes that the market arbitrage opportunities
	will cause the daily changes in USCIs share price on the NYSE Arca to closely track the daily changes in USCIs per share NAV. USCF believes that the net effect of this expected relationship and the expected relationship described above
	between USCIs per share NAV and the SDCI will be that the daily changes in the price of USCIs shares on the NYSE Arca will closely track the daily changes in the SDCI, less USCIs expenses. While USCI is composed of Benchmark
	Component Futures Contracts and is therefore a measure of the prices of the corresponding commodities comprising the SDCI for future delivery, there is nonetheless expected to be a reasonable degree of correlation between the SDCI and the cash or
	spot prices of the commodities underlying the Benchmark Component Futures Contracts.




	Investors should be aware that
	USCIs investment objective is

	not

	for its NAV or market price of shares to equal, in dollar terms, the spot prices of the commodities underlying the Benchmark Component Futures Contracts or the prices of any particular group of futures
	contracts. USCI will not seek to achieve its stated investment objective over a period of time

	greater than one day.

	This is because natural market forces called contango and backwardation have impacted the total return on an investment in
	USCIs shares during the past year relative to a hypothetical direct investment in the various commodities and, in the future, it is likely that the relationship between the market price of USCIs shares and changes in the spot prices of
	the underlying commodities will continue to be so impacted by contango and backwardation. (It is important to note that this comparison ignores the potential costs associated with physically owning and storing the commodities, which could be
	substantial.)







	Principal Investment Risks of an Investment in USCI





	An investment in USCI involves a degree of risk. Some of the risks you may face are summarized below. A more extensive discussion of these
	risks appears beginning on page 5.





	Investment Risk





	Investors may choose to use USCI as means of investing indirectly in commodities. There are significant risks and hazards inherent in the commodity industry that may cause the price of commodities to
	widely fluctuate.





	Correlation Risk





	To the extent that investors use USCI as a means of indirectly investing in commodities, there is the risk that the daily changes in the price of USCIs shares on the NYSE Arca will not closely track
	the daily changes in the spot prices of the commodities comprising the SDCI. This could happen if the price of shares traded on the NYSE Arca do not correlate closely with the value of USCIs NAV; the changes in USCIs NAV do not correlate
	closely with the changes in the price of the Benchmark Component Futures Contracts; or the changes in the price of the Benchmark Component Futures Contracts do not closely correlate with the changes in the cash or spot price of the underlying
	commodities. This is a risk because if these correlations do not exist, then investors may not be able to use USCI as a cost-effective way to indirectly invest in commodities or as a hedge against the risk of loss in commodity-related transactions.

	Table of Contents






	The design of the SDCI is such that every month it is made up of different Benchmark
	Component Futures Contracts and USCIs investment must be rebalanced on an ongoing basis to reflect the changing composition of the SDCI. In the event of a commodity futures market where near month contracts to expire trade at a higher
	price than next month contracts to expire, a situation referred to as backwardation, then absent the impact of the overall movement in commodity prices, the value of the SDCI would tend to rise as it approaches expiration. As a
	result, USCI may benefit because it would be selling more expensive contracts and buying less expensive ones on an ongoing basis. Conversely, in the event of a commodity futures market where near month contracts trade at a lower price than next
	month contracts, a situation referred to as contango, then absent the impact of the overall movement in commodity prices, the value of the SDCI would tend to decline as it approaches expiration. As a result, USCIs total return
	may be lower than might otherwise be the case because it would be selling less expensive contracts and buying more expensive ones. The impact of backwardation and contango may cause the total return of USCI to vary significantly from the total
	return of other price references, such as the spot price of the commodities comprising the SDCI. In the event of a prolonged period of contango, and absent the impact of rising or falling commodity prices, this could have a significant negative
	impact on USCIs NAV and total return.





	Tax Risk





	USCI is organized as a Delaware statutory trust, but taxed as a limited partnership in accordance with the provisions of its Trust Agreement and applicable state law, and therefore, has a more complex tax
	treatment than conventional mutual funds.





	OTC Contract Risk





	USCI may also invest in Other Commodity-Related Investments, many of which are negotiated OTC contracts that are not as liquid as Futures Contracts and expose USCI to credit risk that its counterparty may
	not be able to satisfy its obligations to USCI.





	Other Risks





	USCI pays fees and expenses that are incurred regardless of whether it is profitable.




	Unlike mutual funds, commodity pools or other investment pools that manage their investments in an attempt to realize income and gains and distribute such income and gains to their investors, USCI
	generally does not distribute cash to limited partners or other shareholders. You should not invest in USCI if you will need cash distributions from USCI to pay taxes on your share of income and gains of USCI, if any, or for any other reason.




	You will have no rights to participate in the management of USCI and will have to rely on the duties and judgment of USCF to
	manage USCI.




	USCI is subject to actual and potential inherent conflicts involving USCF, various commodity futures brokers and
	Authorized Purchasers. USCFs officers, directors and employees do not devote their time exclusively to USCI. USCFs personnel are directors, officers or employees of other entities that may compete with USCI for their services, including
	other commodity pools (funds) that USCF manages (these funds are referred to in this prospectus as the Related Public Funds and are identified in the Glossary). They could have a conflict between their responsibilities to USCI and to
	those other entities. As a result of these and other relationships, parties involved with USCI have a financial incentive to act in a manner other than in the best interest of USCI and the shareholders.

	USCF has contractually agreed to cap the management fee paid by USCI at 0.80% per annum effective May 1, 2014. USCF has agreed to keep this agreement in place
	until December 31, 2015. USCF can terminate this agreement after this date at any time in its sole discretion. If this agreement were terminated, the annual management fees paid by USCI to USCF would increase from 0.80% to 0.95%, which would
	negatively impact your total return from an investment in USCI.

	RISK FACTORS INVOLVED WITH AN INVESTMENT IN USCI






	You should consider carefully the risks described below before making an investment decision. You should also refer to the other
	information included in this prospectus, as well as information found in our periodic reports, which include USCIs financial statements and the related notes that are incorporated by reference. See Incorporation by Reference of Certain
	Information on page 70.





	USCIs investment strategy is designed to provide investors with a means of investing
	indirectly in various commodities and to hedge against movements in the spot price of such commodities. USCI seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing in Commodity Interests. Accordingly, an investment in USCI involves investment risk
	similar to a direct investment in Commodity Interests. An investment in USCI also involves correlation risk, which is the risk that investors purchasing shares to hedge against movesments in the price of commodities will have an efficient hedge only
	if the price they pay for their shares closely correlates with the price of the commodities. In addition to investment risk and correlation risk, an investment in USCI involves tax risks, OTC risks, and other risks.







	Investment Risk






	The NAV of USCIs shares relates directly to the value of its assets invested in accordance with the SDCI and other assets held by USCI and fluctuations in the prices of these assets could
	materially adversely affect an investment in USCIs shares. Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results; all or substantially all of an investment in USCI could be lost.





	USCIs investment objective is for the NAV of its shares to track the price of the SDCI, less expenses. The net assets of USCI
	consist primarily of investments in Futures Contracts and, to a lesser extent, in Other Commodity-Related Investments. The NAV of USCIs shares relates directly to the value of these assets (less liabilities, including accrued but unpaid
	expenses), which in turn relates to the market price of the commodities which comprise the SDCI.






	Economic
	conditions.


	The demand for commodities, in general, correlates closely with general economic growth rates. The occurrence of recessions or other periods of low or negative economic growth will typically have a direct adverse impact on
	commodity prices. Other factors that affect general economic conditions in the world or in a major region, such as changes in population growth rates, periods of civil unrest, government austerity programs, or currency exchange rate fluctuations,
	can also impact the demand for commodities. Sovereign debt downgrades, defaults, inability to access debt markets due to credit or legal constraints, liquidity crises, the breakup or restructuring of fiscal, monetary, or political systems such as
	the European Union, and other events or conditions that impair the functioning of financial markets and institutions also may adversely impact the demand for commodities.






	Other demand-related factors.


	Other factors may affect the demand for certain commodities and therefore their price. For example, such factors may include: technological improvements in
	energy efficiency; seasonal weather patterns; increased competitiveness of alternative energy sources; changes in technology or consumer preferences that alter fuel choices, such as toward alternative fueled vehicles, and changes in consumer
	preference.






	Other supply-related factors.


	Commodities prices also vary depending on a number of factors
	affecting supply. For example, increased supply from the development of hybrid crops (such as corn and soybeans) and technologies for efficient farming tends to reduce prices in such commodity to the extent such supply increases are not offset by
	commensurate growth in demand. Similarly, increases in industry manufacturing capacity may impact the supply of a particular crop. World food supply levels can also be affected by factors that reduce available supplies, such as embargoes, the
	occurrence of wars, hostile actions, natural disasters, disruptions in competitors operations, or unexpected unavailability of distribution channels that may disrupt supplies.




	 




	5







	Table of Contents




	Technological change can also alter the relative costs for companies to produce, and process and distribute a commodity, which in turn may affect the supply of and demand of such commodity.






	Other market factors.


	The supply of and demand for agricultural and other commodities may also be impacted by
	changes in interest rates, inflation, and other local or regional market conditions.






	Price Volatility May Possibly
	Cause the Total Loss of Your Investment.


	Futures contracts have a high degree of price variability and are subject to occasional rapid and substantial changes. Consequently, you could lose all or substantially all of your investment in USCI.







	Correlation Risk





	Investors purchasing shares to hedge against movements in the price of commodities will have an efficient hedge only if the return from their shares closely correlates with the return from the SDCI, which
	in turn, correlates with the price of commodities that comprise the SDCI. Investing in shares of USCI for hedging purposes involves the following risks:



	 





	 




	




	 





	The market price at which the investor buys or sells shares may be significantly more or less than NAV.






	 





	 




	




	 





	Daily percentage changes in NAV may not closely correlate with daily percentage changes in the price of the SDCI.






	 





	 




	




	 





	Daily percentage changes in the prices of the Benchmark Component Futures Contracts may not closely correlate with daily percentage changes in the
	price of the commodities that comprise the SDCI.









	The market price at which investors buy or sell shares may be
	significantly more or less than NAV.






	USCIs NAV per share will change throughout the day as fluctuations occur in
	the market value of USCIs portfolio investments. The public trading price at which an investor buys or sells shares during the day from their broker may be different from the NAV of the shares. Price differences may relate primarily to supply
	and demand forces at work in the secondary trading market for shares that are closely related to, but not identical to, the same forces influencing the prices of the commodities comprising the Benchmark Component Futures Contracts and the SDCI at
	any point in time. USCF expects that exploitation of certain arbitrage opportunities by Authorized Purchasers and their clients and customers will tend to cause the public trading price to track NAV per share closely over time, but there can be no
	assurance of that.




	The NAV of USCIs shares may also be influenced by non-concurrent trading hours between the NYSE Arca
	and the various futures exchanges on which a commodity comprising the SDCI is traded. While the shares trade on the NYSE Arca from 9:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time, the trading hours for the futures exchanges on commodities trade may not
	necessarily coincide during all of this time. For example, while the shares trade on the NYSE Arca until 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time, liquidity in the commodities market will be reduced after the close of the NYMEX at 2:30 p.m. Eastern Time. As a result,
	during periods when the NYSE Arca is open and the futures exchanges on which commodities are traded are closed, trading spreads and the resulting premium or discount on the shares may widen and, therefore, increase the difference between the price
	of the shares and the NAV of the shares.






	Daily percentage changes in USCIs NAV may not correlate with daily percentage changes in
	the price of the SDCI.






	It is possible that the daily percentage changes in USCIs NAV per share may not closely
	correlate to daily percentage changes in the price of the SDCI. Non-correlation may be attributable to disruptions in the market for

	a particular commodity, the imposition of position or accountability limits by regulators or exchanges, or other extraordinary circumstances. As USCI approaches or reaches position limits with
	respect to a Benchmark Component Futures Contract or other Futures Contracts or in view of market conditions, USCI may begin investing in Other Commodity-Related Investments. In addition, USCI is not able to replicate exactly the changes in the
	price of the SDCI because the total return generated by USCI is reduced by expenses and transaction costs, including those incurred in connection with USCIs trading activities, and increased by interest income from USCIs holdings of
	Treasuries. Tracking the SDCI requires trading of USCIs portfolio with a view to tracking the SDCI over time and is dependent upon the skills of USCF and its trading principals, among other factors.






	Daily percentage changes in the price of the Benchmark Component Futures Contract may not correlate with daily percentage changes in the spot price
	of the corresponding commodity.






	The correlation between changes in prices of a Benchmark Component Futures Contract
	and the spot price of the corresponding commodity may at times be only approximate. The degree of imperfection of correlation depends upon circumstances such as variations in the speculative commodities market, supply of and demand for Futures
	Contracts (including the Benchmark Component Futures Contract) and Other Commodity-Related Investments, and technical influences in futures trading.






	The price relationship between the SDCI at any point in time and the Futures Contracts that will become the Benchmark Component Futures Contracts on the next rebalancing date will vary and may
	impact both USCIs total return and the degree to which its total return tracks that of SDCI.






	The design of the
	SDCI is such that every month it is made up of different Benchmark Component Futures Contracts, and USCIs investment must be rebalanced on an ongoing basis to reflect the changing composition of the SDCI. In the event of a commodity futures
	market where near month contracts to expire trade at a higher price than next month contracts to expire, a situation referred to as backwardation, then absent the impact of the overall movement in commodity prices, the value of the SDCI
	would tend to rise as it approaches expiration. As a result, USCI may benefit because it would be selling more expensive contracts and buying less expensive ones on an ongoing basis. Conversely, in the event of a commodity futures market where near
	month contracts trade at a lower price than next month contracts, a situation referred to as contango, then absent the impact of the overall movement in commodity prices, the value of the SDCI would tend to decline as it approaches
	expiration. As a result, USCIs total return may be lower than might otherwise be the case because it would be selling less expensive contracts and buying more expensive ones. The impact of backwardation and contango may cause the total return
	of USCI to vary significantly from the total return of other price references, such as the spot price of the commodities comprising the SDCI. In the event of a prolonged period of contango, and absent the impact of rising or falling commodity
	prices, this could have a significant negative impact on a USCIs NAV and total return. See Additional Information About USCI, its Investment Objective and Investments for a discussion of the potential effects of contango and
	backwardation.






	Accountability levels, position limits, and daily price fluctuation limits set by the exchanges have the potential to
	cause tracking error, which could cause the price of shares to substantially vary from the SDCI.






	Designated contract
	markets, such as the NYMEX and ICE Futures, have established accountability levels and position limits on the maximum net long or net short futures contracts in Commodity Interests that any person or group of persons under common trading
	control (other than as a hedge, which an investment by USCI is not) may hold, own or control. In addition to accountability levels and position limits, the NYMEX and ICE Futures also set daily price fluctuation limits on futures contracts. The daily
	price fluctuation limit establishes the maximum amount that the price of a futures contract may vary either up or down from the previous days settlement price. Once the daily price fluctuation limit has been reached in a particular futures
	contract, no trades may be made at a price beyond that limit.




	On November 5, 2013, the CFTC proposed a rulemaking
	that would establish specific limits on speculative positions in 28 physical commodity futures and option contracts as well as swaps that are economically




	 




	7







	Table of Contents




	equivalent to such contracts in the agriculture, energy and metals markets (the Position Limit Rules). On the same date, the CFTC proposed another rule addressing the circumstances
	under which market participants would be required to aggregate their positions with other persons under common ownership or control (the Proposed Aggregation Requirements). Specifically, the Position Limit Rules, among other things:
	identify which contracts are subject to speculative position limits; set thresholds that restrict the number of speculative positions that a person may hold in a spot month, individual month, and all months combined; create an exemption for
	positions that constitute bona fide hedging transactions; impose responsibilities on DCMs and SEFs to establish position limits or, in some cases, position accountability rules; and apply to both futures and swaps across four relevant venues 
	OTC, designated contract markets (DCMs), swap execution facilities (SEFs) as well as non-U.S. located trading platforms.




	Until such time as the Position Limit Rules are adopted, the regulatory architecture in effect prior to the adoption of the Position Limit Rules will govern transactions in commodities and related
	derivatives (collectively, Referenced Contracts). Under that system, the CFTC enforces federal limits on speculation in agricultural products (e.g., corn, wheat and soy), while futures exchanges enforce position limits and accountability
	levels for agricultural and certain energy products (e.g., oil and natural gas). As a result, USCI may be limited with respect to the size of its investments in a Futures Contracts and Other Commodity-Related Investment subject to these limits.
	Finally, subject to certain narrow exceptions, the Position Limit Rules require the aggregation, for purposes of the position limits, of all positions in the 28 Referenced Contracts held by a single entity and its affiliates, regardless of whether
	such position existed on U.S. futures exchanges, non-U.S. futures exchanges, in cleared swaps or in OTC swaps. Under the CFTCs existing position limits requirements and the Position Limit Rules, a market participant is generally required to
	aggregate all positions for which that participant controls the trading decisions with all positions for which that participant has a 10 percent or greater ownership interest in an account or position, as well as the positions of two or more persons
	acting pursuant to an express or implied agreement or understanding. At this time, it is unclear how the Proposed Aggregation Requirements may affect USCI, but it may be substantial and adverse. By way of example, the Proposed Aggregation
	Requirements in combination with the Position Limit Rules may negatively impact the ability of USCI to meet its investment objectives through limits that may inhibit USCFs ability to sell additional Creation Baskets of USCI.




	All of these limits may potentially cause a tracking error between the price of USCIs shares and the SDCI. This may in turn prevent
	investors from being able to effectively use USCI as a way to hedge against commodity-related losses or as a way to indirectly invest in a commodity.




	USCI has not limited the size of its offering and USCI is committed to utilizing substantially all of its proceeds to purchase Futures Contracts and Other Commodity-Related Investments. If USCI encounters
	accountability levels, position limits, or price fluctuation limits for Futures Contracts on the NYMEX or ICE Futures, it may then, if permitted under applicable regulatory requirements, purchase Futures Contracts on other exchanges that trade the
	listed applicable commodity futures. In addition, if USCI exceeds accountability levels on either the NYMEX or ICE Futures and is required by such exchanges to reduce its holdings, such reduction could potentially cause a tracking error between the
	price of USCIs shares and the SDCI.







	Tax Risk







	An investors tax liability may exceed the amount of distributions, if any, on its shares.






	Cash or property will be distributed at the sole discretion of USCF. USCF has not and does not currently intend to make cash or other distributions with respect to shares. Investors will be required to
	pay U.S. federal income tax and, in some cases, state, local, or foreign income tax, on their allocable share of USCIs taxable income, without regard to whether they receive distributions or the amount of any distributions. Therefore, the tax
	liability of an investor with respect to its shares may exceed the amount of cash or value of property (if any) distributed.




	 




	8







	Table of Contents






	An investors allocable share of taxable income or loss may differ from its economic income or
	loss on its shares.






	Due to the application of the assumptions and conventions applied by USCI in making allocations
	for tax purposes and other factors, an investors allocable share of USCIs income, gain, deduction or loss may be different than its economic profit or loss from its shares for a taxable year. This difference could be temporary or
	permanent and, if permanent, could result in it being taxed on amounts in excess of its economic income.






	Items of income, gain,
	deduction, loss and credit with respect to shares could be reallocated if the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) does not accept the assumptions and conventions applied by USCI in allocating those items, with potential adverse
	consequences for an investor.






	The U.S. tax rules pertaining to entities taxed as partnerships are complex and their
	application to large, publicly traded entities such as USCIs is in many respects uncertain. USCI applies certain assumptions and conventions in an attempt to comply with the intent of the applicable rules and to report taxable income, gains,
	deductions, losses and credits in a manner that properly reflects shareholders economic gains and losses. These assumptions and conventions may not fully comply with all aspects of the Internal Revenue Code (the Code) and
	applicable Treasury Regulations, however, and it is possible that the IRS will successfully challenge USCIs allocation methods and require USCI to reallocate items of income, gain, deduction, loss or credit in a manner that adversely affects
	investors. If this occurs, investors may be required to file an amended tax return and to pay additional taxes plus deficiency interest.






	USCI could be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, which may substantially reduce the value of the shares.






	The Trust, on behalf of USCI, has received an opinion of counsel that, under current U.S. federal income tax laws, USCI will be treated as
	a partnership that is not taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, provided that (i) at least 90 percent of USCIs annual gross income consists of qualifying income as defined in the Code, (ii) the
	Trust and USCI is organized and operated in accordance with its governing agreements and applicable law and (iii) the Trust and USCI do not elect to be taxed as a corporation for federal income tax purposes. Although USCF anticipates that USCI
	has satisfied and will continue to satisfy the qualifying income requirement for all of its taxable years, that result cannot be assured. USCI has not requested and nor will it request any ruling from the IRS with respect to its
	classification as a partnership not taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes. If the IRS were to successfully assert that USCI is taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes in any taxable year, rather than passing
	through its income, gains, losses and deductions proportionately to shareholders, USCI would be subject to tax on its net income for the year at corporate tax rates. In addition, although USCF does not currently intend to make distributions with
	respect to shares, any distributions would be taxable to shareholders as dividend income. Taxation of the Trust and USCI as a corporation could materially reduce the after-tax return on an investment in shares and could substantially reduce the
	value of the shares.






	USCI is organized as a Delaware statutory trust, but taxed as a limited partnership in accordance with the
	provisions of the Trust Agreement and applicable state law, and therefore, USCI has a more complex tax treatment than traditional mutual funds.






	USCI is organized as a Delaware statutory trust, but taxed as a limited partnership in accordance with the provisions of the Trust Agreement and applicable state law




	. No U.S. federal income
	tax is paid by USCI on its income. Instead, USCI will furnish shareholders each year with tax information on IRS Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) and each U.S. shareholder is required to report on its U.S. federal income tax return its allocable share of
	the income, gain, loss and deduction of USCI. This must be reported without regard to the amount (if any) of cash or property the shareholder receives as a distribution from USCI during the taxable year. A shareholder, therefore, may be allocated
	income or gain by USCI but receive no cash distribution with which to pay the tax liability resulting from the allocation, or may receive a distribution that is insufficient to pay such liability.

	OTC Contract Risk







	Currently, OTC transactions are subject to changing regulation.






	A
	portion of USCIs assets may be used to trade OTC Commodity Interests, such as forward contracts or swap or spot contracts. Currently, OTC contracts are typically contracts traded on a principal-to-principal, non-cleared basis through dealer
	markets that are dominated by major money center and investment banks and other institutions and that prior to the passage of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act) had been essentially
	unregulated by the CFTC. The markets for OTC contracts have relied upon the integrity of market participants in lieu of the additional regulation imposed by the CFTC on participants in the futures markets. To date, the forward markets have been
	largely unregulated, forward contracts have been executed bi-laterally and, in general, forward contracts have not been cleared or guaranteed by a third party. On November 16, 2012, the Secretary of the Treasury issued a final determination
	that exempts both foreign exchange swaps and foreign exchange forwards from the definition of swap and, by extension, additional regulatory requirements (such as clearing and margin). The final determination does not extend to other
	foreign exchange derivatives, such as foreign exchange options, certain currency swaps and non-deliverable forwards. While the Dodd-Frank Act and certain regulations adopted thereunder are intended to provide additional protections to participants
	in the OTC market, the current regulation of the OTC contracts could expose USCI in certain circumstances to significant losses in the event of trading abuses or financial failure by participants. On November 28, 2012, the CFTC issued its final
	clearing determination requiring that certain credit default swaps and interest rate swaps be cleared by registered DCMs. This is the CFTCs first clearing determination under the Dodd-Frank Act and became effective on February 11,
	2013. Beginning on March 11, 2013, swap dealers, major swap participants and certain active funds were required to clear certain credit default swaps and interest rate swaps; and beginning on June 10, 2013,
	commodity pools, certain private funds and entities predominantly engaged in financial activities were required to clear the same types of swaps. As a result, if the Trust on behalf of USCI, enters into or has entered into certain interest rate and
	credit default swaps on or after June 10, 2013, such swaps will be required to be centrally cleared. Determination on other types of swaps are expected in the future, and, when finalized, could require USCI to centrally clear certain OTC
	instruments presently entered into and settled on a bi-lateral basis.






	USCI will be subject to credit risk with respect to
	counterparties to OTC contracts entered into by the Trust on behalf of USCI or held by special purpose or structured vehicles.






	USCI faces the risk of non-performance by the counterparties to the OTC contracts. Unlike in futures contracts, the counterparty to these contracts is generally a single bank or other financial
	institution, rather than a clearing organization backed by a group of financial institutions. As a result, there will be greater counterparty credit risk in these transactions. A counterparty may not be able to meet its obligations to USCI, in which
	case USCI could suffer significant losses on these contracts.




	If a counterparty becomes bankrupt or otherwise fails to
	perform its obligations due to financial difficulties, USCI may experience significant delays in obtaining any recovery in a bankruptcy or other reorganization proceeding. The Trust on behalf of USCI may obtain only limited recovery or may obtain no
	recovery in such circumstances.






	Valuing OTC derivatives may be less certain than actively traded financial instruments.






	In general, valuing OTC derivatives is less certain than valuing actively traded financial instruments such as
	exchange traded futures contracts and securities or cleared swaps because the price and terms on which such OTC derivatives are entered into or can be terminated are individually negotiated, and those prices and terms may not reflect the best price
	or terms available from other sources. In addition, while market makers and dealers generally quote indicative prices or terms for entering into or terminating OTC contracts, they typically are not contractually obligated to do so, particularly if
	they are not a party to the transaction. As a result, it may be difficult to obtain an independent value for an outstanding OTC derivatives transaction.

	The regulatory requirements for posting margin in uncleared swap transactions are evolving.






	The Dodd-Frank Act requires the CFTC and SEC to establish both initial and variation margin requirements on all
	swaps that are not cleared by a registered clearing organization (

	i.e.,

	uncleared swaps). In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act provides parties who post initial margin to a swap dealer or major swap participant with a statutory right to
	insist that such margin be held in a segregated account with an independent custodian. On November 6, 2013, the CFTC published a final rule that imposes requirements on swap dealers and major swap participants with respect to the treatment of
	collateral posted by their counterparties to margin, guarantee, or secure uncleared swaps. The rule places restrictions on what swap dealers and major swap participants can do with collateral posted by USCI in connection with uncleared swaps.







	Other Risks







	Certain of USCIs investments could be illiquid, which could cause large losses to investors at any time or from time to time.






	Futures positions cannot always be liquidated at the desired price. It is difficult to execute a trade at a specific price when there is a
	relatively small volume of buy and sell orders in a market. A market disruption, such as a foreign government taking political actions that disrupt the market for its currency, its crude oil production or exports, or another major export, can also
	make it difficult to liquidate a position. Because both Futures Contracts and Other Commodity-Related Investments may be illiquid, USCIs Commodity Interests may be more difficult to liquidate at favorable prices in periods of illiquid markets
	and losses may be incurred during the period in which positions are being liquidated. The large size of the positions that USCI may acquire increases the risk of illiquidity both by making its positions more difficult to liquidate and by potentially
	increasing losses while trying to do so.




	OTC contracts that are not subject to clearing may be even less marketable than
	futures contracts because they are not traded on an exchange, do not have uniform terms and conditions, and are entered into based upon the creditworthiness of the parties and the availability of credit support, such as collateral, and in general,
	they are not transferable without the consent of the counterparty. These conditions make such contracts less liquid than standardized futures contracts traded on a commodities exchange and could adversely impact a USCIs ability to realize the
	full value of such contracts. In addition, even if collateral is used to reduce counterparty credit risk, sudden changes in the value of OTC transactions may leave a party open to financial risk due to a counterparty default since the collateral
	held may not cover a partys exposure on the transaction in such situations.






	The NYSE Arca may halt trading in USCIs shares,
	which would adversely impact an investors ability to sell shares.






	USCIs shares are listed for trading on
	the NYSE Arca under the market symbol USCI. Trading in shares may be halted due to market conditions or, in light of NYSE Arca rules and procedures, for reasons that, in the view of the NYSE Arca, make trading in shares inadvisable. In
	addition, trading is subject to trading halts caused by extraordinary market volatility pursuant to circuit breaker rules that require trading to be halted for a specified period based on a specified market decline. Additionally, there
	can be no assurance that the requirements necessary to maintain the listing of USCIs shares will continue to be met or will remain unchanged.






	The lack of an active trading market for USCIs shares may result in losses on an investors investment in USCI at the time the investor sells the shares.






	Although USCIs shares are listed and traded on the NYSE Arca, there can be no guarantee that an active trading market for the shares
	will be maintained. If an investor needs to sell shares at a time when no active trading market for them exists, the price the investor receives upon sale of the shares, assuming they were able to be sold, likely would be lower than if an active
	market existed.

	USCF is leanly staffed and relies heavily on key personnel to manage USCI and other funds.






	In managing and directing the day-to-day activities and affairs of USCI, USCF relies heavily on Messrs. Howard Mah and
	John Hyland. If Messrs. Mah or Hyland were to leave or be unable to carry out their present responsibilities, it may have an adverse effect on the management of USCI.






	SummerHaven is leanly staffed and relies heavily on key personnel to manage advisory activities.






	SummerHaven is leanly staffed and relies heavily on key personnel to manage advisory activities. In providing trading advisory services to USCI with respect to the SDCI. SummerHaven relies heavily on
	Messrs. Kurt Nelson and Ashraf Rizvi and Dr. K. Geert Rouwenhorst. Messrs. Nelson and Rizvi, and Dr. Rouwenhorst intend to allocate their time to managing the assets of USCI in a manner that they deem appropriate. If such key personnel of
	SummerHaven were to leave or be unable to carry out their present responsibilities, it may have an adverse effect on the management of SummerHaven.






	There is a risk that USCI will not earn trading gains sufficient to compensate for the fees and expenses that it must pay and as such USCI may not earn any profit.






	Based on fees and expenses paid by USCI for the year-ended December 31, 2013 and USCIs average daily total net assets for 2013,
	an investor would pay fees and expenses, prior to any expense waiver, of 1.14% of the amount of the investors investment.




	These fees and expenses must be paid in all cases regardless of whether USCIs activities are profitable. Accordingly, USCI must
	earn trading gains sufficient to compensate for these fees and expenses before it can earn any profit.






	Fewer representative commodities
	may result in greater SDCI volatility.






	The SDCI is concentrated in terms of the number of commodities represented.
	Investors should be aware that other commodities indices are more diversified in terms of both the number and variety of commodities included. Concentration in fewer commodities may result in a greater degree of volatility in the SDCI and the NAV of
	USCI which tracks the SDCI under specific market conditions and over time.






	Regulation of the Commodity Interests is extensive and
	constantly changing; future regulatory developments are impossible to predict but may significantly and adversely affect USCI.






	The futures markets are subject to comprehensive statutes, regulations, and margin requirements. In addition, the CFTC and futures exchanges are authorized to take extraordinary actions in the event of a
	market emergency, including, for example, the retroactive implementation of speculative position limits or higher margin requirements, the establishment of daily price limits and the suspension of trading. Regulation of commodity interest
	transactions in the United States is a rapidly changing area of law and is subject to ongoing modification by governmental and judicial action. Considerable regulatory attention has been focused on non-traditional investment pools that are publicly
	distributed in the United States. In addition, various national governments outside of the United States have expressed concern regarding the disruptive effects of speculative trading in the energy markets and the need to regulate the derivatives
	markets in general. The effect of any future regulatory change on USCI is impossible to predict, but it could be substantial and adverse.






	An investment in USCI may provide little or no diversification benefits. Thus, in a declining market, USCI may have no gains to offset losses from
	other investments, and an investor may suffer losses on its investment in USCI while incurring losses with respect to other asset classes.






	Historically, Commodity Interests have generally been non-correlated to the performance of other asset classes such as stocks and bonds. Non-correlation means that there is a low statistically valid
	relationship between the performance of futures and other commodity interest transactions, on the one hand, and stocks or bonds, on the other hand.




	 




	12







	Table of Contents




	However, there can be no assurance that such non-correlation will continue during future
	periods. If, contrary to historic patterns, USCIs performance were to move in the same general direction as the financial markets, investors will obtain little or no diversification benefits from an investment in the shares. In such a case,
	USCI may have no gains to offset losses from other investments, and investors may suffer losses on their investment in USCI while incurring losses with respect to other investments.




	Variables such as drought, floods, weather, embargoes, tariffs and other political events may have a larger impact on commodity prices
	and commodity-linked instruments, including the Commodity Interests, than on traditional securities. These additional variables may create additional investment risks that subject USCIs investments to greater volatility than investments in
	traditional securities.




	Non-correlation should not be confused with negative correlation, where the performance of two asset
	classes would be opposite of each other. There is no historical evidence that the spot price of a commodity and prices of other financial assets, such as stocks and bonds, are negatively correlated. In the absence of negative correlation, USCI
	cannot be expected to be automatically profitable during unfavorable periods for the stock market, or vice versa.






	The Trust is not a
	registered investment company, so shareholders do not have the protections of the 1940 Act.






	The Trust is not an
	investment company subject to the 1940 Act. Accordingly, investors do not have the protections afforded by that statute which, for example, requires investment companies to have a majority of disinterested directors and regulates the relationship
	between the investment company and its investment manager.






	Trading in international markets could expose USCI to credit and regulatory
	risk.






	USCI invests primarily in Futures Contracts, a significant portion of which are traded on United States
	exchanges, including the NYMEX. However, a portion of USCIs trades may take place on markets and exchanges outside the United States. Some non-U.S. markets present risks because they are not subject to the same degree of regulation as their
	U.S. counterparts. Trading in non-U.S. markets also leaves USCI susceptible to swings in the value of the local currency against the U.S. dollar. Additionally, trading on non-U.S. exchanges is subject to the risks presented by exchange controls,
	expropriation, increased tax burdens and exposure to local economic declines and political instability. An adverse development with respect to any of these variables could reduce the profit or increase the loss earned on trades in the affected
	international markets.






	USCI and USCF may have conflicts of interest, which may permit them to favor their own interests to the
	detriment of shareholders.






	USCI is subject to actual and potential inherent conflicts involving USCF, various
	commodity futures brokers and any Authorized Purchasers. USCFs officers, directors and employees do not devote their time exclusively to USCI. These persons are directors, officers or employees of other entities that may compete with USCI for
	their services. They could have a conflict between their responsibilities USCI and to those other entities. As a result of these and other relationships, parties involved with USCI have a financial incentive to act in a manner other than in the best
	interests of USCI and the shareholders. USCF has not established any formal procedure to resolve conflicts of interest. Consequently, investors are dependent on the good faith of the respective parties subject to such conflicts of interest to
	resolve them equitably. Although USCF attempts to monitor these conflicts, it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, for USCF to ensure that these conflicts do not, in fact, result in adverse consequences to the shareholders.




	USCI may also be subject to certain conflicts with respect to the Futures Commission Merchant (FCM), including, but not
	limited to, conflicts that result from receiving greater amounts of compensation from other clients, or purchasing opposite or competing positions on behalf of third party accounts traded through the FCM.




	 




	13







	Table of Contents




	In addition, USCFs principals, officers, directors or employees may trade futures and related contracts for their own account. A conflict of interest may exist if their trades are in the
	same markets and at the same time as USCI trades using the clearing broker to be used by USCI. A potential conflict also may occur if USCFs principals, officers, directors or employees trade their accounts more aggressively or take positions
	in their accounts which are opposite, or ahead of, the positions taken by USCI.






	USCI, USCF and SummerHaven may have conflicts of
	interest, which may cause them to favor their own interests to the detriment of shareholders.






	USCI, USCF and
	SummerHaven may have inherent conflicts to the extent USCF and SummerHaven attempt to maintain USCIs asset size in order to preserve its fee income and this may not always be consistent with USCIs objective of having the value of its
	units NAV track changes in the value of the SDCI.




	USCFs and SummerHavens officers, directors and employees
	do not devote their time exclusively to USCI. For example, USCFs directors, officers and employees act in such capacity for other entities, including the Related Public Funds that may compete with USCI for their services. They could have a
	conflict between their responsibilities to USCI and to the Related Public Funds.




	USCF has sole current authority to manage
	the investments and operations of USCI. It has delegated management of USCIs investments in its Commodity Interests to its trading advisor, SummerHaven. This authority to manage the investments and operations of USCI may allow either USCF or
	SummerHaven to act in a way that furthers its own interests in conflict with the best interests of investors. Shareholders have very limited voting rights, which will limit the ability to influence matters such as amending the Trust Agreement,
	changing USCIs basic investment objective, dissolving USCI, or selling or distributing USCIs assets.






	Shareholders have only
	very limited voting rights and have the power to replace USCF only under specific circumstances. Shareholders do not participate in the management of USCI and do not control USCF, so they do not have any influence over basic matters that affect
	USCI. In addition, USCI could terminate at any time and cause the liquidation and potential loss of an investment and could upset the overall maturity and timing of an investment portfolio.






	Shareholders have very limited voting rights with respect to USCIs affairs. Shareholders may elect a replacement sponsor only if
	USCF resigns voluntarily or loses its corporate charter. Shareholders are not permitted to participate in the management or control of USCI or the conduct of its business. Shareholders must therefore rely upon the duties and judgment of USCF to
	manage USCIs affairs.




	USCI may terminate at any time, regardless of whether USCI has incurred losses, subject to the
	terms of the Trust Agreement. For example, the dissolution or resignation of USCF would cause USCI to terminate unless, within 90 days of the event, shareholders holding shares representing at least 66 2/3% of the outstanding shares of all of USCI
	elect to continue the Trust and appoint a successor sponsor. In addition, USCF may terminate USCI if it determines that USCIs aggregate net assets in relation to its operating expenses make the continued operation of USCI unreasonable or
	imprudent. However, no level of losses will require USCF to terminate USCI. USCIs termination would result in the liquidation of its assets and the distribution of the proceeds thereof, first to creditors and then to the shareholders in
	accordance with their positive book capital account balances, after giving effect to all contributions, distributions and allocations for all periods, and USCI could incur losses in liquidating its assets in connection with a termination.
	Termination could also negatively affect the overall maturity and timing of an investment portfolio.






	USCI does not expect to make cash
	distributions.






	USCI has not previously made any cash distributions and intends to reinvest any realized gains in
	additional Commodity Interests rather than distributing cash to limited partners. Therefore, unlike mutual funds, commodity




	 




	14







	Table of Contents




	pools or other investment pools that actively manage their investments in an attempt to realize income and gains from their investing activities and distribute such income and gains to their
	investors, USCI generally does not expect to distribute cash. An investor should not invest in USCI if the investor will need cash distributions from USCI to pay taxes on its share of income and gains of USCI, if any, or for any other reason.
	Nonetheless, although USCI does not intend to make cash distributions, the income earned from its investments held directly or posted as margin may reach levels that merit distribution,

	e.g.

	, at levels where such income is not necessary to
	support its underlying investments in Commodity Interests and investors adversely react to being taxed on such income without receiving distributions that could be used to pay such tax. If this income becomes significant then cash distributions may
	be made.






	An unanticipated number of redemption requests during a short period of time could have an adverse effect on USCIs NAV.






	If a substantial number of requests for redemption of Redemption Baskets are received by USCI during a relatively
	short period of time, USCI may not be able to satisfy the requests from USCIs assets not committed to trading. As a consequence, it could be necessary to liquidate positions in USCIs trading positions before the time that the trading
	strategies would otherwise dictate liquidation.






	The financial markets are currently in a slow period of recovery and the financial
	markets are still relatively fragile.






	Since 2008, the financial markets have experienced very difficult conditions and
	volatility as well as significant adverse trends. The conditions in these markets have resulted in a decrease in availability of corporate credit and liquidity and have led indirectly to the insolvency, closure or acquisition of a number of major
	financial institutions and have contributed to further consolidation within the financial services industry. In addition, the current administration and Congress have periodically been reaching impasses in passing a fiscal budget, which could create
	long-term concerns regarding the credit of the United States and interest earned, as well as the United States Governments ability to pay its obligations to holders of Treasuries. If low interest rates on Treasuries continue or if USCI is not
	able to redeem its investments in Treasuries prior to maturity and the U.S. Government cannot pay its obligations, USCI would be negatively impacted. In addition, USCI might also be negatively impacted by its use of money market mutual funds to the
	extent those funds might themselves be using Treasuries. Although the financial markets saw signs of recovery beginning in late 2010 and 2011, economic growth in 2012 was slow and the financial markets are still fragile. A poor financial recovery
	could adversely affect the financial condition and results of operations of USCIs service providers and Authorized Purchasers, which would impact the ability of USCF to achieve USCIs investment objective.






	The failure or bankruptcy of a clearing broker or USCIs Custodian could result in a substantial loss of USCIs assets and could impair
	USCI in its ability to execute trades.






	Under CFTC regulations, a clearing broker maintains customers assets in a
	bulk segregated account. If a clearing broker fails to do so, or even if the customers funds are segregated by the clearing broker but the clearing broker is unable to satisfy a substantial deficit in a customer account, the clearing
	brokers other customers may be subject to risk of a substantial loss of their funds in the event of that clearing brokers bankruptcy. In that event, the clearing brokers customers, such as USCI, are entitled to recover, even in
	respect of property specifically traceable to them, only a proportional share of all property available for distribution to all of that clearing brokers customers. The bankruptcy of a clearing broker could result in the complete loss of
	USCIs assets posted with the clearing broker, although the majority of USCIs assets are held in Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents with the Custodian and would not be impacted by the bankruptcy of a clearing broker. USCI may also
	be subject to the risk of the failure of, or delay in performance by, any exchanges and markets and their clearing organizations, if any, on which commodity interest contracts are traded.




	In addition, to the extent a USCIs clearing broker is required to post USCIs assets as margin to a clearinghouse, the margin
	will be maintained in an omnibus account containing the margin of all the clearing




	 




	15







	Table of Contents




	brokers customers. If USCIs clearing broker defaults to a clearinghouse because of a default by one of the clearing brokers other customers or otherwise, then the clearinghouse
	can look to all of the margin in the omnibus account, including margin posted by USCI and any other non-defaulting customers of the clearing broker to satisfy the obligations of the clearing broker.




	From time to time, clearing brokers may be subject to legal or regulatory proceedings in the ordinary course of their business. A
	clearing brokers involvement in costly or time-consuming legal proceedings may divert financial resources or personnel away from the clearing brokers trading operations, which could impair the clearing brokers ability to
	successfully execute and clear USCIs trades.






	The liability of SummerHaven is limited, and the value of the shares may be
	adversely affected if USCF and USCI are required to indemnify SummerHaven.






	Under the licensing agreement and advisory
	agreement between SummerHaven and USCF, neither SummerHaven and its affiliates, nor any of their respective officers, directors, shareholders, members, partners, employees and any person who controls SummerHaven is liable to USCF or USCI absent
	willful misconduct, gross negligence, bad faith, or material breaches of applicable law or the applicable agreement on the part of SummerHaven. In addition, SummerHaven and its members, directors, officers, shareholders, employees, representatives,
	agents, attorneys, service providers, successors and assigns have the right to be indemnified, defended and held harmless from and against any and all claims, liabilities, obligations, judgments, causes of action, costs and expenses (including
	reasonable attorneys fees) (collectively, Losses) in connection with or arising out of the licensing agreement or advisory agreement, unless such Losses result from any willful misconduct, gross negligence or bad faith on the part
	of SummerHaven, or a material breach by USCF of applicable law or the applicable agreement. Furthermore, SummerHaven will not be liable to USCF or USCI for any indirect, incidental, special or consequential damages, even if SummerHaven or an
	authorized representative of SummerHaven has been advised of the possibility of such damages.






	The liability of USCF and the Trustee are
	limited, and the value of the shares will be adversely affected if USCI is required to indemnify the Trustee or USCF.






	Under the Trust Agreement, the Trustee and USCF are not liable, and have the right to be indemnified, for any liability or expense
	incurred absent gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Trustee or USCF or breach by USCF of the Trust Agreement, as the case may be. As a result, USCF may require the assets of USCI to be sold in order to cover losses or liability
	suffered by it or by the Trustee. Any sale of that kind would reduce the NAV of USCI and the value of its shares.






	Although the shares
	of USCI are limited liability investments, certain circumstances such as bankruptcy or indemnification of USCI by a shareholder will increase the shareholders liability.






	The shares of USCI are limited liability investments; shareholders may not lose more than the amount that they invest plus any profits
	recognized on their investment. However, shareholders could be required, as a matter of bankruptcy law, to return to the estate of USCI any distribution they received at a time when USCI was in fact insolvent or in violation of its Trust Agreement.
	In addition, a number of states do not have statutory trust statutes such as the Delaware statutes under which the Trust has been formed in the State of Delaware. It is possible that a court in such state could hold that, due to the
	absence of any statutory provision to the contrary in such jurisdiction, the shareholders, although entitled under Delaware law to the same limitation on personal liability as stockholders in a private corporation for profit organized under the laws
	of the State of Delaware, are not so entitled in such state. Finally, in the event the Trust or USCI is made a party to any claim, dispute, demand or litigation or otherwise incurs any liability or expense as a result of or in connection with any
	shareholders (or assignees) obligations or liabilities unrelated to the business of the Trust or USCI, as applicable, such shareholder (or assignees cumulatively) is required under the Trust Agreement to indemnify the Trust or USCI, as
	applicable, for all such liability and expense incurred, including attorneys and accountants fees.

	Investors cannot be assured of the continuation of the agreement between SummerHaven and USCF for use
	of the SDCI, and discontinuance of the SDCI may be detrimental to a USCI.






	Investors cannot be assured that the
	agreement between SummerHaven and USCF for use of the SDCI will continue for any length of time. Should the agreement between SummerHaven and USCF for use of the SDCI be terminated, USCF will be required to find a replacement index, which may have
	an adverse effect on USCI.






	Investors cannot be assured of SummerHavens continued services, and discontinuance may be detrimental
	to USCI.






	Investors cannot be assured that SummerHaven will be willing or able to continue to service USCI for any
	length of time. SummerHaven was formed for the purpose of providing investment advisory services, and provides these services to USCI on a contractual basis pursuant to a licensing agreement and an advisory agreement. If SummerHaven discontinues its
	activities on behalf of USCI, USCI may be adversely affected. If SummerHavens registration with the CFTC or membership in the NFA were revoked or suspended, SummerHaven would no longer be able to provide services to USCI.






	USCI is a series of the Trust and, as a result, a court could potentially conclude that the assets and liabilities of USCI are not segregated from
	those of another series of the Trust,




	thereby potentially exposing assets in USCI to the liabilities of another series




	of the Trust.






	USCI is a series of a Delaware statutory trust and not itself a separate legal entity. The Delaware Statutory Trust Act provides that if certain provisions are included in the formation and governing
	documents of a statutory trust organized in series and if separate and distinct records are maintained for any series and the assets associated with that series are held in separate and distinct records and are accounted for in such separate and
	distinct records separately from the other assets of the statutory trust, or any series thereof, then the debts, liabilities, obligations and expenses incurred by a particular series are enforceable against the assets of such series only, and not
	against the assets of the statutory trust generally or any other series thereof. Conversely, none of the debts, liabilities, obligations and expenses incurred with respect to any other series thereof shall be enforceable against the assets of such
	series. USCF is not aware of any court case that has interpreted this Inter-Series Limitation on Liability or provided any guidance as to what is required for compliance. USCF intends to maintain separate and distinct records for USCI and account
	for USCI separately from any other series of the Trust, but it is possible a court could conclude that the methods used do not satisfy the Delaware Statutory Trust Act, which would potentially expose assets in one series to the liabilities of
	another series of the Trust.






	USCF and the Trustee are not obligated to prosecute any action, suit or other proceeding in respect of any
	USCI property.






	Neither USCF nor the Trustee is obligated to, although each may in its respective discretion, prosecute
	any action, suit or other proceeding in respect of USCI property. The Trust Agreement does not confer upon shareholders the right to prosecute any such action, suit or other proceeding.






	Third parties may infringe upon or otherwise violate intellectual property rights or assert that USCF has infringed or otherwise violated their intellectual property rights, which may result in
	significant costs and diverted attention.






	It is possible that third parties might utilize USCIs intellectual
	property or technology, including the use of its business methods, trademarks and trading program software, without permission. USCF has a patent for USCIs business method and has registered its trademarks. USCI does not currently have any
	proprietary software. However, it obtains proprietary software in the future, any unauthorized use of USCIs proprietary software and other technology could also adversely affect its competitive advantage. USCI may not have adequate resources
	to implement procedures for monitoring unauthorized uses of its trademarks, proprietary

	software and other technology. Also, third parties may independently develop business methods, trademarks or proprietary software and other technology similar to that of USCF or claim that USCF
	has violated their intellectual property rights, including their copyrights, trademark rights, trade names, trade secrets and patent rights. As a result, USCF may have to litigate in the future to protect its trade secrets, determine the validity
	and scope of other parties proprietary rights, defend itself against claims that it has infringed or otherwise violated other parties rights, or defend itself against claims that its rights are invalid. Any litigation of this type, even
	if USCF is successful and regardless of the merits, may result in significant costs, divert its resources from USCI, or require it to change its proprietary software and other technology or enter into royalty or licensing agreements.

	ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT USCI, ITS INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE AND
	INVESTMENTS





	USCI is a series of the Trust. The Trust operates pursuant to the terms of the Third Amended and
	Restated Declaration of Trust and Trust Agreement dated as of March 22, 2013 (Trust Agreement) which grants full management control to USCF. The Trust Agreement is posted on USCIs website at

	www.unitedstatescommodityfunds.com

	. USCI maintains its main business office at 1999 Harrison Street, Suite 1530, Oakland, California 94612.




	The net assets of USCI consist primarily of investments in Futures Contracts and, to a lesser extent, in order to comply with regulatory requirements or in view of market conditions, Other
	Commodity-Related Investments. Market conditions that USCF currently anticipates could cause USCI to invest in Other Commodity-Related Investments include those allowing USCI to obtain greater liquidity or to execute transactions with more favorable
	pricing.




	USCI invests substantially the entire amount of its assets in Futures Contracts while supporting such investments by
	holding the amounts of its margin, collateral and other requirements relating to these obligations in short-term obligations of the United States of two years or less (Treasuries), cash and cash equivalents. The daily holdings of USCI
	are available on USCIs website at

	www.unitedstatescommodityfunds.com


	.





	USCI invests in Commodity Interests
	to the fullest extent possible without being leveraged or unable to satisfy its current or potential margin or collateral obligations with respect to its investments in Commodity Interests. In pursuing this objective, the primary focus of USCF, is
	the investment in Futures Contracts and the management of USCIs investments in Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents for margining purposes and as collateral.




	USCI seeks to invest in a combination of Commodity Interests such that the daily changes in its NAV, measured in percentage terms, will closely track the changes in the price of the SDCI, also measured in
	percentage terms. As a specific benchmark, USCF endeavors to place USCIs trades in Commodity Interests and otherwise manage USCIs investments so that A will be plus/minus 10 percent of B, where:



	 





	 




	




	 





	A is the average daily percentage change in USCIs NAV for any period of 30 successive valuation days, i.e., any NYSE Arca trading day as of which
	USCI calculates its per share NAV; and






	 





	 




	




	 





	B is the average daily percentage change in the SDCI over the same period.







	USCF believes that market arbitrage opportunities will cause daily changes in USCIs share price on the NYSE Arca to closely track
	the daily changes in USCIs per share NAV. USCF further believes that the daily changes in USCIs NAV in percentage terms will closely track the daily changes in percentage terms in the SDCI, less USCIs expenses.




	The following two graphs demonstrate the correlation between the changes in the NAV of USCI and the changes in the Benchmark Component
	Futures Contracts. The first graph exhibits the daily changes for the last 30 valuation days ended December 31, 2013; the second graph measures monthly changes for the three years ending December 31, 2013.

	*PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS





	USCF employs a neutral investment strategy intended to track the changes in the SDCI regardless of whether the SDCI goes up
	or goes down. USCIs neutral investment strategy is designed to permit investors generally to purchase and sell USCIs shares for the purpose of investing indirectly in the commodities market in a cost-effective manner, and/or
	to permit participants in the commodities or other industries to hedge the risk of losses in their commodity-related transactions. Accordingly, depending on the investment objective of an individual investor, the risks generally associated with
	investing in the commodities market and/or the risks involved in hedging may exist. In addition, an investment in USCI involves the risks that the changes in the price of USCIs shares will not accurately track the daily changes in the SDCI,
	and that changes in the SDCI will not closely correlate with changes in the spot price of the commodities underlying the SDCI.

	Table of Contents




	For example, for the year ended December 31, 2013, the actual total return of USCI as
	measured by changes in its per share NAV was (4.09)%. This is based on an initial per share NAV of $58.45 on December 31, 2012 and an ending per share NAV as of December 31, 2013 of $56.06. During this time period, USCI made no
	distributions to its shareholders. However, if USCIs daily changes in its per share NAV had instead exactly tracked the changes in the daily return of the SDCI, USCI would have had an estimated per share NAV of $56.83 as of December 31,
	2013, for a total return over the relevant time period of (2.77)%. The difference between the actual per share NAV total return of USCI of (4.09)% and the expected total return based on the SDCI of (2.79)% was an error over the time period of
	(1.32)%, which is to say that USCIs actual total return underperformed the SDCI result by that percentage. USCF believes that a portion of the difference between the actual total return and the expected SDCI total return can be attributed to
	the net impact of the expenses that USCI pays, offset in part by the income that USCI collects on its cash and cash equivalent holdings. During the year ended December 31, 2013, USCI earned interest income of $265,555, which is equivalent to a
	weighted average income rate of approximately 0.05% for such period. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2013, USCI also collected $15,750 from its Authorized Purchasers for creating or redeeming baskets of shares. This income also
	contributed to USCIs actual total return. However, if the total assets of USCI continue to increase, USCF believes that the impact on actual total returns of these fees from creations and redemptions will diminish as a percentage of the actual
	total return. During the year ended December 31, 2013, USCI incurred total expenses of $5,820,464. Income from interest and Authorized Purchaser collections net of expenses was $(5,539,159), which is equivalent to a weighted average net income
	rate of approximately (1.09)% for the year ended December 31, 2013.







	What is the SDCI?





	The SDCI is a commodity sector index designed to broadly represent major commodities while overweighting the components that are assessed
	to be in a low inventory state and underweighting the components assessed to be in a high inventory state.




	The SDCI is
	designed to reflect the performance of a fully margined and collateralized portfolio of 14 commodity futures contracts with equal weights, selected each month from a universe of 27 eligible commodity futures contracts. The SDCI is rules-based and
	rebalanced monthly based on observable price signals. In this context, the term rules-based is meant to indicate that the composition of the SDCI in any given month will be determined by quantitative formulas relating to the prices of
	the futures contracts that relate to the commodities that are eligible to be included in the SDCI. Such formulas are not subject to adjustment based on other factors.




	For additional information regarding the SDCI, see Additional Information About the SDCI on page 64.






	Rebalancing Period






	During the Rebalancing Period, existing
	positions are replaced by new positions based on the signals used for contract selection as outlined above. At the end of the first day of the Rebalancing Period, the signals are observed and on the second day a new portfolio is constructed that is
	equally weighted in terms of notional positions in the newly selected contracts.




	The table and chart below show the
	hypothetical performance of the SDCI from December 31, 1997 through December 31, 2013.





	HYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE
	RESULTS HAVE MANY INHERENT LIMITATIONS, SOME OF WHICH ARE DESCRIBED BELOW. NO REPRESENTATION IS BEING MADE THAT USCI WILL OR IS LIKELY TO ACHIEVE PROFITS OR LOSSES SIMILAR TO THOSE SHOWN. IN FACT, THERE ARE FREQUENTLY SHARP DIFFERENCES BETWEEN
	HYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE RESULTS AND THE ACTUAL RESULTS ACHIEVED BY ANY PARTICULAR TRADING PROGRAM.





	 




	21







	Table of Contents





	ONE OF THE LIMITATIONS OF HYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE RESULTS IS THAT THEY ARE GENERALLY
	PREPARED WITH THE BENEFIT OF HINDSIGHT. IN ADDITION, HYPOTHETICAL TRADING DOES NOT INVOLVE FINANCIAL RISK, AND NO HYPOTHETICAL TRADING RECORD CAN COMPLETELY ACCOUNT FOR THE IMPACT OF FINANCIAL RISK IN ACTUAL TRADING. FOR EXAMPLE, THE ABILITY TO
	WITHSTAND LOSSES OR TO ADHERE TO A PARTICULAR TRADING PROGRAM IN SPITE OF TRADING LOSSES ARE MATERIAL POINTS WHICH CAN ALSO ADVERSELY AFFECT ACTUAL TRADING RESULTS. THERE ARE NUMEROUS OTHER FACTORS RELATED TO THE MARKETS IN GENERAL OR TO THE
	IMPLEMENTATION OF ANY SPECIFIC TRADING PROGRAM WHICH CANNOT BE FULLY ACCOUNTED FOR IN THE PREPARATION OF HYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE RESULTS AND ALL OF WHICH CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT ACTUAL TRADING RESULTS.





	Since the SDCI was launched on December 18, 2009, there is only actual performance history of the SDCI from that date to present.
	This data is available for periods prior to December 18, 2009. However, the components of the SDCI and the weighting of the components of the SDCI are established each month based on purely quantitative data that is not subject to revisions
	based on other external factors. As a result, the table below reflects how the SDCI would have performed from December 31, 2003 through December 31, 2013 had it been in effect during such time period. The performance data does not reflect
	any reinvestment or distribution of profits, commission charges, management fees or other expenses that would have been incurred in connection with operating and managing a commodity pool designed to track the SDCI. Such fees and expenses would
	reduce the performance returns shown in the table below.

	U.S. Treasury Bills. The data for the SDCI Total Return Index is derived by using the SDCIs calculation methodology with historical prices for the futures contracts comprising the SDCI. The
	information about each of the indices comes from publicly-available material about such indices but is not designed to provide a thorough overview of the methodology of each index. None of the indices has an investment objective identical to the
	SDCI. As a result, there are inherent limitations in comparing the performance of such indices against the SDCI. For more information about these indices and their methodologies, please refer to the material published by sponsors of each such index
	which may be found on their websites. USCI is not responsible for any information found on such websites, and such information is not part of this Prospectus.




	In the table above, Total Return refers to the return of the relevant index from December 31, 1997 to December 31, 2013; Annualized Volatility is a measure of the amount
	of variation or fluctuation in the returns of the relevant index. Annualized Volatility is calculated by taking the monthly standard deviation of the relevant indexs return and multiplying it by the square root of 12; and Annualized
	Sharpe Ratio is a measure of the total return of each relevant index adjusted by the risk-free interest rate (the 90-Day U.S. Treasury Bill yield) and the volatility of each index. Many investors consider volatility to be a measure of risk,
	and lower volatility of investment returns is considered a positive investment attribute as opposed to higher volatility. Annualized Sharpe Ratio is a standard measure for investors to compare two different investments or indexes that have different
	levels of volatility. If two indexes have the same total return, but one has lower Annualized Volatility, then its Annualized Sharpe Ratio will be higher. The higher the Annualized Sharpe Ratio, the better the risk-adjusted performance. Annualized
	Sharpe Ratio is calculated by taking the average monthly total return of the relevant index and subtracting the then current yield on the 90-Day U.S. Treasury Bill. The annualized return of this series is then divided by the Annualized Volatility of
	this series, and this result is the Annualized Sharpe Ratio for the relevant index. A higher Sharpe Ratio is not a guarantee that one investment or index will in the future produce better risk adjustment total returns, but USCF believes it is a
	useful tool for investors to consider when making investment decisions.

	Impact of Contango and Backwardation on Total Returns





	Contango and backwardation may impact the total return on investment in shares of USCI relative to a hypothetical direct investment in the commodities underlying the Benchmark Component Futures Contracts
	that make up the SDCI and, in the future, it is likely the relationship between the market prices of USCIs shares and changes in the spot prices of the commodities underlying the Benchmark Component Futures Contracts that make up the SDCI
	could be impacted by contango and backwardation. It is important to note that this comparison ignores the potential costs associated with physically owning and storing commodities, which could be substantial.




	The impact of backwardation and contango may cause the total return of USCI to vary significantly from the total return of other price
	references, such as the spot price of the commodities comprising the SDCI. In the event of a prolonged period of contango, and absent the impact of rising or falling commodity prices, it could have a significant negative impact on USCIs NAV
	and total return. However, generally, periods of contango or backwardation do not materially impact USCIs investment objective of having the daily percentage changes in its per share NAV track the daily percentage changes in the price of the
	SDCI since the impact of backwardation




	 




	25







	Table of Contents




	and contango tend to equally impact the daily percentage changes in price of both USCIs shares and the Benchmark Component Futures Contracts. It is impossible to predict with any degree of
	certainty whether backwardation or contango will occur in the future. It is likely that both conditions will occur during different periods.







	What are the Trading Policies of USCI?







	Liquidity






	USCI invests only in Commodity Interests that, in the
	opinion of USCF, are traded in sufficient volume to permit ready taking and liquidation of positions in these financial interests and in Other Commodity-Related Investments that, in the opinion of USCF, may be readily liquidated with the original
	counterparty or through a third party assuming the position of USCI.






	Spot Commodities






	While certain futures contracts can be physically settled, USCI does not intend to take or make physical delivery. However, USCI may from
	time to time trade in Other Commodity-Related Investments based on the spot price of commodities comprising the SDCI.






	Leverage






	USCF endeavors to have the value of USCIs Treasuries, cash and cash equivalents, whether held by USCI or posted
	as margin or other collateral, at all times approximate the aggregate market value of its obligations under its Commodity Interests. Commodity pools trading positions in futures contracts or other related investments are typically required to
	be secured by the deposit of margin funds that represent only a small percentage of a futures contracts (or other commodity interests) entire market value. While USCF does not intend to leverage USCIs assets, it is not prohibited
	from doing so under the Trust Agreement.






	Borrowings






	Borrowings are not used by USCI, unless it is required to borrow money in the event of physical delivery, if it trades in cash commodities, or for short-term needs created by unexpected redemptions.






	OTC Derivatives






	In addition to Futures Contracts, there are also a number of listed options on the Futures Contracts on the principal futures exchanges. These contracts offer investors and hedgers another set of
	financial vehicles to use in managing exposure to the commodities market. Consequently, USCI may purchase options on Futures Contracts on these exchanges in pursuing its investment objective.




	In addition to the Futures Contracts and options on the Futures Contracts, there also exists an active non-exchange-traded market in
	derivatives tied to commodities. These derivatives transactions (also known as OTC contracts) are usually entered into between two parties in private contracts. Unlike most of the exchange-traded Futures Contracts or exchange-traded options on the
	Futures Contracts, each party to such contract bears the credit of the other party, i.e., the risk that the other party may not be able to perform its obligations under its contract. To reduce the credit risk that arises in connection with such
	contracts, USCI will generally enter into an agreement with each counterparty based on the Master Agreement published by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. (ISDA) that provides for the netting of its overall
	exposure to its counterparty.




	USCF assesses or reviews, as appropriate, the creditworthiness of each potential or existing
	counterparty to an OTC contract pursuant to guidelines approved by USCFs Board.




	USCI may enter into certain
	transactions where an OTC component is exchanged for a corresponding futures contract. (Exchange for Risk or EFR transaction.) These EFR transactions may expose USCI to

	counterparty risk during the interim period between the execution of the OTC component and the exchange for a corresponding futures contract. Generally, the counterparty risk from the EFR
	transaction will exist only on the day of execution.




	During the 12 month period ended December 31, 2013, USCI limited
	its derivatives activities to Futures Contracts and EFR transactions.




	During the year ended December 31, 2013, USCI engaged
	21% in trading in futures contracts listed on foreign exchanges, the LME and ICE Europe. However, USCI did not engage in trading in forward contracts, including options on such contracts. USCI anticipates continuing to engage in trading in futures
	contracts listed on the LME and ICE Europe, however USCI does not anticipate trading in forward contracts or options on such contracts, but it may do so as outlined in USCIs listing exemptive order or as permitted under current regulations.

	Since the commencement of the offering of USCI shares to the public on August 10, 2010 to
	January 31, 2014, the simple average daily changes in index was 0.022%, while the simple average daily change in the NAV of USCI over the same time period was 0.017%. The average daily difference was (0.005)% (or (0.5) basis points, where 1
	basis point equals 1/100 of 1%). As a percentage of the daily movement of the index, the average error in daily tracking by the NAV was (12.204)%, meaning that over this time period USCIs tracking error was within the plus or minus 10% range
	established as its benchmark tracking goal.




	The table below shows the relationship between the trading prices of the shares
	and the daily NAV of USCI, since inception through January 31, 2014. The first row shows the average amount of the variation between USCIs closing market price and NAV, computed on a daily basis since inception, while the second and third
	rows depict the maximum daily amount of the end of day premiums and discounts to NAV since inception, on a percentage basis. USCF believes that maximum and minimum end of day premiums and discounts typically occur because trading in the shares
	continues on the NYSE Arca until 4:00 p.m. New York time while regular trading in the benchmark futures contract on the NYMEX ceases at 2:30 p.m. New York time and the value of the relevant benchmark futures contract, for purposes of determining its
	end of day NAV, can be determined at that time.

	negative returns are larger than the positive returns. Worst Peak-to-Valley Draw-down represents the greatest percentage decline from any month-end NAV per share that occurs without such
	month-end NAV per share being equaled or exceeded as of a subsequent month-end. For example, if the NAV per share declined by $1 in each of January and February, increased by $1 in March and declined again by $2 in April, a peak-to-valley
	draw-down analysis conducted as of the end of April would consider that draw-down to be still continuing and to be $3 in amount, whereas if the NAV per share had increased by $2 in March, the January-February draw-down would
	have ended as of the end of February at the $2 level.







	USCIs Operations








	USCF and its Management and Traders





	USCF is a single member limited liability company that was formed in the state of Delaware on May 10, 2005. USCF maintains its main business office at 1999 Harrison Street, Suite 1530, Oakland,

	Wainwright by virtue of his ownership of Wainwrights shares. Wainwright is a holding company that previously owned an insurance company organized under Bermuda law, which has been liquidated, and a registered investment adviser firm named
	Ameristock Corporation, which has been distributed to the Wainwright shareholders. USCF is a member of the National Futures Association (NFA) and registered as a commodity pool operator (CPO) with the Commodity Futures
	Trading Commission (CFTC) on December 1, 2005 and as a Swaps Firm on August 8, 2013. USCF also manages the Related Public Funds. USCF owns 5 shares of USCI.




	USCF is required to evaluate the credit risk of USCI to the FCM, oversee the purchase and sale of USCIs shares by certain
	Authorized Purchasers, review daily positions and margin requirements of USCI, and manage USCIs investments. USCF also pays the fees of the Marketing Agent, the Administrator, and the Custodian. Brown Brothers Harriman & Co.
	(BBH & Co.) serves as USCIs custodian, registrar, transfer Agent, and administrator (Custodian). SummerHaven Investment Management, LLC (SummerHaven) serves as the commodity trading advisor for
	USCI. In no event may the aggregate compensation paid to the Marketing Agent and any affiliate of USCF for distribution-related services in connection with this offering exceed ten percent (10%) of the gross proceeds of this offering.




	The business and affairs of USCF are managed by a board of directors (the Board), which is comprised of three
	management directors (the Management Directors), some of whom are also its executive officers, and three independent directors who meet the independent director requirements established by the NYSE Arca Equities Rules and the
	Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The Management Directors have the authority to manage USCF pursuant its Trust Agreement, as amended from time to time. Through its Management Directors, USCF manages the day-to-day operations of the Trust and USCI. The
	Board has an audit committee, which is made up of the three independent directors (Peter M. Robinson, Gordon L. Ellis and Malcolm R. Fobes III). The audit committee is governed by an audit committee charter that is posted on USCIs website at

	www.unitedstatescommodityfunds.com

	. The Board has determined that each member of the Audit Committee meets the financial literacy requirements of the NYSE Arca and the Audit Committee Charter. The Board has further determined that each of
	Messrs. Ellis and Fobes have accounting or related financial management expertise as required by the NYSE Arca, such that each of them is considered an Audit Committee Finance Expert as such term is defined in Item 407(d)(5) of
	Regulation S-K.

	Melinda Gerber, the Nicholas and Melinda Gerber Living Trust, Howard Mah, Andrew Ngim, Peter Robinson, Gordon Ellis, Malcolm Fobes, John Love, John Hyland, Ray Allen, Carolyn Yu, Wainwright Holdings Inc. and Margaret Johnson. These individuals are
	Principals due to their positions; however, Nicholas Gerber and Melinda Gerber are also Principals due to their controlling stake in Wainwright. None of the Principals owns or has any other beneficial interest in USCI. John Hyland and Andrew Ngim

	September 1, 2008, Newedge USA merged with future commission merchant and broker dealer Newedge Financial Inc. (NFI)  formerly known as Calyon Financial Inc. Newedge USA was the surviving entity.




	In February 2011, Newedge USA settled, without admitting or denying the allegations, a disciplinary action brought by the CFTC alleging
	that Newedge USA exceeded speculative limits in the October 2009 live cattle futures contract on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and failed to provide accurate and timely reports to the CFTC regarding their larger trader positions. Newedge USA paid
	a $140,000 civil penalty and disgorgement value of $80,910 to settle this matter. In addition, the CFTC Order required Newedge USA to implement and maintain a program designed to prevent and detect reporting violations of the CEA and CFTC

	In January 2012, Newedge USA settled, without admitting or denying the allegations, a disciplinary action

	CFTC Order required Newedge USA to timely submit accurate position reports and notices, and to implement and maintain procedures to prevent and detect reporting violations of the CEA and CFTC regulations.




	In July 2013, Newedge USA settled, without admitting or denying the allegations, a matter brought by FINRA, on its behalf and on behalf
	of NYSE/NYSE Arca, BATS and NASDAQ exchanges, involving rules and regulations pertaining to supervision of equities direct market access and sponsored access business, Regulation SHO and books and records retention. In connection with this matter,

	USCF has contractually agreed to cap the management fee paid by USCI at 0.80% per annum effective May 1, 2014. USCF has agreed to keep this agreement in place
	until December 31, 2015. USCF can terminate this agreement after this date at any time in its sole discretion. If this agreement were terminated, the annual management fees paid by USCI to USCF would increase from 0.80% to 0.95%, which would
	negatively impact your total return from an investment in USCI.









	Breakeven Analysis





	The breakeven analysis below indicates the approximate dollar returns and percentage required for the redemption value of
	a hypothetical investment in a single unit to equal the amount invested twelve months after the investment was made. For purposes of this breakeven analysis, an initial selling price per unit of $56.00, which equals the NAV per share on
	January 31, 2014, is assumed. In order for a hypothetical investment in shares to break even over the next 12 months, assuming a selling price of $56.00 per share, the investment would have to generate a 0.88% or $0.49 return.




	This breakeven analysis refers to the redemption of baskets by Authorized Purchasers and is not related to any gains an individual
	investor would have to achieve in order to break even. The breakeven analysis is an approximation only.

	Authorized Purchasers are required to pay a Creation Basket fee of $350 (through May 1, 2015) for each order they place to create one or more baskets. An order must be
	at least one basket, which is 50,000 units. This breakeven analysis assumes a hypothetical investment in a single unit so the Creation Basket fee is $.01 (350/50,000).








	(3)




	This amount is based on the actual brokerage fees for USCI calculated on an annual basis.








	(4)




	USCI earns interest on funds it deposits with the FCM and the Custodian and it estimates that the interest rate will be 0.05% based on the current interest rate on
	three-month Treasuries as of January 31, 2014. The actual rate may vary.

	In connection with its service as Trustee, Wilmington Trust Company is entitled to receive annual fees in the amount of $3,000 for all Funds in the series. The number

	(6)




	USCI assumed the aggregate costs attributable to tax accounting and reporting to be $400,000. This estimate is based on the experience of USCF in its management of the
	Related Public Funds. The number in the break-even table assumes that USCI has $523,587,187 in assets, which is the amount of assets as of January 31, 2014.

	Conflicts of Interest





	There are present and potential future conflicts of interest in USCIs structure and operation you should consider before you
	purchase shares. USCF and SummerHaven will use this notice of conflicts as a defense against any claim or other proceeding made. If USCF or SummerHaven are not able to resolve these conflicts of interest adequately, it may impact USCIs and the
	Related Public Funds ability to achieve their investment objectives.




	The officers, directors and employees of USCF and
	SummerHaven do not devote their time exclusively to USCI. These persons are directors, officers or employees of other entities which may compete with USCI for their services. They could have a conflict between their responsibilities to USCI and to
	those other entities. USCF and SummerHaven believe that they have sufficient personnel, time, and working capital to discharge their responsibilities in a fair manner and that these persons conflicts should not impair their ability to provide
	services to USCI.




	USCF and SummerHaven have adopted policies that prohibit the principals, officers, directors and employees
	of USCF and SummerHaven from trading futures and related contracts for their own account. In addition, USCF has adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics to ensure that the officers, directors, and employees of USCF and its affiliates do not
	engage in trades that will harm USCI or the shareholders. USCF has also adopted Corporate Governance Guidelines. If these provisions are not successful, shareholders may be harmed in that such trades could affect the prices of the Futures Contracts
	purchased by USCI which could affect USCIs ability to track the SDCI.




	USCF has sole current authority to manage the
	investments and operations of USCI, and this may allow it to act in a way that furthers its own interests which may create a conflict with your best interests. Shareholders have very limited voting rights, which will limit their ability to influence
	matters such as amendment of the Trust Agreement, change in USCIs basic investment policy, dissolution of the Trust, or the sale or distribution of USCIs assets.




	USCF serves as the sponsor to USCI and the Related Public Funds. USCF may have a conflict to the extent that its trading decisions for USCI may be influenced by the effect they would have on the other
	funds it manages.




	In addition, USCF is required to indemnify the officers and directors of the Related Public Funds, if the
	need for indemnification arises. This potential indemnification will cause USCFs assets to decrease. If USCFs other sources of income are not sufficient to compensation for the indemnification, then USCF may terminated and you could lose
	your investment.






	Resolution of Conflicts Procedures






	The Trust Agreement provides that whenever a conflict of interest exists between USCF or any of its affiliates, on the one hand, and the Trust, USCI, or any shareholders or any other person, on the other
	hand, USCF shall resolve such conflict of interest considering the relative interest of each party (including its own interest) and the benefits and burdens relating to such interests, any customary or accepted industry practices, and any applicable
	accepted accounting practices or principles.









	Interests of Named Experts and Counsel






	USCF has employed Reed Smith LLP to prepare this prospectus. Neither the law firm nor any other expert hired by USCF on behalf of the
	Trust and USCI to give advice on the preparation of this offering document has been hired on a contingent fee basis. Nor do any of them have any present or future expectation of interest in USCF, Marketing Agent, Authorized Purchasers, Custodian,
	Administrator or other service providers to the Trust and USCI.

	USCFs Responsibilities and Remedies

	

	




	 





	Delegate duties to one or more commodity trading or other advisors, as USCF determines.







	To the extent that a law (common or statutory) or in equity, USCF has duties (including fiduciary duties) and liabilities relating
	thereto to the Trust, USCI, the shareholders or to any other person, USCF will not be liable to the Trust, USCI, the shareholders or to any other person for its good faith reliance on the provisions of the Trust Agreement or this Prospectus unless
	such reliance constitutes gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of USCF.







	Liability and
	Indemnification





	Under the Trust Agreement, USCF, the Trustee and their respective affiliates (collectively, Covered
	Persons) (i) shall have no liability to the Trust, to USCI, or to any shareholder for any loss suffered by the Trust or USCI which arises out of any action or inaction of such Covered Person and (ii) shall not be personally liable
	for the return or repayment of all or any portion of the capital or profits of any shareholder or assignee thereof, in both cases, provided that such Covered Person, in good faith, determined that such course of conduct was in the best interest of
	the Trust or USCI and such course of conduct did not constitute gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Covered Person. A Covered Person shall not be liable for the conduct or willful misconduct of any Administrator or other delegatee
	selected by USCF with reasonable care, provided, however, that the




	 




	37







	Table of Contents




	Trustee and its affiliates shall not, under any circumstances be liable for the conduct or willful misconduct of any Administrator or other delegatee or any other person selected by USCF to
	provide services to the Trust.




	The Trust Agreement also provides that USCF (and any other Covered Person performing services
	on behalf of the Trust or USCI, as applicable, and acting within the scope of USCFs authority as set forth in the Trust Agreement) shall be indemnified by the Trust (or by USCI separately to the extent the matter in question relates to a
	single fund or disproportionately affects a specific fund in relation to another fund) against any losses, judgments, liabilities, expenses and amounts paid in settlement of any claims sustained by it in connection with its activities for the Trust
	or a fund, as applicable, provided that (i) USCF was acting on behalf of or performing services for the Trust or such Fund, as applicable, and has determined, in good faith, that such course of conduct was in the best interests of the Trust or
	such Fund, as applicable and such liability or loss was not the result of gross negligence, willful misconduct, or a breach of the Trust Agreement on the part of USCF and (ii) any such indemnification will only be recoverable from the assets of
	the Trust or of USCI. All rights to indemnification permitted under the Trust Agreement shall not be affected by the dissolution or other cessation to exist of USCF, or the withdrawal, adjudication of bankruptcy or insolvency of USCF, or the filing
	of a voluntary or involuntary petition in bankruptcy under Title 11 of the Bankruptcy Code by or against USCF.




	USCF shall not
	be indemnified for any losses, liabilities or expenses arising from or out of an alleged violation of the U.S. federal or state securities laws unless (i) there has been a successful adjudication on the merits of each count involving alleged
	securities law violations as to the particular indemnitee and the court approves the indemnification of such expenses (including, without limitation, litigation costs), (ii) such claims have been dismissed with prejudice on the merits by a
	court of competent jurisdiction as to the particular indemnitee and the court approves the indemnification of such expenses (including, without limitation, litigation cost) or (iii) a court of competent jurisdiction approves a settlement of the
	claims against a particular indemnitee and finds that indemnification of the settlement and related costs should be made.




	The
	payment of any indemnification shall be allocated, as appropriate, among the series funds in the Trust, including USCI. The Trust and its series shall not incur the cost of that portion of any insurance which insures any party against any liability,
	the indemnification of which is prohibited under the Trust Agreement.




	Expenses incurred in defending a threatened or pending
	civil, administrative or criminal action, suit or proceeding against USCF shall be paid by the Trust in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding, if (i) the legal action relates to the performance of duties or
	services by USCF on behalf of the Trust or any fund, as applicable; (ii) the legal action is initiated by a party other than the Trust or any fund; and (iii) USCF undertakes to repay the advanced funds with interest to the Trust or any
	fund, as applicable, in cases in which it is not entitled to indemnification under the Trust Agreement.




	In the event the
	Trust or any Fund, as applicable, is made a party to any claim, dispute, demand or litigation or otherwise incurs any loss, liability, damage, cost or expense as a result of or in connection with any shareholders (or assignees)
	obligations or liabilities unrelated to the business of the Trust or any Fund, as applicable, such shareholder (or assignees cumulatively) is required under the Trust Agreement to indemnify, defend, hold harmless and reimburse or such fund, as
	applicable, for all such loss, liability, damage, cost and expense incurred, including attorneys and accountants fees.




	The Trustee will not be liable or accountable to the Trust or to any other person or under any other agreement to which the Trust is a party, except for the Trustees own gross negligence or willful
	misconduct. USCF also indemnifies the Trustee (in its capacity as Trustee and individually) and its successors, assigns, legal representatives, officers, directors, shareholders, employees, agents and servants from and against any and all
	liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, taxes (excluding taxes payable by the Trustee on or measured by any compensation received by the Trustee for its services hereunder or any indemnity payments received by the Trustee under the
	Trust Agreement), claims, actions, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) in any way relating to or arising out of the formation, operation or

	termination of the Trust, the execution, delivery and performance of any other agreements to which the Trust is a party or the action or inaction of the Trustee, except for expenses resulting
	from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of any of the indemnified parties.







	Provisions of Law





	According to applicable law, indemnification of USCF is payable only if USCF determined, in good faith, that the act,
	omission or conduct that gave rise to the claim for indemnification was in the best interest of the Trust and USCI and the act, omission or activity that was the basis for such loss, liability, damage, cost or expense was not the result of
	negligence or misconduct and such liability or loss was not the result of negligence or misconduct by USCF, and such indemnification or agreement to hold harmless is recoverable only out of the assets of USCI.






	Provisions of Federal and State Securities Laws






	This offering is made pursuant to federal and state securities laws. The SEC and state securities agencies take the position that indemnification of USCF that arises out of an alleged violation of such
	laws is prohibited unless certain conditions are met.




	These conditions require that no indemnification of USCF or any
	underwriter for USCI may be made in respect of any losses, liabilities or expenses arising from or out of an alleged violation of federal or state securities laws unless: (i) there has been a successful adjudication on the merits of each count
	involving alleged securities law violations as to the party seeking indemnification and the court approves the indemnification; (ii) such claim has been dismissed with prejudice on the merits by a court of competent jurisdiction as to the party
	seeking indemnification; or (iii) a court of competent jurisdiction approves a settlement of the claims against the party seeking indemnification and finds that indemnification of the settlement and related costs should be made, provided that,
	before seeking such approval, USCF or other indemnitee must apprise the court of the position held by regulatory agencies against such indemnification. These agencies are the SEC and the securities administrator of the State or States in which the
	plaintiffs claim they were offered or sold interests.






	Provisions of the 1933 Act and NASAA Guidelines






	Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the 1933 Act may be permitted to USCF or its directors, officers, or persons
	controlling the Trust and USCI, USCI has been informed that SEC and the various State administrators believe that such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the 1933 Act and the North American Securities Administrators
	Association, Inc. (NASAA) commodity pool guidelines and is therefore unenforceable.







	Books and
	Records





	The Trust and USCI keep their books of record and account at the office of USCF located at 1999 Harrison Street,
	Suite 1530, Oakland, California 94612, or at the offices of the Administrator located at 50 Post Office Square, Boston, Massachusetts, 02110, or such office, including of an administrative agent, as it may subsequently designate upon notice. The
	books and records are open to inspection by any person who establishes to the Trusts satisfaction that such person is a shareholder upon reasonable advance notice at all reasonable times during usual business hours of the Trust and USCI.




	The Trust keeps a copy of the Trust Agreement on file in USCFs office which will be available for inspection by any
	shareholder at all times during its usual business hours upon reasonable advance notice.

	U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations





	The following discussion summarizes the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of shares
	of USCI, and the U.S. federal income tax treatment of USCI, as of the date hereof. In general, this discussion is applicable to a shareholder who holds its shares as a capital asset. This summary does not purport to be a complete description of the
	income tax considerations applicable to an investment in shares. For example, we have not described tax consequences that may be relevant to certain types of shareholders subject to special treatment under United States federal income tax laws,
	including dealers or traders in securities, commodities or currencies, financial institutions, tax-exempt entities, insurance companies, persons holding shares as a part of a position in a straddle or as part of a hedging,
	conversion or other integrated transaction for federal income tax purposes, or holders of shares whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar. Furthermore, the discussion below is based upon the provisions of the Code,
	and regulations (Treasury Regulations), rulings and judicial decisions thereunder as of the date hereof, and such authorities may be repealed, revoked or modified (possibly with retroactive effect) so as to result in U.S. federal income
	tax consequences different from those discussed below.




	USCF has received the opinion of Reed Smith LLP, counsel to the Trust,
	that, subject to the conditions, limitations and assumptions stated in this discussion, the material U.S. federal income tax consequences to USCI and to U.S. shareholders and Non-U.S. shareholders (as defined below) will be as described in the
	following




	 




	41







	Table of Contents




	paragraphs. In rendering its opinion, Reed Smith LLP has relied on the facts and assumptions described in this prospectus as well as certain factual representations made by the Trust and USCF.
	This opinion is not binding on the IRS. No ruling has been requested from the IRS with respect to any matter affecting USCI or prospective investors, and the IRS may disagree with the tax positions taken by the Trust. If the IRS were to challenge
	the Trusts tax positions in litigation, they might not be sustained by the courts.




	As used herein, the term U.S.
	Shareholder means a shareholder that is, for United States federal income tax purposes, (i) a citizen or resident of the United States, (ii) a corporation or partnership created or organized in or under the laws of the United States
	or any political subdivision thereof, (iii) an estate the income of which is subject to United States federal income taxation regardless of its source or (iv) a trust (X) that is subject to the supervision of a court within the United
	States and the control of one or more United States persons as described in section 7701(a)(30) of the Code or (Y) that has a valid election in effect under applicable Treasury Regulations to be treated as a United States person. A
	Non-U.S. Shareholder is a holder that is not a U.S. Shareholder. If a partnership holds our shares, the tax treatment of a partner will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. If you are a
	partner of a partnership holding our shares, you should consult your own tax advisor regarding the tax consequences.




	EACH
	PROSPECTIVE INVESTOR IS ADVISED TO CONSULT ITS OWN TAX ADVISOR REGARDING THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF AN INVESTMENT IN SHARES, AS WELL AS ANY APPLICABLE STATE, LOCAL OR FOREIGN TAX CONSEQUENCES, IN LIGHT OF ITS PARTICULAR
	CIRCUMSTANCES.






	Tax Status of the Trust and USCI






	The Trust is organized and operated as a statutory trust in accordance with the provisions of the Trust Agreement and applicable Delaware law. Notwithstanding the Trusts status as a statutory trust
	and USCIs status as a series of that trust, due to the nature of its activities, USCI will be treated as a partnership rather than a trust for United States federal income tax purposes. In addition, the trading of shares on the NYSE Arca will
	cause USCI to be classified as a publicly traded partnership for federal income tax purposes. Under the Code, a publicly traded partnership is generally taxable as a corporation. In the case of an entity (such as USCI) that is not
	registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, however, an exception to this general rule applies if at least 90% of the entitys gross income is qualifying income for each taxable year of its existence. For this purpose,
	qualifying income is defined as including, in pertinent part, interest (other than from a financial business), dividends and gains from the sale or disposition of capital assets held for the production of interest or dividends. In
	addition, in the case of a partnership a principal activity of which is the buying and selling of commodities (other than as inventory) or of futures, forwards and options with respect to commodities, qualifying income includes income
	and gains from commodities and futures, forwards, options and swaps and other notional principal contracts with respect to commodities. In connection with the opinion provided by Reed Smith LLP, the Trust and USCF have represented, among other
	things, the following to Reed Smith LLP:



	 





	 




	




	 





	At least 90% of USCIs gross income for each taxable year will be derived from (i) income and gains from commodities (not held as inventory)
	or futures, forwards, options, OTC swap transactions, cleared swaps and other notional principal contracts with respect to commodities, and (ii) interest income;






	 





	 




	




	 





	USCI is organized and will be operated in accordance with its governing documents and applicable law; and






	 





	 




	




	 





	USCI has not elected, and USCI will not elect, to be classified as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes.







	Based in part on these representations, Reed Smith LLP is of the opinion that USCI will be treated as a partnership that it is not
	taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. USCIs taxation as a partnership rather than a corporation will require USCF to conduct USCIs business activities in such a manner




	 




	42







	Table of Contents




	that it satisfies the qualifying income exception on a continuing basis. No assurance can be given that USCIs operations for any given year will produce income that satisfies the
	requirements of the qualifying income exception. Reed Smith LLP will not review USCIs ongoing compliance with these requirements and will have no obligation to advise the Trust, USCI or USCIs shareholders in the event of any subsequent
	change in the facts, representations or applicable law relied upon in reaching its opinion.




	If USCI failed to satisfy the
	qualifying income exception in any year, other than a failure that is determined by the IRS to be inadvertent and that is cured within a reasonable time after discovery (in which case USCI could be required to pay over amounts determined by the
	IRS), USCI would be taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes and would pay federal income tax on its income at regular corporate rates. In that event, shareholders of USCI would not report their share of USCIs income or loss on
	their returns. In addition, any distributions to shareholders would be treated as ordinary dividends to the extent of USCIs current and accumulated earnings and profits. To the extent a distribution exceeded USCIs earnings and profits,
	it would be treated as a return of capital up to the amount of a shareholders basis in its shares and thereafter as gain from the sale of shares. Accordingly, if USCI were to be taxable as a corporation, it would likely have a material adverse
	effect on the economic return from an investment in USCI and on the value of the shares.




	The remainder of this summary
	assumes that USCI is classified for federal income tax purposes as a partnership that it is not taxable as a corporation.





	U.S.
	Shareholders







	Tax Consequences of Ownership of Shares







	Taxation of USCIs Income.

	No U.S. federal income tax is paid by USCI on its income. Instead, USCI files annual partnership
	returns, and each U.S. Shareholder is required to report on its U.S. federal income tax return its allocable share of USCIs income, gain, loss, deduction and credit reported on USCIs partnership return. These items must be reported
	without regard to the amount (if any) of cash or property the shareholder receives as a distribution from USCI during the taxable year. As a result, if, for example, USCI recognizes ordinary income in the form of interest on Treasuries and other
	investments, and net capital gain from Futures Contracts and Other Commodity-Related Investments for a taxable year, shareholders must report their share of these items regardless of whether USCI makes any distributions to shareholders.
	Consequently, a shareholder may be taxed on income or gain recognized by USCI but receive no cash distribution with which to pay the resulting tax liability, or may receive a distribution that is insufficient to pay such liability. Because USCF
	currently does not intend to make distributions, it is likely that a U.S. Shareholder that is allocated income or gain from a Fund will be required to pay taxes on its allocable share of such income or gain from sources other than USCI
	distributions.





	Monthly Conventions for Allocations of USCIs Profit and Loss and Capital Account Restatement.

	Under Code section 704, the determination of a partners distributive share of any item of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit is governed by the applicable organizational document unless the allocation provided by such document lacks
	substantial economic effect. An allocation that lacks substantial economic effect nonetheless will be respected if it is in accordance with the partners interests in the partnership, determined by taking into account all facts and
	circumstances relating to the economic arrangements among the partners. Subject to the discussion below, concerning certain conventions to be used by USCI, allocations of USCI income pursuant to the Trust Agreement should be considered as having
	substantial economic effect or as being in accordance with a shareholders interest in USCI.




	In situations where a
	partners interest in a partnership is sold or otherwise transferred during a taxable year, the Code generally requires that partnership tax items for the year be allocated to the partner using either an interim closing of the books or a daily
	proration method. USCI intends to allocate tax items using an interim closing of the books method under which income, gain, loss, deductions and credits will be determined on a monthly basis, taking into account USCIs accrued income and
	deductions and gains and losses (both realized




	 




	43







	Table of Contents




	and unrealized) for the month. The tax items for each month during the taxable year will then be allocated among the holders of shares in proportion to the number of shares owned by them as of
	the close of business on the last trading day of the previous month (the monthly allocation convention).




	Under
	the monthly allocation convention, if an investor who held a share as of the close of business on the last trading day of the previous month disposes of a share during the current month, such investor will be treated for purposes of making
	allocations as if it owned the share throughout the current month. For example, an investor who buys a share on April 10 of a year and sells it on May 20 of the same year will be allocated all of the tax items attributable to May (because
	he is deemed to hold it through the last day of May) but will not be allocated any of the tax items attributable to April. The tax items attributable to that share for April will be allocated to the person who is the actual or deemed holder of the
	share as of the close of business on the last trading day of March. Under the monthly convention, an investor who purchases and sells a share during the same month, and therefore does not hold (and is not deemed to hold) the share at the close of
	business on the last trading day of either that month or the previous month, will receive no allocations with respect to that share for any period. Accordingly, investors may receive no allocations with respect to shares that they actually held, or
	may receive allocations with respect to shares attributable to periods that they did not actually hold the shares. Investors who hold a share on the last trading day of the first month of USCIs operation will be allocated the tax items for
	that month, as well as the tax items for the following month, attributable to the share.




	By investing in shares, a U.S.
	Shareholder agrees that, in the absence of new legislation, regulatory or administrative guidance, or judicial rulings to the contrary, it will file its U.S. income tax returns in a manner that is consistent with the monthly allocation convention as
	described above and with the IRS Schedule K-1 or any successor form provided to shareholders by the Trust.




	In addition, for
	any month in which a Creation Basket is issued or a Redemption Basket is redeemed, USCI generally will credit or debit the book capital accounts of its existing shareholders with any unrealized gain or loss, on USCIs assets. For
	this purpose, unrealized gain or loss will be computed based on the lowest fair market value of USCIs assets during the month in which shares are issued or redeemed, which may be different than the value of the assets at the time of an
	issuance or redemption. The capital accounts as adjusted in this manner will be used in making tax allocations intended to account for the differences between the tax basis and fair market value of assets of USCI at the time new shares are issued or
	outstanding shares are redeemed (so-called reverse Code section 704(c) allocations). The intended effect of these adjustments is to equitably allocate among shareholders any unrealized appreciation or depreciation in USCIs assets
	existing at the time of a contribution or redemption for book and tax purposes.




	USCF believes that application of the
	conventions described above is consistent with the intent of the partnership provisions of the Code and that the resulting allocations should have substantial economic effect or otherwise should be respected as being in accordance with
	shareholders interests in USCI for federal income tax purposes. The Code and existing Treasury Regulations do not expressly permit adoption of these conventions, although the monthly allocation convention described above is consistent with a
	semi-monthly method permitted under recently proposed Treasury Regulations, as well as the legislative history for the provisions that requires allocations to appropriately reflect changes in ownership interests. It is possible that the IRS could
	successfully challenge USCIs allocation conventions on the ground that they do not satisfy the technical requirements of the Code or Treasury Regulations, requiring a shareholder to report a greater or lesser share of items of income, gain,
	loss, deduction, or credit than if our conventions were respected. USCF is authorized to revise our allocation method to conform to the requirements of future Treasury Regulations.




	The conventions used by USCI in making tax allocations may cause a shareholder to be allocated more or less income or loss for federal
	income tax purposes than its proportionate share of the economic income or loss realized by USCI during the period it held its shares. This mismatch between taxable and economic income or loss in some cases may be temporary, reversing itself in a
	later year when the shares are sold, but could be permanent. For example, a shareholder could be allocated income accruing before it purchased its shares,




	 




	44







	Table of Contents




	resulting in an increase in the basis of the shares (see Tax Basis of Shares, below). On a subsequent disposition of the shares, the additional basis might produce a capital loss the
	deduction of which may be limited (see Limitations on Deductibility of Losses and Certain Expenses, below).





	Section 754 election.

	USCI intends to make the election permitted by section 754 of the Code, which election is irrevocable
	without the consent of the IRS. The effect of this election is that when a secondary market sale of shares occurs, USCI adjusts the purchasers proportionate share of the tax basis of its assets to fair market value, as reflected in the price
	paid for the shares, as if the purchaser had directly acquired an interest in USCIs assets. The section 754 election is intended to eliminate disparities between a partners basis in its partnership interest and its share of the tax bases
	of the partnerships assets, so that the partners allocable share of taxable gain or loss on a disposition of an asset will correspond to its share of the appreciation or depreciation in the value of the asset since it acquired its
	interest. Depending on the price paid for shares and the tax bases of USCIs assets at the time of the purchase, the effect of the section 754 election on a purchaser of shares may be favorable or unfavorable. In order to make the appropriate
	basis adjustments in a cost effective manner, USCI will use certain simplifying conventions and assumptions. In particular, USCI will obtain information regarding secondary market transactions in its shares and use this information to make
	adjustments to shareholders basis in USCIs assets. It is possible the IRS will successfully assert that the conventions and assumptions applied are improper and require different basis adjustments to be made, which could adversely affect
	some shareholders.





	Section 1256 Contracts.

	Under the Code, special rules apply to instruments constituting
	section 1256 contracts. A section 1256 contract is defined as including, in relevant part: (1) a futures contract that is traded on or subject to the rules of a national securities exchange which is registered with the SEC, a
	domestic board of trade designated as a contract market by the CFTC, or any other board of trade or exchange designated by the Secretary of the Treasury, and with respect to which the amount required to be deposited and the amount that may be
	withdrawn depends on a system of marking to market; and (2) a non-equity option traded on or subject to the rules of a qualified board or exchange. Section 1256 contracts held at the end of each taxable year are treated as if
	they were sold for their fair market value on the last business day of the taxable year (i.e., are marked to market). In addition, any gain or loss realized from a disposition, termination or marking-to-market of a section 1256 contract
	is treated as long-term capital gain or loss to the extent of 60% thereof, and as short-term capital gain or loss to the extent of 40% thereof, without regard to the actual holding period (60  40 treatment).




	Many of USCIs Futures Contracts and some of its Other Commodity-Related Investments will qualify as section 1256
	contracts under the Code. Gain or loss recognized through disposition, termination or marking-to market of USCIs section 1256 contracts will be subject to 60  40 treatment and allocated to shareholders in accordance with the
	monthly allocation convention.





	Limitations on Deductibility of Losses and Certain Expenses.

	A number of different
	provisions of the Code may defer or disallow the deduction of losses or expenses allocated to shareholders by USCI, including but not limited to those described below.




	A shareholders deduction of its allocable share of any loss of USCI is limited to the lesser of (1) the tax basis in its shares or (2) in the case of a shareholder that is an individual or
	a closely held corporation, the amount which the shareholder is considered to have at risk with respect to USCIs activities. In general, the amount at risk will be a shareholders invested capital. Losses in excess of the
	lesser of tax basis or the amount at risk must be deferred until years in which USCI generates additional taxable income against which to offset such carryover losses or until additional capital is placed at risk.




	Non-corporate taxpayers are permitted to deduct capital losses only to the extent of their capital gains for the taxable year plus $3,000
	of other income. Unused capital losses can be carried forward and used to offset capital gains in future years. In addition, a non-corporate taxpayer may elect to carry back net losses on section 1256 contracts to each of the three preceding
	years and use them to offset section 1256 contract gains in




	 




	45







	Table of Contents




	those years, subject to certain limitations. Corporate taxpayers generally may deduct capital losses only to the extent of capital gains, subject to special carryback and carryforward rules.




	Otherwise deductible expenses incurred by non-corporate taxpayers constituting miscellaneous itemized deductions,
	generally including investment-related expenses (other than interest and certain other specified expenses), are deductible only to the extent they exceed 2% of the taxpayers adjusted gross income for the year. Although the matter is not free
	from doubt, we believe the management fees that USCI pays to USCF and other expenses of USCI constitute investment-related expenses subject to the miscellaneous itemized deduction limitation, rather than expenses incurred in connection with a trade
	or business, and will report these expenses consistent with that interpretation. The Code imposes additional limitations on the amount of certain itemized deductions allowable to individuals with adjusted gross income in excess of certain amounts by
	reducing the otherwise allowable portion of such deductions by an amount equal to the lesser of:



	 





	 




	




	 





	3% of the individuals adjusted gross income in excess of certain threshold amounts; or






	 





	 




	




	 





	80% of the amount of certain itemized deductions otherwise allowable for the taxable year.







	Non-corporate shareholders generally may deduct investment interest expense only to the extent of their net investment
	income. Investment interest expense of a shareholder will generally include any interest accrued by USCI and any interest paid or accrued on direct borrowings by a shareholder to purchase or carry its shares, such as interest with respect to a
	margin account. Net investment income generally includes gross income from property held for investment (including portfolio income under the passive loss rules but not, absent an election, long-term capital gains or certain qualifying
	dividend income) less deductible expenses other than interest directly connected with the production of investment income.




	To
	the extent that USCI allocates losses or expenses to you that must be deferred or disallowed as a result of these or other limitations in the Code, you may be taxed on income in excess of your economic income or distributions (if any) on your
	shares. As one example, you could be allocated and required to pay tax on your share of interest income accrued by USCI for a particular taxable year, and in the same year allocated a share of a capital loss that you cannot deduct currently because
	of the limitations discussed above. As another example, you could be allocated and required to pay tax on your share of interest income and capital gain for a year, but be unable to deduct some or all of your share of management fees and/or margin
	account interest incurred by you with respect to your shares. shareholders are urged to consult their own professional tax advisors regarding the effect of limitations under the Code on their ability to deduct their allocable share of USCIs
	losses and expenses.






	Tax Basis of Shares






	A shareholders tax basis in its shares is important in determining (1) the amount of taxable gain it will realize on the sale or other disposition of its shares, (2) the amount of
	non-taxable distributions that it may receive from USCI, and (3) its ability to utilize its distributive share of any losses of USCI on its tax return. A shareholders initial tax basis of its shares will equal its cost for the shares plus
	its share of USCIs liabilities (if any) at the time of purchase. In general, a shareholders share of those liabilities will equal the sum of (i) the entire amount of any otherwise nonrecourse liability of USCI as to
	which the shareholder or an affiliate is the creditor (a partner nonrecourse liability) and (ii) a pro rata share of any nonrecourse liabilities of USCI that are not partner nonrecourse liabilities as to any shareholder.




	A shareholders tax basis in its shares generally will be (1) increased by (a) its allocable share of USCIs taxable
	income and gain and (b) any additional contributions by the shareholder to USCI and (2) decreased (but not below zero) by (a) its allocable share of USCIs tax deductions and losses and (b) any distributions by USCI to the
	shareholder. For this purpose, an increase in a shareholders share of USCIs liabilities will be treated as a contribution of cash by the shareholder to USCI and a decrease in that share will be treated as a distribution of cash by USCI
	to the shareholder. Pursuant to certain IRS rulings, a shareholder will be required to maintain a single, unified basis in all shares that it owns. As a result, when a shareholder that acquired its shares at different prices




	 




	46







	Table of Contents




	sells less than all of its shares, such shareholder will not be entitled to specify particular shares (e.g., those with a higher basis) as having been sold. Rather, it must determine its gain or
	loss on the sale by using an equitable apportionment method to allocate a portion of its unified basis in its shares to the shares sold.





	Treatment of USCI Distributions.

	If USCI makes non-liquidating distributions to shareholders, such distributions generally will not be taxable to the shareholders for federal income tax purposes
	except to the extent that the sum of (i) the amount of cash and (ii) the fair market value (subject to certain adjustments) of marketable securities distributed exceeds the shareholders adjusted basis of its interest in USCI
	immediately before the distribution. Any cash distributions in excess of a shareholders tax basis generally will be treated as gain from the sale or exchange of shares.





	Constructive Termination of the Partnership.

	USCI will be considered to have been terminated for tax purposes if there is a sale or exchange of 50% or more of the total interests in its shares
	within a 12-month period. A termination would result in the closing of USCIs taxable year for all shareholders. In the case of a shareholder reporting on a taxable year other than a fiscal year ending December 31, the closing of
	USCIs taxable year may result in more than 12 months of our taxable income or loss being includable in its taxable income for the year of termination. We would be required to make new tax elections after a termination. A termination could
	result in tax penalties if we were unable to determine that the termination had occurred. Moreover, a termination might either accelerate the application of, or subject us to, any tax legislation enacted before the termination.






	Tax Consequences of Disposition of Shares






	If a shareholder sells its shares, it will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized and its adjusted tax basis for the shares sold. A shareholders amount realized
	will be the sum of the cash or the fair market value of other property received plus its share of any USCI debt outstanding.




	Gain or loss recognized by a shareholder on the sale or exchange of shares held for more than one year will generally be taxable as
	long-term capital gain or loss; otherwise, such gain or loss will generally be taxable as short-term capital gain or loss. A special election is available under the Treasury Regulations that will allow shareholders to identify and use the actual
	holding periods for the shares sold for purposes of determining whether the gain or loss recognized on a sale of shares will give rise to long-term or short-term capital gain or loss. It is expected that most shareholders will be eligible to elect,
	and generally will elect, to identify and use the actual holding period for shares sold. If a shareholder fails to make the election or is not able to identify the holding periods of the shares sold, the shareholder may have a split holding period
	in the shares sold. Under such circumstances, a shareholder will be required to determine its holding period in the shares sold by first determining the portion of its entire interest in USCI that would give rise to long-term capital gain or loss if
	its entire interest were sold and the portion that would give rise to short-term capital gain or loss if the entire interest were sold. The shareholder would then treat each share sold as giving rise to long-term capital gain or loss and short-term
	capital gain or loss in the same proportions as if it had sold its entire interest in USCI.




	Under Section 751 of the
	Code, a portion of a shareholders gain or loss from the sale of shares (regardless of the holding period for such shares), will be separately computed and taxed as ordinary income or loss to the extent attributable to unrealized
	receivables or inventory owned by USCI. The term unrealized receivables includes, among other things, market discount bonds and short-term debt instruments to the extent such items would give rise to ordinary income if
	sold by USCI.




	If some or all of a shareholders shares are lent by its broker or other agent to a third party  for
	example, for use by the third party in covering a short sale  the shareholder may be considered as having made a taxable disposition of the loaned shares, in which case 



	 





	 




	




	 





	the shareholder may recognize taxable gain or loss to the same extent as if it had sold the shares for cash;

	Table of Contents






	 




	




	 





	any of USCIs income, gain, loss or deduction allocable to those shares during the period of the loan will not be reportable by the shareholder
	for tax purposes; and






	 





	 




	




	 





	any distributions the shareholder receives with respect to the shares under the loan agreements will be fully taxable to the shareholder, most likely
	as ordinary income.







	Shareholders desiring to avoid these and other possible consequences of a deemed
	disposition of their shares should consider modifying any applicable brokerage account agreements to prohibit the lending of their shares.






	Other Tax Matters







	Information Reporting.

	The Trust will report tax information to the beneficial owners of shares and the IRS. Shareholders of USCI
	are treated as partners for federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, USCI will furnish its shareholders each year with tax information on IRS Schedule K-1 (Form 1065), which will be used by the shareholders in completing their tax returns. The IRS
	has ruled that assignees of partnership interests who have not been admitted to a partnership as partners but who have the capacity to exercise substantial dominion and control over the assigned partnership interests will be considered partners for
	federal income tax purposes. On the basis of such ruling, except as otherwise provided herein, we will treat as a shareholder any person whose shares are held on their behalf by a broker or other nominee if that person has the right to direct the
	nominee in the exercise of all substantive rights attendant to the ownership of the shares.




	Persons who hold an interest in
	USCI as a nominee for another person are required to furnish to us the following information: (1) the name, address and taxpayer identification number of the beneficial owner and the nominee; (2) whether the beneficial owner is (a) a
	person that is not a U.S. person, (b) a foreign government, an international organization or any wholly-owned agency or instrumentality of either of the foregoing, or (c) a tax-exempt entity; (3) the number and a description of shares
	acquired or transferred for the beneficial owner; and (4) certain information including the dates of acquisitions and transfers, means of acquisitions and transfers, and acquisition cost for purchases, as well as the amount of net proceeds from
	sales. Brokers and financial institutions are required to furnish additional information, including whether they are U.S. persons and certain information on shares they acquire, hold or transfer for their own account. A penalty of $100 per failure,
	up to a maximum of $1,500,000 per calendar year, is imposed by the Code for failure to report such information to USCI. The nominee is required to supply the beneficial owner of the shares with the information furnished to USCI.





	Partnership Audit Procedures.

	The IRS may audit the federal income tax returns filed by USCI. Adjustments resulting from any such
	audit may require each shareholder to adjust a prior years tax liability and could result in an audit of the shareholders own return. Any audit of a shareholders return could result in adjustments of non-partnership items as well
	as USCI items. Partnerships are generally treated as separate entities for purposes of federal tax audits, judicial review of administrative adjustments by the IRS, and tax settlement proceedings. The tax treatment of partnership items of income,
	gain, loss and deduction are determined at the partnership level in a unified partnership proceeding rather than in separate proceedings with the shareholders. The Code provides for one shareholder to be designated as the tax matters
	partner and represent the partnership purposes of these proceedings. The Trust Agreement appoints USCF as the tax matters partner of USCI.





	Tax Shelter Disclosure Rules.

	In certain circumstances the Code and Treasury Regulations require that the IRS be notified of certain reportable transactions through a disclosure
	statement attached to a taxpayers United States federal income tax return. These disclosure rules may apply to transactions irrespective of whether they are structured to achieve particular tax benefits. They could require disclosure by the
	Trust or shareholders if a shareholder incurs a loss in excess of a specified threshold from a sale or redemption of its shares, or possibly in other circumstances. While these rules generally do not require disclosure of a loss recognized on the
	disposition of an asset in which the taxpayer has a qualifying basis (generally a basis equal to the amount of




	 




	48







	Table of Contents




	cash paid by the taxpayer for such asset), they apply to a loss recognized with respect to interests in a pass-through entity, such as the shares, even if the taxpayers basis in such
	interests is equal to the amount of cash it paid. In addition, significant penalties may be imposed in connection with a failure to comply with these reporting requirements.

	Investors should consult their own tax advisors concerning the
	application of these reporting requirements to their specific situation

	.





	Additional Tax on Investment Income.

	For
	taxable years beginning after December 31, 2012, individuals with income in excess of $200,000 ($250,000 in the case of married individuals filing jointly) and certain estates and trusts are subject to an additional 3.8% tax on their net
	investment income, which generally includes income from interest, dividends, annuities, royalties, and rents, and net capital gains (other than certain amounts earned from trades or businesses). Also included as income subject to the
	additional 3.8% tax is income from businesses involved in the trading of financial instruments or commodities.





	Tax-Exempt
	Organizations.

	Subject to numerous exceptions, qualified retirement plans and individual retirement accounts, charitable organizations and certain other organizations that otherwise are exempt from federal income tax (collectively exempt
	organizations) nonetheless are subject to the tax on unrelated business taxable income (UBTI). Generally, UBTI means the gross income derived by an exempt organization from a trade or business that it regularly carries on, the
	conduct of which is not substantially related to the exercise or performance of its exempt purpose or function, less allowable deductions directly connected with that trade or business. If USCI were to regularly carry on (directly or indirectly) a
	trade or business that is unrelated with respect to an exempt organization shareholder of USCI, then in computing its UBTI, the shareholder must include its share of (1) USCIs gross income from the unrelated trade or business, whether or
	not distributed, and (2) USCIs allowable deductions directly connected with that gross income.




	UBTI generally does
	not include dividends, interest, or payments with respect to securities loans and gains from the sale of property (other than property held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business). Nonetheless, income on, and gain from
	the disposition of, debt-financed property is UBTI. Debt-financed property generally is income-producing property (including securities), the use of which is not substantially related to the exempt organizations tax-exempt
	purposes, and with respect to which there is acquisition indebtedness at any time during the taxable year (or, if the property was disposed of during the taxable year, the 12-month period ending with the disposition). Acquisition
	indebtedness includes debt incurred to acquire property, debt incurred before the acquisition of property if the debt would not have been incurred but for the acquisition, and debt incurred subsequent to the acquisition of property if the debt would
	not have been incurred but for the acquisition and at the time of acquisition the incurrence of debt was foreseeable. The portion of the income from debt-financed property attributable to acquisition indebtedness is equal to the ratio of the average
	outstanding principal amount of acquisition indebtedness over the average adjusted basis of the property for the year. USCI currently does not anticipate that it will borrow money to acquire investments; however, USCI cannot be certain that it will
	not borrow for such purpose in the future. In addition, an exempt organization shareholder that incurs acquisition indebtedness to purchase its shares in USCI may have UBTI.




	The federal tax rate applicable to an exempt organization shareholder on its UBTI generally will be either the corporate or trust tax rate, depending upon the shareholders form of organization. USCI
	may report to each such shareholder information as to the portion, if any, of the shareholders income and gains from USCI for any year that will be treated as UBTI; the calculation of that amount is complex, and there can be no assurance that
	USCIs calculation of UBTI will be accepted by the IRS. An exempt organization shareholder will be required to make payments of estimated federal income tax with respect to its UBTI.




	Regulated Investment Companies. Interests in and income from qualified publicly traded partnerships satisfying certain gross
	income tests are treated as qualifying assets and income, respectively, for purposes of determining eligibility for regulated investment company (RIC) status. A RIC may invest up to 25% of its assets in interests in a qualified publicly
	traded partnership. The determination of whether a publicly traded partnership such as USCI is a qualified publicly traded partnership is made on an annual basis. USCI expects to be a qualified publicly traded partnership in each of its taxable
	years. However, such qualification is not assured.

	Non-U.S. Shareholders





	Generally, non-U.S. persons who derive U.S. source income or gain from investing or engaging in a U.S. business are taxable on two categories of income. The first category consists of amounts that are
	fixed, determinable, annual and periodic income, such as interest, dividends and rent that are not connected with the operation of a U.S. trade or business (FDAP). The second category is income that is effectively connected with the
	conduct of a U.S. trade or business (ECI). FDAP income (other than interest that is considered portfolio interest) is generally subject to a 30% withholding tax, which may be reduced for certain categories of income by a
	treaty between the U.S. and the recipients country of residence. In contrast, ECI is generally subject to U.S. tax on a net basis at graduated rates upon the filing of a U.S. tax return. Where a non-U.S. person has ECI as a result of an
	investment in a partnership, the ECI is subject to a withholding tax at a rate of 39.6% for individual shareholders and a rate of 35% for corporate shareholders.





	Withholding on Allocations and Distributions.

	The Code provides that a non-U.S. person who is a partner in a partnership that is engaged in a U.S. trade or business during a taxable year will also
	be considered to be engaged in a U.S. trade or business during that year. Classifying an activity by a partnership as an investment or an operating business is a factual determination. Under certain safe harbors in the Code, an investment fund whose
	activities consist of trading in stocks, securities, or commodities for its own account generally will not be considered to be engaged in a U.S. trade or business unless it is a dealer is such stocks, securities, or commodities. This safe harbor
	applies to investments in commodities only if the commodities are of a kind customarily dealt in on an organized commodity exchange and if the transaction is of a kind customarily consummated at such place. Although the matter is not free from
	doubt, USCI believes that the activities directly conducted by USCI do not result in USCI being engaged in a trade or business within in the United States. However, there can be no assurance that the IRS would not successfully assert that
	USCIs activities constitute a U.S. trade or business.




	In the event that USCIs activities were considered to
	constitute a U.S. trade or business, USCI would be required to withhold at the highest rate specified in Code section 1 (currently 39.6%) on allocations of our income to individual Non-U.S. Shareholders and the highest rate specified in Code Section
	11(b) (currently 35%) on allocations of our income to corporate Non-U.S. Shareholders, when such income is allocated or distributed. A Non-U.S. Shareholder with ECI will generally be required to file a U.S. federal income tax return, and the return
	will provide the Non-U.S. Shareholder with the mechanism to seek a refund of any withholding in excess of such shareholders actual U.S. federal income tax liability. Any amount withheld by USCI will be treated as a distribution to the Non-U.S.
	Shareholder.




	If USCI is not treated as engaged in a U.S. trade or business, a Non-U.S. Shareholder may nevertheless be
	treated as having FDAP income, which would be subject to a 30% withholding tax (possibly subject to reduction by treaty), with respect to some or all of its distributions from USCI or its allocable share of USCIs income. Amounts withheld on
	behalf of a Non-U.S. Shareholder will be treated as being distributed to such shareholder.




	To the extent any interest income
	allocated to a Non-U.S. Shareholder that otherwise constitutes FDAP is considered portfolio interest, neither the allocation of such interest income to the non-U.S. shareholder nor a subsequent distribution of such interest income to the
	non-U.S. Shareholder will be subject to withholding, provided that the Non-U.S. Shareholder is not otherwise engaged in a trade or business in the U.S. and provides USCI with a timely and properly completed and executed IRS Form W-8BEN or other
	applicable form. In general, portfolio interest is interest paid on debt obligations issued in registered form, unless the recipient owns 10% or more of the voting power of the issuer.




	The Trust expects that most of USCIs interest income will qualify as portfolio interest. In order for USCI to avoid
	withholding on any interest income allocable to Non-U.S. Shareholders that would qualify as portfolio interest, it will be necessary for all Non-U.S. Shareholders to provide USCI with a timely and properly completed and executed Form
	W-8BEN (or other applicable form).

	Table of Contents





	Gain from Sale of Shares.

	Gain from the sale or exchange of shares may be taxable to
	a Non-U.S. Shareholder if the Non-U.S. Shareholder is a nonresident alien individual who is present in the U.S. for 183 days or more during the taxable year. In such case, the nonresident alien individual will be subject to a 30% withholding tax on
	the amount of such individuals gain.





	Branch Profits Tax on Corporate Non-U.S. Shareholders.

	In addition to the
	taxes noted above, any Non-U.S. Shareholders that are corporations may also be subject to an additional tax, the branch profits tax, at a rate of 30%. The branch profits tax is imposed on a non-U.S. corporations dividend equivalent amount,
	which generally consists of the corporations after-tax earnings and profits that are effectively connected with the corporations U.S. trade or business but are not reinvested in a U.S. business. This tax may be reduced or eliminated by
	an income tax treaty between the United States and the country in which the Non-U.S. Shareholder is a qualified resident.





	Prospective Non-U.S. Shareholders should consult their own tax advisor with regard to these and other tax issues unique to Non-U.S. Shareholders.








	Backup Withholding





	USCI may be required to withhold U.S. federal income tax (backup withholding) at a rate of 28% from all payments to: (1) any shareholder who fails to furnish USCI with his, her or its
	correct taxpayer identification number or a certificate that the shareholder is exempt from backup withholding, and (2) any shareholder with respect to whom the IRS notifies USCI that the shareholder has failed to properly report certain
	interest and dividend income to the IRS and to respond to notices to that effect. Backup withholding is not an additional tax and may be returned or credited against a taxpayers regular federal income tax liability if appropriate information
	is provided to the IRS.






	Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act Provisions






	Recently enacted legislation that becomes effective after June 30, 2014 generally imposes a 30% withholding tax on payments of certain
	types of income to foreign financial institutions that fail to enter into an agreement with the United States Treasury to report, with respect to accounts held by United States persons (or held by foreign entities that have United States persons as
	substantial owners), certain information. The IRS and the Treasury Department have issued final regulations pursuant to which the full implementation of these rules will be phased in over the next several years, including the obligation to withhold.
	The types of income subject to the tax include U.S.-source interest and dividends and the gross proceeds from the sale of any property that could produce U.S.-source interest or dividends. The information to be reported includes the identity and
	taxpayer identification number of each account holder that is a U.S. person and transaction activity within the holders account. In addition, subject to certain exceptions, payments to foreign entities that are not financial institutions will
	be subject to withholding tax unless the foreign entity certifies that it does not have a greater than 10% U.S. owner or provides the withholding agent with identifying information on each greater than 10% U.S. owner. When these provisions become
	effective, depending on their status and the status of the intermediaries through which they hold their shares, Non-U.S. Shareholders could be subject to this 30% withholding tax with respect to distributions on their shares and proceeds from the
	sale of their shares.







	Other Tax Considerations





	In addition to federal income taxes, shareholders may be subject to other taxes, such as state and local income taxes, unincorporated
	business taxes, business franchise taxes, and estate, inheritance or intangible taxes that may be imposed by the various jurisdictions in which USCI does business or owns property or where the shareholders reside. Although an analysis of those
	various taxes is not presented here, each prospective shareholder should consider their potential impact on its investment in USCI. It is each shareholders responsibility to file the appropriate U.S. federal, state, local, and foreign tax
	returns. Reed Smith LLP has not provided an opinion concerning any aspects of state, local or foreign tax or U.S. federal tax other than those U.S. federal income tax issues discussed herein.

	I


	nvestment by ERISA Accounts







	General






	Most
	employee benefit plans and individual retirement accounts (IRAs) are subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA), or the Code, or both. This section discusses certain considerations that
	arise under ERISA and the Code that a fiduciary of an employee benefit plan as defined in ERISA or a plan as defined in Section 4975 of the Code who has investment discretion should take into account before deciding to invest the plans
	assets in USCI. Employee benefit plans under ERISA and plans under the Code are collectively referred to below as plans, and fiduciaries with investment discretion are referred to below as plan fiduciaries.




	This summary is based on the provisions of ERISA and the Code as of the date hereof. This summary is not intended to be complete, but
	only to address certain questions under ERISA and the Code likely to be raised by your advisors. The summary does not include state or local law.





	Potential plan investors are urged to consult with their own professional advisors concerning the appropriateness of an investment in USCI and the manner in which shares should be purchased.







	Special Investment Considerations






	Each plan fiduciary must consider the facts and circumstances that are relevant to an investment in USCI, including the role that an investment in USCI would play in the plans overall investment
	portfolio. Each plan fiduciary, before deciding to invest in USCI, must be satisfied that the investment is prudent for the plan, that the investments of the plan are diversified so as to minimize the risk of large losses, and that an investment in
	USCI complies with the terms of the plan.






	USCI and Plan Assets






	A regulation issued under ERISA contains rules for determining when an investment by a plan in an equity interest of a statutory trust
	will result in the underlying assets of the statutory trust being deemed plan assets for purposes of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code. Those rules provide that assets of a statutory trust will not be plan assets of a plan that purchases an
	equity interest in the statutory trust if the equity interest purchased is a publicly-offered security. If the underlying assets of a statutory trust are considered to be assets of any plan for purposes of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, the
	operations of that trust would be subject to and, in some cases, limited by the provisions of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code.




	The publicly-offered security exception described above applies if the equity interest is a security that is:



	 





	 




	(1)




	freely transferable (determined based on the relevant facts and circumstances);





	 





	 




	(2)




	part of a class of securities that is widely held (meaning that the class of securities is owned by 100 or more investors independent of the issuer and of each other);
	and





	 





	 




	(3)




	either (a) part of a class of securities registered under Section 12(b) or 12(g) of the Exchange Act or (b) sold to the plan as part of a public offering
	pursuant to an effective registration statement under the 1933 Act and the class of which such security is a part is registered under the Exchange Act within 120 days (or such later time as may be allowed by the SEC) after the end of the fiscal year
	of the issuer in which the offering of such security occurred.






	The plan asset regulations under ERISA state
	that the determination of whether a security is freely transferable is to be made based on all the relevant facts and circumstances. In the case of a security that is part of an offering in which the minimum investment is $10,000 or less, the
	following requirements, alone or in combination, ordinarily will not affect a finding that the security is freely transferable: (1) a requirement that no




	 




	52







	Table of Contents




	transfer or assignment of the security or rights relating to the security be made that would violate any federal or state law; and (2) a requirement that no transfer or assignment be made
	without advance written notice given to the entity that issued the security.




	USCF believes that the conditions described
	above are satisfied with respect to the shares of USCI. USCF believes that the shares of USCI therefore constitute publicly-offered securities, and the underlying assets of USCI should not be considered to constitute plan assets of any plan that
	purchases shares.






	Prohibited Transactions






	ERISA and the Code generally prohibit certain transactions involving a plan and persons who have certain specified relationships to the plan. In general, shares may not be purchased with the assets of a
	plan if USCF, the clearing brokers, the trading advisors (if any), or any of their affiliates, agents or employees either:



	 





	 




	




	 





	exercise any discretionary authority or discretionary control with respect to management of the plan;






	 





	 




	




	 





	exercise any authority or control with respect to management or disposition of the assets of the plan;






	 





	 




	




	 





	render investment advice for a fee or other compensation, direct or indirect, with respect to any moneys or other property of the plan;






	 





	 




	




	 





	have any authority or responsibility to render investment advice with respect to any money or other property of the plan; or






	 





	 




	




	 





	have any discretionary authority or discretionary responsibility in the administration of the plan.







	Also, a prohibited transaction may occur under ERISA or the Code when circumstances indicate that (1) the investment in shares is
	made or retained for the purpose of avoiding application of the fiduciary standards of ERISA, (2) the investment in shares constitutes an arrangement under which USCI is expected to engage in transactions that would otherwise be prohibited if
	entered into directly by the plan purchasing the shares, (3) the investing plan, by itself, has the authority or influence to cause USCI to engage in such transactions, or (4) a person who is prohibited from transacting with the investing
	plan may, but only with the aid of certain of its affiliates and the investing plan, cause USCI to engage in such transactions with such person.






	Special IRA Rules






	IRAs are not subject to ERISAs fiduciary
	standards, but are subject to their own rules, including the prohibited transaction rules of Section 4975 of the Code, which generally mirror ERISAs prohibited transaction rules. For example, IRAs are subject to special custody rules and
	must maintain a qualifying IRA custodial arrangement separate and distinct from USCI and its custodial arrangement. If a separate qualifying custodial arrangement is not maintained, an investment in the shares will be treated as a distribution from
	the IRA. Second, IRAs are prohibited from investing in certain commingled investments, and USCF makes no representation regarding whether an investment in shares is an inappropriate commingled investment for an IRA. Third, in applying the prohibited
	transaction provisions of Section 4975 of the Code, in addition to the rules summarized above, the individual for whose benefit the IRA is maintained is also treated as the creator of the IRA. For example, if the owner or beneficiary of an IRA
	enters into any transaction, arrangement, or agreement involving the assets of his or her IRA to benefit the IRA owner or beneficiary (or his or her relatives or business affiliates) personally, or with the understanding that such benefit will
	occur, directly or indirectly, such transaction could give rise to a prohibited transaction that is not exempted by any available exemption. Moreover, in the case of an IRA, the consequences of a non-exempt prohibited transaction are that the
	IRAs assets will be treated as if they were distributed, causing immediate taxation of the assets (including any early distribution penalty tax applicable under Section 72 of the Code), in addition to any other fines or penalties that may
	apply.

	Exempt Plans






	Certain employee benefit plans may be governmental plans or church plans. Governmental plans and church plans are generally not subject to ERISA, nor do the prohibited transaction provisions described
	above apply to them. These plans are, however, subject to prohibitions against certain related-party transactions under Section 503 of the Code, which are similar to the prohibited transaction rules described above. In addition, the fiduciary
	of any governmental or church plan must consider any applicable state or local laws and any restrictions and duties of common law imposed upon the plan.




	No view is expressed as to whether an investment in USCI (and any continued investment in USCI), or the operation and administration of USCI, is appropriate or permissible for any governmental plan or
	church plan under Code Section 503, or under any state, county, local or other law relating to that type of plan.





	Allowing an investment in USCI is not to be construed as a representation by the Trust, USCI, USCF, any trading advisor, any clearing
	broker, the Marketing Agent or legal counsel or other advisors to such parties or any other party that this investment meets some or all of the relevant legal requirements with respect to investments by any particular plan or that this investment is
	appropriate for any such particular plan. The person with investment discretion should consult with the plans attorney and financial advisors as to the propriety of an investment in USCI in light of the circumstances of the particular plan,
	current tax law and ERISA.








	Form of Shares







	Registered Form






	Shares are issued in registered form in accordance
	with the Trust Agreement. The Administrator has been appointed registrar and transfer agent for the purpose of transferring shares in certificated form. The Administrator keeps a record of all shareholders and holders of the shares in certified form
	in the registry (Register). USCF recognizes transfers of shares in certificated form only if done in accordance with the Trust Agreement. The beneficial interests in such shares are held in book-entry form through participants and/or
	accountholders in DTC.






	Book Entry






	Individual certificates are not issued for the shares. Instead, shares are represented by one or more global certificates, which are deposited by the Administrator with DTC and registered in the name of
	Cede & Co., as nominee for DTC. The global certificates evidence all of the shares outstanding at any time. Shareholders are limited to (1) participants in DTC such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies (DTC
	Participants), (2) those who maintain, either directly or indirectly, a custodial relationship with a DTC Participant (Indirect Participants), and (3) those who hold interests in the shares through DTC Participants or
	Indirect Participants, in each case who satisfy the requirements for transfers of shares. DTC Participants acting on behalf of investors holding shares through such participants accounts in DTC will follow the delivery practice applicable to
	securities eligible for DTCs Same-Day Funds Settlement System. Shares are credited to DTC Participants securities accounts following confirmation of receipt of payment.






	DTC






	DTC has advised us as follows: It is a limited purpose trust
	company organized under the laws of the State of New York and is a member of the Federal Reserve System, a clearing corporation within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code and a clearing agency registered
	pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Exchange Act. DTC holds securities for DTC Participants and facilitates the clearance and settlement of transactions between DTC Participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of
	DTC Participants.




	 




	54







	Table of Contents







	Transfer of Shares





	The shares are only transferable through the book-entry system of DTC. Shareholders who are not DTC Participants may transfer their shares
	through DTC by instructing the DTC Participant holding their shares (or by instructing the Indirect Participant or other entity through which their shares are held) to transfer the shares. Transfers are made in accordance with standard securities
	industry practice.




	Transfers of interests in shares with DTC are made in accordance with the usual rules and operating
	procedures of DTC and the nature of the transfer. DTC has established procedures to facilitate transfers among the participants and/or accountholders of DTC. Because DTC can only act on behalf of DTC Participants, who in turn act on behalf of
	Indirect Participants, the ability of a person or entity having an interest in a global certificate to pledge such interest to persons or entities that do not participate in DTC, or otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be affected
	by the lack of a certificate or other definitive document representing such interest.




	DTC has advised us that it will take
	any action permitted to be taken by a shareholder (including, without limitation, the presentation of a global certificate for exchange) only at the direction of one or more DTC Participants in whose account with DTC interests in global certificates
	are credited and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of the global certificate as to which such DTC Participant or Participants has or have given such direction.





	Inter-Series Limitation on Liability





	Because the Trust was established as
	a Delaware statutory trust, each series established under the Trust will be operated so that it will be liable only for obligations attributable to such series and will not be liable for obligations of any other series or affected by losses of any
	other series. If any creditor or shareholder of any particular series asserts against the series a valid claim with respect to its indebtedness or shares, the creditor or shareholder will only be able to obtain recovery from the assets of that
	series and not from the assets of any other series or the Trust generally. The assets of each series will include only those funds and other assets that are paid to, held by or distributed to the series on account of and for the benefit of that
	series, including, without limitation, amounts delivered to the Trust for the purchase of shares in a series. This limitation on liability is referred to as the Inter-Series Limitation on Liability. The Inter-Series Limitation on Liability is
	expressly provided for under the Delaware Statutory Trust Act, which provides that if certain conditions (as set forth in Section 3804(a)) are met, then the debts of any particular series will be enforceable only against the assets of such
	series and not against the assets of any other series or the Trust generally. In furtherance of the Inter-Series Limitation on Liability, every party providing services to the Trust, USCI or the USCF on behalf of the Trust or USCI, will acknowledge
	and consent in writing to the Inter-Series Limitation on Liability with respect to such partys claims.




	The existence of
	a Trustee should not be taken as an indication of any additional level of management or supervision over USCI. To the greatest extent permissible under Delaware law, the Trustee acts in an entirely passive role, delegating all authority for the
	management and operation of USCI and the Trust to USCF. The Trustee does not provide custodial services with respect to the assets of USCI.





	Recognition of the Trust in Certain States





	A number of states do not have statutory trust statutes such as that under which the Trust has been formed in the State of Delaware. It is possible, although unlikely, that a court in such
	state could hold that, due to the absence of any statutory provision to the contrary in such jurisdiction, the shareholders, although entitled under Delaware law to the same limitation on personal liability as stockholders in a private corporation
	for profit organized under the laws of the State of Delaware, are not so entitled in such state. To protect shareholders against any loss of limited liability, the Trust Agreement provides that each written obligation undertaken by USCF on behalf of
	the Trust or USCI shall give notice that the obligation is not binding upon the shareholders individually but is binding only upon the assets and property of USCI, and no resort shall be had to the shareholders personal property for
	satisfaction of such obligation. Furthermore, the Trust and USCI indemnify all shareholders of USCI against any




	 




	55







	Table of Contents




	liability that such shareholders might incur solely based on their status as shareholders of one or more shares (other than for taxes for which such shareholder is liable under the Trust
	Agreement).










	What is the Plan of Distribution?







	Buying and Selling Shares






	Most investors buy and sell shares of
	USCI in secondary market transactions through brokers. Shares trade on the NYSE Arca under the ticker symbol USCI. Shares are bought and sold throughout the trading day like other publicly traded securities. When buying or selling shares
	through a broker, most investors incur customary brokerage commissions and charges. Shareholders are encouraged to review the terms of their brokerage account for details on applicable charges.






	Marketing Agent and Authorized Purchasers






	The offering of USCIs shares is a best efforts offering. USCI continuously offers Creation Baskets consisting of 50,000 shares through the Marketing Agent, to Authorized Purchasers. Authorized
	Purchasers pay a $350 transaction fee for each order they place to create or redeem one or more baskets through May 1, 2015; after May 1, 2015, the fee increases to $1,000. The Marketing Agent receives, for its services as marketing agent
	to USCI, a marketing fee of 0.06% on USCIs assets up to the first $3 billion and 0.04% on USCIs assets in excess of $3 billion, provided, however, that in no event may the aggregate compensation paid to the Marketing Agent and any
	affiliate of USCF for distribution-related services in connection with this offering exceed ten percent (10%) of the gross proceeds of this offering.




	The offering of baskets is being made in compliance with Conduct Rule 2310 of FINRA. Accordingly, Authorized Purchasers will not make any sales to any account over which they have discretionary authority
	without the prior written approval of a purchaser of shares.




	The per share price of shares offered in Creation Baskets on any
	subsequent day will be the total NAV of USCI calculated shortly after the close of the NYSE Arca on that day divided by the number of issued and outstanding shares of USCI. An Authorized Purchaser is not required to sell any specific number or
	dollar amount of shares.




	By executing an Authorized Purchaser Agreement, an Authorized Purchaser becomes part of the group of
	parties eligible to purchase baskets from, and put baskets for redemption to, USCI. An Authorized Purchaser is under no obligation to create or redeem baskets or to offer to the public shares of any baskets it does create.




	As of December 31, 2013, USCI had the following authorized purchasers: Citadel Securities LLC, Credit Suisse Securities USA LLC,
	Jefferies & Company Inc., JP Morgan Securities Inc., Merrill Lynch Professional Clearing Corp., Morgan Stanley & Company Inc., NewEdge USA LLC and Virtu Financial BD LLC.




	Because new shares can be created and issued on an ongoing basis, at any point during the life of USCI, a distribution, as
	such term is used in the 1933 Act, will be occurring. Authorized Purchasers, other broker-dealers and other persons are cautioned that some of their activities may result in their being deemed participants in a distribution in a manner that would
	render them statutory underwriters and subject them to the prospectus-delivery and liability provisions of the 1933 Act. For example, the initial Authorized Purchaser will be a statutory underwriter with respect to the initial purchase of Creation
	Baskets. Any purchaser who purchases shares with a view towards distribution of such shares may be deemed to be a statutory underwriter. In addition, an Authorized Purchaser, other broker-dealer firm or its client will be deemed a statutory
	underwriter if it purchases a basket from USCI, breaks the basket down into the constituent shares and sells the shares to its customers; or if it chooses to couple the creation of a supply of new shares with an active selling effort involving
	solicitation of secondary market demand for the shares. In contrast, Authorized Purchasers may engage in secondary market or other transactions in




	 




	56







	Table of Contents




	shares that would not be deemed underwriting. For example, an Authorized Purchaser may act in the capacity of a broker or dealer with respect to shares that were previously
	distributed by other Authorized Purchasers. A determination of whether a particular market participant is an underwriter must take into account all the facts and circumstances pertaining to the activities of the broker-dealer or its client in the
	particular case, and the examples mentioned above should not be considered a complete description of all the activities that would lead to designation as an underwriter and subject them to the prospectus-delivery and liability provisions of the 1933
	Act.




	Dealers who are neither Authorized Purchasers nor underwriters but are nonetheless participating in a
	distribution (as contrasted to ordinary secondary trading transactions), and thus dealing with shares that are part of an unsold allotment within the meaning of Section 4(3)(C) of the 1933 Act, would be unable to take advantage of
	the prospectus-delivery exemption provided by Section 4(3) of the 1933 Act.




	USCF intends any broker-dealers selling
	shares will be members of FINRA. Investors intending to create or redeem baskets through Authorized Purchasers in transactions not involving a broker-dealer registered in such investors state of domicile or residence should consult their legal
	advisor regarding applicable broker-dealer regulatory requirements under the state securities laws prior to such creation or redemption.




	While the Authorized Purchasers may be indemnified by USCF, they will not be entitled to receive a discount or commission from the Trust or USCF for their purchases of Creation Baskets.







	Calculating NAV





	USCIs NAV is calculated by:



	 





	 




	




	 





	Taking the current market value of its total assets;






	 





	 




	




	 





	Subtracting any liabilities; and






	 





	 




	




	 





	Dividing that total by the total number of outstanding shares.







	The Administrator calculates the NAV of USCI once each NYSE Arca trading day. The NAV for a particular trading day will be released after
	4:00 p.m. New York time. Trading during the core trading session on the NYSE Arca typically closes at 4:00 p.m. New York time. The Administrator uses the closing prices on the relevant Futures Exchanges of the Benchmark Component Futures Contracts
	(determined at the earlier of the close of such exchange or 2:30 p.m. New York time) for the contracts traded on the Futures Exchanges, but calculates or determines the value of all other USCI investments using market quotations, if available, or
	other information customarily used to determine the fair value of such investments as of the earlier of the close of the NYSE Arca or 4:00 p.m. New York time in accordance with the current Administrative Agency Agreement among BBH & Co.,
	USCI and USCF. Other information customarily used in determining fair value includes information consisting of market data in the relevant market supplied by one or more third parties including, without limitation, relevant rates,
	prices, yields, yield curves, volatilities, spreads, correlations or other market data in the relevant market; or information of the types described above from internal sources if that information is of the same type used by USCI in the regular
	course of its business for the valuation of similar transactions. The information may include costs of funding, to the extent costs of funding are not and would not be a component of the other information being utilized. Third parties supplying
	quotations or market data may include, without limitation, dealers in the relevant markets, end-users of the relevant product, information vendors, brokers and other sources of market information.




	In addition, in order to provide updated information relating to USCI for use by investors and market professionals, the NYSE Arca will
	calculate and disseminate throughout the core trading session on each trading day an updated indicative fund value. The indicative fund value will be calculated by using the prior days closing NAV per share of USCI as a base and updating that
	value throughout the trading day to reflect changes in the most recently reported price level of the SDCI as reported by Bloomberg or another reporting service.




	 




	57







	Table of Contents




	The indicative fund value share basis disseminated during NYSE Arca core trading session
	hours should not be viewed as an actual real time update of the NAV, because NAV is calculated only once at the end of each trading day based upon the relevant end of day values of USCIs investments.




	The indicative fund value will be disseminated on a per share basis every 15 seconds during regular NYSE Arca core trading session hours
	of 9:30 a.m. New York time to 4:00 p.m. New York time. The normal trading hours of the Futures Exchanges vary, with some Futures Exchanges ending their trading hours before the close of the core trading session on NYSE Arca (for example, the normal
	trading hours of the NYMEX are 10:00 a.m. New York time to 2:30 p.m. New York time). When USCI holds Benchmark Component Futures Contracts from Futures Exchanges with different trading hours than the NYSE Arca there will be a gap in time at the
	beginning and/or the end of each day during which USCIs shares are traded on the NYSE Arca, but real-time Futures Exchange trading prices for Benchmark Component Futures Contracts traded on such Futures Exchanges are not available. During such
	gaps in time the indicative fund value- will be calculated based on the end of day price of such Applicable Benchmark Component Futures Contracts from Futures Exchanges immediately preceding trading session. In addition, Other Commodity-Related
	Investments and Treasuries held by USCI will be valued by the Administrator, using rates and points received from client-approved third party vendors (such as Reuters and WM Company) and advisor quotes. These investments will not be included in the
	indicative fund value.




	The NYSE Arca will disseminate the indicative fund value through the facilities of CTA/CQ High Speed
	Lines. In addition, the indicative fund value will be published on the NYSE Arcas website and will be available through on-line information services such as Bloomberg and Reuters.




	Dissemination of the indicative fund value provides additional information that is not otherwise available to the public and is useful to
	investors and market professionals in connection with the trading of USCIs shares on the NYSE Arca. Investors and market professionals will be able throughout the trading day to compare the market price of USCI and the indicative fund value.
	If the market price of USCIs shares diverges significantly from the indicative fund value, market professionals will have an incentive to execute arbitrage trades. For example, if USCI appears to be trading at a discount compared to the
	indicative fund value, a market professional could buy USCIs shares on the NYSE Arca and sell short futures contracts. Such arbitrage trades can tighten the tracking between the market price of USCI and the indicative fund value and thus can
	be beneficial to all market participants.







	Creation and Redemption of Shares





	USCI creates and redeems shares from time to time, but only in one or more Creation Baskets or Redemption Baskets. The creation and
	redemption of baskets are only made in exchange for delivery to USCI or the distribution by USCI of the amount of Treasuries and/or cash equal to the combined NAV of the number of shares included in the baskets being created or redeemed determined
	as of 4:00 p.m. New York time on the day the order to create or redeem baskets is properly received.




	Authorized Purchasers
	are the only persons that may place orders to create and redeem baskets. Authorized Purchasers must be (1) registered broker-dealers or other securities market participants, such as banks and other financial institutions, that are not required
	to register as broker-dealers to engage in securities transactions described below, and (2) DTC Participants. To become an Authorized Purchaser, a person must enter into an Authorized Purchaser Agreement with USCF. The Authorized Purchaser
	Agreement provides the procedures for the creation and redemption of baskets and for the delivery of the Treasuries and any cash required for such creation and redemptions. The Authorized Purchaser Agreement and the related procedures attached
	thereto may be amended by USCI, without the consent of any limited partner or shareholder or Authorized Purchaser. Authorized Purchasers pay a transaction fee of $350 to USCI through May 1, 2015 for each order they place to create or redeem one
	or more baskets; on and after May 2, 2015, the fee increases to $1,000. Authorized Purchasers who make deposits with USCI in exchange for baskets receive no fees, commission or other form of compensation or inducement of any kind from either
	USCI or USCF, and no such person will have any obligation or responsibility to USCF or USCI to effect any sale or resale of shares.




	 




	58







	Table of Contents




	Certain Authorized Purchasers are expected to be capable of participating directly in the
	physical commodity and the Commodity Interest markets. Some Authorized Purchasers or their affiliates may from time to time buy or sell commodities or Commodity Interests and may profit in these instances. USCF believes that the size and operation
	of the commodities market make it unlikely that Authorized Purchasers direct activities in the commodities or securities markets will significantly affect the price of commodities, Commodity Interests, or USCIs shares.




	Each Authorized Purchaser will be required to be registered as a broker-dealer under the Exchange Act and a member in good standing with
	FINRA, or exempt from being or otherwise not required to be licensed as a broker-dealer or a member of FINRA, and will be qualified to act as a broker or dealer in the states or other jurisdictions where the nature of its business so requires.
	Certain Authorized Purchasers may also be regulated under federal and state banking laws and regulations. Each Authorized Purchaser has its own set of rules and procedures, internal controls and information barriers as it determines is appropriate
	in light of its own regulatory regime.




	Under the Authorized Purchaser Agreement, USCF has agreed to indemnify the Authorized
	Purchasers against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the 1933 Act, and to contribute to the payments the Authorized Purchasers may be required to make in respect of those liabilities.




	The following description of the procedures for the creation and redemption of baskets is only a summary and an investor should refer to
	the relevant provisions of the Trust Agreement and the form of Authorized Purchaser Agreement for more detail. The Trust Agreement is attached to this prospectus. The form of Authorized Purchaser Agreement is filed as an exhibit to the registration
	statement of which this prospectus is a part. See Where You Can Find More Information for information about where you can obtain the registration statement.






	Creation Procedures






	On any business day, an Authorized Purchaser
	may place an order with the Marketing Agent to create one or more baskets. For purposes of processing purchase and redemption orders, a business day means any day other than a day when the NYSE Arca, the New York Stock Exchange, or any
	of the Futures Exchanges upon which a Benchmark Component Futures Contract is traded is closed for regular trading. Purchase orders must be placed by 10:30 a.m. New York time or the close of regular trading on the NYSE Arca, whichever is earlier.
	The day on which the Marketing Agent receives a valid purchase order is referred to as the purchase order date.




	By placing a
	purchase order, an Authorized Purchaser agrees to deposit Treasuries, cash or a combination of Treasuries and cash with the Trust, as described below. Prior to the delivery of baskets for a purchase order, the Authorized Purchaser must also have
	wired to the Custodian the non-refundable transaction fee due for the purchase order. Authorized Purchasers may not withdraw a creation request.




	The manner by which creations are made is dictated by the terms of the Authorized Purchaser Agreement. By placing a purchase order, an Authorized Purchaser agrees to (1) deposit Treasuries, cash, or
	a combination of Treasuries and cash with the Custodian of the Fund, and (2) if required by USCF in its sole discretion, enter into or arrange for a block trade, an exchange for physical or exchange for swap, or any other OTC transaction
	(through itself or a designated acceptable broker) with USCI for the purchase of a number and type of futures contracts at the closing settlement price for such contracts on the purchase order date. If an Authorized Purchaser fails to consummate
	(1) and (2), the order shall be cancelled. The number and type of contracts specified shall be determined by USCF, in its sole discretion, to meet USCIs investment objective and shall be purchased as a result of the Authorized
	Purchasers purchase of shares.






	Determination of Required Deposits






	The total deposit required to create each basket (Creation Basket Deposit) is the amount of Treasuries and/or cash that is in
	the same proportion to the total assets of USCI (net of estimated accrued but unpaid fees,




	 




	59







	Table of Contents




	expenses and other liabilities) on the purchase order date as the number of shares to be created under the purchase order is in proportion to the total number of shares outstanding on the
	purchase order date. USCF determines, directly in its sole discretion or in consultation with the Administrator, the requirements for Treasuries and cash, including the remaining maturities of the Treasuries and proportions of Treasuries and cash,
	that may be included in deposits to create baskets. The Marketing Agent will publish an estimate of the Creation Basket Deposit requirements at the beginning of each business day.






	Delivery of Required Deposits






	An Authorized Purchaser who places a
	purchase order is responsible for transferring to USCIs account with the Custodian the required amount of Treasuries and/or cash by noon New York time on the third business day following the purchase order date. Upon receipt of the deposit
	amount, the Administrator will direct DTC to credit the number of baskets ordered to the Authorized Purchasers DTC account on the third business day following the purchase order date. The expense and risk of delivery and ownership of
	Treasuries until such Treasuries have been received by the Custodian on behalf of USCI shall be borne by solely by the Authorized Purchaser.




	Because orders to purchase baskets must be placed by 10:30 a.m., New York time, but the total payment required to create a basket during the continuous offering period will not be determined until 4:00
	p.m., New York time, on the date the purchase order is received, Authorized Purchasers will not know the total amount of the payment required to create a basket at the time they submit an irrevocable purchase order for the basket. USCIs NAV
	and the total amount of the payment required to create a basket could rise or fall substantially between the time an irrevocable purchase order is submitted and the time the amount of the purchase price in respect thereof is determined.






	Rejection of Purchase Orders






	USCF acting by itself or through the Marketing Agent shall have the absolute right, but shall have no obligation, to reject any purchase order or Creation Basket Deposit if USCF determines that:



	 





	 




	




	 





	the purchase order or Creation Basket Deposit is not in proper form;






	 





	 




	




	 





	it would not be in the best interest of the shareholders of USCI;






	 





	 




	




	 





	due to position limits or otherwise, investment alternatives that will enable USCI to meet its investment objective are not available to USCI at that
	time;






	 





	 




	




	 





	the acceptance of the purchase order or the Creation Basket Deposit would have adverse tax consequences to USCI or its shareholders;






	 





	 




	




	 





	the acceptance or receipt of which would, in the opinion of counsel to USCF, be unlawful; or






	 





	 




	




	 





	circumstances outside the control of USCF, the Marketing Agent or the Custodian make it, for all practical purposes, not feasible to process Creations
	Baskets (including if USCF determines that the investments available to USCI at that time will not enable it to meet its investment objective).







	None of USCF, the Marketing Agent or the Custodian will be liable for the rejection of any purchase order or Creation Basket Deposit.






	Redemption Procedures






	The procedures by which an Authorized
	Purchaser can redeem one or more baskets mirror the procedures for the creation of baskets. On any business day, an Authorized Purchaser may place an order with the Marketing Agent to redeem one or more baskets. Redemption orders must be placed by
	10:30 a.m. New York time or the close of regular trading on the NYSE Arca, whichever is earlier. A redemption order so received will be effective on the date it is received in satisfactory form by the Marketing Agent. The redemption procedures allow




	 




	60







	Table of Contents




	Authorized Purchasers to redeem baskets and do not entitle an individual shareholder to redeem any shares in an amount less than a Redemption Basket, or to redeem baskets other than through an
	Authorized Purchaser.




	By placing a redemption order, an Authorized Purchaser agrees to deliver the baskets to be redeemed
	through DTCs book-entry system to USCI not later than noon New York time on the third business day following the effective date of the redemption order. Prior to the delivery of the redemption distribution for a redemption order, the
	Authorized Purchaser must also have wired to USCFs account at the Custodian the non-refundable transaction fee due for the redemption order. An Authorized Purchaser may not withdraw a redemption order.




	The manner by which redemptions are made is dictated by the terms of the Authorized Purchaser Agreement. By placing a redemption order,
	an Authorized Purchaser agrees to (1) deliver the Redemption Basket to be redeemed through DTCs book-entry system to the Funds account with the Custodian no later than 3:00 p.m. New York time on the third business day following
	the effective date of the redemption order (Redemption Order Date), and (2) if required by USCF in its sole discretion, enter into or arrange for a block trade, an exchange for physical or exchange for swap, or any other OTC
	transaction (through itself or a designated acceptable broker) with USCI for the purchase of a number and type of futures contracts at the closing settlement price for such contracts on the Redemption Order Date. If an Authorized Purchaser fails to
	consummate (1) and (2), the order shall be cancelled. The number and type of contracts specified shall be determined by USCF, in its sole discretion, to meet USCIs investment objective and shall be sold as a result of the Authorized
	Purchasers sale of shares.






	Determination of Redemption Distribution






	The redemption distribution from USCI will consist of a transfer to the redeeming Authorized Purchaser of an amount of Treasuries and/or
	cash that is in the same proportion to the total assets of USCI (net of estimated accrued but unpaid fees, expenses and other liabilities) on the date the order to redeem is properly received as the number of shares to be redeemed under the
	redemption order is in proportion to the total number of shares outstanding on the date the order is received. USCF, directly or in consultation with the Administrator, determines the requirements for Treasuries and cash, including the remaining
	maturities of the Treasuries and proportions of Treasuries and cash, that may be included in distributions to redeem baskets. The Marketing Agent will publish an estimate of the redemption distribution per basket as of the beginning of each business
	day.






	Delivery of Redemption Distribution






	The redemption distribution due from USCI will be delivered to the Authorized Purchaser on the third business day following the redemption order date if, by 3:00 p.m., New York time on such third business
	day, USCIs DTC account has been credited with the baskets to be redeemed. If USCIs DTC account has not been credited with all of the baskets to be redeemed by such time, the redemption distribution will be delivered to the extent of
	whole baskets received. Any remainder of the redemption distribution will be delivered on the next business day to the extent of remaining whole baskets received if USCI receives the fee applicable to the extension of the redemption distribution
	date which USCF may, from time to time, determine and the remaining baskets to be redeemed are credited to USCIs DTC account by 3:00 p.m., New York time on such next business day. Any further outstanding amount of the redemption order shall be
	cancelled. Pursuant to information from USCF, the Custodian will also be authorized to deliver the redemption distribution notwithstanding that the baskets to be redeemed are not credited to USCIs DTC account by 3:00 p.m., New York time on the
	third business day following the redemption order date if the Authorized Purchaser has collateralized its obligation to deliver the baskets through DTCs book entry-system on such terms as USCF may from time to time determine.






	Suspension or Rejection of Redemption Orders






	USCF may, in its discretion, suspend the right of redemption, or postpone the redemption settlement date, (1) for any period during which the NYSE Arca or any of the Futures Exchanges upon which a
	Benchmark Component Futures Contract is traded is closed other than customary weekend or holiday closings, or trading on




	 




	61







	Table of Contents




	the NYSE Arca or the Futures Exchanges is suspended or restricted, (2) for any period during which an emergency exists as a result of which delivery, disposal or evaluation of Treasuries is
	not reasonably practicable, or (3) for such other period as USCF determines to be necessary for the protection of the shareholders. For example, USCF may determine that it is necessary to suspend redemptions to allow for the orderly liquidation
	of USCIs assets at an appropriate value to fund a redemption. If USCF has difficulty liquidating USCIs positions, e.g., because of a market disruption event in the futures markets or an unanticipated delay in the liquidation of a
	position in an over the counter contract, it may be appropriate to suspend redemptions until such time as such circumstances are rectified. None of USCF, the Marketing Agent, or the Custodian will be liable to any person or in any way for any loss
	or damages that may result from any such suspension or postponement.




	Redemption orders must be made in whole baskets. USCF acting by itself
	or through the Marketing Agent may, in its sole discretion, reject any Redemption Order (1) USCF determines that the Redemption Order is not in proper form, (2) the fulfillment of which its counsel advises may be illegal under applicable
	laws and regulations, or (3) if circumstances outside the control of USCF, the Marketing Agent or the Custodian make it for all practical purposes not feasible for the shares to be delivered under the Redemption Order. USCF may also reject a
	redemption order if the number of shares being redeemed would reduce the remaining outstanding shares to 100,000 shares (i.e., two baskets) or less.






	Creation and Redemption Transaction Fee






	To compensate USCI for its
	expenses in connection with the creation and redemption of baskets, an Authorized Purchaser is required to pay a transaction fee to USCI of $350 per order through May 1, 2015 to create or redeem baskets, regardless of the number of baskets in
	such order; on and after May 2, 2015, the fee increases to $1,000. The transaction fee may be reduced, increased or otherwise changed by USCF. USCF shall notify DTC of any change in the transaction fee and will not implement any increase in the
	fee for the redemption of baskets until 30 days after the date of notice.






	Tax Responsibility






	Authorized Purchasers are responsible for any transfer tax, sales or use tax, stamp tax, recording tax, value added tax or similar tax or
	governmental charge applicable to the creation or redemption of baskets, regardless of whether or not such tax or charge is imposed directly on the Authorized Purchaser, and agree to indemnify USCF and USCI if they are required by law to pay any
	such tax, together with any applicable penalties, additions to tax and interest thereon.






	Secondary Market Transactions






	As noted, USCI will create and redeem shares from time to time, but only in one or more Creation Baskets or Redemption
	Baskets. The creation and redemption of baskets are only made in exchange for delivery to USCI or the distribution by USCI of the amount of Treasuries and/or cash equal to the aggregate NAV of the number of shares included in the baskets being
	created or redeemed determined on the day the order to create or redeem baskets is properly received.




	As discussed above,
	Authorized Purchasers are the only persons that may place orders to create and redeem baskets. Authorized Purchasers must be registered broker-dealers or other securities market participants, such as banks and other financial institutions that are
	not required to register as broker-dealers to engage in securities transactions. An Authorized Purchaser is under no obligation to create or redeem baskets, and an Authorized Purchaser is under no obligation to offer to the public shares of any
	baskets it does create. Authorized Purchasers that do offer to the public shares from the baskets they create will do so at per-Share offering prices that are expected to reflect, among other factors, the trading price of the shares on the NYSE
	Arca, the NAV of USCI at the time the Authorized Purchaser purchased the Creation Baskets, the NAV of the shares at the time of the offer of the shares to the public, the supply of and demand for shares at the time of sale, and the liquidity of the
	Commodity Interests. The prices of shares offered by




	 




	62







	Table of Contents




	Authorized Purchasers are expected to fall between USCIs NAV and the trading price of the shares on the NYSE Arca at the time of sale. Shares initially comprising the same basket but
	offered by Authorized Purchasers to the public at different times may have different offering prices. An order for one or more baskets may be placed by an Authorized Purchaser on behalf of multiple clients. Shares are expected to trade in the
	secondary market on the NYSE Arca. Shares may trade in the secondary market at prices that are lower or higher relative to their NAV per Share. The amount of the discount or premium in the trading price relative to the NAV per share may be
	influenced by various factors, including the number of investors who seek to purchase or sell shares in the secondary market and the liquidity of the Commodity Interests. While the shares trade during the core trading session on the NYSE Arca until
	4:00 p.m. New York time, liquidity in the market for Commodity Interests may be reduced after the close of the Futures Exchanges upon which the Benchmark Component Futures Contracts are traded. As a result, during this time, trading spreads, and the
	resulting premium or discount, on the shares may widen.










	Use of Proceeds





	USCF will cause USCI to transfer the proceeds of the sale of Creation Baskets to the Custodian or another custodian for use in trading
	activities. USCF will invest USCIs assets in Commodity Interests. When USCI purchases Commodity Interests that are exchange-traded, USCI will be required to deposit with the FCM on behalf of the exchange a portion of the value of the contract
	or other interest as security to ensure payment for the obligation under the Commodity Interests at maturity. This deposit is known as initial margin. Counterparties in transactions in OTC contracts will generally impose similar collateral
	requirements on USCI. USCF will invest USCIs assets that remain after margin and collateral is posted in short-term Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents. Subject to these margin and collateral requirements, USCF has sole authority to
	determine the percentage of assets that will be:



	 





	 




	




	 





	held as margin or collateral with FCMs or other custodians;






	 





	 




	




	 





	used for other investments; and






	 





	 




	




	 





	held in bank accounts to pay current obligations and as reserves.







	Approximately 5% to 30% of USCIs assets have normally been committed as margin for commodity futures contracts. However, from time
	to time, the percentage of assets committed as margin may be substantially more, or less, than such range. Ongoing margin and collateral payments will generally be required for exchange-traded and OTC Commodity Interests based on changes in the
	value of Commodity Interests. Furthermore, ongoing collateral requirements with respect to OTC contracts are negotiated by the parties, and may be affected by overall market volatility of the SDCI, the ability of the counterparty to hedge its
	exposure under the Commodity Interests, and each partys creditworthiness. In light of the differing requirements for initial payments under exchange-traded and OTC contracts and the fluctuating nature of ongoing margin and collateral payments,
	it is not possible to estimate what portion of USCIs assets will be posted as margin or collateral at any given time. The Treasuries, cash and cash equivalents held by USAG will constitute reserves that will be available to meet ongoing margin
	and collateral requirements. All interest income will be used for USCIs benefit. USCI invests the balance of USCIs assets not invested in Commodity Interests or held in margin as reserves to be available for changes in margin. All
	interest income is used for USCIs benefit.




	An FCM, counterparty, government agency or commodity exchange could increase
	margin or collateral requirements applicable to USCI to hold trading positions at any time. Moreover, margin is merely a security deposit and has no bearing on the profit or loss potential for any positions held.




	USCIs assets posted as margin for Futures Contracts will be held in segregation pursuant to the CEA and CFTC regulations.
	Collateral posted in connection with OTC contracts held with USCIs FCM will be similarly segregated and if held with other counterparties will be segregated pursuant to contract between USCI and its counterparties.

	Additional Information About the SDCI





	The overall return on the SDCI is generated by two components: (i) uncollateralized returns from the commodity futures contracts
	comprising the SDCI and (ii) a daily fixed income return reflecting the interest earned on a hypothetical 3-month U.S. Treasury Bill collateral portfolio, calculated using the weekly auction rate for the 3-Month U.S. Treasury Bills published by
	the U.S. Department of the Treasury. SummerHaven Indexing is the owner of the SDCI.




	The SDCI is composed of physical
	non-financial commodity futures contracts with active and liquid markets traded upon futures exchanges in major industrialized countries. The futures contracts are denominated in U.S. dollars and weighted equally by notional amount. The SDCI
	currently reflects commodities in six commodity sectors: energy (e.g., crude oil, natural gas, heating oil, etc.), precious metals (e.g., gold, silver platinum), industrial metals (e.g., zinc, nickel, aluminum, copper, etc.), grains (e.g., wheat,
	corn, soybeans, etc.), softs (e.g., sugar, cotton, coffee, cocoa), and livestock (e.g., live cattle, lean hogs, feeder cattle).




	Table 1 below lists the eligible commodities, the relevant futures exchange on which the futures contract is listed and quotation
	details. Table 2 lists the eligible futures contracts, their sector designation and maximum allowable tenor.

	Prior to the end of each month, SummerHaven Indexing determines the composition of the SDCI and provides
	such information to Bloomberg. Values of the SDCI are computed by Bloomberg and disseminated approximately every fifteen (15) seconds from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, which also publishes a daily SDCI value at approximately 5:30
	p.m., New York City time, under the index ticker symbol SDCI:IND. Only settlement and last-sale prices are used in the SDCIs calculation, bids and offers are not recognized  including limit-bid and limit-offer price quotes.
	Where no last-sale price exists, typically in the more deferred contract months, the previous days settlement price is used. This means that the underlying index may lag its theoretical value. This tendency to lag is evident at the end of the
	day when the SDCI value is based on the settlement prices of the Benchmark Component Futures Contracts, and explains why the underlying SDCI often closes at or near the high or low for the day.






	Composition of the SDCI






	The composition of the SDCI on any given day, as determined and published by SummerHaven Indexing, is determinative of the benchmark for USCI. However, it is not possible to anticipate all possible
	circumstances and events that may occur with respect to the SDCI and the methodology for its composition, weighting and calculation. Accordingly, a number of subjective judgments must be made in connection with the operation of the SDCI that cannot
	be adequately reflected in this description of the SDCI. All questions of interpretation with respect to the application of the provisions of the SDCI methodology, including any determinations that need to

	Because the SDCI is comprised of actively
	traded contracts with scheduled expirations, it can be calculated only by reference to the prices of contracts for specified expiration, delivery or settlement periods, referred to as contract expirations. The contract expirations included in the
	SDCI for each commodity during a given year are designated by SummerHaven Indexing, provided that each contract must be an active contract. An active contract for this purpose is a liquid, actively-traded contract expiration, as defined or
	identified by the relevant trading facility or, if no such definition or identification is provided by the relevant trading facility, as defined by standard custom and practice in the industry.




	If a Futures Exchange ceases trading in all contract expirations relating to a particular Futures Contract, SummerHaven Indexing may
	designate a replacement contract on the commodity. The replacement contract must satisfy the eligibility criteria for inclusion in the SDCI. To the extent practicable, the replacement will be effected during the next monthly review of the
	composition of the SDCI. If that timing is not practicable, SummerHaven Indexing will determine the date of the replacement based on a number of factors, including the differences between the existing Futures Contract and the replacement Futures
	Contract with respect to contractual specifications and contract expirations.




	If a contract is eliminated and there is no
	replacement contract, the underlying commodity will necessarily drop from the SDCI. The designation of a replacement contract, or the elimination of a commodity from the SDCI because of the absence of a replacement contract, could affect the value
	of the SDCI, either positively or negatively, depending on the price of the contract that is eliminated and the prices of the remaining contracts. It is impossible, however, to predict the effect of these changes, if they occur, on the value of the
	SDCI.






	Commodity Selection






	14 of the 27 eligible Futures Contracts are selected for inclusion in the SDCI for the next month, subject to the constraint that each of the six commodity sectors is represented by at least one
	commodity. The methodology used to select the 14 Futures Contracts is based solely on quantitative data using observable futures prices and is not subject to human bias.




	Monthly commodity selection is a two-step process based upon examination of the relevant futures prices for each commodity:




	1) The annualized percentage price difference between the closest-to-expiration Futures Contract and the next closest-to-expiration Futures Contract is calculated for each of the 27 eligible Futures
	Contracts on USCIs Selection Date. The seven commodities with the highest percentage price difference are selected.




	2)
	For the remaining 20 eligible commodities, the percentage price change of each commodity over the previous year is calculated, as measured by the change in the price of the closest-to-expiration Futures Contract on the Selection Date from the price
	of the closest-to-expiration Futures Contract a year prior to USCIs Selection Date. The seven commodities with the highest percentage price change are selected.




	When evaluating the data from the second step, all six commodity sectors must be represented. If the selection of the seven additional commodities with the highest price change fails to meet the overall
	diversification requirement that all six commodity sectors are represented in the SDCI, the commodity with the highest price change among the commodities of the omitted sector(s) would be substituted for the commodity with the lowest price change
	among the seven additional commodities.




	 




	66







	Table of Contents




	The 14 commodities selected are included in the SDCI for the next month on an
	equally-weighted basis. Due to the dynamic monthly commodity selection, the sector weights will vary from approximately 7% to 43% over time, depending on the price observations each month. USCIs Selection Date for the SDCI is the fifth
	business day prior to the first business day of the next calendar month.




	The following graph shows the sector weights of the
	commodities selected for inclusion in the SDCI as of December 31, 2013.





	USCI Sector Weightings as of December 31,
	2013




	 








	Contract Selection






	For each commodity selected for inclusion into the SDCI for a particular month, the SDCI selects a specific Futures Contract with a tenor (i.e., contract month) among the eligible tenors (the range of
	contract months) based upon the relative prices of the Futures Contracts within the eligible range of contract months. The previous notwithstanding, the contract expiration is not changed for that month if a contract remains in the SDCI, as long as
	the contract does not enter expire or enter its notice period in the subsequent month.






	Portfolio Construction






	The portfolio rebalancing takes place during the Rebalancing Period. At the end of each of the days in the Rebalancing Period one fourth
	of the prior month portfolio positions are replaced by an equally-weighted position in the commodity contracts determined on USCIs Selection Date. At the end of the Rebalancing Period the SDCI takes an equal-weight position of approximately
	7.14% in each of the selected commodity contracts.






	SDCI Total Return Calculation






	The value of the SDCI on any business day is equal to the product of (i) the value of the SDCI on the immediately preceding business
	day multiplied by (ii) one plus the sum of the days returns for another version

	of the SDCI known as the SummerHaven Dynamic Commodity Index Excess Return (SDCI ER) (explained below) and one business days interest from hypothetical Treasuries. The value of
	the SDCI is calculated and published by Bloomberg.






	SDCI Base Level






	The SDCI was set to 100 on January 2, 1991.






	SDCI ER Calculation






	The total return of the SDCI ER reflects the
	percentage change of the market values of the underlying commodity futures. During the Rebalancing Period, the SDCI changes its contract holdings during a four day period. The value of the SDCI ER at the end of a business day t is equal
	to the SDCI ER value on day t-1 multiplied by the sum of the daily percentage price changes of each commodity future factoring in each respective commodity futures notional holding on day t-1.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

Strategy & Benefits

Principal Investment Strategy
The investment strategy of the Direxion Indexed Commodity Strategy Fund includes:

A quantitative, strategic index-based approach to commodity investing
Exposure to 12 commodities that can individually be long or flat (if a short signal is triggered the position is moved to cash)
The ability to make position changes intra-month based on trends
Monthly rebalance based on risk reduction where the allocation of individual components is reduced if volatility exceeds certain predetermined risk levels
A “smart” contract roll approach1

1 Smart Contract Roll Approach – A futures contract roll approach designed to select cost effective futures contracts to roll into upon expiration of current contract.
Why Invest in the Fund?

The long/flat approach provides exposure to commodities that can individually be positioned long or flat (in cash) based upon price trends
Seeks to mitigate the downside risk and maximum declines relative to notable long-only commodity indices
Has the flexibility to make individual commodity position changes intra-month
Risk management controls designed to adjust exposure levels if volatility gets too high
Low- or non-correlation to stocks and bonds
Disciplined, quantitative, rules-based approach to commodity investing




Why Commodities?

Not just commodities – Long/Flat commodities.
Most traditional commodity funds provide long only exposure to commodities. This limits their potential to contribute to a portfolio’s long-term performance because they only benefit if commodity prices rise.
The Direxion Indexed Commodity Strategy Fund seeks to match the performance of the Auspice Broad Commodity ER Index (ABCERI), which provides exposure to 12 commodities that can individually be positioned long or flat (in cash) based upon price trends.
This long/flat index is potentially more adaptive to volatile commodity markets because it seeks to take advantage of individual commodities by going long when prices rise, and mitigate risk by going flat (to cash) when prices fall.
Why consider long/flat commodities?
Most traditional commodity funds can only benefit if commodity prices rise. However, these long-only commodity strategies have shown to be inconsistent over time because:

Commodity returns are typically cyclical and sporadic
Individual commodity sub-sectors tend to perform dissimilarly in different market environments
Significant draw-downs can be damaging to the long-term performance of a portfolio

Within the inherently volatile commodity markets, a long/flat approach is potentially more adaptive to whip-sawing market conditions.

Target Index

The Auspice Broad Commodity ER Index aims to capture upward trends in the commodity markets while minimizing risk during downward trends. The index uses a quantitative methodology to track either long or flat positions in a diversified portfolio of 12 commodity futures covering energy, metals, and agriculture. The index incorporates dynamic risk management and contract rolling methods.

Bloomberg Commodity Total Return Index (BCOM TR), a broadly diversified index that allows investors to track 19 commodity futures through a single, simple measure
Deutsche Banc Liquid Commodity Optimum Yield Index (DBC CI), an index composed of futures contracts on 14 of the most heavily-traded and important physical commodities in the world.

Standard Deviation is a measure of the dispersion of a set of data from its mean.
Correlation is a statistical measure of how two securities move in relation to each other.
Maximum Drawdown is the greatest percent decline from a previous high.

The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. For the most recent month-end performance please visit the funds website at direxioninvestments.com.
Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus.

 The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost; current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance for one year and under are cumulative, not annualized. Short term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. For additional information, see the fund(s) prospectus.
Each Direxion Fund share price is calculated as of the close of regular trading, usually as of 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time, each day the New York Stock Exchange is open for business. Each fund seeks to meet its investment objective relative to the value of the target index or benchmark as of 4:00 p.m.
Shares of Direxion Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Market Price returns are based upon the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4:00 PM Eastern time (when NAV is normally determined), and do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times. Fund returns assume that dividends and capital gains distributions have been reinvested in the Fund at NAV. Some performance results reflect expense subsidies and waivers in effect during certain periods shown. Absent these waivers, results would have been less favorable.
After-Tax and After-Tax, Post Sales Returns
Tax-adjusted returns and tax cost ratio are estimates of the impact taxes have had on a fund. We assume the highest tax rate in calculating these figures. These returns follow the SEC guidelines for calculating returns before sale of shares. Tax-adjusted returns show a fund’s annualized after tax total return for the one, three and five year periods, excluding any capital-gains effects that would result from selling the fund at the end of the period. To determine this figure, all income and short-term capital gains distributions are taxed at the maximum federal rate at the time of distribution. Long-term capital gains are taxed at a 15% rate. The after tax portion is then assumed to be reinvested in the fund. State and local taxes are not included in our calculations. For more information, please consult your tax consultant.
Distribution Dates

Payable and Ex-Date – With regard to mutual funds, this is the day on which declared distributions (dividends or capital gains) are deducted from the fund’s assets before it calculates its net asset value (NAV). The NAV per share will drop by the amount of the distribution per share.
Record Date – Date by which a shareholder must officially own shares in order to be entitled to a dividend.

Types of Distributions

Income Dividend – A portion of a company’s profit paid to common and preferred shareholders.
Long Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for more than one year.
Short Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for less than one year

 The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost; current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance for one year and under are cumulative, not annualized. Short term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. For additional information, see the fund(s) prospectus.
Each Direxion Fund share price is calculated as of the close of regular trading, usually as of 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time, each day the New York Stock Exchange is open for business. Each fund seeks to meet its investment objective relative to the value of the target index or benchmark as of 4:00 p.m.
Shares of Direxion Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Market Price returns are based upon the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4:00 PM Eastern time (when NAV is normally determined), and do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times. Fund returns assume that dividends and capital gains distributions have been reinvested in the Fund at NAV. Some performance results reflect expense subsidies and waivers in effect during certain periods shown. Absent these waivers, results would have been less favorable.
After-Tax and After-Tax, Post Sales Returns
Tax-adjusted returns and tax cost ratio are estimates of the impact taxes have had on a fund. We assume the highest tax rate in calculating these figures. These returns follow the SEC guidelines for calculating returns before sale of shares. Tax-adjusted returns show a fund’s annualized after tax total return for the one, three and five year periods, excluding any capital-gains effects that would result from selling the fund at the end of the period. To determine this figure, all income and short-term capital gains distributions are taxed at the maximum federal rate at the time of distribution. Long-term capital gains are taxed at a 15% rate. The after tax portion is then assumed to be reinvested in the fund. State and local taxes are not included in our calculations. For more information, please consult your tax consultant.
Distribution Dates

Payable and Ex-Date – With regard to mutual funds, this is the day on which declared distributions (dividends or capital gains) are deducted from the fund’s assets before it calculates its net asset value (NAV). The NAV per share will drop by the amount of the distribution per share.
Record Date – Date by which a shareholder must officially own shares in order to be entitled to a dividend.

Types of Distributions

Income Dividend – A portion of a company’s profit paid to common and preferred shareholders.
Long Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for more than one year.
Short Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for less than one year

 The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost; current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance for one year and under are cumulative, not annualized. Short term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. For additional information, see the fund(s) prospectus.
Each Direxion Fund share price is calculated as of the close of regular trading, usually as of 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time, each day the New York Stock Exchange is open for business. Each fund seeks to meet its investment objective relative to the value of the target index or benchmark as of 4:00 p.m.
Shares of Direxion Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Market Price returns are based upon the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4:00 PM Eastern time (when NAV is normally determined), and do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times. Fund returns assume that dividends and capital gains distributions have been reinvested in the Fund at NAV. Some performance results reflect expense subsidies and waivers in effect during certain periods shown. Absent these waivers, results would have been less favorable.
After-Tax and After-Tax, Post Sales Returns
Tax-adjusted returns and tax cost ratio are estimates of the impact taxes have had on a fund. We assume the highest tax rate in calculating these figures. These returns follow the SEC guidelines for calculating returns before sale of shares. Tax-adjusted returns show a fund’s annualized after tax total return for the one, three and five year periods, excluding any capital-gains effects that would result from selling the fund at the end of the period. To determine this figure, all income and short-term capital gains distributions are taxed at the maximum federal rate at the time of distribution. Long-term capital gains are taxed at a 15% rate. The after tax portion is then assumed to be reinvested in the fund. State and local taxes are not included in our calculations. For more information, please consult your tax consultant.
Distribution Dates

Payable and Ex-Date – With regard to mutual funds, this is the day on which declared distributions (dividends or capital gains) are deducted from the fund’s assets before it calculates its net asset value (NAV). The NAV per share will drop by the amount of the distribution per share.
Record Date – Date by which a shareholder must officially own shares in order to be entitled to a dividend.

Types of Distributions

Income Dividend – A portion of a company’s profit paid to common and preferred shareholders.
Long Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for more than one year.
Short Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for less than one year

Strategy & Benefits

Principal Investment Strategy
The investment strategy of the Direxion Indexed Commodity Strategy Fund includes:

A quantitative, strategic index-based approach to commodity investing
Exposure to 12 commodities that can individually be long or flat (if a short signal is triggered the position is moved to cash)
The ability to make position changes intra-month based on trends
Monthly rebalance based on risk reduction where the allocation of individual components is reduced if volatility exceeds certain predetermined risk levels
A “smart” contract roll approach1

1 Smart Contract Roll Approach – A futures contract roll approach designed to select cost effective futures contracts to roll into upon expiration of current contract.
Why Invest in the Fund?

The long/flat approach provides exposure to commodities that can individually be positioned long or flat (in cash) based upon price trends
Seeks to mitigate the downside risk and maximum declines relative to notable long-only commodity indices
Has the flexibility to make individual commodity position changes intra-month
Risk management controls designed to adjust exposure levels if volatility gets too high
Low- or non-correlation to stocks and bonds
Disciplined, quantitative, rules-based approach to commodity investing




Why Commodities?

Not just commodities – Long/Flat commodities.
Most traditional commodity funds provide long only exposure to commodities. This limits their potential to contribute to a portfolio’s long-term performance because they only benefit if commodity prices rise.
The Direxion Indexed Commodity Strategy Fund seeks to match the performance of the Auspice Broad Commodity ER Index (ABCERI), which provides exposure to 12 commodities that can individually be positioned long or flat (in cash) based upon price trends.
This long/flat index is potentially more adaptive to volatile commodity markets because it seeks to take advantage of individual commodities by going long when prices rise, and mitigate risk by going flat (to cash) when prices fall.
Why consider long/flat commodities?
Most traditional commodity funds can only benefit if commodity prices rise. However, these long-only commodity strategies have shown to be inconsistent over time because:

Commodity returns are typically cyclical and sporadic
Individual commodity sub-sectors tend to perform dissimilarly in different market environments
Significant draw-downs can be damaging to the long-term performance of a portfolio

Within the inherently volatile commodity markets, a long/flat approach is potentially more adaptive to whip-sawing market conditions.

Target Index

The Auspice Broad Commodity ER Index aims to capture upward trends in the commodity markets while minimizing risk during downward trends. The index uses a quantitative methodology to track either long or flat positions in a diversified portfolio of 12 commodity futures covering energy, metals, and agriculture. The index incorporates dynamic risk management and contract rolling methods.

Source: Bloomberg. Data from 10/1/2010 – 6/30/2017. October 1, 2010 is the inception of the Auspice Broad Commodity ER Index. Index returns and correlations are historical and are not representative of any fund performance. Total returns of the index include reinvested dividends. Past performance does not guarantee future results.  One cannot invest directly in an index. The indexes are composite indexes of commodity sector returns representing unmanaged, unleveraged, long-only investment in commodity futures that are broadly diversified across the spectrum of commodities. 

S&P Goldman Sachs Commodity Index (S&P GSCI), a composite index of commodity sector returns representing an unleveraged, long-only investment in commodity futures that is broadly diversified across the spectrum of commodities;
Bloomberg Commodity Total Return Index (BCOM TR), a broadly diversified index that allows investors to track 19 commodity futures through a single, simple measure
Deutsche Banc Liquid Commodity Optimum Yield Index (DBC CI), an index composed of futures contracts on 14 of the most heavily-traded and important physical commodities in the world.

Standard Deviation is a measure of the dispersion of a set of data from its mean.
Correlation is a statistical measure of how two securities move in relation to each other.
Maximum Drawdown is the greatest percent decline from a previous high.

* The Net Expense Ratio includes management fees, other operating expenses and Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses.

If these expenses were included, the net expense ratio would be higher.
The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. For the most recent month-end performance please visit the funds website at direxioninvestments.com.
Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus.

  Addressing The Top Misconceptions About Alternative Investments    


Alternative strategies have the potential to be a viable way for investors, whether institutional or retail, to reduce risk in their investment portfolios.


  Alternatives? Too Many, or Not Enough?    


The key to risk-adjusted returns and diversification is not the number of securities – it’s their correlation – or, really, non-correlation – to each other, that’s paramount.


  A Correlation Misconception    


Some clients confuse negative correlation with low (or non-) correlation. They mistakenly believe that returns for investments with low correlation move in opposite directions from each other.

 The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost; current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance for one year and under are cumulative, not annualized. Short term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. For additional information, see the fund(s) prospectus.
Each Direxion Fund share price is calculated as of the close of regular trading, usually as of 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time, each day the New York Stock Exchange is open for business. Each fund seeks to meet its investment objective relative to the value of the target index or benchmark as of 4:00 p.m.
Shares of Direxion Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Market Price returns are based upon the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4:00 PM Eastern time (when NAV is normally determined), and do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times. Fund returns assume that dividends and capital gains distributions have been reinvested in the Fund at NAV. Some performance results reflect expense subsidies and waivers in effect during certain periods shown. Absent these waivers, results would have been less favorable.
After-Tax and After-Tax, Post Sales Returns
Tax-adjusted returns and tax cost ratio are estimates of the impact taxes have had on a fund. We assume the highest tax rate in calculating these figures. These returns follow the SEC guidelines for calculating returns before sale of shares. Tax-adjusted returns show a fund’s annualized after tax total return for the one, three and five year periods, excluding any capital-gains effects that would result from selling the fund at the end of the period. To determine this figure, all income and short-term capital gains distributions are taxed at the maximum federal rate at the time of distribution. Long-term capital gains are taxed at a 15% rate. The after tax portion is then assumed to be reinvested in the fund. State and local taxes are not included in our calculations. For more information, please consult your tax consultant.
Distribution Dates

Payable and Ex-Date – With regard to mutual funds, this is the day on which declared distributions (dividends or capital gains) are deducted from the fund’s assets before it calculates its net asset value (NAV). The NAV per share will drop by the amount of the distribution per share.
Record Date – Date by which a shareholder must officially own shares in order to be entitled to a dividend.

Types of Distributions

Income Dividend – A portion of a company’s profit paid to common and preferred shareholders.
Long Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for more than one year.
Short Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for less than one year

  Addressing The Top Misconceptions About Alternative Investments    


Alternative strategies have the potential to be a viable way for investors, whether institutional or retail, to reduce risk in their investment portfolios.


  Alternatives? Too Many, or Not Enough?    


The key to risk-adjusted returns and diversification is not the number of securities – it’s their correlation – or, really, non-correlation – to each other, that’s paramount.


  A Correlation Misconception    


Some clients confuse negative correlation with low (or non-) correlation. They mistakenly believe that returns for investments with low correlation move in opposite directions from each other.
