Customers are Saying...



            "We don't have any questions. Just a comment. We are 100% satisfied with the loan experiences we've had with LightStream. The application process was quick and painless and our concerns were addressed within 5 min of sending an email to customer service. Also,  the service feels very personalized. 10 out of 10! Congratulations,  you've gained yourselves lifelong customers!"
            - B. M. & B. M. from Ogden, UT


            "For anyone in need of a loan, they won't even consider financing with anyone else after they experience LightStream.  There simply isn't a better way to go about it.  The other sites that I visited were far and away behind LightStream, and cannot compete at any level in my view.  Nobody offers what LightStream does that I am aware of, and I will never go anywhere else.  Fast, efficient, and incredibly easy.  Thank you very much for making my experience the best ever."
            - A. C. from Marseilles, IL


            "I have borrowed (and paid back successfully) multiple personal loans throughout my professional career.  And you guys offer, by far, the most outstanding overall experience of all of them.  I look forward to much more business with you over the years!"
            - E. R. from Carson, CA


            "Thank you so much for making my dream happen (owning a 56 Belair) … love you guys."
            - M. C. from Glendale, AZ


            "Great process and experience.  I purchased a 2008 Corvette this week and fulfilled a lifelong dream.  Having the money to deal and personally holding the title made the entire process much more pleasant than dealing with financing at the time of purchase. Thanks for inventing the best loan process ever."
            - J. L. from Arden, NC


            "You guys Rock making it so easy for deserving customers. Appreciate your service - will bank with u guys from now on."
            - S. B. from Dallas, TX


            "This was the most hassle-free loan we have ever applied for. The application was received and approved in one hour and four minutes.  Outstanding service is an understatement!!!  Kudos to the staff at LightStream!"
            - R. G. & K. G. from South Daytona, FL


            "Hello LightStream folks. I just got an easy, low interest loan from you via my Suntrust Bank. Then, today, I got an ecard saying y'all arrange to plant a tree with every loan! Thanks! That tree shall be named "Gibbs" to share the name of the Ford F150 Pickup that we bought with the loan! May Gibbs grow tall and strong! Thanks!"
            - R. S. & T. S. from Hephzibah, GA


            "Approved in minutes. I have excellent credit and qualified for their lowest rate, that traditional brick and mortar banks can't even come close to, at my terms, and completely unsecured.  They called a few minutes after I submitted the application to confirm my work number, and moments later, an email arrived telling me I was approved.  They allowed ME to decide when my first payment would be, which they push to the next business day if that falls on a weekend or federal holiday.  The proceeds were available in my bank account the very next day.
Fast, no hoops to jump through, and incredible terms.  I feel like taking out another loan just for the sake of it because the process was so satisfying.
"
            - B. C. from Lanoka Harbor, NJ


            "I just wanted to commend your company on its efficiency, efficacy, and equitability. I have never enjoyed such service and ease of accomplishment. At this point, you are doing everything right except the access for customer feedback and comments. I searched your website for several minutes before finding this page. Advice: make it easy for your customers to praise you; you deserve it!"
            - R. T. & T. T. from Palm Coast, FL


            "Just wanted to take a moment to comment on your process. Hands down the best loan experience I have ever had. So simple and straight forward it's hard to believe. It was a process that assigned real value to a lifetime of good decisions. I will gladly do business with you again and I'm happy to tell my friends with similar credit profiles about you."
            - E. B. from Richmond, VA


            "This is by far the best online loan experience I have ever had. Your site is easy to understand and navigate, the loan application process was flawless."
            - E. K. from Harper's Ferry, WV


            "I LOVE THIS SITE, THE PROCESS AND THE SPEED OF ASSISTANCE THROUGHOUT THIS LOAN EXPERIENCE. I SAW THE AD INDICATING "BEST LOAN EXPERIENCE EVER OF WE WILL GIVE YOU $100." I THOUGHT, PROBABLY EVERYBODY SAYS THAT. THIS HAS TRULY BEEN AN EXPERIENCE THAT FAR EXCEEDED MY EXPECTATIONS. NEVER HAD TO LEAVE MY DESK. LOW INTEREST RATE. FLEXIBLE TERMS. KNEW THE COMMITMENT BEFORE LOAN OR CREDIT PROCESSED. LIGHTENING SPEED OF APPROVAL AND FUNDING PROCESS. I LOVE YOU GUYS!"
            - L. B. from Smyrna, TN


            "I just wanted to say thank you, to the Lightstream staff and creators of the process! This was by far, the easiest loan process I’ve ever been through! With your help, our lives have gotten much easier to handle financially. I will be returning to SunTrust Bank and LightStream for all of my future financial needs!"
            - J. J. from Philadelphia, PA


            "I wanted to wait until the first debit processed to offer my unqualified endorsement of your service.  I discovered you on the web, applied for a car loan on a Thursday, had the funds in my Credit Union the next day, and had my CPO car that afternoon.  Unbelievable.  Just a follow up call the day of the application and that was that.  Also, your web site, both before and after the loan is excellent.  Very easy to navigate, and the clarity of my loan and its current standing is flawless.  A 100% positive experience."
            - J. G. from Glendale, AZ


            "Over the past few months, I have had to manage, a home refinance, new homeowner and car insurance, new employer setup and benefits. 
All of it was done electronically and most of it was very disastrous.  No real people to talk to, and the navigation oftentimes did not work.

When I was advised that the LightStream loan process would be electronic, I was wary.  Happily, my concerns were unfounded.  I found your process
to be easy and quick.  Your turnaround is incredible.  When reaching out to real people, I was not placed on hold and I did not have to go through 
endless scripts ending up with a disconnect.  The people answering were knowledgeable, friendly, and easy to understand. 
How refreshing!
"
            - S. C. from Buford, GA


            "I just wanted to express our happiness and gratitude for the ease and efficiency in the entire loan process. From day one of applying for the loan to the payment process, it has been flawless! We were amazed at the quickness it took to be approved and receive the money for the loan. I believe it was 2-3 days!  Never have we ever been taken care of with such courtesy and expertise. We will most definitely be referring you to our friends and family. Keep doing what you're doing because you guys got it right!!!"
            - E. G. & D. G. from Spring, TX


            "I would like to thank everyone at Light Stream for this loan's convenience and all the representative's at Light Stream. Pleasure doing business!"
            - M.E. from Valrico, FL


            "Just wanted to say how much I love your mobile friendly system.  On my phone I check balance and payments. Easy to make extra payments. Great rate and the entire process has been very user friendly. Wish I didn't owe you money but the experience has been great! Thanks friends!"
            - R.M. from Little River, SC


            "I am one of those people that rarely write reviews but couldn't do this after my great experience. I applied in the evening on a Monday and was advised that I would hear the next business day once underwriting was in the office. I would say by 9 am the next morning I had my approval for a used unsecured auto loan for 1.74%!!! That is an amazing rate and I know being an underwriter for consumer loans myself! The process was simple and I had my money by Wednesday morning with no extra fees. I couldn't even get as good of a rate or customer service from the bank I work at (and underwriters who sit right next to me) if I had tried."
            - S.R. from Grand Rapids, MI


            "To the Team at LightStream:

Indeed, this is great news! You guys have certainly created an excellent customer experience overall. We are extremely pleased. Your email response time is very appropriate, the language and communication skill of the employees has the right balance between friendly and professional. I also felt very well informed of the tasks I needed to accomplish in order to be in good standing. The use of appropriate hyper-links is a great approach for both tech savvy and non tech savvy individuals.

I could say some more complimentary things, but for now I will cease there. I will recommend you as well to anyone in need of loan services. To the planners and wonderful implementors of the LightStream approach - well done. Up there with Zappos and Amazon with certainly!

On top of it all, I carry the wonderful heart weight of knowing my loan assisted in the planting of a wonderful tree. Bravo. 

Truly grateful - you are making a difference providing for your families while doing it.
"
            - D.J. & D.J from Windermere, FL


            "I just had the pleasure of speaking with Drew.  Cannot say enough how he listen to what I was saying and provided amazing guidance. In today’s world the customer service word is non existence.  If he represents how light stream is I will be a customer for life."
            - C.M. & J.M. from Brentwood, CA


            "Good morning, I wanted to send a quick thank you for providing such excellent customer service. This is our second loan with LightStream and both experiences have been extraordinarily efficient. The online application is simple and response time is so fast. Our second loan was even easier than our first since much of our information auto filled (very smart). Also, the emails that I receive from LightStream are concise vs. filled with useless default information that we are all so unfortunately used to from other businesses. Thank you so much for doing what you do. You guys are awesome!"
            - D.S. & L.S. from Wilmington, NC


            "This was a pleasant surprise. I had no idea how easy everything would be. They did everything they said they would exactly how they  said. It was quick and easy and would definitely suggest this site to anyone interested in auto loan."
            - T.R. from West Monroe, LA


            "First off, this is been the easiest financial transaction--ever! I'm looking forward to the confidence that having my financing ready to go for car shopping will give me. Thank you."

            "I just wanted to tell you that there is no WAY I could even contemplate trying to argue for the $100 if this wasn't the best loan experience ever.  The whole process, from start to finish, was simple and incredibly quick.  Not to mention, wow what a rate! You can believe I will be sharing your site with everyone on my social media! Great, Great, Great, Job!!"

            "LightStream was amazing to work with and I have already recommended them to friends and family. They make the process incredibly easy and their rates are great…LightStream's customer service was efficient and friendly and navigating their site was incredibly easy. The entire application process to funding and now repay is streamlined and simple. I read all the fine print and they truly offer a simple interest loan with no prepayment penalties and their rates are very competitive. They made consolidating my credit card debt painless and I have the peace of mind knowing that I will be able to pay off this loan in 3 years and my interest has been cut in half! I will be thinking of LightStream first the next time I need a loan."

            "I wish I could like your page 100 times. LightStream has made my last two car purchases a breeze. I really appreciate that there is still a company out there willing to extend quality low-rate unsecured loans so quickly and effectively to people with the credit history, income, and assets to qualify. It seems most banks have gotten away from really rewarding the "very low risk" borrowers with appropriate benefits - they just have their standard categories of high or low risk and give a standard rate and terms accordingly. I tell everyone I know about LightStream. Thanks again for making my life easier."

            "Thank you.  I have been married with a family for 44 years and during that time with careers and raising a family there have been times that I have had to apply for a loan.  I can honestly say that the process you have is the easiest, most customer friendly process that I have ever encountered.  I look forward to being a customer of yours, paying off this loan and also looking to you for any future needs and I have already recommended you to several people.  Thank you again for your outstanding customer service.  I don’t usually write notes like this, but I don’t usually get excellent customer service and when I do, I like to acknowledge it. Thanks again."

            "This was the most efficient and convenient loan process I have experienced. I needed assistance with two areas on the application and received help immediately.  After all was submitted, Alyssa called about a routing problem; I had given incomplete information.  She competently corrected numbers and verified procedures through a conference call with my bank. She then explained the deposit options, allowing me to choose without a hint of impatience or condescension, somewhat rare among young technical assistance professionals these days! Her degree of thoroughness and attention to detail was impressive.

I work hard to pay bills and live as debt-free as possible. You made a small splurge (horse trailer) possible!"

            "I just want to offer my heartfelt thanks to the Customer Service team at LightStream.  Please make sure that your management sees this email.
I am a somewhat picky customer and can be a bit of a pain sometimes.  Regardless, your team has always dealt with me with grace and courtesy.  You are also incredibly fast in your responses to my questions and set a very high bar for any of your competitors to match.  From the very first time I was introduced to LightStream, you stood out as different and noticeably better.  Applying for a loan was super easy, approval was quick and the whole process was the most pleasant and quick loan experience I can remember.  I am an IT pioneer, with more than 50 years in the field, much of that spent consulting with Fortune 500 companies, including many major banks.  You make me proud in that you represent a shining example of smart IT use, backed up by first class people. To put it in fewer words, LightStream ROCKS!
Thank you for doing such a wonderful job for your clients. To Gwen and Monica and all the others on the Customer Service team, keep on doing what you obviously do extremely well, making LightStream’s customers happy."

Light Steam is the best lending source because of the services and customer support they provide. You seem to be a huge reason the customer support is so great! Thanks for the quick response!"

            "Amazing experience! I reached out to LightStream because I'm buying my first boat and I can't say enough about how great this experience was. I submitted my application online on a Wednesday, got a call a few hours later that missed. Called them back in the morning the next day, answered a couple of questions they had, got an email 20 minutes later asking for me to attach my latest paystub, 20 minutes after I did that I got an email with approval. I could have had the money wired the next day if I chose. I held off because I was still negotiating with the broker on the boat. The whole process took less than 24 hours. To put it in perspective, I submitted an application with the broker to finance through his company two days before I submitted with LightStream... it's now been almost a week and I haven't heard back regarding the financing from the broker yet. I just told him to forget about it, I was going to pay cash. That helped the negotiations! I never, ever take the time to write reviews but this process was so easy, the customer service and responsiveness is by far the best I've ever had. If you're looking for a pleasant experience financing your next toy, you have to reach out to LightStream and see what they have to offer."

            "We just wanted to let you know that the whole process of getting an unsecured loan with LightStream has been fantastic. It was so easy and quick to get the money into our bank account, and then to have the payments automatically withdrawn. Also, the website is easy to use and doesn't have a bunch of stuff on it that you don't need. Don't change a thing!! You are doing GREAT!"

            "This isn't really a question but a sincere "Thank you"!  I never want to step foot into another bank again because I am so impressed with how you handled our loan. Never have I been so impressed with your speed on decisions and deposits! We are so grateful that you are as good as your word. In this day and time, it's hard to find a company that cares about their customers time and finances. You did both, if I could rate you it would be 5 stars! Tell you what, whenever you are near this area, come by and jump in the pool with us. Again, just wanted to let you know how great we think you are and how you took care of us."

            "I have never experienced a simpler or quicker loan process in my life. Applied and was approved within 2 days. Any delays were generally tied to how often I checked my email. Application process was all online and took 10 minutes max. Received a great rate and money was deposited in my account on the day I selected. All transactions were simple, fast, and digital…"
            - D.N. from Alpharetta, GA


            "I used LightStream for an auto loan and I couldn't be happier with the process… The process was extremely fast and efficient. Their website is relatively simple and user-friendly. At the touch of a button, I can easily adjust my monthly payments and get a quick schedule of the payments until the loan has been completely paid off. That way, I can easily gauge how much interest I'd save if I were to make additional payments each month. Honestly, I can't imagine using any other loan service going forward… Your credit score and financial position gives LightStream confidence that you will not only make monthly payments timely but also resist the temptation to put your car title down on the craps table."

            "OMG!!!!!!!!!! There are no words in the English language to express my gratitude to your very well established funding process.  Wow...I am overwhelmed with gratitude to get away from the HIGH interest rates and a fee for everything.  I simply dropped by my favorite SunTrust Bank today, walked in and as usual was greeted by my name.  I had NO idea today would be the day I would finally get a loan that REALLY make sense to me.  Thank you!"

            "...Thank You for an excellent experience!

Yesterday, I started looking online for attractive auto loan options as I had selected a 2016 GMC Canyon that I wanted to purchase.  Based on several recommendations I found, I took a look at LightStream and decided it was worthwhile to start a loan application.  What immediately caught my eye is they describe and market their service…  “LightStream offers attractive loan terms and approval processes if you have excellent credit history, you have a high credit rating, etc.”  I thought to myself, have I perhaps found a financial institution that caters to very low risk customers and rewards them with great rates and simple loan processes?  I was very hopeful.

The loan application itself was incredibly simple and took me less than 10 minutes to complete.  Step 1 complete, I give it a 10 out of 10.  

In less than a minute I received an email letting me know things were underway.  I received a phone call in approximately 25 minutes from a very friendly customer service representative who was reviewing my application.  She only had one minor question related to my address/city not coinciding to my zip code which we easily sorted out.  Step 2 complete, another 10 out of 10.

10 minutes later I received an approval email with a 1.99% term.  The email had a web link where I could customize my loan amount, payment term and date, and when and where my funds would be deposited to.  Step 3 complete, 10 out of 10.

This morning at 7am I check my account balance and my funds had been deposited.  Final step complete, 10 out of 10.

This afternoon I went and picked up my new GMC Canyon and was able to pay cash for it which helped me negotiate a very good purchase price.
Few things in life exceed my expectation, especially so when they involve major purchases, loans, financial institutions and processes that usually take hours.  I give the entire LightStream experience my very highest recommendation.  It was fast, simple, incredible efficient and rewards those who take things like credit worthiness seriously.

I am VERY satisfied and will most certainly do business with LightStream again."

            "I know you plant a tree for every loan given, but I just wanted to tell you what that means to us.  We are up to our eyeballs in the IVF process which is the reason we got this loan.  Previous to this, we endured almost 4 years of repeated miscarriages (7 total) and we recently planted a magnolia bush to commemorate those losses.  There's something very special and poignant to planting a tree to honor loss and I just wanted to say thank you!!!!!  We also appreciate the real reason-- saving the earth for our future generation!!!"

I applied online and they called me 45 minutes later and asked me some follow up questions. Half an hour later, I was approved and I had the money in my checking account the next day. Since it's an unsecured loan, you can just tell the dealership you're paying cash, which makes the buying process simple and quick, too. LightStream gave me the best rate I could find, by a good margin…"

I was approved almost instantaneously, had the funds wired to my bank account exactly when I asked, and was able to purchase the car without a lien on the title. Who could ask for more? The whole experience was absolutely fantastic. It almost felt like one of those "too good to be true" things, BUT, it was true…"

My credit is excellent, but no local banks would lend on a vehicle 12-years-old, or older… The best part is that my APR went DOWN from my current payment .5%, and the monthly payments went down $150, and my overall vehicle debt went down $4,000! What a deal! Thank you for lending based upon good credit history. This is an amazing business model, and great customer service; thank you again!"

            "I can't say enough about this company and their customer service. My wife and I found them by chance back in 2013 and since then we've closed four auto loans totaling $60,000. The first was a refinance which saved 2.5% and hundreds over the life of the loan. The process was so seamless that we refinanced another vehicle about two weeks later. It seems that they value repeat customers and consider their payment history, as the subsequent loans were even easier and quicker decisions; within hours in both cases with little to no documentation required… It seems that most of the negative reviews are from those who were denied. What I'll say is that the customer service is second to none and if you establish a relationship with them (even if it's via the internet) they will deliver in a way which other lenders cannot."

I applied for a $17,000 auto loan, and was approved within three hours, at the lowest rate they offer (which I had convinced myself would only be available to people with 840+ credit scores. Once I received my approval, it was so simple to go in, select a deposit date, and select the beginning repayment date. This process was so seamless, so easy, that I almost feel like I cheated the "system." I will be recommending LightStream to all of my friends, family and co-workers."

            "I wanted to say how pleased I was with this whole experience.  Reading the reviews, you look good, but once I started working with you, you’re GREAT!  I have never had such an easy time working with a financial institution, and your support staff made it quick and easy.  I also could not believe that you answered my first email within 30 seconds. That is great customer support! The loan process was simple and FAST!  I emailed a few questions and got a call from Michael. The other thing I learned was that most other loan companies, no matter how good, had some nearly hidden fees.  Most were in the form of an origination fee that was deducted from the loan amount or in hidden interest.  Usually where the interest rate was 9.75% but the APR was 11.78%. When I asked I was told those were fees for loaning the money.  I was pleased to hear directly from email customer service that there were no fees and no hidden interest rates. Over all you get a 9 of 5 stars for complete customer satisfaction… I could not ask for a better experience."

            "I absolutely LOVED your used car loan process. Your concept is perfect and I just can't stop telling friends about it. The dealer told me there was no way I could beat his best interest rate from one of 10 companies. You helped me prove him wrong. Not only was he impressed that I beat him by a whole percentage point but also that it was unsecured debt and the money was available the next day. Plus, it was fun writing a personal check that large and to have them visually verify that I had the money in my account!  He said he'd keep you in mind for when his son starts driving and he needs to buy a car for him. You guys are simply amazing. Thank you so much for thinking outside the box to make lending easy for those who use it wisely!"
            - M. S. from Olathe, KS

            - C. P. & N. P. from Webster, MA


            "Thank you for this utterly painless, streamlined transaction! What a breath of fresh air. In addition to the competitive rate, your customer sales associate Krista was smart, friendly, and efficient. This was the most efficiently processed loan we have ever obtained, hands down.  We will tell everyone we know about LightStream."
            - M. K. & K. K. from Sherman Oaks, CA


            "Whoever is handling your customer relations is doing a great job. My future loans will come from you…"

            - S. F. from Greenville, SC


            "I would just like to say thank you for making this process seamless. You allowed me every avenue to make paying off my high-balance credit cards complete. I'm so happy to be closer to my goal of being debt free and LightStream is to thank for it."
            - N. A. from Denver, CO

            - D. C. from Coupeville, WA


            "I just wanted to say this was the easiest, smoothest, hassle free loan I have ever applied for.  It is rewarding for people who have good credit to not have to jump through hoops to be approved. Thank you."
            - T. A. from Graham, NC


            "… I have to tell you,I have owned 13 cars during my lifetime. I have financed perhaps 80% of them. This BY FAR has been the most pleasant process EVER. Thank you so much :)"
            - C. O. from Reno, NV


            "Easiest process ever!  Submitted application, received a call requesting pay stub to verify income and was approved within two hours of applying. Got an amazing rate on a new car purchase and couldn't recommend them enough…"
            - R. S. from Cayucos, CA


            "I have to respond to this confirmation just to say I cannot remember when I have been so impressed with the efficiency, simplicity, and design of anything! The period of 30 days is perfect. This is a very good deal for the boat I want, but is not confirmed as of yet. Wanted to secure the funds ahead of time.  I will definitely return to your site for future needs, and recommend you to anyone who might need your services."
            - D. M. from Newport, NC


            "… I applied for an auto loan, received approval a day later, and funds were added to my account the day after approval.
 
I spent maybe a total of 12 minutes between submitting the application and speaking to your customer service rep on some clarification questions.  I can't even drive to a bank in 12 minutes.
 
And you got me an unsecured loan at 1.99%... no back-and-forth emails, no lien-holder paperwork, no antiquated snail mail of forms, no dealing with time-draining dealership finance people and processes: No BS.  You guys figured out EXACTLY how a good loan process should go and made it happen: modern (i.e. electronic), simple, efficient and effective.
 
Just a great customer service experience, wow.  Well played LightStream."
            - J. K. from Idledale, CO


            "Thank you so very much [for the birthday email]! This is so very nice of your company to do this kind of thing for their customers. I have been more than happy with the service and the kindness we have received from you since we financed the truck through you. It was so easy, fast and painless. We would definitely go through you again. And you have proven that there really are human-run companies out there still. LOL! Thanks again! Have a great day!"

            - A. L. from Orlando, FL


            "In this fast-paced and sometimes impersonal world, I was extremely impressed by today's auto-loan application process and your agent's timely and professional response.  Unfortunately, the process happened so quickly, I did not write down the name of the female representative who telephoned.  For the record, and anyone in management viewing this email, please accept my sincere appreciation and please extend kudos for her professional, personal service, and first-class representation of your company.  I will definitely share this experience with others!"
            - S. G. & R. J. from Dallas, TX


            "Hello. I just wanted to pass along some praise. We recently acquired a loan from LightStream for the purpose of consolidating our high-interest credit card debt. We are absolutely thrilled with how quick and easy the entire process was. The communication was wonderful, as well. We got a fantastic rate and we couldn't be happier! Thank you so very much!"
            - J. V. & W. V. from Edgewater Park, NJ

            - A. R. from Beaufort, SC


            "Thank you.  I can't believe your company and how easy it is to do business with you.  It was a pleasure to borrow money with no hassles and low interest.  Amazing.  Why don't other companies (banks) behave in this civilized way?"
            - S. C. & R. C. from Denver, CO


            "I was just approved and received my LightStream loan, rapidly and successfully. No single word can describe how positive my experience with LightStream has been thus far. The purpose was to finance a classic automobile...  Upon my initial research, yet it seemed it would be a bit of a process as well as crazy high on the interest rate.  With LightStream, I was able to perform most document transactions via electronic form. It was extremely pain-free, easy, fast, and to the point, with only one brief phone interaction. I was able to obtain the full amount I asked for, at a super interest rate. I just wanted to tell you how pleased I am to have found you guys.  I really hope that you will be around for A LONG TIME soon as I am ready to apply for my next loan. Thanks a million!"
            - J. C. from Corona, CA


            "Your business model is amazing.  Admittedly, my credit is spotless but to get a $17,000 unsecured car loan in 15 minutes is truly almost beyond belief.  At a regular bank I would still be waiting for the proper person to talk after 15 minutes. Very well done! Thanks."
            - A. H. from Wooster, OH


            "I cannot emphasize enough how simple, convenient, and painless accessing a home improvement loan through LightStream was.  I applied for a $35,000 loan to do major interior work to our home; I was initially drawn in by LightStream’s interest rates, which were so much better than those offered by my local bank and credit union, even for those with excellent credit.  I was skeptical, assuming that no one actually qualified for the lowest rates indicated on LightStream’s website.  Holy cow was I wrong!  The entire process, from applying online, to submitting a pay stub for wage verification, to having the funds in my account was less than two days!  And I was offered the lowest rate listed by LightStream for the loan term I requested.  I cannot say enough how wonderfully simple, efficient, and uncomplicated this process was.  Thank you, LightStream!"
            - V. P. from Pierre, SD


            "A quick note to everyone at LightStream, you guys have been amazing… You really stand behind the fast and simple process. I constantly recommend you to everyone. I appreciate the quick response and friendly customer service that both my husband and I get every time we call. In fact, we had originally been declined for this second loan and after talking with one of your customer service reps they helped us get the funding we needed. They didn’t have the attitude 'there is nothing we can do for you' we got 'let’s see how we can make this work.' YOU GUYS ROCK!
"
            - E. T. & K. T. from Maricopa, AZ


            "My experience with the LightStream team and service has been thus far has been stellar!"

            "…. LightStream was wonderful to work with and I really like how easy navigating your web page is.  Very easy to get information."
            - R. E. from Garden City, KS


            "I have to give LightStream a LOT of credit. My wife and I started our application at around 6:30 on a Friday night.  We were approved by 7 p.m.  I couldn't believe it -- the company asked for additional documents and we were able to provide them right away.  Today is Tuesday (before 8 a.m.) and the loan is funded with the money already deposited into my bank account.  That's less than two business days. I did talk to a rep on the phone Monday; someone had called to clarify something on the credit report so we called back.  The call was very quick and the gentleman I talked to was friendly and helpful.  I didn't even have to wait on hold for someone to pick up.  Other companies get A+ ratings but seriously LightStream is one of the few companies that really deserve it."
            - T. B. from Portage, MI


            "I was recently denied a loan. I am not upset. It was clearly explained to me in a very professional manner. I just wanted to thank LightStream and its employees for such a professional experience.  I hope to be able to do business with LightStream in the future even though this attempt did not end as I had hoped.  Rest assured it did not leave a bitter taste behind.  I thank you for that.  Have a great weekend."
            - J. H. and S. H. from Overland Park, KS


            "I want to say 'Thank you all' as well. It was really nice to be able to do this loan process from my home.

Thanks!"

            - D. M. from Woodland Hills, CA


            "We recently completed a debt consolidation loan with you and were so impressed on how quickly and less painful it was to apply and get an approval. I have been in the banking industry for 30 years so I am well educated on the hoops some institutions make you jump through to get a loan. We were so impressed that we decided to upgrade to a new car, so I applied this morning for a used vehicle loan.  Incredibly, five hours later I received an email; you had two simple questions and didn't need further income documentation since you already had it on file.  About 15 minutes after that call, I received the approved loan email; that's just incredible."
            - R. M. and C. M. from Wallkill, NY

            "How amazing this process was. I expected it to take weeks and take a lot of documents for proof of income and other financials and was shocked I got an approval so fast and so hassle free. Thank you, LightStream."
            - S. O. from Locust Grove, VA


            "First I want to say this was in fact the EASIEST loan transaction ever!  I have truly found a new lender.  Thank you for making my dream of owning a pool come true in just one day!"
            - B. W. from Philadelphia, PA

I just wanted to say thank you and I have already recommended you to others and will continue. Thanks."
            - M. B. from Rahway, NJ


            "Your loan application process has to be by far the most amazingly simply and efficient experience I have come across.  The two times I spoke with a representative were very pleasant and basically your company "cut right to the chase" with asking for what they needed... I provided it...and my loan was approved and processed in record time.  I cannot begin to express my satisfaction with your company and how it works.  I look forward to dealing with you in the future and if there is some area where I could post this positive message to the public, please let me know!   Thank you so much!"
            - C. K. from Hop Bottom, PA

            "By far, the quickest turnaround, and best customer service we have ever experienced from a loan company.  Within four hours we had approval, the documents signed and in under 18 hours the funds were in our bank.  Thanks to LightStream/SunTrust Banks, we were able to purchase our classic car before someone else did.  We have purchased many vehicles over the years and we have never dealt with an easier loan process, uncomplicated, and just lightning fast.  We will be back and will tell everyone we know about your services.  Thank you."

            "We applied for a loan for a new roof & home repairs today at 11:30 am.  At 1:30, we had our approval and the money was deposited the next day!  The interest rate was great & we couldn’t be happier!!  Thanks so much!"

            "Love LightStream!  You made it easy to fund our new purchase of a 2006 Corvette from a private party.  A loan that most companies won't fund.  We love that you offer loans on the unconventional [purposes] from weddings to home repairs to cars that don't fit in the traditional boxes that traditional lending companies won't touch.  Plus, being green and paperless and planting a tree in honor of the loan!  That's awesome.  Great company! Keep up the great work!"

Very awesome and I will definitely recommend  LightStream/SunTrust to my friends and family! THANK YOU!"

            "In all my years of doing business with banks, yours is the best and second place isn't even close.  Don't change anything.  Your customer reps are friendly, professional and courteous.

I have been around for a long time and have been involved in many loans over my adult life, including mortgages, car loans, personal loans, educational loans, and a few more, and have never had a better organized, and helpful experience then this one with you all. It was totally professional, informative, and comfortable. Thank you, and we look forward to working with you in the future."

            "I recently used your financing for an auto loan.  This was because my bank told me it would take 4 days and 2 more after that for approval and funding of my loan.  Really!?  So I Googled and found LightStream.  I applied and was approved within the hour and funds deposited next day.  I was very impressed with your service as well as your extremely helpful employees.  So much so that I went ahead and refinanced my other 2 loans through you.  Just wanted to give you a compliment on a job well done.  Thanks."

            "You made my car-buying process so much faster and gave me an instant negotiating tool (i.e. being able to buy cash). When I called customer service the process was extremely efficient. Your associate was friendly, understanding and well-versed in your product details. She gave me information I needed about how to make extra payments (which can conveniently be done online); what to expect with the loan payout; and how to re-amortize the loan if I made extra payments…. I look forward to doing business with your reputable organization again. Our new to us (used car) is exactly what the family needed to feel safe on the roads and it was at a great price thanks to LightStream loan funding..."

            "This has been the easiest loan process ever… it is really wonderful not to have to deal with the finance people at the dealership — always a very wearing process — and have this clarity up front. Your communication and speed of processing/funding is very impressive. I know exactly what to expect and when to expect it. The website is simple and easy to use. Well done, I'll definitely recommend you to friends…"

            "This is really cool that [you plant a tree for every loan] when your customers choose paperless billing!  Thanks for being an environmentally conscious company and for going the extra mile.  It was totally unexpected that you would do this.  On top of your great loan rates, this is another reason I will recommend your service."

            "I just wanted to let you know your service thus far is outstanding.  The process of obtaining the loan was straightforward, and fair.  The payment structure is clear. The conveniences in terms of making extra payments, as well as automatically providing updated amortization schedules, amount to above and beyond customer service.   I am very pleased, and glad to do business with your institution.  Thank you."

            "I attempted to deal with my local bank, where I have had accounts for many years, but they wouldn't lend on a car that’s older than a 2010 model.  I went to another local bank, where I have had several car loans over the years.  They wanted $165 for a “loan origination fee” and would charge 7.5% interest on the loan.  I started the application process with them but every day they seemed to want more information from me.  This went on for several days until I chanced upon your advertisement online.  I was skeptical, as anyone should be with online transactions, but you turned out to be the real deal.  Your application process was simple and the approval was almost immediate.  The funds were available in a couple of days, deposited right into my bank account, and the interest rate was half of what local banks wanted.    Thank you.  Please feel free to use my compliments as a testimonial to your incredible service."

            "First off, a big thank you for helping our dream come true! Our local credit union couldn't even come close to offering the rate that you extended to us!

            "….by the way, I was pleasantly surprised by how efficiently my loan was processed.  I have to be honest, I had never heard about LightStream before I did some online searching, so I was pretty skeptical.  However, since receiving my loan so promptly and without any hassle, I told my friends about it, they applied for a loan (much greater than mine) to consolidate some other loans and were approved after some necessary paperwork, they had an excellent experience as well.

I can assure you that so long as nothing changes, the rest of my loans will be processed through LightStream in the future, be it auto, refinance, whatever.

Thanks again!

            "Our first experience with LightStream was great!  I am amazed at how easy and fast the entire process was.  We applied for a large loan for a swimming pool and thought it would take some time to get approved and funds in our bank account.  We applied on a Saturday morning, and Sunday were approved, and could have had our funds on Monday, but we wanted to hold off until our contract was signed with our pool builder.  We will recommend LightStream to our friends and family!  THANK you!"

            "We applied at our local bank for a home equity line of credit for $75,000.  Home taxable value $350,000, free & clear.  Plus an apartment building with no debt but lots of income.  Our credit scores are 775 & 780.  No debt.  Local bank got hung up on the apartment building leases forgetting we were applying for a HOME EQUITY LINE OF CREDIT for $75,000, less than the home's worth.

After 6 weeks, we found a 2008 Class A bunkhouse George Town 350 SE by Forest River with only 17,000 miles, excellent condition with many extras.  List price over $125,000.  We had most of the money but needed another $45,000 to close the deal.  The local bank still undecided.

I went online and found LightStream, a Division of SunTrust.  I began the application process at 4pm, approved 9 am the next day, money deposited into my local bank account the next business day.  Unsecured loan! I could have saved myself 6 weeks of stress providing the local bank with 178 pages of documentation and waiting to see if...I refer others to LightStream!

            "Thank you. I continue to be impressed not only with your excellent product offerings, but with your "presence."  The website is wonderfully low-key and simple with a very personable manner of communication, and little things like the fact that you acknowledge this is our second loan with you rather than treating us as just another entry in your ledgers make a huge difference in that elusive entity called good will. I'm a fan and am regularly recommending you to my friends and colleagues who are in need of a loan."

It was fast, and filled with pleasant surprises from picking our funding dates, to changing our loan amount, to having a tree planted because we took a loan.  That one I really liked!  The few questions I had were answered quickly via email.  I am in banking and wish we had a product like this, kudos on a remarkable job.  I know where I am coming again when I need a loan."

            "...Please know that I found your service to be excellent and the process more simple than I would have imagined and that it is everything you advertise in simplicity of process and convenience. Should the need arise again, I would not hesitate to come to you first and have told several others already about how easy the service was to use and how incredibly quickly you all provided me an answer and a loan at a terrific rate.

My bank had me hopping through hoops and dragging out years’ worth of paperwork and spending countless hours on the phone with a loan officer, that one would think I was asking for a million dollars.  I was beginning to think that having excellent credit didn't matter much now a days.  LightStream made the loan process painless again.  Thank you LightStream."

            "Let me say Thank You, Thank You, for the most hassle free loan I have ever had. The approval and funding service was incredible. 

The interest rate for a personal loan is 2nd to none.

It was very easy to get set up and set to pay back this loan will save over $5,000.00 when I pay off my existing travel trailer loan set at 9.5% versus the loan you gave me at 2.99%.

Again thank you so.

I wish all loan applications were this easy.  I can't thank you enough.  Your rates were the same as my credit union, but I can do this in the comfort of my own home.  I am highly recommending your bank to all my friends and family.  No more visits to my local bank or credit union for the type of loans you offer.  Super highly recommended."

            "I would ask that you pass this on to the staff that worked on my loan.  I work in Afghanistan in support of the US Military and my wife is home going to medical school.  So you can see that it would be very hard for us to stop and do a normal loan at our SunTrust Bank.  From the start of the loan process, all the way through to the end, I have received the best customer service that I have seen in a long time.  It is refreshing to be able to talk to people with such a positive attitude.  I felt like I was sitting in the loan office of our bank that we have been customers with since 1999, and when you walk in they say our names.  Again, I just wanted to let your team know they are outstanding!"

            "So far I am amazed by your process and hope this will be the start of a wonderful loan relationship!!!!"
            - S.M. from Wilmette, IL


            "I cannot believe how easy this loan process has been. I was skeptical at first but seeing you were part of SunTrust bank so I applied. I have banked with [other bank] for years and I am seriously thinking about closing my accounts with them and opening  SunTrust accounts because of this experience with you guys."
            - Anonymous


            "Just wanted to thank you for making this transaction so smooth and stress-free.  Your web site is so well designed and easy to use.  I will recommend you to my friends in the future."
            - M.A. from Santa Rosa, CA


            "Your service was extremely easy and the funds were transferred early on the day of funding.  Everything went so well, I think your group will be very successful with this program in the future.  Thanks for planting the tree."
            - F.S. from San Luis Obispo, CA


            "Congratulations on doing an EXCELLENT job on the loan.  It is incredible how little paperwork was required.  You did everything you said you would in a very timely manner.  I would not hesitate to use your company again or recommend you to others."
            - C.K. from Stockton, CA


            "I just wanted to take a second and say, thank you.  The loan process with LightStream was unbelievably smooth.  From the easy/short application, quick decision time, uploading docs and E-docs, to the funding date and picking your own payment date.  There was not a step of the process that I could have hoped to go better.  I have worked in banks and loan funding, and I have never seen a process this streamlined.  I did a lot of research to make sure I was getting a great deal, and I was in no way disappointed.  It's nice to see a bank that obviously has customer service as a top priority rather than just closing loans and collecting interest.  When I called with questions on the loan I was greeted with an actual person as well.  This was a nice surprise.  Anyway, Just wanted to say great work, and it's appreciated."
            - E.C. from Hawthorne, NJ


            "Thank you so much for the wonderfully smooth and quick transaction.  Pleasure doing business with you!"
            - K.G. from Johns Creek, GA


            "You guys are amazing.  It was an absolute pleasure dealing with LightStream.  First, you have the best rates.  And you don’t ask for a ton of paperwork and everything is submitted electronically, so it’s simple.  When I called to ask a question, you answered within seconds… not minutes, but seconds.  I made about five calls and each person was extremely knowledgeable and pleasant.  I never needed to be put on hold.  And when I realized how good your rate was and how affordable the monthly payments would be, I called to ask about increasing the amount of the loan (but worried that I would have to start all over) and you advised that once loans are approved, they can be increased up to another $5K.  So your business model even anticipates what people might want to do. I'm a marketing consultant to global companies, but you guys could give business classes to most companies today."
            - L.N. from Weston, CT


            "Thank you very much for making our loan application a very enjoyable experience.  We have never dealt with any business that has been as professional and efficient as this process has been.  Getting the loan has been so much easier than dealing with the boat dealerships.  Most seem to not care whether they sell a boat or not, and that is not the case with your organization.  You’re NUMBER 1!  You put your customers first.  I’m not too proficient with the computer, but your instructions were easy to follow.  Thanks again!"
            - D.B. from Westminister, SC


            "I have to say, I am blown away at how easy this was to complete.  You weren't kidding when you said it's guaranteed the easiest loan process ever.  I thought dealing with our credit union in the past was easy, but this takes it to a whole different level."
            - J.W. from Bee Cave, TX


            "I just wanted to take a quick moment to say how great my experience with LightStream has been.  After several months I have found the whole process very user friendly.  Everything on LightStream's part has gone just as the expectation that was set.

Just wanted to give a quick note that I have found both the staff and the service provided stellar.
"
            - M.J. from Milton, FL

At LightStream, we care about the environment and, more importantly, we try to do something about it.  For one, we have created a paperless consumer loan experience at LightStream.  By eliminating paper almost entirely from the LightStream loan process, we not only save our natural resources but we save on expenses as well, better enabling us to offer you highly competitive interest rates.

In addition, for every loan that we fund for our customers, 
we will have a tree planted in one of our country's fragile habitat communities currently under restoration.

WHAT DOES LIGHTSTREAM DO WITH YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?


Why?
Financial companies choose how they share your personal information. Federal law
                    gives consumers the right to limit some but not all sharing. Federal law also requires
                    us to tell you how we collect, share, and protect your personal information. Please
                    read this notice carefully to understand what we do.

                    business—to process transactions, maintain customer accounts, and report to credit
                    bureaus. In the section below, we list the reasons financial companies can share
                    their customers' personal information; the reasons LightStream chooses to share;

Who we are


Who is providing this notice?
LightStream, and its affiliates.




What we do


How does LightStream protect my personal information?
To protect your personal information from unauthorized access and use, we use security
                    measures that comply with federal law. These measures include computer safeguards
                    and secured files and buildings.


How does LightStream collect my personal information?
We collect your personal information, for example, when you
                    
open an account or deposit money

                    We also collect your personal information from others, such as credit bureaus, affiliates,
                    or other companies. 


Why can't I limit all sharing?
Federal law gives you the right to limit sharing only for
                    
affiliates' everyday business purposes—information about your creditworthiness
affiliates to market to you
nonaffiliates to market to you

                    State laws and individual companies may give you additional rights to limit sharing.
                


What happens when I limit sharing for an account I hold jointly with someone else?
Your choices will apply to everyone on your account—unless you tell us otherwise

LightStream is a national online consumer lending division of SunTrust Bank. From the convenience of a computer or mobile device, LightStream offers its customers highly competitive fixed rate financing. The company advertises a hassle-free loan that rewards customers for their good credit and promises the best loan experience possible.



The Good

Flexible Loan Terms
Interest Rates
High Maximum Loan Amount
Direct Lender

Flexible Loan Terms
LightStream has many different loan terms available to customers. The maximum loan term offered through LightStream is an 84-month or a seven-year loan; however, there are several other options for terms available through LightStream. Customers can select to have a loan as short as 24 months or two years. LightStream is flexible and allows customers to choose a loan term that best fits their needs.
Interest Rates
Interest rates can depend on several different factors, including the time period of the loan, the reason for the loan, the loan amount, and the borrower's credit history. LightStream offers competitive interest rates that can be as low as 2.19 percent (with auto-pay) for customers with excellent credit scores. LightStream's highest APR for personal loans is 17.99 percent.
**Your APR may differ based on loan purpose, amount, term, and your credit profile. Rate is quoted with AutoPay discount, which is only available when you select AutoPay prior to loan funding. Rates under the invocing option are 0.50 percent higher. Subject to credit approval. Conditions and limitations appy. Advertised rates and terms are subject to change without notice. MOnthly Payments for a $10,000 loans at 5.99 percent APR with a term of three years would result in 36 monthly payment of $304.17. 
High Maximum Loan Amount
LightStream is competitive in the loan amounts that it offers. The company allows customers to borrow as little as $5,000 or as much as $100,000. With such a wide range of loan amounts available, borrowers have the ability to select a loan that will best fit their needs.
Direct Lender
Unlike many of LightStream's competitors, all of the funding for the company's loans is provided directly in-house, which means immediate funding upon the close of a consumer's loan. This also means that there are no third parties involved in the process. The less a consumer's information is transmitted from hand to hand, the less chance there is of that consumer falling victim to scams, predatory lending, or other forms of illegal activity such as identity theft. Visit Site



The Bad

Fund Stipulations
Minimum Credit Score
No Peer-to-Peer Lending

Fund Stipulations
Once a customer applies for a loan, LightStream has a team of underwriters that carefully look into the details of both the loan and the applicant. Same-day funding is possible if someone applies, is approved and chooses a funding date by 2:30 Eastern time. Once the funds are made available, customers receiving loans through LightStream and have 30 days to move the funds into their personal bank accounts or the loan application is cancelled and the entire process must be restarted. In addition, funds must be used specifically for the reason stated when applying for the loan or the loan is void. These are basic terms of the agreement and apply to each and every loan processed through LightStream.
Minimum Credit Score
LightStream requires borrowers to have a minimum credit score of 680 in order to qualify for a loan. This is relatively high in comparison to other online lending companies; however, LightStream does claim to be a loan company that rewards its customers for excellent credit. This could be the reason behind the required good to excellent credit score requirements for all LightStream loans.
No Peer-to-Peer Lending
Peer-to-peer lending is becoming increasingly popular. However, LightStream does not offer this option. Instead, the company is the online consumer lending division of SunTrust Bank. Customers looking for a peer-to-peer loan will not find it with LightStream.



The Bottom Line
LightStream offers an impressive array of features and is backed up by SunTrust Bank, which is a strong company. LightStream is ideal for individuals with credit scores of 680 and up. Although LightStream offers some of the best APRs in the industry with flexible loan terms to choose from, those consumers with little to no credit will have a difficult time receiving a loan from LightStream.

Applied for a pool loan, approved and secured funds within the same day! Delivered just as promised. The process was the simplest I have ever experienced when applying for a loan.   The only down fall is you can't claim the interest on your taxes.

I'm buying a classic Chrysler muscle car and was having a hard time securing reasonable auto loans through banks I've dealt with for years.  I applied to LighStream with a score around 730 and was approved after answering 3 brief questions over the phone.  Honestly the process was so incredibly fast and easy that I'm HERE reading reviews to figure out what the scam is...  The only complaints I see are people getting denied, but for whatever reason, I'm not in that boat.

Great experience with Lightstream. Auto loan approved right away and money deposited in our account before we even found the car. Lowest interest rate we could find anywhere. So convenient to check our balance anytime and make extra payments on line. We will be using Lightstream again in the future.

Pretty flawless on a small 7K loan. Interest rate can't be beat, after screwing around with local banks getting denied time after time with a exceptional credit record , lightstream was refreshing. Just simple and worked.

I have had one auto loan through LightStream, and just applied (and was approved within an hour) for a new loan. I noticed all of the crybaby reviews on here, and just wanted to help balance it out. Their process is quick and simple, and always offered rates well below what my local credit union (of which I have been a member for nearly 30 years) can offer. Additionally, LightStream will finance vehicles older than 10 years, which is hard to find with banks and credit unions. If you have good credit and adequate income, this is a great company to use. I can only speak to auto loans- not sure about any of their other products.

Wanted to do an auto refi, have over 8k in equity, and 100% pay on time ratio's. Debt % is high, however with credit history over 29 years of on time pay, they declined. Their disclaimer say's they look at all aspect's, although obviuosly did not.  I would have considered it a slam dunk, or a secured loan. I will never use this company as my debt ratio's reduce, and would not recommend any service from them.

Non-deliverers!! With FICO around 770, income well over $100k, less that 25% utilization, this ought to be a mere formality. Nevertheless, they declined application after responding to their "pre-selected" offer, leaving a "hard" inquiry on the record. Never seen such nonsense before, and it's by far not the first personal loan I applied for. Welcome to another blacklist, LightStream scammers!

Waste of time, wanted a pool loan for 65k had more than double in liquid assets available, kept hounding me for more info more documents, kept supplying. Credit score was close to 700, denied me anyway. Not really sure who's getting approved but they must not be borrowing much money and that's why they're approved. Its also true that they don't let you specify certain info and just judge off basic numbers. IE: Not counting that mortgages are paid through renters generating positive income.

Couldn't have been easier. Applied on a holiday. Approved on the holiday.  $35K renovation loan approved within hours.  Received the lowest advertised interest rate, competive with home equity loan.  Easiest loan ever.

Fast, easy and great service.  Best interest rate given for my last minute pool project.  Got my $$$ same day without any issues.  There email online service is the best so far I've ever dealt with.  Only people complaining is probably the ones with real bad credit.

Horribly rude customer service over email.  They advertise one rate but approve a different one by tricking you and saying that they will give 0.5% for autopay.  Instead they up their rate by 0.5% than what any other institution is offering.  The rude emails indicate that they either are tanking and at this point not looking for new customers, or their employees are so underpaid that they take it out on the customers.  Either way, beware.

WARNING - LIGHTSTREAM IS HORRIBLE! 

Don't even bother applying to a company with so many negative reviews from people with outstanding credit! There is no personal experience - no "real person" to speak with, it's automated with very tight standards, even I don't understand! 

I have 800+ Credit / 100k income / Zero Credit Card Debt / More Money in the Bank than the auto loan I applied for, and was still denied!! (my credit union approved me in 30 minutes). My guess is they looked at three home loans on my credit report - not recognizing that two of the homes are rental properties generating positive income and just calculated my debt-to-income was out of wack... crazy that they don't ask for details - just a rude "your denied".

This company is losing lots and lots of great business just by their "quick and easy" approach.

I knew there was no way I'd get denied, so I was suckered into applying by their low advertised rates - don't you be a sucker too! Any credit union on the planet will give you a loan at low rates and you don't have to be a member to apply! I used Security Service Credit Union.

I used LightStream for an auto loan and I couldn't be happier with the process. It took less than 2 hours for me to be approved for the auto loan. They funded my checking account within 24 hours and I was able to pay off my previous auto loan within 2 business days. My interest rate reduced by almost 1 and a quarter percent and I will save almost $2,500 over the course of the loan. The process was extremely fast and efficient. Their website is relatively simple and user-friendly. At the touch of a button, I can easily adjust my monthly payments and get a quick schedule of the payments until the loan has been completely paid off. That way, I can easily gauge how much interest I'd save if I were to make additional payments each month. Honestly, I can't imagine using any other loan service going forward. Please note they offer unsecured loans which means applicants are approved (or declined) solely based on their credit score and current substantiated financial position. Since it's an unsecured auto loan, the underlying item is not deemed collateral. The good thing about having an unsecured auto loan is that you, as the buyer, receive the car title immediately. Your credit score and financial position gives LightStream confidence that you will not only make monthly payments timely but also resist the temptation to put your car title down on the craps table.

I had nothing but an excellent experience with Lightstream. Easy application process; no glitches or delays; extremely competitive rate; easy-peasy auto-pay system (my choice of payment date) with no problems. Never had to contact customer support, so cannot comment on that aspect: all was handled through secure on-line transaction.

Extremely rude. Spoke with Andrei who was upset because me and my husband share an email address. Continued to ask questions about my life and family that pertained nothing to the Loan. After an hour of arguing I told him to cancel the application. I've never set with such scum in my life!! Don't Use This Bank!

Customers are Saying...



            "We don't have any questions. Just a comment. We are 100% satisfied with the loan experiences we've had with LightStream. The application process was quick and painless and our concerns were addressed within 5 min of sending an email to customer service. Also,  the service feels very personalized. 10 out of 10! Congratulations,  you've gained yourselves lifelong customers!"
            - B. M. & B. M. from Ogden, UT


            "For anyone in need of a loan, they won't even consider financing with anyone else after they experience LightStream.  There simply isn't a better way to go about it.  The other sites that I visited were far and away behind LightStream, and cannot compete at any level in my view.  Nobody offers what LightStream does that I am aware of, and I will never go anywhere else.  Fast, efficient, and incredibly easy.  Thank you very much for making my experience the best ever."
            - A. C. from Marseilles, IL


            "I have borrowed (and paid back successfully) multiple personal loans throughout my professional career.  And you guys offer, by far, the most outstanding overall experience of all of them.  I look forward to much more business with you over the years!"
            - E. R. from Carson, CA


            "Thank you so much for making my dream happen (owning a 56 Belair) … love you guys."
            - M. C. from Glendale, AZ


            "Great process and experience.  I purchased a 2008 Corvette this week and fulfilled a lifelong dream.  Having the money to deal and personally holding the title made the entire process much more pleasant than dealing with financing at the time of purchase. Thanks for inventing the best loan process ever."
            - J. L. from Arden, NC


            "You guys Rock making it so easy for deserving customers. Appreciate your service - will bank with u guys from now on."
            - S. B. from Dallas, TX


            "This was the most hassle-free loan we have ever applied for. The application was received and approved in one hour and four minutes.  Outstanding service is an understatement!!!  Kudos to the staff at LightStream!"
            - R. G. & K. G. from South Daytona, FL


            "Hello LightStream folks. I just got an easy, low interest loan from you via my Suntrust Bank. Then, today, I got an ecard saying y'all arrange to plant a tree with every loan! Thanks! That tree shall be named "Gibbs" to share the name of the Ford F150 Pickup that we bought with the loan! May Gibbs grow tall and strong! Thanks!"
            - R. S. & T. S. from Hephzibah, GA


            "Approved in minutes. I have excellent credit and qualified for their lowest rate, that traditional brick and mortar banks can't even come close to, at my terms, and completely unsecured.  They called a few minutes after I submitted the application to confirm my work number, and moments later, an email arrived telling me I was approved.  They allowed ME to decide when my first payment would be, which they push to the next business day if that falls on a weekend or federal holiday.  The proceeds were available in my bank account the very next day.
Fast, no hoops to jump through, and incredible terms.  I feel like taking out another loan just for the sake of it because the process was so satisfying.
"
            - B. C. from Lanoka Harbor, NJ


            "I just wanted to commend your company on its efficiency, efficacy, and equitability. I have never enjoyed such service and ease of accomplishment. At this point, you are doing everything right except the access for customer feedback and comments. I searched your website for several minutes before finding this page.

            "Just wanted to take a moment to comment on your process. Hands down the best loan experience I have ever had. So simple and straight forward it's hard to believe. It was a process that assigned real value to a lifetime of good decisions. I will gladly do business with you again and I'm happy to tell my friends with similar credit profiles about you."

            "I LOVE THIS SITE, THE PROCESS AND THE SPEED OF ASSISTANCE THROUGHOUT THIS LOAN EXPERIENCE. I SAW THE AD INDICATING "BEST LOAN EXPERIENCE EVER OF WE WILL GIVE YOU $100." I THOUGHT, PROBABLY EVERYBODY SAYS THAT. THIS HAS TRULY BEEN AN EXPERIENCE THAT FAR EXCEEDED MY EXPECTATIONS. NEVER HAD TO LEAVE MY DESK. LOW INTEREST RATE. FLEXIBLE TERMS. KNEW THE COMMITMENT BEFORE LOAN OR CREDIT PROCESSED. LIGHTENING SPEED OF APPROVAL AND FUNDING PROCESS. I LOVE YOU GUYS!"
            - L. B. from Smyrna, TN


            "I just wanted to say thank you, to the Lightstream staff and creators of the process! This was by far, the easiest loan process I’ve ever been through! With your help, our lives have gotten much easier to handle financially. I will be returning to SunTrust Bank and LightStream for all of my future financial needs!"

            "I wanted to wait until the first debit processed to offer my unqualified endorsement of your service.  I discovered you on the web, applied for a car loan on a Thursday, had the funds in my Credit Union the next day, and had my CPO car that afternoon.  Unbelievable.  Just a follow up call the day of the application and that was that.  Also, your web site, both before and after the loan is excellent.  Very easy to navigate, and the clarity of my loan and its current standing is flawless.  A 100% positive experience."

            "Over the past few months, I have had to manage, a home refinance, new homeowner and car insurance, new employer setup and benefits. 
All of it was done electronically and most of it was very disastrous.  No real people to talk to, and the navigation oftentimes did not work.

When I was advised that the LightStream loan process would be electronic, I was wary.  Happily, my concerns were unfounded.  I found your process
to be easy and quick.  Your turnaround is incredible.  When reaching out to real people, I was not placed on hold and I did not have to go through 
endless scripts ending up with a disconnect.  The people answering were knowledgeable, friendly, and easy to understand. 
How refreshing!

            "I just wanted to express our happiness and gratitude for the ease and efficiency in the entire loan process. From day one of applying for the loan to the payment process, it has been flawless! We were amazed at the quickness it took to be approved and receive the money for the loan. I believe it was 2-3 days!  Never have we ever been taken care of with such courtesy and expertise. We will most definitely be referring you to our friends and family. Keep doing what you're doing because you guys got it right!!!"

            "Just wanted to say how much I love your mobile friendly system.  On my phone I check balance and payments. Easy to make extra payments. Great rate and the entire process has been very user friendly. Wish I didn't owe you money but the experience has been great! Thanks friends!"
            - R.M. from Little River, SC


            "I am one of those people that rarely write reviews but couldn't do this after my great experience. I applied in the evening on a Monday and was advised that I would hear the next business day once underwriting was in the office. I would say by 9 am the next morning I had my approval for a used unsecured auto loan for 1.74%!!! That is an amazing rate and I know being an underwriter for consumer loans myself! The process was simple and I had my money by Wednesday morning with no extra fees. I couldn't even get as good of a rate or customer service from the bank I work at (and underwriters who sit right next to me) if I had tried."

            "To the Team at LightStream:

Indeed, this is great news! You guys have certainly created an excellent customer experience overall. We are extremely pleased. Your email response time is very appropriate, the language and communication skill of the employees has the right balance between friendly and professional. I also felt very well informed of the tasks I needed to accomplish in order to be in good standing. The use of appropriate hyper-links is a great approach for both tech savvy and non tech savvy individuals.

I could say some more complimentary things, but for now I will cease there. I will recommend you as well to anyone in need of loan services. To the planners and wonderful implementors of the LightStream approach - well done. Up there with Zappos and Amazon with certainly!

On top of it all, I carry the wonderful heart weight of knowing my loan assisted in the planting of a wonderful tree. Bravo. 

Truly grateful - you are making a difference providing for your families while doing it.

            "Good morning, I wanted to send a quick thank you for providing such excellent customer service. This is our second loan with LightStream and both experiences have been extraordinarily efficient. The online application is simple and response time is so fast. Our second loan was even easier than our first since much of our information auto filled (very smart). Also, the emails that I receive from LightStream are concise vs. filled with useless default information that we are all so unfortunately used to from other businesses. Thank you so much for doing what you do. You guys are awesome!"

Great, Great, Great, Job!!"

            "LightStream was amazing to work with and I have already recommended them to friends and family. They make the process incredibly easy and their rates are great…LightStream's customer service was efficient and friendly and navigating their site was incredibly easy. The entire application process to funding and now repay is streamlined and simple. I read all the fine print and they truly offer a simple interest loan with no prepayment penalties and their rates are very competitive. They made consolidating my credit card debt painless and I have the peace of mind knowing that I will be able to pay off this loan in 3 years and my interest has been cut in half! I will be thinking of LightStream first the next time I need a loan."

            "I wish I could like your page 100 times. LightStream has made my last two car purchases a breeze. I really appreciate that there is still a company out there willing to extend quality low-rate unsecured loans so quickly and effectively to people with the credit history, income, and assets to qualify. It seems most banks have gotten away from really rewarding the "very low risk" borrowers with appropriate benefits - they just have their standard categories of high or low risk and give a standard rate and terms accordingly. I tell everyone I know about LightStream. Thanks again for making my life easier."

I can honestly say that the process you have is the easiest, most customer friendly process that I have ever encountered.  I look forward to being a customer of yours, paying off this loan and also looking to you for any future needs and I have already recommended you to several people.  Thank you again for your outstanding customer service.  I don’t usually write notes like this, but I don’t usually get excellent customer service and when I do, I like to acknowledge it. Thanks again."

            "This was the most efficient and convenient loan process I have experienced. I needed assistance with two areas on the application and received help immediately.  After all was submitted, Alyssa called about a routing problem; I had given incomplete information.  She competently corrected numbers and verified procedures through a conference call with my bank. She then explained the deposit options, allowing me to choose without a hint of impatience or condescension, somewhat rare among young technical assistance professionals these days! Her degree of thoroughness and attention to detail was impressive.

I work hard to pay bills and live as debt-free as possible. You made a small splurge (horse trailer) possible!"

I am a somewhat picky customer and can be a bit of a pain sometimes.  Regardless, your team has always dealt with me with grace and courtesy.  You are also incredibly fast in your responses to my questions and set a very high bar for any of your competitors to match.  From the very first time I was introduced to LightStream, you stood out as different and noticeably better.  Applying for a loan was super easy, approval was quick and the whole process was the most pleasant and quick loan experience I can remember.  I am an IT pioneer, with more than 50 years in the field, much of that spent consulting with Fortune 500 companies, including many major banks.  You make me proud in that you represent a shining example of smart IT use, backed up by first class people. To put it in fewer words, LightStream ROCKS!
Thank you for doing such a wonderful job for your clients. To Gwen and Monica and all the others on the Customer Service team, keep on doing what you obviously do extremely well, making LightStream’s customers happy."

            "Amazing experience! I reached out to LightStream because I'm buying my first boat and I can't say enough about how great this experience was. I submitted my application online on a Wednesday, got a call a few hours later that missed. Called them back in the morning the next day, answered a couple of questions they had, got an email 20 minutes later asking for me to attach my latest paystub, 20 minutes after I did that I got an email with approval. I could have had the money wired the next day if I chose. I held off because I was still negotiating with the broker on the boat. The whole process took less than 24 hours. To put it in perspective, I submitted an application with the broker to finance through his company two days before I submitted with LightStream... it's now been almost a week and I haven't heard back regarding the financing from the broker yet. I just told him to forget about it, I was going to pay cash. That helped the negotiations! I never, ever take the time to write reviews but this process was so easy, the customer service and responsiveness is by far the best I've ever had. If you're looking for a pleasant experience financing your next toy, you have to reach out to LightStream and see what they have to offer."

            "We just wanted to let you know that the whole process of getting an unsecured loan with LightStream has been fantastic. It was so easy and quick to get the money into our bank account, and then to have the payments automatically withdrawn. Also, the website is easy to use and doesn't have a bunch of stuff on it that you don't need. Don't change a thing!! You are doing GREAT!"

Never have I been so impressed with your speed on decisions and deposits! We are so grateful that you are as good as your word. In this day and time, it's hard to find a company that cares about their customers time and finances. You did both, if I could rate you it would be 5 stars! Tell you what, whenever you are near this area, come by and jump in the pool with us. Again, just wanted to let you know how great we think you are and how you took care of us."

            "I have never experienced a simpler or quicker loan process in my life. Applied and was approved within 2 days. Any delays were generally tied to how often I checked my email. Application process was all online and took 10 minutes max. Received a great rate and money was deposited in my account on the day I selected. All transactions were simple, fast, and digital…"
            - D.N. from Alpharetta, GA


            "I used LightStream for an auto loan and I couldn't be happier with the process… The process was extremely fast and efficient. Their website is relatively simple and user-friendly. At the touch of a button, I can easily adjust my monthly payments and get a quick schedule of the payments until the loan has been completely paid off. That way, I can easily gauge how much interest I'd save if I were to make additional payments each month. Honestly, I can't imagine using any other loan service going forward… Your credit score and financial position gives LightStream confidence that you will not only make monthly payments timely but also resist the temptation to put your car title down on the craps table."

Wow...I am overwhelmed with gratitude to get away from the HIGH interest rates and a fee for everything.

Thank you!"

            "...Thank You for an excellent experience!

Yesterday, I started looking online for attractive auto loan options as I had selected a 2016 GMC Canyon that I wanted to purchase.  Based on several recommendations I found, I took a look at LightStream and decided it was worthwhile to start a loan application.  What immediately caught my eye is they describe and market their service…  “LightStream offers attractive loan terms and approval processes if you have excellent credit history, you have a high credit rating, etc.”  I thought to myself, have I perhaps found a financial institution that caters to very low risk customers and rewards them with great rates and simple loan processes?  I was very hopeful.

The loan application itself was incredibly simple and took me less than 10 minutes to complete.  Step 1 complete, I give it a 10 out of 10.  

In less than a minute I received an email letting me know things were underway.  I received a phone call in approximately 25 minutes from a very friendly customer service representative who was reviewing my application.  She only had one minor question related to my address/city not coinciding to my zip code which we easily sorted out.  Step 2 complete, another 10 out of 10.

10 minutes later I received an approval email with a 1.99% term.  The email had a web link where I could customize my loan amount, payment term and date, and when and where my funds would be deposited to.  Step 3 complete, 10 out of 10.

This morning at 7am I check my account balance and my funds had been deposited.  Final step complete, 10 out of 10.

This afternoon I went and picked up my new GMC Canyon and was able to pay cash for it which helped me negotiate a very good purchase price.
Few things in life exceed my expectation, especially so when they involve major purchases, loans, financial institutions and processes that usually take hours.  I give the entire LightStream experience my very highest recommendation.  It was fast, simple, incredible efficient and rewards those who take things like credit worthiness seriously.

I am VERY satisfied and will most certainly do business with LightStream again."

            "I know you plant a tree for every loan given, but I just wanted to tell you what that means to us.  We are up to our eyeballs in the IVF process which is the reason we got this loan.  Previous to this, we endured almost 4 years of repeated miscarriages (7 total) and we recently planted a magnolia bush to commemorate those losses.  There's something very special and poignant to planting a tree to honor loss and I just wanted to say thank you!!!!!  We also appreciate the real reason-- saving the earth for our future generation!!!"

I applied online and they called me 45 minutes later and asked me some follow up questions. Half an hour later, I was approved and I had the money in my checking account the next day. Since it's an unsecured loan, you can just tell the dealership you're paying cash, which makes the buying process simple and quick, too. LightStream gave me the best rate I could find, by a good margin…"

My credit is excellent, but no local banks would lend on a vehicle 12-years-old, or older… The best part is that my APR went DOWN from my current payment .5%, and the monthly payments went down $150, and my overall vehicle debt went down $4,000! What a deal! Thank you for lending based upon good credit history. This is an amazing business model, and great customer service; thank you again!"

            - P.B. from Woodstock, CT


            "I cannot say enough about my experience with LightStream. Within three days of applying for a new car loan I had my funds in the bank. The online application process was seamless and the follow-up for additional documentation was effortless; and within a day of my loan being approved, my funds were wired to my account. The sweetener came with the interest rate that was offered... 3% on a 72-month loan... A+++++"

            "Just wanted you all to know that I really appreciate your service. It is nice to know that good credit means something in today's world. The experience you have provided me and the service you have provided me and my family has been exceptional. I will admit that it is exceptional mainly in that it has been painless. The amount of time I saved by using your services is priceless because I can get on with living instead of dealing with financial red tape. Well done!"

            "I can't say enough about this company and their customer service. My wife and I found them by chance back in 2013 and since then we've closed four auto loans totaling $60,000. The first was a refinance which saved 2.5% and hundreds over the life of the loan. The process was so seamless that we refinanced another vehicle about two weeks later. It seems that they value repeat customers and consider their payment history, as the subsequent loans were even easier and quicker decisions; within hours in both cases with little to no documentation required… It seems that most of the negative reviews are from those who were denied. What I'll say is that the customer service is second to none and if you establish a relationship with them (even if it's via the internet) they will deliver in a way which other lenders cannot."
            - S.V. & N.V. from Estero, FL


            "I can't say enough about your staff. I have had many cars and loans in my time and I wish it could always be easy and organized. Everyone is always very polite, knowledgeable and you have the best rates. I will recommend your services to all my friends and car buddies. Thanks again for helping get my dream car in my garage. I absolutely love it!"
            - P.S. from Peoria, AZ


            "I cannot say enough wonderful things about this company or their process. I applied for a $17,000 auto loan, and was approved within three hours, at the lowest rate they offer (which I had convinced myself would only be available to people with 840+ credit scores. Once I received my approval, it was so simple to go in, select a deposit date, and select the beginning repayment date. This process was so seamless, so easy, that I almost feel like I cheated the "system." I will be recommending LightStream to all of my friends, family and co-workers."
            - S.L. from Dunmore, PA


            "Your application process is so simple and customer service team is just great. I cannot say enough good things about your company. I will let others know, in person and online, about how great your services are."

            - P.M. from Haskell, NJ


            "I wanted to say how pleased I was with this whole experience.  Reading the reviews, you look good, but once I started working with you, you’re GREAT!  I have never had such an easy time working with a financial institution, and your support staff made it quick and easy.  I also could not believe that you answered my first email within 30 seconds. That is great customer support! The loan process was simple and FAST!  I emailed a few questions and got a call from Michael. The other thing I learned was that most other loan companies, no matter how good, had some nearly hidden fees.  Most were in the form of an origination fee that was deducted from the loan amount or in hidden interest.  Usually where the interest rate was 9.75% but the APR was 11.78%. When I asked I was told those were fees for loaning the money.  I was pleased to hear directly from email customer service that there were no fees and no hidden interest rates. Over all you get a 9 of 5 stars for complete customer satisfaction… I could not ask for a better experience."

            "I want to thank LightStream for the excellent job and treatment toward my loan that I needed to fix my teeth and pay off my credit card. Everything is on cruise control, kudos for all personnel who do a great job every day. You got me hooked for future loans. Once again thank you."
            - F. Y. from San Antonio, TX


            "To the helpful people at LightStream: First off, thank you for redefining the loan process. I was amazed at how easy everything was. It was great to actually feel trusted by a bank, and I loved having the power of a cash buyer… Keep up the good work!"
            - D. A. from Silverdale, WA


            "I absolutely LOVED your used car loan process. Your concept is perfect and I just can't stop telling friends about it. The dealer told me there was no way I could beat his best interest rate from one of 10 companies. You helped me prove him wrong. Not only was he impressed that I beat him by a whole percentage point but also that it was unsecured debt and the money was available the next day. Plus, it was fun writing a personal check that large and to have them visually verify that I had the money in my account!  He said he'd keep you in mind for when his son starts driving and he needs to buy a car for him. You guys are simply amazing. Thank you so much for thinking outside the box to make lending easy for those who use it wisely!"

            "Thank you for this utterly painless, streamlined transaction! What a breath of fresh air. In addition to the competitive rate, your customer sales associate Krista was smart, friendly, and efficient. This was the most efficiently processed loan we have ever obtained, hands down.  We will tell everyone we know about LightStream."

            "I have to respond to this confirmation just to say I cannot remember when I have been so impressed with the efficiency, simplicity, and design of anything! The period of 30 days is perfect. This is a very good deal for the boat I want, but is not confirmed as of yet. Wanted to secure the funds ahead of time.  I will definitely return to your site for future needs, and recommend you to anyone who might need your services."
            - D. M. from Newport, NC


            "… I applied for an auto loan, received approval a day later, and funds were added to my account the day after approval.
 
I spent maybe a total of 12 minutes between submitting the application and speaking to your customer service rep on some clarification questions.  I can't even drive to a bank in 12 minutes.
 
And you got me an unsecured loan at 1.99%... no back-and-forth emails, no lien-holder paperwork, no antiquated snail mail of forms, no dealing with time-draining dealership finance people and processes: No BS.  You guys figured out EXACTLY how a good loan process should go and made it happen: modern (i.e. electronic), simple, efficient and effective.
 
Just a great customer service experience, wow.  Well played LightStream."
            - J. K. from Idledale, CO


            "Thank you so very much [for the birthday email]! This is so very nice of your company to do this kind of thing for their customers. I have been more than happy with the service and the kindness we have received from you since we financed the truck through you. It was so easy, fast and painless. We would definitely go through you again. And you have proven that there really are human-run companies out there still. LOL! Thanks again! Have a great day!"

            "In this fast-paced and sometimes impersonal world, I was extremely impressed by today's auto-loan application process and your agent's timely and professional response.  Unfortunately, the process happened so quickly, I did not write down the name of the female representative who telephoned.  For the record, and anyone in management viewing this email, please accept my sincere appreciation and please extend kudos for her professional, personal service, and first-class representation of your company.  I will definitely share this experience with others!"

            "Thank you.  I can't believe your company and how easy it is to do business with you.  It was a pleasure to borrow money with no hassles and low interest.  Amazing.  Why don't other companies (banks) behave in this civilized way?"
            - S. C. & R. C. from Denver, CO


            "I was just approved and received my LightStream loan, rapidly and successfully. No single word can describe how positive my experience with LightStream has been thus far. The purpose was to finance a classic automobile...  Upon my initial research, yet it seemed it would be a bit of a process as well as crazy high on the interest rate.  With LightStream, I was able to perform most document transactions via electronic form. It was extremely pain-free, easy, fast, and to the point, with only one brief phone interaction. I was able to obtain the full amount I asked for, at a super interest rate. I just wanted to tell you how pleased I am to have found you guys.  I really hope that you will be around for A LONG TIME soon as I am ready to apply for my next loan. Thanks a million!"

            "Your business model is amazing.  Admittedly, my credit is spotless but to get a $17,000 unsecured car loan in 15 minutes is truly almost beyond belief.  At a regular bank I would still be waiting for the proper person to talk after 15 minutes. Very well done! Thanks."
            - A. H. from Wooster, OH


            "I cannot emphasize enough how simple, convenient, and painless accessing a home improvement loan through LightStream was.  I applied for a $35,000 loan to do major interior work to our home; I was initially drawn in by LightStream’s interest rates, which were so much better than those offered by my local bank and credit union, even for those with excellent credit.  I was skeptical, assuming that no one actually qualified for the lowest rates indicated on LightStream’s website.  Holy cow was I wrong!  The entire process, from applying online, to submitting a pay stub for wage verification, to having the funds in my account was less than two days!  And I was offered the lowest rate listed by LightStream for the loan term I requested.  I cannot say enough how wonderfully simple, efficient, and uncomplicated this process was.  Thank you, LightStream!"
            - V. P. from Pierre, SD


            "A quick note to everyone at LightStream, you guys have been amazing… You really stand behind the fast and simple process. I constantly recommend you to everyone. I appreciate the quick response and friendly customer service that both my husband and I get every time we call. In fact, we had originally been declined for this second loan and after talking with one of your customer service reps they helped us get the funding we needed. They didn’t have the attitude 'there is nothing we can do for you' we got 'let’s see how we can make this work.' YOU GUYS ROCK!

            - R. E. from Garden City, KS


            "I have to give LightStream a LOT of credit. My wife and I started our application at around 6:30 on a Friday night.  We were approved by 7 p.m.  I couldn't believe it -- the company asked for additional documents and we were able to provide them right away.  Today is Tuesday (before 8 a.m.) and the loan is funded with the money already deposited into my bank account.  That's less than two business days. I did talk to a rep on the phone Monday; someone had called to clarify something on the credit report so we called back.  The call was very quick and the gentleman I talked to was friendly and helpful.  I didn't even have to wait on hold for someone to pick up.  Other companies get A+ ratings but seriously LightStream is one of the few companies that really deserve it."
            - T. B. from Portage, MI


            "I was recently denied a loan. I am not upset. It was clearly explained to me in a very professional manner. I just wanted to thank LightStream and its employees for such a professional experience.  I hope to be able to do business with LightStream in the future even though this attempt did not end as I had hoped.  Rest assured it did not leave a bitter taste behind.  I thank you for that.  Have a great weekend."

            "I want to say 'Thank you all' as well. It was really nice to be able to do this loan process from my home.

            "We recently completed a debt consolidation loan with you and were so impressed on how quickly and less painful it was to apply and get an approval. I have been in the banking industry for 30 years so I am well educated on the hoops some institutions make you jump through to get a loan. We were so impressed that we decided to upgrade to a new car, so I applied this morning for a used vehicle loan.  Incredibly, five hours later I received an email; you had two simple questions and didn't need further income documentation since you already had it on file.  About 15 minutes after that call, I received the approved loan email; that's just incredible."

            - M. B. from Rahway, NJ


            "Your loan application process has to be by far the most amazingly simply and efficient experience I have come across.  The two times I spoke with a representative were very pleasant and basically your company "cut right to the chase" with asking for what they needed... I provided it...and my loan was approved and processed in record time.  I cannot begin to express my satisfaction with your company and how it works.  I look forward to dealing with you in the future and if there is some area where I could post this positive message to the public, please let me know!   Thank you so much!"

Thanks to LightStream/SunTrust Banks, we were able to purchase our classic car before someone else did.  We have purchased many vehicles over the years and we have never dealt with an easier loan process, uncomplicated, and just lightning fast.  We will be back and will tell everyone we know about your services.  Thank you."

            "Love LightStream!  You made it easy to fund our new purchase of a 2006 Corvette from a private party.  A loan that most companies won't fund.  We love that you offer loans on the unconventional [purposes] from weddings to home repairs to cars that don't fit in the traditional boxes that traditional lending companies won't touch.  Plus, being green and paperless and planting a tree in honor of the loan!  That's awesome.  Great company! Keep up the great work!"

So I Googled and found LightStream.  I applied and was approved within the hour and funds deposited next day.  I was very impressed with your service as well as your extremely helpful employees.

Your associate was friendly, understanding and well-versed in your product details. She gave me information I needed about how to make extra payments (which can conveniently be done online); what to expect with the loan payout; and how to re-amortize the loan if I made extra payments…. I look forward to doing business with your reputable organization again. Our new to us (used car) is exactly what the family needed to feel safe on the roads and it was at a great price thanks to LightStream loan funding..."

            "I attempted to deal with my local bank, where I have had accounts for many years, but they wouldn't lend on a car that’s older than a 2010 model.  I went to another local bank, where I have had several car loans over the years.  They wanted $165 for a “loan origination fee” and would charge 7.5% interest on the loan.  I started the application process with them but every day they seemed to want more information from me.  This went on for several days until I chanced upon your advertisement online.  I was skeptical, as anyone should be with online transactions, but you turned out to be the real deal.  Your application process was simple and the approval was almost immediate.  The funds were available in a couple of days, deposited right into my bank account, and the interest rate was half of what local banks wanted.    Thank you.  Please feel free to use my compliments as a testimonial to your incredible service."

            "….by the way, I was pleasantly surprised by how efficiently my loan was processed.  I have to be honest, I had never heard about LightStream before I did some online searching, so I was pretty skeptical.  However, since receiving my loan so promptly and without any hassle, I told my friends about it, they applied for a loan (much greater than mine) to consolidate some other loans and were approved after some necessary paperwork, they had an excellent experience as well.

I can assure you that so long as nothing changes, the rest of my loans will be processed through LightStream in the future, be it auto, refinance, whatever.

Thanks again!

            "We applied at our local bank for a home equity line of credit for $75,000.  Home taxable value $350,000, free & clear.  Plus an apartment building with no debt but lots of income.  Our credit scores are 775 & 780.  No debt.  Local bank got hung up on the apartment building leases forgetting we were applying for a HOME EQUITY LINE OF CREDIT for $75,000, less than the home's worth.

After 6 weeks, we found a 2008 Class A bunkhouse George Town 350 SE by Forest River with only 17,000 miles, excellent condition with many extras.  List price over $125,000.  We had most of the money but needed another $45,000 to close the deal.  The local bank still undecided.

I went online and found LightStream, a Division of SunTrust.  I began the application process at 4pm, approved 9 am the next day, money deposited into my local bank account the next business day.  Unsecured loan! I could have saved myself 6 weeks of stress providing the local bank with 178 pages of documentation and waiting to see if...I refer others to LightStream!

The website is wonderfully low-key and simple with a very personable manner of communication, and little things like the fact that you acknowledge this is our second loan with you rather than treating us as just another entry in your ledgers make a huge difference in that elusive entity called good will.

            "Let me say Thank You, Thank You, for the most hassle free loan I have ever had. The approval and funding service was incredible. 

The interest rate for a personal loan is 2nd to none.

It was very easy to get set up and set to pay back this loan will save over $5,000.00 when I pay off my existing travel trailer loan set at 9.5% versus the loan you gave me at 2.99%.

Again thank you so. 
"
            - L.L. from Stuart, VA


            "Just wanted to send you this note of thanks.
 
I have acquired several loans over the last 40 years and I can't say enough how pleasing it was to do business with your company.  This was by far the best Auto Loan I have ever gotten.  Everyone I talked to was very professional and courteous.  Thanks again for making this extremely painless.
"
            - T.F. from Salisbury, NC


            "I had read a lot of positive things about SunTrust and the LightStream Loan, but I was still a little skeptical.  24 hours later and I am a believer. Best rates, best customer service and an UNHEARD OF turn-around time. Simply the best of the best. I hardly ever write to THANK a company for their service and product, but you guys were a pleasure to deal with, so thank you."
            - T.A. and B.A. from Endicott, NY


            "I just want to say this has been the absolute best loan experience I have ever had.  Straight forward, easy to understand, and quick.  Everything I could ask for, and I will definitely be coming back for all my future needs."
            - M.N. from Durham, NC


            "I have been meaning to send you a note to tell you how satisfied I am with the loan you provided to me.  It was the easiest loan I ever received and the LightStream team made it painless. I just referred a neighbor to you tonight based on my experience with LightStream.  Thanks again for making it possible for those who work hard, pay their bills on time and retain excellent credit ratings to be able to receive low interest loans."
            - D.M. from Phoenix, AZ


            "LightStream is the BEST!  My personal bank was dragging out our home equity line of credit application.  I went online and found LightStream.  We were approved in less than 24 hours!  Thank you for taking the stress out of buying our RV.  We love it!"
            - E.S. and B.S. from Ann Arbor, MI


            "You guys are good.  You are very easy to work with, very fast, and efficient.  Being in customer service myself, I really appreciate it, and you have my recommendation.  Thank you Again."
            - D.P. from Braselton, GA


            "Really love the service and people at LightStream.  I will be back!!!"
            - F.S. from Houston, TX


            "Best loan company I have ever been with."
            - R.S. from Niles, MI


            "Great experience doing business with you!  You will be my first choice for any future needs."
            - P.G. from Hope Full, AL


            "Regardless of the outcome, I am beyond impressed with the LightStream team’s prompt and thoughtful responses to, not only my application, but to my follow-up emails."
            - K.H. from Charlotte, NC


            "Hello, I am currently financing my vehicle with a Light Stream unsecured loan and can say with certainty this is the most pleasant financial experience I've ever had."
            - J.M. from Laramie, WY


            "I would like to compliment you on the innovative loan product that you offer. I have had an exceptionally good and pleasant experience from applying through the down-to-business phone call to evaluate my personal situation (new to the country) to loan funding. Your everything-paperless approach is exactly what matches my lifestyle. Congratulations!"
            - M.D. from San Francisco, CA


            "I just wanted to tell you all how wonderful and efficient you were.  Thank you!"
            - B.M. from Purcell, OK


            "First, I wanted to say thank you for the painless loan process and approval speed.  This is the easiest loan process my wife and I have ever been a part of.  I wish all loan applications were this easy.  I can't thank you enough.  Your rates were the same as my credit union, but I can do this in the comfort of my own home.  I am highly recommending your bank to all my friends and family.  No more visits to my local bank or credit union for the type of loans you offer.  Super highly recommended."
            - H.R. from Mission, TX


            "I just want you to know that as a prior banker, this is the most friendly and easy process I have ever gone through in my life to borrow money.  If you are ever looking for a testimonial, please contact me.  I know you have to have good credit - but even so - it is an amazing process.  Thank you so much."
            - A.E. from Wilmington, DE


            "I am really impressed with your web service portal.  I find it clear, concise, easy to use, and containing everything available to allow “self-help” if a question arises.  Great job LightStream!"
            - D.W. from La Quinta, CA


            "I would ask that you pass this on to the staff that worked on my loan.  I work in Afghanistan in support of the US Military and my wife is home going to medical school.  So you can see that it would be very hard for us to stop and do a normal loan at our SunTrust Bank.  From the start of the loan process, all the way through to the end, I have received the best customer service that I have seen in a long time.  It is refreshing to be able to talk to people with such a positive attitude.  I felt like I was sitting in the loan office of our bank that we have been customers with since 1999, and when you walk in they say our names.  Again, I just wanted to let your team know they are outstanding!"
            - D.M. and W.M. from Villa Rica, GA


            "I love the program that you have and I hope to use you for many years to come."
            - J.C. from Warren, IN


            "It has been an outstanding experience!  Coming from someone who works in the financial services industry.  I have an excellent perspective of what great service is and what it isn’t."
            - J.S. from Monroeville, PA


            "So far I am amazed by your process and hope this will be the start of a wonderful loan relationship!!!!"
            - S.M. from Wilmette, IL


            "I cannot believe how easy this loan process has been. I was skeptical at first but seeing you were part of SunTrust bank so I applied. I have banked with [other bank] for years and I am seriously thinking about closing my accounts with them and opening  SunTrust accounts because of this experience with you guys."
            - Anonymous


            "Just wanted to thank you for making this transaction so smooth and stress-free.  Your web site is so well designed and easy to use.  I will recommend you to my friends in the future."
            - M.A. from Santa Rosa, CA


            "Your service was extremely easy and the funds were transferred early on the day of funding.  Everything went so well, I think your group will be very successful with this program in the future.  Thanks for planting the tree."
            - F.S. from San Luis Obispo, CA


            "Congratulations on doing an EXCELLENT job on the loan.  It is incredible how little paperwork was required.  You did everything you said you would in a very timely manner.  I would not hesitate to use your company again or recommend you to others."
            - C.K. from Stockton, CA


            "I just wanted to take a second and say, thank you.  The loan process with LightStream was unbelievably smooth.  From the easy/short application, quick decision time, uploading docs and E-docs, to the funding date and picking your own payment date.  There was not a step of the process that I could have hoped to go better.  I have worked in banks and loan funding, and I have never seen a process this streamlined.  I did a lot of research to make sure I was getting a great deal, and I was in no way disappointed.  It's nice to see a bank that obviously has customer service as a top priority rather than just closing loans and collecting interest.  When I called with questions on the loan I was greeted with an actual person as well.  This was a nice surprise.  Anyway, Just wanted to say great work, and it's appreciated."
            - E.C. from Hawthorne, NJ


            "Thank you so much for the wonderfully smooth and quick transaction.  Pleasure doing business with you!"
            - K.G. from Johns Creek, GA


            "You guys are amazing.  It was an absolute pleasure dealing with LightStream.  First, you have the best rates.  And you don’t ask for a ton of paperwork and everything is submitted electronically, so it’s simple.  When I called to ask a question, you answered within seconds… not minutes, but seconds.  I made about five calls and each person was extremely knowledgeable and pleasant.  I never needed to be put on hold.  And when I realized how good your rate was and how affordable the monthly payments would be, I called to ask about increasing the amount of the loan (but worried that I would have to start all over) and you advised that once loans are approved, they can be increased up to another $5K.  So your business model even anticipates what people might want to do. I'm a marketing consultant to global companies, but you guys could give business classes to most companies today."
            - L.N. from Weston, CT


            "Thank you very much for making our loan application a very enjoyable experience.  We have never dealt with any business that has been as professional and efficient as this process has been.  Getting the loan has been so much easier than dealing with the boat dealerships.  Most seem to not care whether they sell a boat or not, and that is not the case with your organization.  You’re NUMBER 1!  You put your customers first.  I’m not too proficient with the computer, but your instructions were easy to follow.  Thanks again!"
            - D.B. from Westminister, SC


            "I have to say, I am blown away at how easy this was to complete.  You weren't kidding when you said it's guaranteed the easiest loan process ever.  I thought dealing with our credit union in the past was easy, but this takes it to a whole different level."
            - J.W. from Bee Cave, TX


            "I just wanted to take a quick moment to say how great my experience with LightStream has been.  After several months I have found the whole process very user friendly.  Everything on LightStream's part has gone just as the expectation that was set.

Just wanted to give a quick note that I have found both the staff and the service provided stellar.
