I was surprised that your rental contract just didn't ask for a DNA sample.  The level of information I was required to provide UHAUL to rent the equipment was unsettling at best.  Why do I need to provide multiple personal references? 

I will be seeking other companies in the future to see if this is a common practice.

Its a sad day when the equipment (product) was far above expectations, but the customer service SUCKED!  The attendant was on the phone the entire time (clipped to his shirt, on the front), didn't speak English very well (and I don't speak Arabic/how did he get a customer service job is beyond me), scribbled instructions, gave me a truck that was half full with gas, swapped it with another (redo paperwork) and when I got frustrated (pissed) he blamed me for getting mad...as if I was inconveniencing him from his phone call!  I will never use this vendor again and if U-Haul condones this at all, they should be ashamed!  Completely BUSH LEAGUE

The man at the counter was great-- would rate him highly, though the store was dirty.  Van drove fine, but was filthy and smelly.  Someone had hauled something like hay in it and it was very dirty, plus they'd spilled sticky things in all the cup holders, on the dash, etc, and none of that had been cleaned.  A little attention to cleaning would have made this rental a much better experience.  As it was, we had to lay blankets on the floor of the van so that our things wouldn't get dirty from the state of the van.  Not very happy.

They did not have record of my early checkin. This location is also a convenience store and there was only one person working and they we continually interrupted to wait on a convenience store customer. This extended our wait time significantly. 

Also, i reserved 2 utility dollies and one furniture dollie. They only had one utility dollie. 

This is the second time in a year we have rented from this location and it will be the last time we rent from this location.

I had a reservation for 7:00 am. When I arrived at 7:00 the shop was closed and no one showed up until 7:30. There was no apology or reason given.  Additionally, after I turned in the equipment, I received a call from U-Haul corporate a week later claiming I had not returned the vehicle.  After calling the Petro station, this was fixed. I am deployed overseas and dealing with this from another country was frustrating.

To start, they failed to meet my reservation.  I had a 7 am pickup. They did not even open until 7:50, and only after I had to call the u-haul help line to have the store open. After he finally got to the store he proceeded to work on store opening task for about 10 minutes. Lastly, the trailer leaked, was dirty and even stained some of my items. 
This is the second bad experience in the same number of rentals. 
Do you process my failed reservation request ($50)?

I stopped in. He asked if I had problems and I informed him of the tire issues. All he said was "go out it behind the building and your done. Sorry". They did no final expection nor did they even come out of the building to ensure proper separation and trailer location. It was very poor customer service after an aalready difficult rental

Once again, when we rented from uhaul, the trailer we reserved was not available as promised.   We reserved a cart, which was not available.   We had to pay MORE money to rent a truck they happened to have available,  but it was too small for what we needed and harder for us to move.   It was a terrible experience from start to finish,  AND they didn't even bill us under the correct name, but they were happy to charge our card.  This is the LAST time we will be using uhaul.

The person was rude and wouldn't even help me unload my vehicle after I told her that I have MS and couldn't climb under the truck!!! Now they are saying I owe more money!!! They'll NEVER get it, just out of principle!!

Truck smelled like Marijuana and was pretty dirty, cigarette packs and skittles all over driver side seat. Associate was nice and made things easy. Didn't have time to complain.

Very friendly and polite. The girl that helped me check out was extra helpful and was genuinely concerned with my needs. It was the best experience I have had with Uhaul.

I will not use y'all again for one way moves. The truck I reserved was not there. The agent stated he would give me a cheaper rate and did not. I then had to go to enterprise and get a pick up to get everything in one trip. This is not very professional business.

The person at the counter for drop of was on his phone and when I tried to inform him about the it if date license plate on the trailer, he shrugged it off.

The store should have at least two people on duty, the lady had to wait on customers while trying to do paperwork for u haul. She was overworked and no doubt underpaid
