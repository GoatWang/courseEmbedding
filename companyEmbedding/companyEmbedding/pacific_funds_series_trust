You should consider a fund’s investment goal, risks, charges and expenses carefully before investing. The prospectus and/or the applicable summary prospectus contain this and other information about the fund and are available from your financial advisor. The prospectus and/or summary prospectus should be read carefully before investing.
As with any mutual fund, the value of the fund's holdings will fluctuate so that shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. There is no guarantee that the funds will achieve their investment goals. Asset allocation and diversification do not guarantee future results, ensure a profit, or protect against loss. Corporate credit securities involve risk of default on interest and principal payments or price changes due to changes in credit quality of the borrower. A fund-of-funds does not guarantee gains and may incur losses and/or experience volatility, particularly during periods of broad market declines. Equity securities tend to go up or down in value, sometimes rapidly and unpredictably in response to many factors including a company's historical and prospective earnings, the value of its assets, general economic conditions, interest rates, investor perceptions, and market liquidity.
Pacific Funds is a product provider. It is not a fiduciary and therefore does not give advice or make recommendations regarding insurance or investment products. Only an advisor who is also a fiduciary is required to advise if the product purchase and any subsequent action taken with regard to the product are in their client's best interest.

Innovation









Today, we are working at P&G to build a better company. Our goal is clear—meeting the needs of consumers better than the best competitors to deliver winning total shareholder return. We are doing this by focusing on a stronger portfolio, setting new standards of excellence, bringing a productivity mindset to everything we do, and empowering our people to keep the consumer at the center of everything we do.
Building a better company demands a streamlined, focused approach to our portfolio, and ensuring our brands continue to delight consumers.
A Strengthened Portfolio

Global leader in 10 categories with 65 brands that leverage P&G’s core strengths
Daily-use categories where purchase intent and choice are driven primarily by a specific job to do and the product's effectiveness
A focused portfolio for faster growth and higher profitability

We are also establishing a higher standard of excellence for all our brands. Success requires bringing these standards to every brand, and we are investing to fuel our growth by making these standards a reality.
New Standards of Excellence

Irresistibly Superior Products
Irresistibly Superior Packaging
Superior Brand Communications
Excellent Retail Execution
Winning Customer and Consumer Value Equation

Investing for growth requires bringing a productivity mindset to everything we do.  This approach has allowed us to deliver on our initial productivity commitment and to raise the bar with plans to save even more.

Productivity

$10 billion saved from fiscal year 2012 through fiscal year 2016.
Up to an additional $10 billion in savings from fiscal year 2017 through fiscal year 2021.
The objective: balanced top-and-bottom line growth that consistently delivers total shareholder return in the top-third of our peer group.

Our efforts are underpinned by an organization that is experienced, agile, accountable and committed to win. To further strengthen our performance, we’re also designing our structures to enable greater speed and agility, and we’re moving resources closer to consumers and customers, driving deeper mastery and accountability.
Empowering Our Organization and Culture

Today, 70% of our commercial function employees reside in local markets—executing innovation, advertising, and merchandising programs by leveraging their unique local knowledge.
In large markets, such as the US and China, we’re moving to end-to-end accountability. This model gives category business leaders full profit and loss responsibilities.
In smaller markets, we’re implementing a “freedom within a framework,”  empowering leaders to make real-time changes in strategy without engaging regional or global resources.
We’re also hiring from the outside—with the number of external hires quadrupling across five different levels of management including senior leadership.

Winning results happen when we earn them—every day, every week, every month, every quarter and every year—in every brand and in every country in which we compete.  And today, we are building a better company that is delivering on just that.

Company Strategy






Building a Better Company
This year, P&G will be 180 years old. A company does not last for that long if its management is not willing to change anything and everything, except for its purpose and core values, to serve consumers and create value for shareowners.













 

Operating Total Shareholder Return



 

Value Creation


 Value Creation is top priority. We are putting strategies and capabilities into place to transform P&G into a faster-growing, more profitable and far simpler company.  What's different, and how are we building a better P&G? 






 


Portfolio Transformation – Leading Brands


 P&G is focusing on 10 product categories with about 65 brands. P&G is a leader in all of these categories, with significant growth potential.









 




 

Innovation


 Innovation has always been - and continues to be - P&G's lifeblood. Each P&G product category provides a portfolio of innovation, including a mix of commercial programs, product improvements and game-changing innovations. 






 

Productivity Improvements

Cost of Goods Sold
Overhead Reductions
Marketing Efficiencies

 

 

Productivity


 Productivity is a core strength for P&G, which creates flexibility to fund our growth efforts, offset cost challenges and/or improve operating margins. We have taken significant steps to accelerate productivity and savings across all elements of costs, which are yielding significant benefits to our operating margin.

 The Dos And Don'ts Of Setting Up A Trust Fund? | How To Protect Your Assets             How To Protect Your Assets Menu       The Dos And Don’ts Of Setting Up A Trust Fund? SETTING UP A TRUST FUND: WHAT YOU SHOULD NEVER CONSIDER DOING Parents tend to make mistakes. It kind of goes with the job when you become one. No parent is going to be perfect. This also goes for setting up a trust fund for their kids. There are many parents who have made quite a few mistakes with this. You are here so you can learn from these mistakes. Learn what not to do when setting up a trust.  WHO IS GOING TO BE IN CHARGE OF THEIR KID’S TRUST FUNDThis is probably the number one mistake parents make when setting up a trust fund for their kids. They fail to select the appropriate trustee for their kids. There are two different types of trustees. There is the Single trustee. There is also the co-trustee. This one offers more of a checks-and-balances protocol in the system. It really doesn’t matter who you pick, just make sure it’s someone you trust 100% and beyond. What is going to happen once you are no longer there? The trustee can say or go along with anything you want, as long as you are still alive. Once you are dead and gone, this person might just take the reins. This can be both good and bad. Please make sure you are selecting someone you really do have faith in.  THINK ABOUT THE PATH OF THE MONEY This is the second mistake many parents make. They set up a trust. However, they fail to set up a direction for the trust. Guys, you have to do this. Figure out how and when the money should be dispersed out. Do you really want to leave this up to a neutral party? This can and will happen. When it does, you might not be happy with the results. This is your money. These are your kids. Set up some goals.A LIST OF BENEFICIARIES Setting up the trust and the trustee are the first steps. Afterwards, you have to set up a small list of beneficiaries. This way the money goes back and forth where it’s intended to be. You have to have protocols in place to make sure all your plans are happening, as well as people to do the job. You cannot leave this up to chance. Too many parents have left it up to chance. The kids ended up suffering because of it. A trust fund is not just about money. It’s about your kids and their future. Please make sound choices here. Part of providing well for your kids is making good choices with the people involved. Go with your gut. If your gut says to not trust someone with this charge, than listen to it.

† The benchmark shown is a "best fit" benchmark assigned by Morningstar. Morningstar does not calculate benchmark performance for funds with a blended, or combined primary benchmark. For more information on the Fund's benchmark, please click on the prospectus link above. 
Powered by Morningstar.
Morningstar data is shown as of the most recent reporting period by each fund family. Allocations may not equal 100% and will vary overtime. Assets contained within "Other" category are not classified by Morningstar. All information presented in this tool is for informational purposes only and is not intended to be investment advice. The information is not meant to be an offer to sell or a recommendation to buy any investment product. Unless otherwise noted, performance is shown before sales charge. For more fund information, click the prospectuses button.
All information is historical and not indicative of future results. Current performance may be lower or higher than the quoted past performance, which cannot guarantee results. Share price, principal value, and return will vary, and you may have a gain or a loss when you sell your shares. Performance assumes reinvestment of distributions and does not account for taxes. After-sales-charge returns reflect the maximum sales charge applicable to the fund, which can be found within the Table Chart. Performance may not reflect any expense limitation or subsidies currently in effect. Short-term trading fees may apply. To obtain the most recent month-end performance, visit Morningstar.com.
This material is for informational and educational purposes only. It is not a recommendation of any specific investment product, strategy, or decision, and is not intended to suggest taking or refraining from any course of action.

‡ As of May 8, 2017, Putnam High Yield Advantage Fund was renamed to Putnam High Yield Fund.


Current performance may be lower or higher than the quoted past performance, which cannot guarantee future results. Share price, principal value, and return will vary, and you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares. To obtain the most recent month-end performance, visit putnam.com. 



Performance assumes reinvestment of distributions and does not account for taxes. Returns before sales charge do not reflect the current maximum sales charges as indicated below. Had the sales charge been reflected, returns would be lower. Returns at public offering price (after sales charge) for class A and class M shares reflect the current maximum initial sales charges of 5.75% and 3.50% for equity funds and Putnam Absolute Return 500 Fund and 700 Fund, and 4.00% and 3.25% for income funds (1.00% and 0.75% for Putnam Floating Rate Income Fund and Putnam Absolute Return 100 Fund and 300 Fund), respectively. Class B share returns reflect the applicable contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC), which is 5% in the first year, declining to 1% in the sixth year, and is eliminated thereafter (except for Putnam Floating Rate Income Fund, which is 3% in the first year, declining to 1% in the fourth year, and is eliminated thereafter). Class C shares reflect a 1% CDSC the first year that is eliminated thereafter. Performance for class B, C, M, R, T, and Y shares prior to their inception is derived from the historical performance of class A shares, adjusted for the applicable sales charge (or CDSC) and, except for class Y shares, the higher operating expenses for such shares (with the exception of Putnam Tax-Free High Yield Fund and Putnam AMT-Free Municipal Fund, which are based on the historical performance of class B shares). Performance for Class R5/R6 shares before their inception are derived from the historical performance of class Y shares, which have not been adjusted for the lower expenses; had they, returns would have been higher. Class A, M, and T shares of Putnam money market funds have no initial sales charge. For a portion of the periods, some funds had expenses limitations or had been sold on a limited basis with limited assets and expenses, without which returns would be lower. 



Lipper rankings are based on total return without sales charge relative to all share classes of funds with similar objectives as determined by Lipper. Past performance is not indicative of future results. Rankings for other periods can be found on the Facts & Rankings tab.



For each fund with at least a three-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Rating based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly performance (including the effects of sales charges, loads, and redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. (Each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages.) The Overall Morningstar Rating for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its 3–, 5–, and 10–year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. Data is historical. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Rankings for other periods can be found on the Facts & Rankings tab.

Compare correlation to uncover hidden portfolio risk
Diversifying by market cap, geography, or investment style may not be enough.
The traditional model for building a diversified portfolio may not be adequate in today's market. Adding small-cap stocks to a large-cap portfolio, combining growth stocks with value stocks, or even supplementing a U.S.-focused fund mix with international or emerging-market equities may not create the level of diversification desired. The reason: high correlations across markets and investment styles over the past several years.
Use FundVisualizer to compare the correlation between two portfolios and fund-to-fund correlation to uncover hidden portfolio risk.
