Parallax Capital Partners, LP













                Parallax Capital Partners, LP, founded in 1998, is a hedge fund utilizing the General 
                Partner's economic background and experience since 1975, working with Investment 
                Securities, Fixed Income, Futures, Options, Stocks and Mortgage Backed Securities 
                products. 
                

                However, the fund may, at the discretion of the General Partner, utilize other 
                investment tools. Although the fund 
                does use some leverage to accomplish its returns, meaning there is substantial risk 
                to the invested principal in the fund, leverage has never exceeded 2 to 1. 
                Notwithstanding the above comments, The Private Placement Memorandum (PPM) is the sole 
                source of information on this fund.
                
Disclaimer
                
                Past performance does not guarantee or predict future results.
