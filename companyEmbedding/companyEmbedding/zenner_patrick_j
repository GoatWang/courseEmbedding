WATERTOWN, Mass., June  19, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Selecta Biosciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:SELB), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on unlocking the full potential of biologic therapies by avoiding unwanted immune responses, today announced the election of Patrick J. Zenner to its Board of Directors at the company’s 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, which was held on June 16, 2017. Mr. Zenner previously served as President and Chief Executive Officer of Hoffmann-La Roche Inc., North America, the prescription drug unit of Roche. “I am delighted that we were able to add an executive of Patrick’s caliber to Selecta’s Board of Directors,” said Werner Cautreels, Ph.D., CEO and Chairman of Selecta. “We believe his experience in leading an expanding organization, navigating regulatory hurdles and commercializing a range of major therapeutics will be key as we seek to advance our clinical programs and enable new treatments using our Synthetic Vaccine Particles (SVP™) technology platform.” Prior to his retirement, Mr. Zenner held various positions during his 32-year career at Roche. He currently serves as chairman of the boards of directors of both ArQule, Inc. and West Pharmaceutical Services, Inc. Previously, Mr. Zenner served as a director of Par Pharmaceuticals and several other public and private company boards. He received his B.S.B.A. from Creighton University and his M.B.A. from Fairleigh Dickinson University. About Selecta Biosciences, Inc.Selecta Biosciences, Inc. is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company that is focused on unlocking the full potential of biologic therapies by avoiding unwanted immune responses. Selecta plans to combine its tolerogenic Synthetic Vaccine Particles (SVP™) to a range of biologics for rare and serious diseases that require new treatment options. The company’s current proprietary pipeline includes SVP-enabled enzyme, oncology and gene therapies. SEL-212, the company’s lead candidate in Phase 2, is being developed to treat severe gout patients and resolve their debilitating symptoms, including flares and gouty arthritis. Selecta’s clinical oncology candidate, LMB-100, is in a Phase 1 program targeting pancreatic cancer and mesothelioma. Its two proprietary gene therapy product candidates are being developed for rare inborn errors of metabolism and have the potential to enable repeat administration. The use of SVP is also being explored in the development of vaccines and treatments for allergies and autoimmune diseases. Selecta is based in Watertown, Massachusetts. For more information, please visit http://selectabio.com and follow @SelectaBio on Twitter.

(“the company”), including without limitation, the company’s ability to unlock the full potential of biologic therapies, the company’s plan to apply its SVP platform to a range of biologics for rare and serious diseases, the potential of SEL-212 to treat severe gout patients and resolve their debilitating symptoms, the potential of the company’s two gene therapy product candidates to enable repeat administration, the potential treatment applications for products utilizing the SVP platform in areas such as gene therapy, immuno-oncology, allergies, autoimmune diseases and vaccines, and other statements containing the words “anticipate,” “believe,” “continue,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “hypothesize,” “intend,” “may,” “plan,” “potential,” “predict,” “project,” “should,” “target,” “would,” and similar expressions, constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Selecta Biosciences Announces Addition of Patrick J. Zenner to Board of Directors

WATERTOWN, Mass., June  19, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Selecta Biosciences, Inc. (SELB) , a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on unlocking the full potential of biologic therapies by avoiding unwanted immune responses, today announced the election of Patrick J. Zenner to its Board of Directors at the company’s 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, which was held on June 16, 2017. Mr. Zenner previously served as President and Chief Executive Officer of Hoffmann-La Roche Inc., North America, the prescription drug unit of Roche.
“I am delighted that we were able to add an executive of Patrick’s caliber to Selecta’s Board of Directors,” said Werner Cautreels, Ph.D., CEO and Chairman of Selecta. “We believe his experience in leading an expanding organization, navigating regulatory hurdles and commercializing a range of major therapeutics will be key as we seek to advance our clinical programs and enable new treatments using our Synthetic Vaccine Particles (SVP™) technology platform.” Prior to his retirement, Mr. Zenner held various positions during his 32-year career at Roche. He currently serves as chairman of the boards of directors of both ArQule, Inc. and West Pharmaceutical Services, Inc. Previously, Mr. Zenner served as a director of Par Pharmaceuticals and several other public and private company boards. He received his B.S.B.A. from Creighton University and his M.B.A. from Fairleigh Dickinson University. About Selecta Biosciences, Inc. (SELB)Selecta Biosciences, Inc. (SELB) is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company that is focused on unlocking the full potential of biologic therapies by avoiding unwanted immune responses. Selecta plans to combine its tolerogenic Synthetic Vaccine Particles (SVP™) to a range of biologics for rare and serious diseases that require new treatment options. The company’s current proprietary pipeline includes SVP-enabled enzyme, oncology and gene therapies. SEL-212, the company’s lead candidate in Phase 2, is being developed to treat severe gout patients and resolve their debilitating symptoms, including flares and gouty arthritis. Selecta’s clinical oncology candidate, LMB-100, is in a Phase 1 program targeting pancreatic cancer and mesothelioma. Its two proprietary gene therapy product candidates are being developed for rare inborn errors of metabolism and have the potential to enable repeat administration. The use of SVP is also being explored in the development of vaccines and treatments for allergies and autoimmune diseases. Selecta is based in Watertown, Massachusetts.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/29/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

As with all your investments through Fidelity, you must make your own determination whether an investment is appropriate for you.  Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.  Foreign securities are subject to interest-rate, currency-exchange-rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.  Illiquidity is an inherent risk associated with investing in real estate and REITs.  There is no guarantee the issuer of a REIT will maintain the secondary market for its shares and redemptions may be at a price which is more or less than the original price paid.  Closed-end funds can trade at a discount to their NAV.  Shareholders of Master Limited Partnerships may be treated as partners for tax purposes.  Partnerships issue a Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) rather than a Form 1099 form for tax purposes. It lists the partner's share of income, deductions, credits, etc.  Speak with your tax advisor to determine how this may affect you.  A royalty trust is a type of corporation, mostly in the United States or Canada, usually involved in oil and gas production or mining.

 WATERTOWN, Mass., June 19, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Selecta Biosciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:SELB), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on unlocking the full potential of biologic therapies by avoiding unwanted immune responses, today announced the election of Patrick J. Zenner to its Board of Directors at the company's 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, which was held on June 16, 2017. Mr. Zenner previously served as President and Chief Executive Officer of Hoffmann-La Roche Inc., North America, the prescription drug unit of Roche. "I am delighted that we were able to add an executive of Patrick's caliber to Selecta's Board of Directors," said Werner Cautreels, Ph.D., CEO and Chairman of Selecta. "We believe his experience in leading an expanding organization, navigating regulatory hurdles and commercializing a range of major therapeutics will be key as we seek to advance our clinical programs and enable new treatments using our Synthetic Vaccine Particles (SVP™) technology platform." Prior to his retirement, Mr. Zenner held various positions during his 32-year career at Roche. He currently serves as chairman of the boards of directors of both ArQule, Inc. and West Pharmaceutical Services, Inc. Previously, Mr. Zenner served as a director of Par Pharmaceuticals and several other public and private company boards. He received his B.S.B.A. from Creighton University and his M.B.A. from Fairleigh Dickinson University.  About Selecta Biosciences, Inc.Selecta Biosciences, Inc. is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company that is focused on unlocking the full potential of biologic therapies by avoiding unwanted immune responses. Selecta plans to combine its tolerogenic Synthetic Vaccine Particles (SVP™) to a range of biologics for rare and serious diseases that require new treatment options. The company's current proprietary pipeline includes SVP-enabled enzyme, oncology and gene therapies. SEL-212, the company's lead candidate in Phase 2, is being developed to treat severe gout patients and resolve their debilitating symptoms, including flares and gouty arthritis.

Its two proprietary gene therapy product candidates are being developed for rare inborn errors of metabolism and have the potential to enable repeat administration. The use of SVP is also being explored in the development of vaccines and treatments for allergies and autoimmune diseases. Selecta is based in Watertown, Massachusetts.
