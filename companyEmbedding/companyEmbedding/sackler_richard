Dr. Raymond Sackler, a pioneer in psychopharmacology, a medicinal products entrepreneur and a leading philanthropist whose family made a fortune from the opioid painkiller OxyContin, died on Monday in Greenwich, Conn. He was 97.His death was confirmed by his wife, Beverly.Dr. Sackler was the last survivor among three brothers — all psychiatrist sons of Brooklyn grocers — whose scientific and marketing skills transformed a tiny Greenwich Village company founded in the 19th century into a global pharmaceutical giant known as Purdue Pharma, now headquartered in Stamford, Conn.Last year, the Sacklers were ranked 19th among “America’s richest families” by Forbes magazine, with assets estimated at $18 billion.They were major benefactors who helped finance the Sackler Wing of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York (home to the Temple of Dendur), the Freer and Sackler Gallery at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, British cultural institutions, schools in Israel and scores of scientific, academic and cultural programs.

Raymond was the middle brother and was regarded as the most retiring. Arthur, the eldest, died in 1987, Mortimer in 2010.“Raymond was a tremendous supporter of basic science and of young people doing research in basic science,” Dr. Phillip A. Sharp, a Nobel Prize-winning professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said in an email. “His main interest was the intersection of mathematical, engineering and physical sciences with biomedical science” — an emerging field known as convergence science.OxyContin, introduced in 1995, was Purdue Pharma’s breakthrough palliative for chronic pain. Under a marketing strategy that Arthur Sackler had pioneered decades earlier, the company aggressively pressed doctors to prescribe the drug, wooing them with free trips to pain-management seminars and paid speaking engagements. Sales soared.By 2001, prescriptions for OxyContin were generating more than $1.5 billion a year — surpassing sales of Viagra — and accounted for some 80 percent of the company’s revenue.OxyContin, made with a synthetic version of morphine, was said to be nonaddictive because in the form of long-acting tablets, it released its active ingredient slowly.But the time-release effect could be defeated by crushing the tablets and snorting the powder, or by smoking it, or by adding water and injecting it — all for an immediate, sometimes heroinlike, high.Federal regulators accused Purdue Pharma of misleading consumers when it asserted that OxyContin was less likely than traditional narcotics to be abused.

In 2007, the company agreed to pay $600 million to resolve the federal charges, although its executives insisted that they had adequately informed doctors and consumers about the potential for drug abuse and had responded quickly to reports of overdose deaths.They also said they had contributed to independent research on pain to guard against rampant overprescribing.

“During the past six years, we have implemented changes to our internal training, compliance and monitoring systems that seek to assure that similar events do not occur again,” the company said at the time of the settlement.Several company officials pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of misbranding and were fined more than $34 million. The Sacklers personally were never formally accused of wrongdoing.Raymond Raphael Sackler was born on Feb. 16, 1920, in Brooklyn to Isaac Sackler and the former Sophie Ziesel, Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe who ran a grocery store.After graduating from Erasmus Hall High School in Brooklyn, he earned a bachelor of science degree from New York University in 1938.At a time when medical schools in New York imposed quotas on the number of Jewish students they would admit, Raymond Sackler pursued his medical degree at Anderson College of Medicine in Glasgow, where he also joined the British Home Guard and served as a plane spotter during World War II. He graduated from Middlesex University Medical School in Waltham, Mass. (It closed later in the 1940s.)In 1944, Dr. Sackler married the former Beverly Feldman, who survives him. Survivors also include their two sons, Richard and Jonathan.The brothers founded the Creedmoor Institute of Psychobiological Studies at the state hospital in Queens Village, N.Y. (Raymond and Mortimer, who were studying skin burns for the Atomic Energy Commission there, were dismissed in 1953 when they refused to sign an Army loyalty oath requiring them to report participants who engaged in conversations deemed subversive.)

Early on, the three brothers “helped pioneer research of the biology of psychiatric illnesses,” BMJ (formerly the British Medical Journal) wrote in 2011, “research that helped open the door decades later toward drug treatments.”It was Arthur Sackler, a trailblazer in medical advertising, who financed the purchase of a small Greenwich Village drug manufacturer, the Purdue Frederick Company, in 1952, according to the book “Pain Killer: A ‘Wonder’ Drug’s Trail of Addiction and Death” (2003), by Barry Meier, a reporter for The New York Times. Raymond and Mortimer became co-chairmen.The company’s products included an ear wax remover, a laxative, a “metabolic cerebral tonic” called Gray’s Glycerine (its formula was 11 percent alcohol) and the antiseptic Betadine, the familiar orange disinfectant smeared on patients’ skin before surgery. (In 1969, the astronaut Neil Armstrong decontaminated the Apollo landing module with Betadine after his moon walk.)The company began experimenting with generic oxycodone, which was invented in Germany during World War I, to create a time-release formula that would spread the analgesic narcotic’s effects over 12 hours and, among other things, allow pain sufferers to sleep through the night.Before developing OxyContin, the company, in 1984, created MS Contin, an extended-release, morphine-based drug to relieve cancer pain.The Sacklers were benefactors of, among other institutions, the Sackler School of Graduate Biomedical Sciences at Tufts University, the Mortimer and Raymond Sackler Institute of Advanced Studies at the University of Tel Aviv, the Raymond and Beverly Sackler Gallery for Assyrian Art at the Metropolitan Museum, Leiden University in the Netherlands, Weill Cornell Medical College in New York, the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, the British Museum, and the Raymond and Beverly Sackler Medical Research Center at the University of Cambridge School of Clinical Medicine.

A
 Kentucky judge’s order to unseal secret OxyContin records is putting the spotlight on a wealthy, publicity-averse doctor whose testimony about the marketing of the addictive pain pill is the most prized document in the court files.
Dr. Richard Sackler, a board member and past president of Purdue Pharma, belongs to the family that controls the privately held company, which many blame for helping spark the nation’s ongoing opioid crisis. He was deposed last year by the Kentucky attorney general’s office as part of a state lawsuit alleging that Purdue illegally marketed the potent opioid painkiller OxyContin.
What Sackler said in that deposition is the subject of extraordinary interest because it is believed to be the first time a member of the Sackler family has been questioned under oath about OxyContin marketing and because of the central role Richard Sackler played at the company over three decades.

He began working for the company as assistant to the president in 1971 and was named president in 1999 before becoming cochairman of the board in 2003. During his time at Purdue, he oversaw the research department that developed products like OxyContin and managed the sales and marketing unit. His name appears on several company patents.
In 2001, as reports of OxyContin abuse spread across the country, Richard Blumenthal, then the Connecticut attorney general and now a US senator, wrote directly to Sackler urging him to “completely overhaul and reform” Purdue’s marketing of OxyContin. The Blumenthal exchange is a topic likely to have been discussed during Sackler’s deposition. Sackler may also have been asked what he and other executives knew about the addictive properties of OxyContin and of any efforts by sales staff to downplay those when pushing doctors to prescribe the powerful opioid.
The deposition is one of several sealed documents that a Kentucky judge on Wednesday ordered to be released to the public at the request of STAT. Purdue said it will appeal the ruling, and the documents are being withheld pending the outcome of an appeal.

Richard Sackler, 71, moves among elite circles of scientists, researchers, and investors and rarely speaks at public events. Even photographs of him are difficult to find. The Sackler family, in general, has avoided public discussion of OxyContin or the drug’s role in helping hook Americans on opioids. The Purdue website makes little mention of Richard Sackler or other family members.
All of the company’s profits — totaling billions of dollars alone from OxyContin — go to Sackler family trusts and entities. Nine members of the family are on the Purdue board. The family name has been highlighted and celebrated in the world of philanthropy, where the extended Sackler family has donated hundreds of millions of dollars. Museums, hospitals, and other institutions across the world carry the Sackler name as a result. These include the Serpentine Sackler Gallery in London; the Sackler Gallery at the Smithsonian Museum, and the Sackler School of Medicine at Tel Aviv University in Israel.

Richard Sackler trained to be a doctor but detoured from that profession to work at the family business. His father, Raymond, was one of three brothers who founded Purdue in 1952. Among the children of the three siblings, Richard Sackler appears to have had the most direct involvement in operating the Stamford, Conn.-based company.
Sackler graduated from New York University School of Medicine in 1971 and is licensed to practice medicine in New York and Connecticut. His Connecticut license lists him as a physician and surgeon, although there is little public information about the extent that he practiced medicine. He did his postgraduate training at Hartford Hospital in the internal medicine unit. At one time, he was a board member of the American Medical Association.

						STAT goes to court to unseal records of OxyContin maker					


He is an advisor and benefactor to several elite universities. At Yale University, where he and his brother endowed the Richard and Jonathan Sackler Professorship in Medicine, Sackler has served on leadership boards. He is listed as a member of the Board of Overseers for the Tufts University School of Medicine in Boston, which houses the Sackler School of Graduate Biomedical Sciences. He is an advisor to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology cancer research center and has a long affiliation with the Rockefeller University genetics lab as an adjunct professor.
He is on the scientific advisory board of Verastem, a company developing cancer treatments, along with several prominent researchers from Harvard, Yale, MIT, and elsewhere.
Recently, he teamed up with New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft and other well-known investors to fund Silk Therapeutics, a Massachusetts-based biotech that has patented a silk protein it uses in a skin-care line and that plans to expand the business to medical applications. Sackler made the investment through his family’s New York-based investment fund, called Summer Road, operated by his son David.

(Toby Talbot/Associated Press)     By Charles Lane  By Charles Lane   Opinion writer March 29  Follow @ChuckLane1      According to the cynical old saw, apocryphally attributed to Joseph Stalin, a single death is a tragedy but a million deaths is a statistic. I’ve been pondering that line lately, apropos the 183,000 deaths related to prescription opioid overdoses between 1999 and 2015 — a figure sure to rise when 2016 data come out. A study published last week by economists Anne Case and Angus Deaton argues opioid overdoses help explain rising death rates for whites without a college education in the 21st century, when death rates for other demographic groups continue to fall. Prescription opioid overdose deaths were rare before the 1990s, suggesting the current wave could have been avoided, and that one or more persons or institutions can and should be held accountable.  Who, exactly? I don’t know, but I know whose opinion on the subject I most want to hear: Dr. Richard S. Sackler’s.   Sackler is the scion of one of the wealthiest families in the world, whose collective assets, shared among 20 people, total $13 billion, according to Forbes magazine. Art museums and medical research institutions around the world bear the Sackler name in recognition of the family’s philanthropy.       (The Washington Post)   Relevant to the opioid crisis, however, the source of the Sacklers’ fortune is their privately held firm, Purdue Pharma, maker of OxyContin, a potentially addictive painkiller that has earned an estimated $35 billion in revenue since it came on the market in 1995 — an event many consider the trigger of the opioid epidemic. Purdue’s aggressive marketing tactics, akin to those pioneered for other drugs by Richard Sackler’s uncle, Arthur Sackler (who died in 1987), spurred OxyContin’s phenomenal sales growth around the turn of the 21st century.  They also got the company prosecuted by the Justice Department. In 2007, Purdue pleaded guilty, as a corporation, to a felony related to false marketing of the pills, and paid $635 million. Three top executives also accepted guilt and paid fines. Neither Richard Sackler (nor any other family member) faced charges; evidence did not tie them to the misconduct, according to the Virginia U.S. attorney in the case, John L. Brownlee.  Sackler was, and apparently still is, a key figure at Purdue, however. He went into the family business in 1971 and over the next 33 years rose to “a series of positions of increasing responsibility, including direct management of both the Research and Development and the Sales and Marketing functions,” according to his published résumé. Sackler became president of Purdue in 1999, then co-chairman of the board in 2003. Today, Purdue’s corporate website announces it’s “learning from the past while focusing on the future.” In 2010, Purdue reformulated OxyContin so it is much more difficult for those seeking a high to convert the pills into inhalable or injectable forms. Perhaps not just coincidentally, OxyContin sales, though substantial, are declining. The company is at work on new products (such as a remedy for constipation caused by prolonged opioid use) and recently provided a $3 million grant to Virginia’s prescription drug-monitoring program. Still, it’s hard to move on without some sort of public accounting, unmediated by lawyers or corporate executives, from the people who made so much money off these drugs.  The Sacklers, though, are publicity-shy, aside from putting their names on buildings and endowed chairs. A Purdue spokesman declined my request for an interview with Richard Sackler or any member of the company’s board, which includes his close relatives.  The closest thing to an accounting Sackler has given may be his 2015 sealed deposition in a lawsuit against Purdue by the opioid-ravaged state of Kentucky. Purdue settled out of court shortly after this sworn testimony, for $24 million, with no admission of wrongdoing. Now Purdue’s lawyers are fighting a state judge’s subsequent order to release Sackler’s deposition, and other internal Purdue records, at the request of Stat, which covers health care news.  A Kentucky appeals court could decide the matter soon. Perhaps Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) will have better luck producing documents. She has announced a wide-ranging investigation into the top five opioid manufacturers and their marketing practices.  To be sure, continuing opioid-related litigation against Purdue and other pharmaceutical companies would discourage individual owners and executives from addressing the crisis candidly outside of court, even if they wanted to. This may be a drawback of how the American system holds businesses, and others, accountable.  Also, no investigation of the crisis would be complete without examining the role of all the gatekeepers — the Food and Drug Administration, the Drug Enforcement Administration, state regulators and prescribing physicians — that were supposed to protect the public.  Which brings us back to the cynical old saw. If everyone is to blame, is no one to blame? Where does the buck stop for 183,000 lives avoidably lost?  I want Richard Sackler’s take on that — because we know where the bucks stopped.   Read more from Charles Lane’s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.

Mortimer D. Sackler, Arts Patron, Dies at 93

Mortimer D. Sackler, a psychiatrist who was a co-owner of the pharmaceutical company Purdue Pharma, makers of the controversial painkiller OxyContin, and whose lavish gifts to the Guggenheim Museum, the Metropolitan Museum of Art and Columbia University made him one of New York City’s most prominent benefactors, died March 24 in Gstaad, Switzerland. He was 93 and had homes in London, Gstaad and Antibes, France.His death was confirmed by his daughter Ilene Sackler Lefcourt.Dr. Sackler, a specialist in psychobiology, did seminal research in the biology of psychiatric illness in the 1940s and ’50s, and  later established research and training institutes in developmental psychobiology at Columbia and Weill Cornell Medical College as well as at four other universities in England, Scotland and Canada.A native New Yorker, he began his medical education in Scotland because, he said, quotas kept him, as a Jew, from being admitted to medical school in New York. He  lived in Europe since the 1970s, and his philanthropy — often along with that of his older brother, Arthur, and his younger brother, Raymond — encompassed both Britain and the Continent.He was a major donor to Oxford University, Edinburgh University, Glasgow University, the Tate Gallery in London, the Royal College of Art, the Louvre, the Jewish Museum in Berlin and Salzburg University, among other institutions.

In New York, the Sackler brothers were probably best known for the Sackler wing of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, which houses the Temple of Dendur and whose construction they helped finance. Through his foundation, Mortimer Sackler financed the Sackler Center for Arts Education at the Guggenheim, and was a major contributor to the American Museum of Natural History.

The Sackler brothers were all doctors, and all businessmen as well. In 1952, while the three were working at the Creedmoor state psychiatric hospital, Arthur financed the purchase of a small drug manufacturer based in Greenwich Village, the Purdue Frederick Company, which Mortimer and Raymond Sackler ran as co-chairmen and which later became Purdue Pharma, now based in Stamford, Conn. (The brothers later established several drug companies in other countries.)

In the early years under the Sacklers, Purdue produced among other things an earwax remover, Cerumenex, a laxative marketed under the name Senokot and later the antiseptic Betadine. At the same time, Arthur Sackler was president of a pharmaceutical advertising firm, and he is widely given credit (some would say blame) for creating many of the drug industry’s more aggressive marketing techniques — for example, holding  conferences for doctors in which attendees learn about the efficacy of the sponsoring company’s drugs.Arthur Sackler died in 1987, and by the mid-1990s Purdue Pharma was still a small drug company. But with a new product, OxyContin, a powerful, long-acting, narcotic painkiller, the company hoped to join the ranks of industry giants. Indeed, by 2001 sales of the drug had reached nearly $3 billion and accounted for 80 percent of Purdue Pharma’s revenue.But OxyContin also became a widely abused street drug responsible for a number of overdose deaths, which drew legal scrutiny of the company, in particular the claims it had made in marketing the drug.

None of the Sacklers were ever accused of any wrongdoing, but in 2007 Purdue Pharma  agreed to pay $600 million in fines and other payments to resolve the charge that the company had misled doctors and patients by claiming that the drug’s long-acting quality made it less likely to be abused than traditional narcotics.  The company’s president, medical director and top lawyer pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of misbranding and paid more than $34 million in fines.Mortimer David Sackler was born in Brooklyn on Dec. 7, 1916. His parents were Jewish immigrants — his father, Isaac, from what is now Ukraine and  his mother, Sophie, from Poland — who ran a grocery. He went to Erasmus Hall High School, where, as advertising manager of the school newspaper, he persuaded Chesterfield cigarettes to place an ad that earned him a five-dollar weekly commission, no small thing during the Depression.He graduated from New York University, attended the Anderson College of Medicine in Scotland and received his medical degree from the Middlesex University School of Medicine, which was in Waltham, Mass., on land now occupied by Brandeis University.His first two marriages ended in divorce. In addition to his daughter Ilene, who lives in Manhattan, he is survived by his brother Raymond, of Greenwich, Conn.; his wife, Theresa, whom he married in 1980; four other daughters, Kathe Sackler, of Weston, Conn., and Samantha Hunt, Marissa Sackler and Sophie Sackler, all of London; two sons, Mortimer D. A. Sackler, of Manhattan, and Michael Sackler, of London; 10 grandchildren; and two  great-grandchildren.Once, at a charity auction, Theresa Sackler, an ardent gardener, bought  the right to name a new breed of rose, which she did, after her husband. The official description of the rose — “The blooms give the impression of delicacy and softness but are, in fact, very tough and little affected by bad weather” — reminded her of him, she said.

Philanthropist, UConn Donor Dr. Raymond Sackler Dies

SHARELINES











Philanthropist Dr. Raymond Sackler died on July 17 after a brief illness. He was 97 years old. He and his wife Beverly have been generous donors to the University of Connecticut for more than 30 years.
Raymond Raphael Sackler was born in Brooklyn, New York, to Eastern European Jewish immigrants. He earned his undergraduate degree at New York University in 1938 and began medical school at Anderson College of Medicine in Scotland, where he volunteered in the United Kingdom’s home guard as a plane spotter in the first year of World War II. Due to the war, he completed his studies at the Middlesex University School of Medicine, on the site of current day Brandeis University in Waltham, Mass., where he received his medical degree in 1944. He was certified in psychiatry by the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology, and later became a Distinguished Life Fellow of the American Psychiatric Association. In 1954, he married Beverly Galeski. They had two sons: Richard Sackler MD, and Jonathan Sackler.
A beloved husband, father, and grandfather, Sackler was noted in his early career for exploring the frontiers of psychopharmacology and the biology of schizophrenia and psychosis. In 1952, he and his brother, Dr. Mortimer Sackler, co-founded Purdue Pharma, a pharmaceutical business that continues to develop healthcare products and antiseptics for pain management, as well as respiratory and gastrointestinal conditions. As Dr. Sackler’s entrepreneurial business interests grew, so did his commitment to philanthropy. His interest in biomedical research and Mrs. Sackler’s passion for fine arts were the beginning of a three decades-long relationship with UConn, one of their many philanthropic beneficiaries. Through his individual gifts, as well as those from The Raymond and Beverly Sackler Foundation and The Raymond and Beverly Sackler Fund for the Arts and Sciences, he made transformative gifts of almost $5 million to advance critical medical research and fine arts.
Members of the ‘1881 Circle’ of the UConn Foundation’s Founders Society, the Sacklers’ relationship with UConn began with their support of the School of Pharmacy in the early 1980s. In the mid-1990s, they established The Raymond and Beverly Sackler Distinguished Lecture Series at the Thomas J. Dodd Research Center, which welcomes important scholars, activists, and officials from around the world to UConn to discuss the compelling human rights issues of our time. The series catalyzed the development of UConn’s internationally known human rights education and research programs, and continues to shine a light on injustice and the struggle to advance human rights.
Soon after, the Sacklers began their broad support for the School of Fine Arts, which includes an Artist-in-Residence program, a Master Arts Institute, a Music Composition Fund, the Metropolitan Opera Collaboration Fund, and the Fine Arts program, all bearing the name of these visionary arts leaders and patrons. Because of the Sacklers’ commitment to the arts, UConn students and faculty have been given opportunities to have in-depth collaborative experiences with internationally renowned performers and visual artists, enriching the fine arts curriculum, expanding creative research, and enlivening the cultural life of the entire University community.
“We are deeply grateful that Dr. Sackler supported life-changing experiences for students and faculty with the Sackler Artist-in-Residence program, expanding our opportunities for creative expression and professional practice in the arts,” says Anne D’Alleva, the dean of UConn’s School of Fine Arts, “and the SFA family extends our deepest condolences to Dr. Sackler’s family and friends.”
A recipient of an honorary doctorate of humane letters from UConn in 1998, Sackler expanded his philanthropic work into the University’s noted medical research arena in 1999, when The Raymond and Beverly Sackler Fund for Genetics and Molecular Medicine was founded. About 10 years later, the Raymond and Beverly Sackler Assistant Professorship began providing critical funding for faculty member Stormy Chamberlain to build a top-flight research team focused on stem cell research and neurodevelopmental disorders that afflict children.
Dr. Bruce Liang, dean of UConn’s School of Medicine, has often expressed his gratitude to Sackler over the years, and notes that his outstanding support will inspire the teams at UConn Health for years to come. “As the Sackler family and their many friends mourn the loss of Dr. Sackler, we will continue to strive for the excellence that he personally exemplified in his life and work,” Liang says.
Most recently, the Sacklers established The Raymond and Beverly Sackler Center for Biomedical, Biological, Physical, and Engineering Sciences. With a vanguard approach to next-level treatments for musculoskeletal injuries – and led by internationally known medical researcher Dr. Cato Laurencin – the Center is breaking ground in the new field of regenerative engineering, which represents a convergence of tissue engineering, advanced materials science, physics, stem cell science, and developmental biology.
“We have lost a great friend and a great man,” says Josh Newton, president and CEO of the UConn Foundation, “and our hope is that his family’s grief is soothed by happy memories of this wonderful father, physician, businessman, and philanthropist.”
Adds University President Susan Herbst, “Dr. Sackler’s legacy runs wide and deep. His life’s work and generosity helped us discover new knowledge in regenerative engineering, genetics, and rare neurodevelopmental disorders. The Sacklers’ support for the arts has helped students and artists hone their crafts and make substantial contributions to our culture. For that and more, we are a grateful University and a grateful state.”

SHARELINES











Philanthropist Dr. Raymond Sackler died on July 17 after a brief illness. He was 97 years old. He and his wife Beverly have been generous donors to the University of Connecticut for more than 30 years.
Raymond Raphael Sackler was born in Brooklyn, New York, to Eastern European Jewish immigrants. He earned his undergraduate degree at New York University in 1938 and began medical school at Anderson College of Medicine in Scotland, where he volunteered in the United Kingdom’s home guard as a plane spotter in the first year of World War II. Due to the war, he completed his studies at the Middlesex University School of Medicine, on the site of current day Brandeis University in Waltham, Mass., where he received his medical degree in 1944. He was certified in psychiatry by the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology, and later became a Distinguished Life Fellow of the American Psychiatric Association. In 1954, he married Beverly Galeski. They had two sons: Richard Sackler MD, and Jonathan Sackler.
A beloved husband, father, and grandfather, Sackler was noted in his early career for exploring the frontiers of psychopharmacology and the biology of schizophrenia and psychosis. In 1952, he and his brother, Dr. Mortimer Sackler, co-founded Purdue Pharma, a pharmaceutical business that continues to develop healthcare products and antiseptics for pain management, as well as respiratory and gastrointestinal conditions. As Dr. Sackler’s entrepreneurial business interests grew, so did his commitment to philanthropy. His interest in biomedical research and Mrs. Sackler’s passion for fine arts were the beginning of a three decades-long relationship with UConn, one of their many philanthropic beneficiaries. Through his individual gifts, as well as those from The Raymond and Beverly Sackler Foundation and The Raymond and Beverly Sackler Fund for the Arts and Sciences, he made transformative gifts of almost $5 million to advance critical medical research and fine arts.
Members of the ‘1881 Circle’ of the UConn Foundation’s Founders Society, the Sacklers’ relationship with UConn began with their support of the School of Pharmacy in the early 1980s. In the mid-1990s, they established The Raymond and Beverly Sackler Distinguished Lecture Series at the Thomas J. Dodd Research Center, which welcomes important scholars, activists, and officials from around the world to UConn to discuss the compelling human rights issues of our time. The series catalyzed the development of UConn’s internationally known human rights education and research programs, and continues to shine a light on injustice and the struggle to advance human rights.
Soon after, the Sacklers began their broad support for the School of Fine Arts, which includes an Artist-in-Residence program, a Master Arts Institute, a Music Composition Fund, the Metropolitan Opera Collaboration Fund, and the Fine Arts program, all bearing the name of these visionary arts leaders and patrons. Because of the Sacklers’ commitment to the arts, UConn students and faculty have been given opportunities to have in-depth collaborative experiences with internationally renowned performers and visual artists, enriching the fine arts curriculum, expanding creative research, and enlivening the cultural life of the entire University community.
“We are deeply grateful that Dr. Sackler supported life-changing experiences for students and faculty with the Sackler Artist-in-Residence program, expanding our opportunities for creative expression and professional practice in the arts,” says Anne D’Alleva, the dean of UConn’s School of Fine Arts, “and the SFA family extends our deepest condolences to Dr. Sackler’s family and friends.”
A recipient of an honorary doctorate of humane letters from UConn in 1998, Sackler expanded his philanthropic work into the University’s noted medical research arena in 1999, when The Raymond and Beverly Sackler Fund for Genetics and Molecular Medicine was founded. About 10 years later, the Raymond and Beverly Sackler Assistant Professorship began providing critical funding for faculty member Stormy Chamberlain to build a top-flight research team focused on stem cell research and neurodevelopmental disorders that afflict children.
Dr. Bruce Liang, dean of UConn’s School of Medicine, has often expressed his gratitude to Sackler over the years, and notes that his outstanding support will inspire the teams at UConn Health for years to come. “As the Sackler family and their many friends mourn the loss of Dr. Sackler, we will continue to strive for the excellence that he personally exemplified in his life and work,” Liang says.
Most recently, the Sacklers established The Raymond and Beverly Sackler Center for Biomedical, Biological, Physical, and Engineering Sciences. With a vanguard approach to next-level treatments for musculoskeletal injuries – and led by internationally known medical researcher Dr. Cato Laurencin – the Center is breaking ground in the new field of regenerative engineering, which represents a convergence of tissue engineering, advanced materials science, physics, stem cell science, and developmental biology.
“We have lost a great friend and a great man,” says Josh Newton, president and CEO of the UConn Foundation, “and our hope is that his family’s grief is soothed by happy memories of this wonderful father, physician, businessman, and philanthropist.”
Adds University President Susan Herbst, “Dr. Sackler’s legacy runs wide and deep. His life’s work and generosity helped us discover new knowledge in regenerative engineering, genetics, and rare neurodevelopmental disorders. The Sacklers’ support for the arts has helped students and artists hone their crafts and make substantial contributions to our culture. For that and more, we are a grateful University and a grateful state.”
