Markets Served By Powell





Oil and Gas Refining - The refining of oil and gas requires large amounts of electrical energy to separate crude oil into its basic parts. This is a primary market and application for Powell solutions. Distributing, controlling and monitoring the power systems for refineries is often a complex integration of equipment; including metal-clad switchgear for the distribution of electrical power, motor control used in the various processes, monitoring and control of the energy system, interconnectivity with other systems, environmental controls, and communications. Powell has equipment located in refineries all around the world including North America, South America, Middle East, Far East, Europe, and Asia.Offshore Oil and Gas Production - A production platform is self-contained, providing for all of its own infrastructure needs. Powell modules range in size from a few hundred to well over one thousand tons and typically contain very complex arc-resistant metal-clad switchgears and a vast array of interconnections to other critical electrical components such as generators and associated controls, battery systems, transformers, drives, and command and control systems. These solutions, designed to withstand the harsh conditions of the open sea, are also complex in mechanical design with fire rated walls and doors and blast proof walls. Powell offshore modules can be found in the Gulf of Mexico, in the Far East, and off the coasts of Africa, Mexico, Central America, and South America.​Petrochemical - Processing of crude oil component raw stock into useable raw materials such as plastics and chemicals also requires large amounts of electrical energy and is therefore a significant market for Powell products and solutions. Powell typically provides one or more integrated equipment enclosures (PCR® or eHouse) containing metal-clad switchgear, metal-enclosed switchgear, motor control, drives, bus duct, and communications all interconnected to perform as a fully functional inter-related system. These enclosures are often located in hazardous areas due to the volatile nature of the materials or in highly corrosive environments where the mechanical and environmental design of the integrated package is as critical as the electrical distribution design. ​Pipelines - The movement of liquid or gas materials from one location to another is most efficiently and safely accomplished using pipelines. This transport may be from the primary source such as the crude oil production point to the refinery where the oil will be divided into useable components, from the refinery to petrochemical facilities where the components are processed into secondary raw materials, or from petrochemical facilities to terminals for transport to other locations or for sale to end users. Pumping stations along the pipeline are required to move the material and these stations require electrical power. Powell secondary substations are used to provide that electrical power.​​Terminals - Storage and receiving facilities are typically located at the end points of pipelines and are used to store the pipeline material as it waits for other transport methods such as tankers or other connective pipelines. Tanker ships can either bring crude oil from remote destinations and offload it for shipment to refining facilities or on load finished product for transport and sale to remote locations. Anytime there is large scale movement of liquid or gas product, dependable electrical energy is required. These facilities typically use Powell-integrated equipment enclosures (PCR® or eHouse) containing metal-clad switchgear, metal-enclosed switchgear, motor control, drives, bus duct, and communications systems.Pulp and Paper - The plants that turn wood and cellulose-based raw material into a useable form and the mills that take that pulp and convert it into paper and paper products are both extremely heavily equipment-based. The material must be pulverized, cleaned, bleached, transported, pressed, dried, and sized. All of this production requires large amount of electrical energy and Powell products and solutions are used throughout. When industries are highly price-competitive and when equipment uptime and utilization factors are important, the dependability of electrical energy is a critical element. Powell integrated solutions of arc-resistant metal-clad switchgear are used whenever capital investment in plant and equipment such as this is made.​Mining and Metals - Modern mines are often located in remote mountainous areas and are required to process large amounts of rock and ore to extract relatively small amounts of useable metal. The process typically processes large volumes of material which must be crushed and processed at the site. This process needs tons of pressure and therefore is powered by large motors run at medium voltage levels. The resulting output is transported to facilities where the material is refined into useable raw material for sale to manufacturers. Powell has equipment in mining operations in the United States, Canada, South America, and the Far East where materials such as gold, silver, copper, iron, and other basic building products are produced.​Traction Power - As city populations become more and more dense, the movement of people becomes a bigger and bigger problem. The implementation of mass transit rail systems has long been the solution in major metropolitan areas. These train systems can be classified several ways: heavy rail, light rail, electric railway, streetcar and people movers. The purpose of Traction Power Substations is to provide power to these rail systems. Substations to provide the needed energy to run the trains are required every 1-2 miles along the track. The typical Traction Power Substation receives AC power from a utility at medium voltage. Specialty transformers step this voltage down and it is rectified to the required specific DC operating voltage.  DC Switchgear is utilized to supply the rectifier output power to the trains. Extensive command and control systems are also needed to manage such operations. Powell is a leading supplier of these substations in North America and around the world.Electric Utilities - The electrical power market is divided into three main segments; generation of the electrical power, transmission from point to point, and distribution of the electrical power to end-users. Powell is a solution-provider to two of these segments. Where electricity is generated, metal-clad switchgear is needed to connect it to the transformers that will step up the voltage to very high levels for transmission to other locations, At the end point of transmission, metal-clad switchgear is again required to distribute that energy to the various local systems and users of the energy. Powell specializes in medium-voltage so our equipment and distribution substations are installed in both the generation and distribution segments. ​

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The three scores are based on the trading styles of Growth, Value, and Momentum.


Growth Score
A


Value Score
A


Momentum Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
