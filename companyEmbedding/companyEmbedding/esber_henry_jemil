Doofl Mgmt   Just  Filled Form D  Announcing $115000  Financing


05/13/2015  by OctaStaff 
			in Private Financing News 












Share with your friendsYour NameYour EmailRecipient EmailEnter a MessageI read this article and found it very interesting, thought it might be interesting for you. The article is called Doofl Mgmt   Just  Filled Form D  Announcing $115000  Financing and is was published by Octafinance.com at http://www.octafinance.com/doofl-mgmt-just-filled-form-d-announcing-115000-financing/49762/.CaptchaSubmit
Doofl Mgmt  Financing
Doofl Mgmt, Inc., Corporation just  had published form D  about $115,000 financing. Doofl Mgmt  was able to  finance itself with $115,000. That is 100.00% of the  financing offer. The total  offering amount was $115,000.  This form was filled on 2015-05-12. The reason for the financing was: unspecified. 
 Doofl Mgmt  is based in Alabama. The  filler’s business is Other Technology. The  form was  signed by Thomas E Decareau CEO. The company was incorporated in 2015. The filler’s address is: 1400 Key Blvd, Ste 100, Arlington, Va, Virginia, 22209.  Thomas Edward Decareau is the related person in the form and it has address: 4002 Ancient Oak Ct, Annandale, Va, Virginia, 22003.
Analysis of Doofl Mgmt  Offering
On average,  businesses in the Other Technology sector, sell 85.80% of the total offering  size. Doofl Mgmt  sold 100.00% of the offering.   Could this mean that the trust in Doofl Mgmt  is high? The average  offering amount for companies in the Other Technology industry is $1.54 million. The offering was 92.53% smaller than the average of $1.54 million.  Of course this should not be  interpreted as negative.  Firms  raise funds for  different  reasons and needs. The minimum investment for this  offering  is set at $3000. If you know more about the reasons for the  financing, please comment below.
What is Form D? What It Is Used For
Form D disclosures could be used to track and understand better your competitors. The information in Form D is usually highly confidential for ventures and startups and they don’t like revealing it. This is because it reveals amount raised or planned to be raised as well as reasons for the financing. This could help competitors. Entrepreneurs usually want to keep their financing a ‘secret’ so they can stay in stealth mode for longer.
Why Fundraising Reporting Is Good For Doofl Mgmt  Also
Despite Thomas E Decareau’s reporting disadvantages, Doofl Mgmt, Inc. could benefit from this reporting. First, it helps potential customers feel more safe to deal with a firm that is well financed. The odds are higher that it will stay in the business. Second, this could attract other investors such as venture-capital firms, funds and angels. Third, positive PR effects could even bring leasing firms and venture lenders.
