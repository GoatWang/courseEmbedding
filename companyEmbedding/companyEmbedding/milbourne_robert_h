Item Description: Createspace Independent Publishing Platform, United States, 2016. Paperback. Book Condition: New. Language: English . Brand New Book ***** Print on Demand *****.Richard H. Mannsfield was once at the forefront of the world of contemporary rhyming verse poetry. His poems delighted adults and children alike. But today, he has been almost completely forgotten. The Million Dollar Tuna was his first published anthology of poetry. The poems are written in a rhyming verse similar to the style of Lewis Carroll, Dr. Seuss, Rudyard Kipling, Roald Dahl, and Robert W. Service. In Mannsfield s early career, he was something of a formalist, always adhering to a strict rhyme and meter. It wasn t until his later works that he began experimenting with relaxed and blank verse. The poems here are mostly narrative and comedic, and ideal for a younger readership. Mannsfield didn t likely write them with children in mind, but children seem to enjoy them. Mannsfield s poetry was much tamer at this early stage in his life, and if you aren t familiar with the writer, this book is an excellent place to start before delving into some of his harsher and less accessible work. He was only nineteen when this book was initially published, and he was too worried about getting in trouble with his parents to write the truly vile and tasteless poems that were in his heart. This re-publication of this book is part of an initiative to bring Mannsfield s largely forgotten work back into the public light. For more information about Richard H. Mannsfield and his work, contact David Grannem at.  Bookseller Inventory # APC9781537584324

Item Description: Poetry Box, United States, 2016. Paperback. Book Condition: New. Language: English . Brand New Book ***** Print on Demand *****. The Poeming Pigeon is a semi-annual journal of poetry, with each book having a unique theme. Our first three issues included poetry on the topic of birds, food and cannabis, and for this issue, we explore poems about music. 675 poets from across the globe answered the call to share their musically inspired poetry. We chose 88 poems--one for each key on a piano. Upon these pages you ll discover poems inspired by genres ranging from classical to country, from jazz to rock-n-roll, and everything in between. Join us on a musical journey of discovery and nostalgia. And let the poetry tug on your heartstrings, like a virtuoso glides the bow across the strings of a violin. Contributing Poets: A.J. Huffman - Ada Jill Schneider - Akua Lezli Hope - Alan Catlin - Amy Miller - Anne Harding Woodworth - Anne Whitehouse - Annette L. Grunseth - Bill Cushing - Bill Frayer - Brad G.

Item Description: Poetry Box, United States, 2016. Paperback. Book Condition: New. Language: English . Brand New Book ***** Print on Demand *****.The Poeming Pigeon is a semi-annual journal of poetry, with each book having a unique theme. Our first three issues included poetry on the topic of birds, food and cannabis, and for this issue, we explore poems about music. 675 poets from across the globe answered the call to share their musically inspired poetry. We chose 88 poems--one for each key on a piano. Upon these pages you ll discover poems inspired by genres ranging from classical to country, from jazz to rock-n-roll, and everything in between. Join us on a musical journey of discovery and nostalgia. And let the poetry tug on your heartstrings, like a virtuoso glides the bow across the strings of a violin. Contributing Poets: A.J.

Item Description: MIT Press Ltd, United States, 2008. Hardback. Book Condition: New. Language: English . Brand New Book. Modern science is increasingly collaborative, as signaled by rising numbers of coauthored papers, papers with international coauthors, and multi-investigator grants. Historically, scientific collaborations were carried out by scientists in the same physical location--the Manhattan Project of the 1940s, for example, involved thousands of scientists gathered on a remote plateau in Los Alamos, New Mexico. Today, information and communication technologies allow cooperation among scientists from far-flung institutions and different disciplines. Scientific Collaboration on the Internet provides both broad and in-depth views of how new technology is enabling novel kinds of science and engineering collaboration. The book offers commentary from notable experts in the field along with case studies of large-scale collaborative projects, past and ongoing.The projects described range from the development of a national virtual observatory for astronomical research to a National Institutes of Health funding program for major multi-laboratory medical research; from the deployment of a cyberinfrastructure to connect experts in earthquake engineering to partnerships between developed and developing countries in AIDS research. The chapter authors speak frankly about the problems these projects encountered as well as the successes they achieved. The book strikes a useful balance between presenting the real stories of collaborations and developing a scientific approach to conceiving, designing, implementing, and evaluating such projects. It points to a future of scientific collaborations that build successfully on aspects from multiple disciplines. Contributors Mark S. Ackerman, Paul Avery, Matthew Bietz, Jeremy P. Birnholtz, Nathan Bos, Geoffrey C. Bowker, Randal Butler, David Conz, Eric Cook, Dan Cooney, Jonathon Cummings, Erik Dahl, Mark Ellisman, Ixchel Faniel, Thomas A. Finholt, Ian Foster, Jeffrey S.
