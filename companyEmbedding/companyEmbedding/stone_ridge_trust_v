   Dear Shareholder: 
At Stone Ridge, we believe that markets work. Centuries of financial history have shown that markets reward investors for the capital they supply and the
risks they bear. Competition quickly drives prices to fair value leaving only risk premium. Consistent with this approach, we purposefully put our portfolios in harms way, taking on intelligent and diversified risks  the most
reliable way we know to build long term wealth.  Stone Ridge specializes in creating exposure to difficult to access and potentially valuable risks,
including the reinsurance risks that drive returns in our Reinsurance Funds. While thankfully most days the planet does not endure catastrophic earthquakes or hurricanes, the reality is that any bond we hold in the portfolio could go to zero
overnight. It is this jump to default risk that we believe provides much of the expected return in our reinsurance portfolios.  Our
funds incorporate an intellectually coherent and scientific approach to portfolio construction. We do not believe we can effectively add value by selecting individual securities. Instead, we carefully and systematically screen for adverse
selection and compose highly diversified portfolios. Any returns the Funds earn are a function of the substantial risks they bear. There are no shortcuts, free lunches, or easy solutions. 
As zealots for detail, every member of the Stone Ridge team is proud of the care, craftsmanship, and quality we put into every product we design. We are
grateful for the trust you have shown by your investment in the Stone Ridge family of Risk Premium Funds.  Ross Stevens 
Founder and CEO  The opinions expressed are those of Stone Ridge
Asset Management through the end of the period of this report, are subject to change, and are not intended to be a forecast of future events, a guarantee of future results, nor investment advice. 
Past performance is not a guarantee of future results.

Shareholder Letter   
   







  
   The Funds are generally available only to
registered investment advisers (RIAs) meeting certain qualifications and that have completed a training program provided by the Adviser. Before allocating shares of the Funds to a clients account, RIAs should carefully consider the
Funds risks and investment objectives, as an investment in the Funds may not be appropriate for all clients and is not designed to be a complete investment program. An investment in the Fund involves a high degree of risk. The event-linked
securities in which the Fund invests are considered high yield or junk bonds. It is possible that investing in the Fund may result in a loss of some or all of the amount invested. Before making an investment/allocation
decision, an RIA should (i) consider the suitability of this investment with respect to a clients investment objectives and individual situation and (ii) consider factors such as a clients net worth, income, age, and risk
tolerance. Allocation to client accounts should be avoided where a client has a short-term investing horizon and/or cannot bear the loss of some or all of their investment.  Mutual fund investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. Event-linked, catastrophe bonds and Reinsurance related securities carry large uncertainties and major risk exposures to adverse conditions. If a
trigger event, as defined within the terms of the bond (such as a major natural disaster), involves losses or other metrics exceeding a specific magnitude in the geographic region and time period specified therein, the Fund may lose a portion or all
of its investment in such security, including accrued interest and/or principal invested in such security. The Funds may invest in Illiquid or Restricted Securities which may be difficult or impossible to sell at a time that the Funds would like or
at the price that the Fund believes the security is currently worth. For additional risks, please refer to the prospectus.  This information is
intended for the shareholders of the Funds and is not for distribution to prospective investors unless preceded or accompanied by a current prospectus. 
Diversification does not assure a profit or protect against loss in a declining market.  The Stone Ridge Funds are distributed by Quasar Distributors, LLC.

Notes to Financial Statements (Unaudited)
 
 
April 30, 2013
   
1. Organization  Stone Ridge Trust (the Trust)
was organized as a Delaware statutory trust on September 28, 2012, and is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the 1940 Act), as amended, as an open-end management investment company issuing shares in series, each
series representing a distinct portfolio with its own investment objectives and policies. As of April 30, 2013, the Trust consisted of two series (the Funds): the Stone Ridge Reinsurance Risk Premium Fund (the Reinsurance
Fund) and the Stone Ridge High Yield Reinsurance Risk Premium Fund (the High Yield Fund). Both Funds began operations on February 1, 2013. The Funds each offer two classes of shares to investors; Class I shares, with no
front-end or back-end sales charges, no 12b-1 fees and no redemption fee; and the Class M Shares with no front-end or back-end sales charges, a 0.15% 12b-1 fee and no redemption fee. There are an unlimited number of authorized shares. The investment
objective of both Funds is to seek a high level of total return consisting of income and capital appreciation.  Two additional series of the Trust, the
Stone Ridge U.S. Variance Risk Premium Fund and the Stone Ridge U.S. Small Cap Variance Risk Premium Fund were incepted on April 30, 2013, and commenced operations on May 1, 2013. An additional series of the Trust, the Stone Ridge U.S.
Master Variance Risk Premium Fund commenced operations on May 22, 2013.  2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
The following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently followed by the Trust in the preparation of its financial statements. The financial
statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP).  (a)
Use of Estimates The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of increases and decreases in net assets from operations during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
(b) Indemnifications In the normal course of business the Funds enter into contracts that contain a variety of representations which provide general
indemnifications. The Funds maximum exposure under these arrangements cannot be known; however, the Funds expect any risk of loss to be remote. 
(c) Federal Income Taxes The Funds intend to qualify as regulated investment companies under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
as amended. If so qualified, the Funds will not be subject to federal income tax to the extent they distribute substantially all of their net investment income and capital gains to shareholders. Therefore, no federal income tax provision is
required.  (d) Event-Linked Bonds Event-linked bonds are variable rate debt securities for which the return of principal and payment of interest
are contingent on the non-occurrence of a specified trigger event(s) that leads to economic and/or human loss, such as an earthquake of a particular magnitude or a hurricane of a specific category. The most common type of event-linked bonds is known
as catastrophe or CAT bonds. In most cases, the trigger event(s) will not be deemed to have occurred unless the event(s) happened in a particular geographic area and was of a certain magnitude (based on independent scientific
readings) or caused a certain amount of actual or modeled loss. If the trigger event(s) occurs prior to a bonds maturity, the Funds may lose all or a portion of its principal and forgo additional interest. In this regard, event-linked bonds
typically have a special condition that states that if the issuer (i.e., an insurance or reinsurance company) suffers a loss from a particular pre-defined catastrophe, then the issuers obligation to pay interest and/or repay the principal is
either deferred or completely forgiven. For example, if a Fund holds a bond which covers an insurers losses due to a hurricane with a trigger at $1 billion and a hurricane hits causing $1 billion or more in losses to such insurer,
then the Fund will lose all or a portion of its principal invested in the bond and forgo any future interest payments. If the trigger event(s) does not occur, the Fund will recover its principal plus interest. Interest typically accrues and is paid
on a quarterly basis. Although principal typically is repaid only on the maturity date, it may be repaid in installments, depending on the terms of the bond. The Funds may invest in event-linked bonds directly or indirectly through certain
derivative instruments. Event-linked swaps are derivative instruments that are typically contingent, or formulaically related to defined trigger events. Trigger events include hurricanes, earthquakes and weather-related phenomena.

(e) Quota Shares Quota shares are a form of proportional reinsurance in which an investor participates in the premiums and losses of a reinsurers
portfolio according to a pre-defined percentage. For example, under a 20% quota-share agreement, a special purpose vehicle (SPV) would obtain 20% of all premiums of the subject portfolio while being responsible for 20% of all claims, and
the Fund, as holder of a Quota Share Note issued by the SPV, would be entitled to its pro rata share of the premiums received by the SPV and would be responsible for its pro rata share of the claims up to the total amount invested. 
(f) Distributions to Shareholders The Funds intend to distribute to their shareholders any net investment income and any net realized long or short-term
capital gains, if any, at least annually. Distributions are recorded on ex-dividend date. The Funds each may periodically make reclassifications among certain of their capital accounts as a result of the characterization of certain income and
realized gains determined annually in accordance with federal tax regulations that may differ from generally accepted accounting principals.  (g)
Foreign Currency Transactions The Funds books and records are maintained in U.S. dollars. Foreign currency denominated transactions (i.e. market value of investment securities, assets and liabilities, purchases and sales of investment
securities, and income and expenses) are translated into U.S. dollars at the current rate of exchange. The Funds do not isolate that portion of results of operations resulting from changes in foreign exchange rates on investments from the
fluctuations arising from changes in market prices of securities held. Such fluctuations are included within the net realized and unrealized gain from investments.  (h) Allocation of Income, Expenses, Gains/Losses Income, expenses (other than those deemed attributable to a specific share class), and gains and losses of each Fund are allocated daily to each share class
based up the ratio of net assets represented by each class as a percentage of the net assets of each Fund. Expenses deemed directly attributable to a class of shares are recorded by the specific class. Most expenses are allocated based on average
net assets, with the exception of 12b-1 fees, which are expensed at 0.15% of average daily net assets of the Class M shares.  (i) Other
Investment transactions are recorded on the trade date. Dividend income, less any foreign tax withheld, is recognized on the ex-dividend date and interest income is recognized on an accrual basis, including amortization/accretion of premiums or
discounts. Discounts and premiums on securities purchased are amortized over the lives of the respective securities using the constant yield method. 
Net investment income, other than class specific expenses, and realized and unrealized gains and losses are allocated daily to each class of shares based upon the
relative net asset value of outstanding shares of each class of shares at the beginning of the day.  (j) Restricted Securities The Funds may
invest a substantial portion of their assets in securities that are restricted, but eligible for purchase and sale by certain qualified buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, as well as other restricted
securities. Restricted securities may be resold in transactions that are exempt from registration under Federal securities laws or if the securities are publically registered. Restricted securities may be deemed illiquid. 
3. Investment Valuation and Fair Value Measurement  In
determining the net asset value (NAV) of the Funds shares, securities which are traded on a domestic national stock exchange are valued at the last sale price each day on the securities exchange on which the securities are
primarily traded. Securities traded principally on the Nasdaq Stock Market are normally valued at the Nasdaq Official Closing Price (NOCP) provided by Nasdaq each business day. Exchange-traded securities for which there were no
transactions are valued at the mean between the closing bid and asked prices. Non-exchange traded equity securities are valued at the mean price in the over-the-counter market. If a non-exchange traded equity does not trade on a particular day, the
mean between the closing bid and asked prices is used.  Investment in mutual funds, including money market funds, are generally priced at the ending net
asset value (NAV) provided by the service agent of the Trust and will be classified as Level 1.  Debt securities with a remaining maturity in
excess of 60 days, including corporate debt securities and municipal debt securities, event-linked bonds, collateralized mortgage obligation, loans, and other asset backed securities are valued

using the mean between the closing bid and asked prices provided by either a pricing service or two independent brokers. Debt securities with a remaining maturity of less than 60 days are valued
at amortized cost, which approximates fair value. Debt securities valued using these techniques and inputs are categorized as Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.  In the event that the Trusts pricing vendor is unable to provide two independent broker quotes for event-linked bonds (catastrophe bonds), the Advisor will engage an independent data delivery vendor to obtain
firm bids from two independent brokers or from a market maker in the security on a weekly basis and on the last business day of each month. Event-linked bonds valued using these techniques and inputs are categorized as Level 2 of the fair value
hierarchy.  Exchange-traded options are generally valued at the mean of the bid and asked quotations on the exchange at closing. Exchange-traded options
may also be valued at its National Best Bid and Offer (NBBO) from participant exchanges. Over the counter options not traded on an exchange are valued at the mean of the bid and asked quotations. Options valued using these techniques and
inputs are categorized as Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.  Participation Notes (Quota Shares) are valued on a weekly basis and on the last day of
each month. These instruments are valued based upon non-publically available market quotations obtained from a third-party broker. Preference Shares (Quota Shares) are fair valued by the Advisers Valuation Committee on a weekly basis and the
last day of each month using models created by the Adviser. Quota Shares will be valued more frequently if there are significant events during the course of a week that could affect the value of the instrument. Quota Shares will generally be
classified as Level 3 investments.  Securities for which market quotations are not readily available are fair valued by the Adviser Valuation
Committee (the Committee), under the oversight of the Board of Trustees Valuation Committee. In determining the method to be used to determine the fair value of a portfolio security, the Committee considers the Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC) guidance as set forth in Accounting Series Release No. 113 (October 21, 1969) and No. 118 (December 23, 1970) and other communications from the SEC. No single standard for determining fair value can be
set forth because fair value depends upon the facts and circumstances of each individual case. Each fair value determination is based upon a consideration of such factors and circumstances as the Committee deems relevant, which may include some or
all of the following: i) fundamental analytical data relating to the security, including financial statements and analysts report; ii) the type of security, size of the holding in the portfolio, original cost, and pricing history; iii) the
nature and duration of any restrictions on the disposition of the security; iv) the forces that influence the market in which the security trades; v) the value of other financial securities (i.e. derivatives, exchange-traded funds, ADRs, and
closed-end funds) that are traded on other markets or among dealers; vi) the liquidity or illiquidity of the market for the particular portfolio security; vii) the value of similar securities of the issuer or comparable companies; viii) values of
baskets of securities traded in other markets; ix) changes in interest rates; x) foreign currency exchange activity; xi) observations from financial institutions; xii) foreign or domestic government pronouncements or actions; xiii) relevant news
events; xiv) whether the same or similar portfolio securities are held by other funds managed by the Adviser and the method used to price the security in those funds; xv) an analysis of the companys financial statements; xvi) the existence of
extraordinary market circumstances; xvii) with respect to debt securities, the maturity, coupon, credit worthiness, currency denomination, and movement of the market in which the security is normally traded. 
For the purpose of determining the fair value, the Committee may use a variety of valuation methodologies, including: i) mathematical techniques that refer to the
prices of similar or related securities; ii) a percentage increase or decrease across all securities of a region, country or industry affected by a significant event; iii) a multiple of earnings; iv) a discount from the market value of a similar
freely-traded security; v) a the yield to maturity of debt securities; vi) broker indications or single broker bids (provided that such indications or bids may not be the sole basis for valuation determination); vii) mathematical models developed by
independent third parties; or viii) any combination of the aforementioned.  Securities valued by the Committee are valued as Level 3 of the fair value
hierarchy.  The Funds have adopted authoritative fair valuation accounting standards which establish an authoritative definition of fair value and set
out a hierarchy for measuring fair value. These standards require additional disclosures about the various inputs and valuation techniques used to develop the measurements of fair value and a discussion of changes in

valuation techniques and related inputs during the period. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1
measurement) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:  Level
1: Inputs that reflect unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Fund has the ability to access at the measurement date;  Level 2: Significant inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly, including inputs in markets that are not considered to be active; 
Level 3: Significant inputs that are unobservable.  Inputs are used
in applying the various valuation techniques and broadly refer to the assumptions that market participants use to make valuation decisions, including assumptions about risk. A financial instruments level within the fair value hierarchy is
based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement. However, the determination of what constitutes observable requires significant judgment by the Trust. The Trust considers observable data to be
that market data which is readily available, regularly distributed or updated, reliable and verifiable, not proprietary, and provided by independent sources that are actively involved in the relevant market. The categorization of a financial
instrument within the hierarchy is based upon the pricing transparency of the instrument and does not necessarily correspond to the Trusts perceived risk of that instrument.  There were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 during the reporting period. Transfers between levels are recognized at the end of the reporting period. The following tables summarize the inputs used to value
the Funds investments as of April 30, 2013.

 The unobservable inputs used in determining the fair value of non-broker quoted quota shares (preference shares) include original
transaction price, losses from severe weather events, and changes in market risk spread of comparable securities (including catastrophe bonds with similar risk profiles). Significant increases in the market risk spread of comparable instruments or
severe weather losses in isolation would result in a significantly lower fair value measurement. A high amount of loss from severe weather may also increase market risk spreads.  The Funds did not hold any derivative instruments during the period ended April 30, 2013.  4. Agreements
 (a) Investment Advisory Agreement Stone Ridge Asset Management LLC (Stone Ridge or the Adviser) is the investment
adviser of the Funds. The Adviser was organized as a Delaware limited liability company in 2012. Its primary place of business is at 405 Lexington Avenue, 55th Floor, New York, NY 10174. The Advisers primary business is to provide a variety of
investment management services, including an investment program for the Funds. The Adviser is responsible for all business activities and oversight of the investment decisions made for the Funds. 
In return for providing management services to the Funds, each of the Reinsurance Funds pay the Adviser an annual fee of 1.50% of that Funds average daily
net assets.  Through February 1, 2014, the Adviser has agreed to waive its management fee and/or pay or otherwise bear operating and other expenses
of the Funds or a Class thereof (excluding taxes, brokerage and transactional expenses, borrowing and other investment-related costs and fees including interest and commitment fees, short dividend expense, acquired fund fees, taxes, litigation and
indemnification expenses, judgments and extraordinary expenses not incurred in the ordinary course of the Funds business) solely to the extent necessary to limit the Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses to 2.00% for Class I shares and 2.15%
for Class M shares of each Fund. The Adviser shall be permitted to recover expenses attributable to the Funds or a Class thereof that the Adviser has borne in later periods to the extent that the expenses for a Class of shares fall below the
annual rate in effect at the time of the actual waiver/reimbursement. Under the expense limitation agreement, the Funds are not obligated to reimburse such expenses beyond three years from the end of the fiscal year in which the Adviser waived a fee
or reimbursed an expense. Any such recovery by the Adviser will

not cause a class to exceed the annual limitation rate in effect at the time of the actual waiver/reimbursement. As of April 30, 2013, the Advisor has waived and recouped fees as follows:

 (b) Distributor Quasar Distributors, LLC (the Distributor) serves as the Funds distributor. Its principal
business address is 615 East Michigan Street, Milwaukee, WI, 53202.  (c) Administrator, Custodian and Transfer Agent The custodian to the Trust
is U.S. Bank, N.A., located at 1555 N RiverCenter Drive, Suite 302, Milwaukee, WI 53212. The administrator and transfer agent to the Trust is U.S. Bancorp Fund Services, LLC, an affiliate of US. Bank, N.A., located at 615 East Michigan Street,
Milwaukee, WI 53202.  5. Distribution Plan  The
Funds pay fees to the Distributor, on an ongoing basis as compensation for the services the Distributor renders and the expenses it bears in connection with the sale and distribution of Class M shares (distribution fees) and/or in
connection with personal services rendered to Class M shareholders and the maintenance of shareholder accounts (servicing fees). These payments are made pursuant to a Distribution and Servicing Plan (12b-1 Plan) adopted by
each Fund pursuant to Rule 12b-1 under the 1940 Act. The maximum annual rate at which the distribution and/or servicing fees may be paid under the 12b-1 Plan is 0.15% of each Funds average daily net assets attributable to the Class M Shares.
Because 12b-1 fees are paid out of a Funds assets on an ongoing basis, over time these fees will increase the cost of your investment and may cost you more than other types of sales charges. 
6. Organization and Offering Costs  Organization costs
consist of costs incurred to establish the Funds and enable them to legally do business. The Funds expense organization costs as incurred. Offering costs include state registration fees and legal fees regarding the preparation of the initial
registration statement. Offering costs are accounted for as deferred costs until operations begin. Offering costs are then amortized to expense over twelve months on a straight-line basis. These organization and offering expenses were advanced by
the Adviser, subject to potential recovery (see Note 4). The total amount of the organization costs and offering costs incurred by the Reinsurance Fund is estimated at approximately $124,511 and $232,208, respectively. The total amount of the
organization costs and offering costs incurred by the High Yield Reinsurance Risk Premium Fund is estimated at approximately $48,267 and $121,217, respectively.  7. Related Parties  Certain officers of the Trust are also employees of the Adviser. The Officers, with the
exception of a portion of the Chief Compliance Officers salary as shown in the Trusts Statement of Operations, are not compensated by the Trust.  8. Investment Transactions  The aggregate purchase and sales of securities (excluding short-term securities by
the Funds for the period ended April 30, 2013 were as follows:

 10. New Accounting Pronouncement  In January, 2013, the FASB issued ASU No. 2013-01 Clarifying the Scope of Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities in GAAP and International Reporting Financial Standards
(IFRS). ASU No. 2013-01 clarifies ASU No. 2011-11, Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities to increase comparability and reduce presentation differences between financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP
and financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS. This requires increased disclosure about derivative instruments that are offset in a reporting entitys Statement of Assets and Liabilities and derivative instruments that are subject
to a master netting agreement (MNA). Specifically, the ASU requires reporting entities to present separately for assets and liabilities, a) the gross amounts of those recognized assets and recognized liabilities, b) the amounts offset to
determine the net amounts presented in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities, c) The net amount presented in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities, d) the amounts subject to an enforceable MNA not included in (b), and e) the net amount after
deducting the amounts from (d) and (c). The effective date of the ASU is for interim and annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013. The Trust is currently evaluating the impact of the ASU on its financial statements. 
11. Foreign Investment Risk  The Funds may invest in
event-linked securities issued by foreign sovereigns and foreign entities that are corporations, partnerships, trusts or other types of business entities. Because the majority of event-linked security issuers are domiciled outside the United States,
the Funds will normally invest significant amounts of its assets in non-U.S. entities. Certain SPVs in which the Funds invest may be sponsored by non-U.S. ceding insurers that are not subject to the same regulation as that to which U.S. ceding
insurers are subject. Such SPVs may pose a greater risk of loss, for example due to less stringent underwriting and/or risk-retention requirements. The Funds investments will consist primarily of event-linked bonds which provide the Funds with
contractual rights under the terms of the bond issuance. While the contractual rights of event-linked bonds issued are similar whether they are issued by a U.S. issuer or a non-U.S. issuer, there may be certain additional risks associated with
non-U.S. issuers. For example, foreign issuers could be affected by

factors not present in the U.S., including expropriation, confiscatory taxation, lack of uniform accounting and auditing standards, less publicly available financial and other information,
potential difficulties in enforcing contractual obligations, and increased costs to enforce applicable contractual obligations outside the U.S. Settlements of securities transactions in foreign countries are subject to risk of loss, may be delayed
and are generally less frequent than in the U.S., which could affect the liquidity of the Funds assets.  12. Other Expenses 
Other Expenses includes compensation of the Chief Compliance Officer from the Reinsurance Fund and the High Yield Fund in the amounts of $8,976 and $3,608,
respectively.  13. Subsequent Events Evaluation 
Effective May 22, 2013, the Trust consists of five series. The Stone Ridge U.S. Variance Risk Premium Fund and the Stone Ridge U.S. Small Cap Variance Risk
Premium Fund commenced operations on May 1, 2013. The Stone Ridge U.S. Master Variance Risk Premium Fund commenced operations on May 22, 2013.

Expense Example (Unaudited)   As a shareholder of the Stone Ridge Funds ( each a Fund, together the Funds), you incur two types of ongoing
costs, including investment advisory fees, distribution and/or shareholder servicing fees, and other Fund expenses, which are indirectly paid by shareholders. This example is intended to help you understand your ongoing costs (in dollars) of
investing in a Fund and to compare these costs with the ongoing costs of investing in other mutual funds.  The example is based on an investment of
$1,000 invested at the beginning of the period and held the entire period from February 1, 2013 to April 30, 2013.  Actual Expenses
 The first line of each of the tables below provides information about actual account values and actual expenses. However, the table does not include
shareholder specific fees, such as the $15.00 fee charged for wire redemptions by the Funds transfer agent. The table also does not include portfolio trading commissions and related trading costs. You may use the information in this line, together
with the amount you invested, to estimate the expenses that you paid over the period. Simply divide your account value by $1,000 (for example, an $8,600 account value divided by $1,000 = 8.6), then multiply the result by the number in the first line
under the heading entitled Expenses Paid During Period to estimate the expenses you paid on your account during the period.  Hypothetical
Example For Comparison Purposes  The second line each table below provides information about hypothetical account values and hypothetical expenses
based on the actual expense ratios for each share class of the Funds and an assumed rate of return of 5% per year before expenses, which is not the Funds actual returns. The hypothetical account values and expenses may not be used to
estimate the actual ending account balance or expenses you paid for the period. You may use this information to compare the ongoing costs of investing in the Funds and other funds. To do so, compare this 5% hypothetical example with the 5%
hypothetical examples that appear in the shareholder reports of the other fund. Please note that the expenses shown in the table are meant to highlight your ongoing costs only and do not reflect any transactional costs, such as sales charges
(loads), redemptions fees, or exchange fees. Therefore, the second line of the table is useful in comparing ongoing costs only, and will not help you determine the relevant total cost of owning different funds.

Additional Information (Unaudited)
 
    1. Investment Advisory Agreement Disclosure  At an in-person Organizational meeting of the Board held on
November 30, 2012, the Board of Trustees of the Stone Ridge Trust (the Trust), including the Independent Trustees, considered and approved the investment advisory agreement (the Advisory Agreement) between the Trust, on
behalf of its series Stone Ridge Reinsurance Risk Premium Fund and the Stone Ridge High Yield Reinsurance Risk Premium Fund and the Advisor.  In
preparation for review of the Advisory Agreements, the Board requested the Advisor to provide detailed information which the Board determined to be reasonably necessary to evaluate the Advisory Agreements. The Independent Trustees used this
information, as well as other information that the Advisor and other service providers submitted to the Board, to help them decide whether to approve the Advisory Agreement. The Board also received a detailed memorandum from K&L Gates LLP,
counsel to the Trust and each of its series regarding the responsibilities of the Board members in connection with their consideration of the Advisory Agreement.  As discussed below, the Board considered many factors and information in evaluating whether the Advisory Agreement and the fees provided therein with respect to the Trust, on behalf of each of its series, should be
approved. The discussion below is not intended to be all-inclusive or intended to touch on every fact that the Board took into consideration regarding the approval of the Advisory Agreement. The determination to approve the Advisory Agreement was
made on the basis of each Independent Trustees business judgment after consideration of all the information presented. It is important to recognize that individual Independent Trustees may have given different weight to certain factors and
assigned various degrees of materiality to information received in connection with the approval process.  In connection with their consideration and
approval of each Investment Advisory Agreement, the Trustees analyzed: (1) the nature, extent, and quality of the services to be provided by Stone Ridge; (2) the investment strategies of Stone Ridge; (3) the cost of the services to be
provided and projected profits to be realized by Stone Ridge from its relationship with the relevant Fund; (4) the extent to which economies of scale would be realized as the Fund grows and whether fee levels reflect any such economies of
scale; (5) the proposed expense ratio of the Fund.  In considering the nature, extent, and quality of the services provided by Stone Ridge, the
Board considered the qualifications the Advisors personnel and the Advisors ability to attract investors for the Fund. On the basis of the Boards review of the fees to be charged by the Advisor for investment advisory and related
services, the specialized nature of the Funds investment program, the Advisors financial information, and the estimated costs associated with managing the Funds, the Board concluded that the level of investment management fees is
appropriate in light of the services to be provided, the management fees and estimated overall expense ratios of comparable funds and other clients of the Advisor.  The Board concluded that the approval of each of the investment advisory agreement was in the best interest of the Funds shareholders. The Board considered the presentation from the Advisor on the investment
strategies for the Fund and the proposed cost of services to be provided by the Advisor and concluded they were appropriate. The Board discussed the extent to which economies of scale would be realized as the Trust grows, taking note of the
anticipated asset caps. The Board concluded that the existing fees schedules were acceptable. The Board compared the Funds proposed expense ratio to those of other comparable mutual funds and considered the Advisors willingness to
contractually cap the operating expenses of the Funds. After review, the Board concluded that the proposed expense ratio of the Funds were appropriate. 
Based on the foregoing, and such other matters as were deemed relevant, but with no single factor being determinative to their decision, the Trustees concluded
that the proposed Investment Advisory Agreements and advisory fees were reasonable in relation to the services to be provided by the Advisor to each Fund. As a result, the Trustees concluded that the approval of the Investment Advisory Agreements
was in the best interest of the Funds.  2. Availability of Quarterly Portfolio Holdings Schedules 
The Funds are required to file their complete schedule of portfolio holdings with the SEC for the first and third quarters of each fiscal year on Form N-Q. Once
filed, the Funds Form N-Q is available without charge, upon request on the SECs website (http://www.sec.gov) and may be available by calling 1.855.609.3680. You may also obtain copies at the SECs

The following Insuring Clause is added:
 
 

 

 
 
FRAUDULENT TRANSFER INSTRUCTIONS
 
 

 

 
 
Loss resulting directly from the ASSURED having, in good faith, transferred money on deposit in

 
 
a Customer’s account, or a Customer’s Certificated Security or Uncertificated Security, in

 
 
reliance upon a fraudulent instruction transmitted to the ASSURED via telefacsimile, telephone or

 
 
electronic mail; provided, however, that:
 
 

 

 
 
A.
the fraudulent instruction purports, and reasonably appears, to have originated from:

 
 
 
i.
such Customer, or
 
 

 
 
 
ii.
an Employee acting on instructions of such
Customer, or
 

 
 
 
iii.
another financial institution acting on behalf of such Customer with authority to make such

 
 
 
 
instructions; and
 
 

 

 
 
B.
the sender of the fraudulent instruction verified the instruction with the password, PIN, or

 
 
 
other security code of such Customer;
and
 

 

 
 
C.
the sender was not, in fact, such Customer,
was not authorized to act on behalf of such

 
 
 
Customer, and was not an
Employee; and
 

 

 
 
D.
the instruction was received by an Employee
specifically authorized by the ASSURED to

 
 
 
receive and act upon such instructions; and
 

 

 
 
E.
for any transfer exceeding the amount set forth in paragraph (8) of this endorsement, the

ASSURED verified the instructions via a call back to a predetermined telephone number set

 
 
 
forth in the ASSURED’s written agreement with such Customer or other verification

 
 
 
procedure approved in writing by the COMPANY; and
    14-02-21330 (10/2014) Page 1   
 









 
 
F.
 
the ASSURED preserved a contemporaneous record of the call back, if any, and the instruction which

 
 
 
 
verifies use of the authorized password, PIN or other security code of the Customer.

 

(2
)
For the purposes of the coverage afforded by this endorsement, the following terms shall have

 
 
the following meanings:

 

 
 
Certificated Security means a share, participation or other interest in property of, or

represented by an instrument issued in bearer or registered form, and

 

 
 
(2

of a type commonly dealt in on securities exchanges or markets or commonly recognized

 
 
 
 
 
in any area in which it is issued or dealt in as a medium for investment, and

 

 
 
(3

either one of a class or series or by its terms divisible into a class or series of shares,

 
 
 
 
 
participations, interests or obligations.

or

 
 
subscriber of an Investment Company which has

or Uncertificated Security in reliance upon
instructions transmitted to the ASSURED via

 
 
telefacsimile, telephone or electronic mail to transmit the fraudulent instruction.

 

 
 
Uncertificated Security means a share, participation or other interest in property of or
an

 
 
enterprise of the issuer or an obligation of the issuer, which is:

 

 
 
(1
)
 
not represented by an instrument and the transfer of which is registered on books

 
 
 
 
 
maintained for that purpose by or on behalf of the issuer, and

 

 
 
(2
)
 
of a type commonly dealt in on securities exchanges or markets, and

 

 
 
(3
)
 
either one of a class or series or by its terms divisible into a class or series of shares,

 
 
 
 
 
participations, interests or obligations.

 

(3
)
It shall be a condition precedent to coverage under this Insuring Clause that the ASSURED

 
 
assert any available claims, offsets or defenses against such Customer, any financial institution

 
 
or any other party to the transaction.

 

(4
)
Solely with respect to the Fraudulent Transfer Instruction Insuring Clause, the following

 
 
Exclusions are added:

 

 
 
A.
 
Loss resulting directly or indirectly from a fraudulent instruction if the sender, or anyone

 
 
 
 
acting in collusion with the sender, ever had authorized access to such
Customer’s

 
 
 
 
password, PIN or other security code; and

 

 
 
B.
 
Loss resulting directly or indirectly from the fraudulent alteration of an instruction to initiate an

 
 
 
 
automated clearing house (ACH) entry, or group of ACH entries, transmitted as an electronic

 
 
 
 
message, or as an attachment to an electronic message, sent via the internet, unless:

 

 
 
 
 
i.
each ACH entry was individually verified via the call back procedure without regard to the

 
 
 
 
 
amount of the entry; or

 
 
 
 
ii.
the instruction was formatted, encoded or encrypted so that any altercation in the ACH

 
 
 
 
 
entry or group of ACH entries would be apparent to the ASSURED.   14-02-21330 (10/2014) Page 2 
   







(5

 POLICYHOLDER 

 DISCLOSURE NOTICE OF 

 TERRORISM INSURANCE COVERAGE 

 (for policies with no terrorism exclusion or sublimit) 

 Insuring Company: 

 You are hereby notified that, under the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (the Act), this 

 policy makes available to you insurance for losses arising out of certain acts of terrorism. 

 Terrorism is defined as any act certified by the Secretary of the Treasury of the United 

 States, to be an act of terrorism; to be a violent act or an act that is dangerous to human 

 life, property or infrastructure; to have resulted in damage within the United States, 

 or outside the United States in the case of an air carrier or vessel or the premises of a 

 United States Mission; and to have been committed by an individual or individuals as part 

 of an effort to coerce the civilian population of the United States or to influence the policy 

 or affect the conduct of the United States Government by coercion. 

   

 You should know that the insurance provided by your policy for losses caused by acts of 

 terrorism is partially reimbursed by the United States under the formula set forth in the 

 Act. Under this formula, the United States pays 85% of covered terrorism losses that 

 exceed the statutorily established deductible to be paid by the insurance company 

 providing the coverage. Beginning in 2016, the Federal share will be reduced by 1% per 

 year until it reaches 80%, where it will remain. 

   

 However, if aggregate insured losses attributable to terrorist acts certified under the Act 

 exceed $100 billion in a calendar year, the Treasury shall not make any payment for 

 any portion of the amount of such losses that exceeds $100 billion.       10-02-1281 (Ed. 03/2015)  
 




 If aggregate insured losses attributable to terrorist acts certified under the Act exceed 

 $100 billion in a calendar year and we have met our insurer deductible under the Act, 

 we shall not be liable for the payment of any portion of the amount of such losses that 

 exceeds $100 billion, and in such case insured losses up to that amount are subject to 

 pro rata allocation in accordance with procedures established by the Secretary of the 

 Treasury. 

   

 The portion of your policys annual premium that is
attributable to insurance for such acts 

 of terrorism is: $ -0-. 

   

 If you have any questions about this notice, please contact your agent or broker.       10-02-1281 (Ed. 03/2015)


APPROVAL OF INVESTMENT COMPANY JOINT FIDELITY BOND AND INVESTMENT COMPANY FIDELITY BOND
AGREEMENT  (TRUST, TRUST II, TRUST III, TRUST IV and TRUST V) 
RESOLVED, that the Board, including a majority of Independent Trustees, taking into consideration all relevant factors presented to the Board at the
meeting, hereby finds that the joint fidelity bond issued by Federal Insurance Company (Joint Fidelity Bond) is in a reasonable form and amount, consistent with the applicable requirements of Rule 17g-1 under the 1940 Act, and hereby
approves such Joint Fidelity Bond; and be it  FURTHER RESOLVED, that the appropriate officers of the Trusts be, and each of them hereby is,
authorized to execute and deliver the Joint Fidelity Bond in substantially the form discussed at this meeting;  FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Trustees
hereby approve in all respects an agreement, substantially in the form presented at this meeting, among the Funds and any other parties to the Joint Fidelity Bond, providing that, in the event recovery is received under the Joint Fidelity Bond as a
result of a loss sustained by a Fund and one or more other named insureds, that Fund shall receive an equitable and proportionate share of the recovery, but at least equal to the amount which it would have received had it maintained a single insured
bond with the minimum coverage required by paragraph (d)(1) of Rule 17g-1 promulgated under the 1940 Act; and be it  FURTHER RESOLVED, that the
Trustees, including a majority of the Independent Trustees, hereby approve the payment by each Fund of the annual premium for coverage under the Joint Fidelity Bond, in the amount presented at this meeting, after having considered all factors deemed
relevant by the Board, including, but not limited to, the number of other parties named as insured, the nature and business activities of such other parties, the aggregate amount of coverage under the Joint Fidelity Bond, the aggregate annual
premium of the Joint Fidelity Bond, the ratable allocation of the premium among each Fund and the extent to which the share of the premium allocated to each Fund is less than the premium such Fund would have to pay if it maintained a single insured
bond; and be it  FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Secretary or Assistant Secretary is hereby designated as the party responsible for making all filings
with the SEC and giving all notices on behalf of the Funds with respect to such Joint Fidelity Bond required by paragraph (g) of Rule 17g-1 under the 1940 Act.

 Prospectus  
Stone Ridge Trust V  
Stone Ridge Alternative Lending Risk Premium Fund
  Common Shares
 The Fund. Stone Ridge Alternative Lending Risk Premium Fund (the “Fund”) is a newly
organized, non-diversified, closed-end management investment company that continuously offers its shares (“Shares”). 
Investment Objective. The Fund’s investment objective is to achieve total return and current income. There can be no
assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objective.  Investment Strategy. The Fund will pursue its
investment objective primarily by investing in alternative lending-related securities that generate interest or other streams of payments and that the Adviser (as defined herein) believes offer access to the credit risk premium. The “credit
risk premium” is positive if interest payments paid in connection with a pool of such investments, minus the principal losses actually experienced across that pool, exceed the risk free rate, on average and over time. The “risk-free
rate” is the rate of return that can be earned on high-quality, short-term government debt securities. There can be no assurance that the credit risk premium will be positive for the Fund’s investments at any time or on average and over
time. As described in more detail herein, alternative lending-related securities are loans originated through non-traditional lending marketplaces or lenders, commonly referred to as “marketplace lenders” (“alternative lending
platforms”), or securities that provide the Fund with exposure to such loans. The Fund will invest in foreign securities.  As described herein, the Fund has adopted the following investment restrictions as fundamental policies that can only be changed with the approval of the holders of a majority of the Fund’s
outstanding voting securities:   


 
•
 
 The Fund may not invest in loans that are of subprime quality at the time of investment. (See “Investment Objective, Policies and Risks”
for a discussion of the term “subprime”.)   


 
•
 
 The Fund may not purchase loans or other alternative lending-related securities from platforms whose business consists primarily of originating
loans of subprime quality.   


 
•
 
 The Fund may not purchase loans or other alternative lending-related securities originated in emerging markets. 
 


 
•
 
 The Fund may not purchase loans or other alternative lending-related securities from platforms whose financial statements are not audited by a
nationally recognized accounting firm.  Investment Adviser. The Fund’s investment adviser is
Stone Ridge Asset Management LLC (“Stone Ridge” or the “Adviser”). As of March 31, 2016, Stone Ridge managed approximately $6.35 billion of assets.   


 
•
 
 The Fund will not list its Shares on any securities exchange. There is currently no secondary market for its Shares and the Fund does not
expect a secondary market in its Shares to develop.   


 
•
 
 An investment in the Fund is not suitable for investors who need certainty about their ability to access all of the money they invest in the
short term.   


 
•
 
 Even though the Fund will make quarterly repurchase offers for a minimum of 5%, and currently expects to offer to repurchase 5%, of its
outstanding Shares, investors should consider Shares of the Fund to be an illiquid investment.   


 
•
 
 There is no assurance that the Fund will be able to maintain a certain level of distributions. 
 


 
•
 
 Distributions may be funded from offering proceeds, which may constitute a return of capital and reduce the amount of capital available for
investment. See “Distributions and Federal Income Tax Matters” for a discussion of the federal income tax treatment of a return of capital. 


The Fund expects to invest primarily in unrated securities. Although the Fund’s
fundamental policies described above do not permit the Fund to invest in loans of subprime quality, some unrated securities purchased by the Fund may be of credit quality comparable to securities rated below investment grade by a nationally
recognized statistical rating organization. In addition, the Fund may invest in securities that are rated below investment grade. Below-investment grade securities, which are often referred to as “junk,” have predominantly speculative
characteristics with respect to the issuer’s capacity to pay interest and repay principal. They may also be difficult to value and illiquid.  An investment in the Fund’s Shares should be considered speculative and involving a high degree of risk, including the risk of a substantial loss of investment. See “Risk
Considerations,” beginning on page 36, to read about the risks you should consider before buying Fund Shares, including the risk of leverage.  Neither the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) nor any state securities commission has approved or disapproved of these securities or determined this prospectus is truthful or
complete. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense.

 The date of this prospectus is [            ]
 Interval Fund. The Fund has an interval fund structure pursuant to which the Fund, subject to applicable law, will
conduct quarterly repurchase offers and currently expects to offer to repurchase 5% of the Fund’s outstanding Shares at net asset value (“NAV”) per quarter, subject to approval of the Board of Trustees (the “Board,” and each
of the trustees on the Board, a “Trustee”). It is possible that a repurchase offer may be oversubscribed, with the result that shareholders may only be able to have a portion of their Shares repurchased. There is no assurance that you
will be able to tender your Shares when or in the amount that you desire. The Fund will not list its Shares for trading on any national securities exchange. There is not expected to be any secondary trading market in the Shares. The Shares are,
therefore, not marketable. Even though the Fund will make quarterly repurchase offers to repurchase a portion of the Shares to try to provide liquidity to shareholders, you should consider the Shares to be illiquid. 
Investment in the Fund involves substantial risks. The Fund is sold to (i) institutional investors, including registered
investment advisers (“RIAs”), that meet certain qualifications and have completed an educational program provided by the Adviser; (ii) clients of such institutional investors; and (iii) certain other Eligible Investors (as
defined in “How to Buy Shares” below). As a fundamental policy, the Fund will only sell shares to or through fiduciaries (such as RIAs or retirement plans) or institutional investors, or to employees, directors and affiliates of the Fund
or the Adviser. The minimum initial account size is $15 million, subject to certain exceptions. See “Investment Minimums.” Investors should carefully consider the Fund’s risks and investment objective, as an investment in the Fund may
not be appropriate for all investors and is not designed to be a complete investment program. An investment in the Fund involves a high degree of risk. It is possible that investing in the Fund may result in a loss of some or all of the amount
invested. Before making an investment/allocation decision, investors should (i) consider the suitability of this investment with respect to an investor’s or a client’s investment objective and individual situation and
(ii) consider factors such as an investor’s or a client’s net worth, income, age and risk tolerance. Investment should be avoided where an investor/client has a short-term investing horizon and/or cannot bear the loss of some or all
of their investment. Before investing in the Fund, an investor should read the discussion of the risks of investing in the Fund in the “Investment Objective, Policies and Risks” section beginning on page 30 of this prospectus.
 This prospectus sets forth concisely information you should know before investing in the common Shares. You should
read this prospectus carefully before deciding to invest in the Fund and you should retain it for future reference. A Statement of Additional Information dated [            ], as it may be
amended, containing additional information about the Fund, has been filed with the SEC. The Statement of Additional Information, annual and semi-annual reports to shareholders when available and other information about the Fund can be obtained
without charge by calling (855) 609-3680 or by visiting www.stoneridgefunds.com. A table of contents to the Statement of 



Additional Information is located at page 79 of this prospectus. This prospectus incorporates by reference the entire Statement of Additional Information. The Statement of Additional Information
is available: at the SEC’s public reference room in Washington, DC (call (202) 942-8090 for information on the operation of the reference room); from the EDGAR database on the SEC’s internet site (www.sec.gov); upon payment of
copying fees by writing to the SEC’s public reference section, Washington, DC 20549-0102; or by electronic mail at publicinfo@sec.gov. The Fund’s address is 510 Madison Ave, 21st Floor, New York City, NY 10022. 
Shares of the Fund do not represent a deposit or obligation of, and are not guaranteed or endorsed by, any bank or other insured
depository institution and are not federally insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Federal Reserve Board or any other government agency.  An investor should not construe the contents of this prospectus as legal, tax or financial advice. You should consult your own professional advisers as to legal, tax, financial or other matters relevant
to the suitability of an investment in the Fund.

PROSPECTUS SUMMARY 
This is only a summary. This summary may not contain all of the information that you should consider before investing in the
Fund’s common Shares. You should review the more detailed information contained in this prospectus and in the Statement of Additional Information. In particular, you should carefully read the risks of investing in the Fund’s common Shares,
as discussed under “Investment Objective, Policies and Risks — Risk Considerations.”  The Fund 
Stone Ridge Alternative Lending Risk Premium Fund (the “Fund”) is a newly organized, non-diversified, closed-end management
investment company that continuously offers its shares (the “Shares”). The Fund is operated as an “interval fund” (as defined below). An investment in the Fund may not be appropriate for all investors. 
Stone Ridge Asset Management LLC (“Stone Ridge” or the “Adviser”) is the Fund’s investment adviser. 
The Offering  Shares of
the Fund are being offered initially at an offering price of $10 per share. The Shares are expected to be offered on a continuous basis thereafter at net asset value (“NAV”) per share. There is no minimum number of Shares (by all investors
in the aggregate) required to be purchased in the initial offering or any subsequent offering. Proceeds from the offering will be held by the Fund’s custodian.  Upon commencement of investment operations, the Fund will initially cap its total assets at $1 billion (an “Initial Cap”). Once the Initial Cap is met, the Fund will no longer accept
new investors and only the reinvestment of dividends by existing investors will be permitted. Following the initial launch, the Fund may re-open to new investors and may subsequently close again at any time at the discretion of the Adviser,
irrespective of the Initial Cap amount.  In addition, upon commencement of investment operations, the Fund will be made
available for investment on a priority basis to a group of investors (the “Consortium”) who have participated in educational sessions regarding the Fund and the asset class in which it invests. If capacity allows, once orders are fulfilled
for the Consortium, the Fund will then be available for investment by other investors. The Fund may also prioritize and allocate capacity to the Consortium upon any subsequent re-opening of the Fund. The Consortium members do not have any special
rights to offering price, dividends or liquidation. The Consortium is expected to consist of a selected group of RIAs who have discretionary authority to invest on their clients’ behalf and a fiduciary duty to their clients, and with whom the
Adviser has a previous relationship. Members of the Consortium and their clients are not obligated to invest in the Fund. 
The Fund’s Shares are offered through Quasar Distributors, LLC (the “Distributor”), as the exclusive
distributor, on a best efforts basis. The minimum initial investment is $15 million, subject to certain exceptions. The Fund reserves the right to reject a purchase order for any reason. See “Shareholder Guide — How to Buy Shares.”
Shareholders will not have the right to redeem their Shares. However, as described below, in order to provide liquidity to shareholders, the Fund will conduct periodic repurchase offers for a portion of its outstanding Shares. 
The Fund will only sell shares to or through fiduciaries (such as RIAs or retirement plans) or institutional investors, or to employees,
directors and affiliates of the Fund or the Adviser.  Periodic Repurchase Offers 
The Fund is an “interval fund,” a type of fund which, in order to provide liquidity to shareholders, has adopted a fundamental
investment policy to make quarterly offers to repurchase between 5% and 25% of its outstanding 
 
  5 




Shares at NAV. Subject to applicable law and approval of the Board, for each quarterly repurchase offer, the Fund currently expects to offer to repurchase 5% of the Fund’s outstanding Shares
at NAV, which is the minimum amount permitted. The Fund will make quarterly repurchase offers in the months of February, May, August and November. Written notification of each quarterly repurchase offer (the “Repurchase Offer Notice”) will
be sent to shareholders at least 21 calendar days before the repurchase request deadline (i.e., the date by which shareholders can tender their Shares in response to a repurchase offer) (the “Repurchase Request Deadline”). The
Fund’s Shares are not listed on any securities exchange, and the Fund anticipates that no secondary market will develop for its Shares. Accordingly, you may not be able to sell Shares when and/or in the amount that you desire. Thus, the Shares
are appropriate only as a long-term investment. In addition, the Fund’s repurchase offers may subject the Fund and shareholders to special risks. See “Principal Risks of the Fund — Repurchase Offers Risk.” 
Investment Objective and Principal Investment Policies  The Fund’s investment objective is to achieve total return and current income. There can be no assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objective. 
The Adviser believes that investing should involve a long-term view and a systematic focus on sources of expected return, not on security
selection or market timing. In managing the Fund, the Adviser focuses primarily on one source of expected returns: the “credit risk premium” in certain loans and other investments described below. The “credit risk premium” is
positive if interest payments paid in connection with a pool of such investments, minus the principal losses actually experienced across that pool, exceed the risk free rate, on average and over time. The “risk-free rate” is the rate of
return that can be earned on high-quality, short-term government debt securities. There can be no assurance that the credit risk premium will be positive for the Fund’s investments at any time or on average and over time. For example, a
consumer or small business borrower typically pays a premium (interest) to a lender in exchange for use of the lender’s capital (the amount of the borrowing) for a pre-determined amount of time. On average and over time, if payments of interest
and repayments of principal on such borrowings are greater than losses incurred from defaults, the excess positive return represents the credit premium. By investing in these loans and other investments, the Fund is accepting the risk that some
borrowers will not repay their loans, in exchange for the expected returns associated with the receipt of interest payments and repayment of principal by those that do. The Fund seeks to benefit over the long-term from the difference between the
amount of interest and principal received and losses experienced.  The Adviser will not purchase or sell investments for the
Fund’s portfolio based on an analysis of specific borrowers’ abilities to repay their loans or other criteria specific to individual securities. Instead, the Adviser seeks to identify alternative lending platforms that originate pools of
loans and other securities on an ongoing basis that can be purchased by the Fund and serve as part of a portfolio that will provide the Fund with broad exposure to the risk and return characteristics (and potential credit risk premium) of loans from
a variety of geographic regions and representing a variety of different borrower types for a variety of loan purposes, including, but not limited to:   


 
•
 
 individual consumers consolidating existing debt or funding large purchases 
 


 
•
 
 small or medium-sized businesses funding working capital such as property, plant, equipment, expansion, receivables or inventory
  


 
•
 
 students financing education or refinancing existing student loans. 
The Fund has adopted the following investment restrictions as fundamental policies that can only be changed with the approval of the
holders of a majority of the Fund’s outstanding voting securities (the “Fundamental Investment Restrictions”):   


 
•
 
 The Fund may not invest in loans that are of subprime quality at the time of investment. 
 
  6 





 
•
 
 The Fund may not purchase loans or other alternative lending-related securities from platforms whose business consists primarily of originating
loans of subprime quality.   


 
•
 
 The Fund may not purchase loans or other alternative lending-related securities originated in emerging markets. 
 


 
•
 
 The Fund may not purchase loans or other alternative lending-related securities from platforms whose financial statements are not audited by a
nationally recognized accounting firm.  As described in more detail below under “Alternative
Lending,” an “alternative lending platform” is a lending marketplace or lender that is not a traditional lender such as a bank. The Adviser, as part of its portfolio construction process, performs diligence on the platforms from which
the Fund purchases alternative lending-related securities in order to evaluate both the process by which each platform extends loans to borrowers and provides related services and the characteristics of the overall portfolio of loans made available
through that platform. The Fund generally purchases a portfolio of loans from a particular platform that meet certain criteria (such as maturities and durations, borrower and loan types, borrower credit quality and geographic locations of borrower)
and that provide broad exposure to that particular platform’s loan originations. The Fund will invest solely in loans originated by platforms that will provide the Fund with a written commitment to deliver or cause to be delivered individual
loan-level data on an ongoing basis throughout the life of each individual loan that is updated periodically as often as the NAV is calculated to reflect new information regarding the borrower or loan, and the Fund will not invest in loans sold on
platforms for which the Fund cannot evaluate to its satisfaction the completeness and accuracy of the individual loan data relevant to the existence and valuation of the loans purchased that is provided by the platform and used by the Fund in
accounting for loans. Although the Fund conducts diligence on the platforms, the Fund generally does not have the ability to independently verify the information provided by the platforms, other than payment information regarding loans and other
alternative lending-related securities owned by the Fund, which the Fund will observe directly as payments are received. The Fund generally will not have access to personally identifiable information about the individual borrowers (e.g.,
names or similar identifying information) prior to purchasing loans or other alternative lending-related securities, although the Fund’s custodian will have this information for whole loans owned by the Fund (and the Fund and the Adviser have
established procedures with the Fund’s custodian designed to prevent the inadvertent communication of personally identifiable borrower information by the Fund’s custodian to the Fund or the Adviser). The Fund will monitor the
characteristics of the alternative lending-related securities purchased from particular platforms on an ongoing basis. In this way, the Adviser seeks to construct a portfolio that provides broad, representative investment exposure across the
alternative lending asset class.  The Adviser will determine whether loans offered to the Fund are of subprime quality at the
time of investment pursuant to guidelines approved by the Board from time to time. These guidelines currently provide that in order to be eligible for purchase by the Fund, the Adviser must determine that loans have a likelihood of repayment that is
greater than that of “subprime” consumer loans. “Subprime” does not have a specific legal or market definition, but is understood in the credit marketplace to signify that a loan has a material likelihood that it will not be
repaid. The Adviser will make the determination that loans purchased by the Fund are not of subprime quality based on the Adviser’s due diligence of the credit underwriting policies of the originating platform, which look to a number of
borrower-specific factors to determine a borrower’s ability to repay a particular loan, including employments status, income, assets, education, and credit bureau data where available. Although credit bureau data is only one factor considered
in determining the credit quality of a borrower and a loan, when FICO data is available with respect to a borrower, the Adviser’s guidelines do not allow the Adviser to cause the Fund to purchase any consumer loan to an individual whose FICO
score is below 600 at the time of origination.  The Fund pursues its investment objective by investing primarily in
alternative lending-related securities, either directly or through one or more wholly-owned and controlled subsidiaries (each, a “Subsidiary”) formed by the Fund. These securities typically provide the Fund with exposure to loans
originated by alternative lending 
 
  7 




platforms. The Fund will invest primarily in whole loans, but also may invest, to a lesser extent, in other types of alternative lending-related securities, which include: 
 


 
•
 
 shares, certificates, notes or other securities representing the right to receive principal and interest payments due on fractions of whole loans or
pools of whole loans (including “member-dependent payment notes” issued by some public U.S. platforms, which we refer to as “fractional loans” herein) 
 


 
•
 
 securities issued by special purpose entities that hold either of the foregoing types of alternative lending-related securities (“asset-backed
securities”)   


 
•
 
 equity or debt securities (publicly or privately offered), including warrants, of alternative lending platforms or companies that own or operate
alternative lending platforms   


 
•
 
 derivative instruments (which may include options, swaps or other derivatives) that provide exposure to any of the investments the Fund may make
directly.  The Fund may gain exposure directly or indirectly to loans that are unsecured, secured by a
perfected security interest in an enterprise or specific assets of an enterprise or individual borrower, and/or supported by a personal guarantee by individuals related to the borrower. The loans to which the Fund will gain exposure may pay fixed or
variable rates of interest, may have a variety of amortization schedules, may include borrowings that do not require amortization payments (i.e., are interest-only), and may have a term ranging from less than one year to thirty years or
longer. This universe of investments is subject to change under varying market conditions and as alternative lending-related instruments and markets evolve over time.  Under normal circumstances, the Fund will invest at least 80% of its net assets, plus the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes, directly or indirectly in alternative lending-related
securities. As a matter of fundamental policy, the Fund will concentrate its investments in the alternative lending industry.  The Fund may seek to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange or interest rate risks that arise as a result of its investments. The Fund may use forwards, futures, swaps or other listed or over-the-counter
(“OTC”) derivatives or may purchase or sell physical currency, bonds or other securities, including short sales on assets the Fund does not own, which may require the Fund to pay a premium to borrow the assets sold short and to pay the
lender any dividends or interest received on the assets while borrowed. There can be no guarantee the Fund’s hedging activities will effectively offset any adverse impact of foreign exchange or interest rates. 
In implementing the Fund’s investment strategy, the Adviser has broad discretion to invest in alternative lending-related securities
of different types and relating to a variety of borrower types and geographic regions (including regions inside and outside the U.S.), subject to the Fundamental Investment Restrictions, which prohibit the Fund from investing in loans of subprime
quality or loans originated in emerging markets. Initially, the Adviser expects to seek to invest in alternative lending-related securities through platforms that operate in (and that originate loans to borrowers located in) the U.S., Europe,
Australia and New Zealand and may in the future seek to gain exposure to other geographic regions, other than emerging markets. Within each region and borrower type, the Adviser has broad discretion to invest in securities that provide the Fund with
a variety of exposures, including to borrower creditworthiness, lines of business and loan purpose. Subject to any restrictions under applicable law (including diversification requirements under U.S. federal income tax law applicable to regulated
investment companies), the Fund is not restricted in its exposure to any particular borrower creditworthiness, line of business, loan purpose, term or form of security or guarantee or any other loan terms or characteristics, except as provided in
the Fundamental Investment Restrictions. There is no stated limit on the percentage of assets the Fund can invest in a particular investment or the percentage of assets the Fund will allocate to any one loan type, borrower type, loan purpose,
geographic region, borrower creditworthiness, term or form of security or guarantee permitted by the Fundamental Investment Restrictions. The Fund may, at times, focus its investments in instruments meeting one or more of these criteria.

The Fund may make investments in alternative lending-related securities directly or
indirectly through one or more Subsidiaries. Each Subsidiary may invest, for example, in whole loans or in shares, certificates, notes or other securities representing the right to receive principal and interest payments due on fractions of whole
loans or pools of whole loans, or any other security that the Fund may hold directly. References herein to the Fund include references to a Subsidiary in respect of the Fund’s exposure to alternative lending-related securities. 
In addition, the Fund may directly or indirectly invest in and/or sell certain of its alternative lending-related investments to special
purpose entities formed by third parties for the purpose of acquiring alternative lending-related investments and issuing securities, the payments on which are funded by payments received on such entities’ underlying investments. Such
asset-backed securities may be issued in different tranches of debt and equity interests with different rights and preferences. The Fund may hold any tranche of such asset-backed securities. 
There is generally a limited secondary market available for many of the securities in which the Fund will invest and, as a result, the
Fund generally will hold investments to maturity. As described below, the Fund may sell certain of its investments to securitization vehicles, and, to the extent a more active secondary market develops over time, the Fund may selectively purchase or
sell loans in executing its investment strategy.  Leverage 
The Fund may obtain leverage in seeking to achieve its investment objective. The Fund or a Subsidiary of the Fund may obtain financing to
make investments in alternative lending-related securities. The Fund expects that borrowings by the Fund or a Fund’s Subsidiary will be secured by alternative lending-related securities held by the Fund or such Subsidiary. The Fund may also
obtain leverage through derivative instruments that afford the Fund economic leverage or other investments, such as asset-backed securities, that may have embedded leverage. The Fund is not limited in the form or manner in which it may incur
leverage.  The Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”), requires a closed-end fund to
maintain asset coverage of not less than 300% of the value of the outstanding amount of senior securities representing indebtedness (as defined in the 1940 Act). This means that the value of the Fund’s senior securities representing
indebtedness may not exceed one-third of the value of its total assets (including such senior securities), measured at the time the Fund issues the senior securities. Investments or trading practices that involve contractual obligations to pay in
the future are subject to the same requirements unless the Fund designates liquid assets in an amount the Fund believes to be equal to the Fund’s contractual obligations (marked-to-market on a daily basis) or appropriately “covers”
such obligations with offsetting positions.  Leverage can have the effect of magnifying the Fund’s exposure to changes in
the value of its assets and may also result in increased volatility in the Fund’s NAV. This means the Fund will have the potential for greater gains, as well as the potential for greater losses, than if the Fund owned its assets on an
unleveraged basis. The value of an investment in the Fund will be more volatile and other risks tend to be compounded if and to the extent that the Fund is exposed to leverage directly or indirectly. 
Alternative Lending 
Alternative lending, which is sometimes referred to as peer-to-peer lending, online lending or marketplace lending, is a method of
financing in which an alternative lending platform facilitates the borrowing and lending of money while generally not relying on deposits for capital to fund loans. It is considered an alternative to more traditional debt financing done through a
bank. There are several different models of alternative lending but, very generally, a platform typically matches consumers, small or medium-sized businesses or other types of borrowers with investors that are interested in gaining investment
exposure to the loans made to such borrowers. Prospective borrowers are usually required to provide or give access to certain financial information to the 
 
  9 




platform, such as the intended purpose of the loan, income, employment information, credit score, debt-to-income ratio, credit history (including defaults and delinquencies) and home ownership
status, and, in the case of small business loans, business financial statements and personal credit information regarding any guarantor, some of which information is made available to prospective lenders. Often, platforms charge fees to borrowers to
cover these screening and administrative costs. Based on this and other relevant supplemental information, the platform usually assigns its own credit rating to the borrower and sets the interest rate for the requested borrowing. Platforms then post
the borrowing requests online and investors may choose among the loans, based on the interest rates the loans are expected to yield less any servicing or origination fees charged by the platform or others involved in the lending arrangement, the
background data provided on the borrowers and the credit rating assigned by the platform. In some cases, a platform partners with a bank to originate a loan to a borrower, after which the bank sells the loan to the platform; alternatively, some
platforms may originate loans themselves. Some investors, including the Fund, may not review the particular characteristics of the loans in which they invest at the time of investment, but rather negotiate in advance with platforms the general
criteria of the investments, as described above. As a result, the Fund is dependent on the platforms’ ability to collect, verify and provide information to the Fund about each loan and borrower. 
Platforms may set minimum eligibility standards for borrowers to participate in alternative lending arrangements and may limit the
maximum permitted borrowings. Depending on the purpose and nature of the loan, its term may, for example, be as short as six months or shorter, or as long as thirty years or longer. Set forth below is additional information about some of the
Fund’s alternative lending-related investments.  Whole Loans. The Fund will invest primarily in whole loans.
When the Fund invests directly or indirectly in whole loans, it will typically purchase all rights, title and interest in the loans pursuant to a loan purchase agreement directly from the platform or its affiliate. The platform or a third-party
servicer typically continues to service the loans, collecting payments and distributing them to investors, less any servicing fees assessed against the Fund, and the servicing entity typically will make all decisions regarding acceleration or
enforcement of the loans following any default by a borrower. The Fund expects to have a backup servicer in case any platform or affiliate of the platform ceases or fails to perform these servicing functions. The Fund, as an investor in a whole
loan, would be entitled to receive payment only from the borrower and/or any guarantor, and would not be able to recover any deficiency from the platform, except under very narrow circumstances, which may include fraud by the borrower in some cases.
As described above, the whole loans in which the Fund may invest may be secured or unsecured.  Shares, Certificates,
Notes or Other Securities. The Fund may also invest directly or indirectly in shares, certificates, notes or other securities representing the right to receive principal and interest payments due on fractions of whole loans or pools of whole
loans. The platform or a separate special purpose entity organized by or on behalf of the platform may hold the whole loans underlying such securities on its books and issue to the Fund, as an investor, a share, certificate, note or other security,
the payments on which track and depend upon the borrower payments on the underlying loans. As with whole loans, the platforms or third-party servicers typically continue to service the underlying loans on which the performance of such securities is
based. Such securities may be linked to any of the types of whole loans in which the Fund may invest directly. Such securities may also track fractions of a whole loan. These securities may be sold through publicly registered offerings or through
unregistered private offerings.  Equity Securities. The Fund may invest directly or indirectly in public or private
equity securities issued by alternative lending platforms or companies that own or operate alternative lending platforms, including common stock, preferred stock, convertible stock and/or warrants. For example, the Fund may invest in securities
issued by a platform, which may provide the platform with the capital it requires to support its business. Equity investments may afford the Fund voting rights as well as the opportunity to receive dividends and/or capital appreciation, although
warrants, which are options to purchase equity securities at specific prices valid for a specific period of time, typically have no voting rights, receive no dividends and have no rights with respect to

 
  10 




the securities of the issuer unless and until they are exercised for the underlying equity securities. The Fund may also invest directly or indirectly in equity securities of both foreign and
U.S. small and mid-cap companies.  Debt Securities. The Fund may invest directly or indirectly in debt securities
issued by alternative lending platforms or companies that own or operate alternative lending platforms. The Fund may have exposure to the debt securities of U.S. or foreign issuers. These debt securities may have fixed or floating interest rates;
may or may not be collateralized; and may be below investment grade or unrated but judged by the Adviser to be of comparable quality (debt securities that are below investment grade are commonly called “junk bonds”). The Fund has no limits
as to the maturity of debt securities in which it invests directly or indirectly. Such investments may be within any maturity range (short, medium or long) depending on the Adviser’s evaluation of investment opportunities available within the
debt securities market. Similarly, the Fund has no limits as to the market capitalization range of the issuers. 
Asset-Backed Securities. The Fund may invest in securitization vehicles that issue asset-backed securities, which are debt
securities backed by, or residual equity interests in, pools of alternative lending-related debt securities. Such a securitization vehicle may be formed by a platform, a pooled investment vehicle or any other entity. 
Investment Adviser 
Stone Ridge Asset Management LLC is the investment adviser of the Fund. As of March 31, 2016, Stone Ridge managed approximately $6.35
billion of assets. Paul Germain, Robert Gutmann, Tomer Seifan and Ross Stevens (the “Portfolio Managers”) are primarily responsible for the day-to-day management of the Fund. In addition, Stone Ridge performs initial and ongoing due
diligence to evaluate the legal and regulatory frameworks and reputational aspects of the platforms from which the Fund purchases alternative lending-related securities. In that effort, the Portfolio Managers are supported by Benjamin Lawsky, Stone
Ridge’s Head of Regulatory Affairs, and James Rothwell, Stone Ridge’s Head of Legal.  Distributions 
The Fund intends to declare and pay dividends of substantially all net investment income and net realized capital gains at least
annually, although the Fund may declare and pay dividends more frequently (e.g., quarterly). Unless shareholders specify otherwise, dividends will be reinvested in Shares of the Fund. The Fund may pay distributions from sources that may not
be available in the future and that are unrelated to the Fund’s performance, such as from offering proceeds, borrowings and amounts from the Fund’s affiliates that are subject to repayment by investors. 
Unlisted Closed-end Fund Structure; Limited Liquidity  The Fund will not list its Shares for trading on any securities exchange. There is currently no secondary market for its Shares and the Fund does not expect any secondary market to develop for its Shares.
Shareholders of the Fund are not able to have their Shares redeemed or otherwise sell their Shares on a daily basis because the Fund is an unlisted closed-end fund. In order to provide liquidity to shareholders, the Fund is structured as an
“interval fund” and conducts periodic repurchase offers for a portion of its outstanding Shares, as described herein. An investment in the Fund is suitable only for long-term investors who can bear the risks associated with the limited
liquidity of the Shares. Investors should consider their investment goals, time horizons and risk tolerance before investing in the Fund. 
Distributor, Transfer Agent and Custodians  Quasar Distributors, LLC, of Milwaukee, Wisconsin is the Fund’s distributor. U.S. Bancorp Fund Services, LLC, of Milwaukee, Wisconsin is the Fund’s transfer agent, administrator and accounting
agent. U.S. Bank, NA, of 
 
  11 




Milwaukee, Wisconsin and Millennium Trust Company, LLC (“Millennium”) are the Fund’s co-custodians. Millennium also serves as the custodian for assets held by the Funds’
Subsidiaries. The Fund compensates the distributor, transfer agent and custodians for their services.  SPECIAL RISK
CONSIDERATIONS  An investment in the Fund involves special risk considerations. You should consider carefully the
risks summarized below, which are described in more detail under “Investment Objective, Policies and Risks — Risk Considerations” beginning on page 36 of this prospectus. 
Investors should carefully consider the Fund’s risks and investment objective, as an investment in the Fund may not be
appropriate for all investors and is not designed to be a complete investment program. An investment in the Fund involves a high degree of risk. It is possible that investing in the Fund may result in a loss of some or all of the amount invested.
Before making an investment/allocation decision, investors should (i) consider the suitability of this investment with respect to an investor’s or a client’s investment objectives and individual situation and (ii) consider
factors such as an investor’s or a client’s net worth, income, age and risk tolerance. Investment should be avoided where an investor/client has a short-term investing horizon and/or cannot bear the loss of some or all of the investment.
 Default Risk  The value of the Fund’s investments in whole loans and other alternative lending-related securities, such as shares, certificates, notes or other securities representing an interest in and the right
to receive principal and interest payments due on whole loans or fractions of whole loans, is entirely dependent on the borrowers’ continued and timely payments. The Fund receives payments on such investments only if the party servicing the
loans receives the borrower’s payments on the corresponding or underlying loan and passes such payments through to the Fund. If a borrower fails to make interest payments or repay principal when due on a loan in which the Fund has investment
exposure, or if the value of such a loan decreases, the value of the Fund’s investments will be adversely affected. There can be no assurance that payments due on underlying loans will be made. 
If a borrower is unable or fails to make payments on a loan for any reason, the Fund may be greatly limited in its ability to recover any
outstanding principal or interest due, as (among other reasons) the Fund may not have direct recourse against the borrower or may otherwise be limited in its ability to directly enforce its rights under the loan, whether through the borrower or the
platform through which such loan was originated, the loan may be unsecured or under-collateralized and/or it may be impracticable to commence a legal proceeding against the defaulting borrower. If the Fund were unable to recover unpaid principal or
interest due, this would cause the Fund’s net asset value to decrease. As described further under “Risks of Unsecured Loans,” the Fund generally will not be able to offset losses on defaulting loans by looking to collateral or
obligations of guarantors, insurers or governmental authorities, as many of the loans to which the Fund will have exposure are obligations not secured by collateral or (except for certain loans to businesses) backed by any guarantee. 
Borrowings obtained through alternative lending platforms may not limit borrowers from incurring additional debt. If a borrower incurs
additional debt obligations after obtaining a loan through an alternative lending platform, the borrower’s creditworthiness may diminish and any additional obligations could cause the borrower to experience financial distress, insolvency or
bankruptcy, all of which would impair the borrower’s ability to repay the loan underlying the Fund’s investment. Furthermore, the ability of secured creditors to pursue remedies against the collateral of the borrower may impair the
borrower’s ability to repay its unsecured loan or it may impair the platform’s or loan servicer’s ability to collect on the loan upon default. The loans in which the Fund invests generally will not include any cross-default
provisions. Cross-default provisions render a default on one outstanding debt obligation an automatic default on another debt obligation of the borrower, which permits creditors to react more quickly to take steps to protect their interests. In
contrast, the loans in which the Fund will 
 
  12 




invest typically will be placed in default or referred to collection only if there are independent defaults on such loans, irrespective of whether the borrower has defaulted on a different debt
obligation. Not only will the Fund not benefit from such protective provisions, the Fund also generally will not be made aware of any additional debt incurred by a borrower or whether such debt is secured or unsecured. 
Default rates on loans obtained through alternative lending platforms may be adversely affected by a number of factors outside the
Fund’s control, such as economic downturns or general economic or political conditions, including prevailing interest rates, the rate of unemployment, the level of consumer confidence, residential real estate values, the value of the various
currencies, energy prices, changes in consumer spending, the number of personal bankruptcies, insolvencies, disruptions in the credit markets, the borrower’s personal circumstances and other factors. 
The default history for alternative lending borrowing arrangements is limited. Future defaults may be higher than historical defaults and
the timing of defaults may vary significantly from historical observations. As described further under “Credit/Counterparty Risk,” the credit profile and interest rates available to certain borrowers who seek credit through alternative
lending platforms may result in a higher rate of default for alternative lending-related securities as compared with the debt instruments associated with more traditional lending models, such as banks, although pursuant to the Fundamental Investment
Restrictions, the Fund will not invest in loans of subprime quality. If the impact of defaults on loans to which the Fund has exposure exceeds the profits on non-defaulting loans, the Fund will be unable to achieve its investment objective.
 The Fund’s investments in equity securities issued by the platforms themselves (or their affiliates) are also subject to
the risk of loss. If a platform defaults on its outstanding obligations, the Fund’s equity interest in the platform may be diminished or extinguished and the Fund can expect to realize on any such investments only to the extent that the
platform’s creditors are made whole and the platform still has residual profits that would benefit equity holders.  Risk of Unsecured
Loans  Many of the Fund’s investments are associated with loans that are unsecured obligations of borrowers. This
means that they are not secured by any collateral, not insured by any third party, not backed by any governmental authority in any way and, except in the case of certain loans to businesses, not guaranteed by any third party. When a borrower
defaults on an unsecured loan, the holder’s only recourse is generally to accelerate the loan and enter into litigation to recover the outstanding principal and interest. There is no assurance that such litigation would result in full repayment
of the loan and the costs of such measures may frequently exceed the outstanding unpaid amount of the borrowing. The Fund generally will need to rely on the efforts of the platforms, servicers or their designated collection agencies to collect on
defaulted loans and there is no guarantee that such parties will be successful in their efforts to collect on loans. In addition, the Fund’s investments in shares, certificates, notes or other securities representing an interest in a special
purpose entity organized by an alternative lending platform and the right to receive principal and interest payments due on whole loans or fractions of whole loans owned by such entity are typically unsecured obligations of the issuer. As a result,
the Fund generally may not look to the underlying loans to satisfy delinquent payments on such interests, even though payments on such interests depend entirely on payments by underlying borrowers on their loans. 
Risk of Inadequate Collateral or Guarantees on Loans  Even if a loan in which the Fund has investment exposure is secured, there can be no assurance that the collateral will, when recovered and liquidated, generate sufficient (or any) funds to offset any
losses associated with the defaulting loan. It is possible that the same collateral could secure multiple loans, in which case the liquidation proceeds of the collateral may be insufficient to cover the payments due on all the loans secured by that
collateral. There can be no guarantee that the collateral can be liquidated and any costs associated with such liquidation could reduce or eliminate the amount of funds otherwise available to offset the payments due under

 
  13 




the loan. As described further under “Risks of Unsecured Loans,” the Fund generally will need to rely on the efforts of the platforms, servicers or their designated collection agencies
to collect on defaulted loans and there is no guarantee that such parties will be successful in their efforts to collect on loans. To the extent that the loan obligations in which the Fund directly or indirectly invests are guaranteed by a third
party, there can be no assurance that the guarantor will perform its payment obligations should the underlying borrower default on its payments. As described under “Default Risk,” the Fund could suffer delays or limitations on its ability
to realize the benefits of the collateral to the extent the borrower becomes bankrupt or insolvent. Moreover, the Fund’s security interests may be unperfected for a variety of reasons, including the failure to make a required filing by the
servicer and, as a result, the Fund may not have priority over other creditors as it expected.  Asset-Backed Securities Risk
 The Fund’s investments in securitization vehicles or other special purpose entities that hold alternative
lending-related securities (asset-backed securities) may involve risks that differ from or are greater than risks associated with other types of investments. In addition, prepayment on the underlying assets may have the effect of shortening the
weighted average maturity of the portfolio assets of such entities and may lower their return. The asset-backed securities in which the Fund invests are also subject to risks associated with their structure and the nature of the underlying assets
and the servicing of those assets; for this reason, many of the other risks described herein are relevant to the asset-backed securities to which the Fund will have exposure. There is risk that the underlying debt securities will default and that
recovery on repossessed collateral might be unavailable or inadequate to support payments on the underlying investments. The risks and returns for investors like the Fund in asset-backed securities depend on the tranche in which the investor holds
an interest. Many asset-backed securities in which the Fund invests may be difficult to value and may be deemed illiquid. Asset-backed securities may have the effect of magnifying the Fund’s exposure to changes in the value of the underlying
assets and may also result in increased volatility in the Fund’s NAV. This means the Fund may have the potential for greater gains, as well as the potential for greater losses, than if the Fund owned the underlying asset directly. The value of
an investment in the Fund may be more volatile and other risks tend to be compounded if and to the extent that the Fund is exposed to asset-backed securities directly or indirectly. Any mishandling of related documentation by a servicer may also
affect the rights of the security holders in and to the underlying collateral.  Credit/Counterparty Risk 
The value of a debt security depends on the issuer’s credit quality or ability to pay principal and interest when due. The
securities in which the Fund may invest may have varying degrees of credit risk and, subject to the Fundamental Investment Restrictions, which, among other things, prohibit the Fund from investing in loans of subprime quality, the Fund will not be
restricted by any borrower credit criteria or credit risk limitation. The value of a debt security is likely to fall if an issuer or the guarantor of a security is unable or unwilling (or perceived to be unable or unwilling) to make timely principal
and/or interest payments or otherwise to honor its obligations or if the debt security’s rating is downgraded. The obligations of issuers are subject to bankruptcy, insolvency and other laws affecting the rights and remedies of creditors. The
value of a debt security can also decline in response to other changes in market, economic, industry, political and regulatory conditions that affect a particular type of debt security or issuer or debt securities generally, such as conditions in
the alternative lending market. Unlike other debt instruments that are rated by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations, the alternative lending-related securities in which the Fund invests are typically unrated or rated only by the
platform. The Fund will rely on the borrower’s credit information, which is provided by the platforms. However, as described under “Default Risk,” such information may be out of date, incomplete or inaccurate and may, therefore, not
accurately reflect the borrower’s actual creditworthiness. Platforms may not have an obligation to update borrower information, and, therefore, the Fund may not be aware of any impairment in a borrower’s creditworthiness subsequent to the
making of a particular loan. 
 
  14 



Although the Fund conducts diligence on the credit scoring methodology used by
platforms from which the Fund purchases alternative lending-related securities, the Fund typically will not have access to all of the data that platforms utilize to assign credit scores to particular loans purchased directly or indirectly by the
Fund, and will not independently diligence or confirm the truthfulness of such information or otherwise evaluate the basis for the platform’s credit score of those loans. As a result, the Fund may make investments based on outdated, inaccurate
or incomplete information. In addition, the platforms’ credit decisions and scoring models are based on algorithms that could potentially contain programming or other errors or prove to be ineffective or otherwise flawed. This could adversely
affect loan pricing data and approval processes and could cause loans to be mispriced or misclassified, which could ultimately have a negative impact on the Fund’s performance.  Platform Risk  As discussed in more detail in “Default Risk”
and “Risk of Unsecured Loans,” the Fund receives payments on whole loans or securities representing the right to receive principal and interest payments due on loans only if the platform servicing the loans receives the borrower’s
payments on such loans and passes such payments through to the Fund. If a borrower is unable or fails to make payments on a loan for any reason, the Fund may be greatly limited in its ability to recover any outstanding principal or interest due, as
(among other reasons) the Fund may not have direct recourse against the borrower or may otherwise be limited in its ability to directly enforce its rights under the loan, whether through the borrower or the platform through which such loan was
originated, the loan may be unsecured or under-collateralized and/or it may be impracticable to commence a legal proceeding against the defaulting borrower.  The Fund may have limited knowledge about the underlying loans and will be dependent upon the platform for information regarding underlying loans. Although the Fund conducts diligence on the platforms,
the Fund generally does not have the ability to independently verify the information provided by the platforms, other than payment information regarding loans and other alternative lending-related securities owned by the Fund, which the Fund will
observe directly as payments are received. Some investors, including the Fund, may not review the particular characteristics of the loans in which they invest at the time of investment, but rather negotiate in advance with platforms the general
criteria of the investments, as described above. As a result, the Fund is dependent on the platforms’ ability to collect, verify and provide information to the Fund about each loan and borrower. 
The Fund will rely on the borrower’s credit information, which is provided by the platforms. However, as described under
“Default Risk,” such information may be out of date, incomplete or inaccurate and may, therefore, not accurately reflect the borrower’s actual creditworthiness. Platforms may not have an obligation to update borrower information, and,
therefore, the Fund may not be aware of any impairment in a borrower’s creditworthiness subsequent to the making of a particular loan. Although the Fund conducts diligence on the credit scoring methodology used by platforms from which the Fund
purchases alternative lending-related securities, the Fund typically will not have access to all of the data that platforms utilize to assign credit scores to particular loans purchased directly or indirectly by the Fund, and will not independently
diligence or confirm the truthfulness of such information or otherwise evaluate the basis for the platform’s credit score of those loans. As a result, the Fund may make investments based on outdated, inaccurate or incomplete information. In
addition, the platforms’ credit decisions and scoring models are based on algorithms that could potentially contain programming or other errors or prove to be ineffective or otherwise flawed. This could adversely affect loan pricing data and
approval processes and could cause loans to be mispriced or misclassified, which could ultimately have a negative impact on the Fund’s performance.  In addition, the underlying loans, in some cases, may be affected by the success of the platforms through which they are facilitated. Therefore, disruptions in the businesses of such platforms may also
negatively impact the value of the Fund’s investments. In addition, disruption in the business of a platform could limit or eliminate the 
 
  15 




ability of the Fund to invest in loans originated by that platform, and therefore the Fund could lose some or all of the benefit of its diligence effort with respect to that platform. 
The Fund may also invest directly or indirectly in public or private equity securities of alternative lending platforms or enter into
other financial transactions, including derivative transactions, to gain exposure to such investments. The performance of equity instruments issued by a platform or derivatives thereon will depend on the success of the platform’s business and
operations. As described above, the Fund may also invest in shares, certificates, notes or other securities representing the right to receive principal and interest payments due on fractions of whole loans or pools of whole loans. 
Platforms are for-profit businesses that, as a general matter, generate revenue by collecting fees on funded loans from borrowers and by
assessing a loan servicing fee on investors, which may be a fixed annual amount or a percentage of the loan or amounts collected. This business could be disrupted in multiple ways; for example, a platform could file for bankruptcy or a platform
might suffer reputational harm from negative publicity about the platform or alternative lending more generally and the loss of investor confidence in the event that a loan facilitated through the platform is not repaid and the investor loses money
on its investment. Many platforms and/or their affiliates have incurred operating losses since their inception and may continue to incur net losses in the future, particularly as their businesses grow and they incur additional operating expenses.
 The Fund’s investments could be adversely impacted if a platform that services the Fund’s investments becomes
unable or unwilling to fulfill its obligations to do so. In order to mitigate this risk, the Fund would seek to rely on a backup servicer provided through the platform or through an unaffiliated backup servicer. To the extent that it is not possible
to collect on defaulted loans or to the extent borrowers prepay loans, a platform that services loans may no longer be able to collect a servicing fee, which would negatively impact its business operations. These or other similar negative events
could adversely affect the platforms’ businesses and/or investor participation in a platform’s marketplace and, in turn, the business of the platforms, which creates a risk of loss for the Fund’s investments in securities issued by a
platform or derivatives thereon.  Platforms may have a higher risk profile than companies engaged in lines of business with a
longer, more established operating history and such investments should be viewed as longer-term investments. They have met with and will continue to meet with challenges, including navigating evolving regulatory and competitive environments;
increasing the number of borrowers and investors utilizing their marketplace; increasing the volume of loans facilitated through their marketplace and transaction fees received for matching borrowers and investors through their marketplace; entering
into new markets and introducing new loan products; continuing to revise the marketplace’s proprietary credit decisions and scoring models; continuing to develop, maintain and scale their platforms; effectively maintaining and scaling financial
and risk management controls and procedures; maintaining the security of the platform and the confidentiality of the information provided and utilized across the platform; and attracting, integrating and retaining an appropriate number of qualified
employees. If platforms are not successful in addressing these issues, the platforms’ businesses and their results of operations may be harmed, which may reduce the possible available investments for the Fund or negatively impact the value of
the Fund’s investments in platforms or in alternative lending-related securities more generally.  Platforms may rely on
debt facilities and other forms of borrowing in order to finance many of the borrower loans they facilitate. However, these financing sources may become unavailable after their current maturity dates or the terms may become less favorable to the
borrowing platforms. As the volume of loans that a platform facilitates increases, the platform may need to expand its borrowing capacity on its existing debt arrangements or may need to seek new sources of capital. Platforms may also default on or
breach their existing debt agreements, which could diminish or eliminate their access to funding at all or on terms acceptable to the platforms. Such events could cause the Fund to incur losses on its investments that are dependent upon the
performance of the platforms. 
 
  16 



The Fund’s investments in the equity securities of platforms, including common
stock, preferred stock, warrants or convertible stock, are subject to equity securities risk. Equity securities risk is the risk that the value of equity securities to which the Fund is exposed will fall due to general market or economic conditions;
overall market changes; local, regional or global political, social or economic instability; currency, interest rate and commodity price fluctuations; perceptions regarding the industries in which the issuers participate and the particular
circumstances and performance of the issuers. The prices of equities are also sensitive to rising interest rates, as the costs of capital rise and borrowing costs increase. The equity securities of smaller, less seasoned companies, such as platforms
or their affiliates, are generally subject to greater price fluctuations, limited liquidity, higher transaction costs and higher investment risk. To the extent that the Fund invests in unlisted equity securities, the investments generally will
involve a higher degree of valuation and performance uncertainty and greater liquidity risk than investments in listed securities. Preferred securities are subject to issuer-specific and market risks applicable generally to equity securities. In
addition, preferred securities generally pay a dividend and rank ahead of common stocks and behind debt securities in claims for dividends and for assets of the issuer in a liquidation or bankruptcy. For this reason, the value of preferred
securities will usually react more strongly than bonds and other debt to actual or perceived changes in the company’s financial condition or prospects. Preferred securities may also be sensitive to changes in interest rates. When interest rates
rise, the fixed dividend on preferred securities may be less attractive, causing the price of preferred stocks to decline. Convertible securities are subject to the risks applicable generally to debt securities, including credit risk. Convertible
securities also react to changes in the value of the common stock into which they convert, and are thus subject to market risk. In the event of a liquidation of the issuing company, holders of convertible securities typically would be paid before
the company’s common stockholders but after holders of any senior debt obligations of the company.  The Fund’s
investments in shares, certificates, notes or other securities issued by a platform, its affiliates or a special purpose entity sponsored by a platform or its affiliates that represent the right to receive principal and interest payments due on
fractions of whole loans or pools of whole loans may expose the Fund to the credit risk of the issuer. Generally, such securities are unsecured obligations of the issuer; an issuer that becomes subject to bankruptcy proceedings may be unable to make
full and timely payments on its obligations to the Fund, even if the payments on the underlying loan or loans continue to be made timely and in full. In addition, when the Fund owns such fractional loans or other securities, the Fund and its
custodian generally will not have a contractual relationship with, or personally identifiable information regarding, individual borrowers, so the Fund will not be able to enforce underlying loans directly against borrowers and may not be able to
appoint an alternative servicing agent in the event that a platform or third-party servicer, as applicable, ceases to service the underlying loans. Therefore, the Fund will be more dependent on the platform for servicing than in the case in which
the Fund owns whole loans. Where such interests are secured, the Fund relies on the platform to perfect the Fund’s security interest. In addition, there may be a delay between the time the Fund commits to purchase a security issued by a
platform, its affiliate or a special purpose entity sponsored by the platform or its affiliate and the issuance of such security and, during such delay, the funds committed to such an investment will not earn interest on the investment nor will they
be available for investment in other alternative lending-related securities, which will reduce the effective rate of return on the investment. The Fund will invest primarily in whole loans, and does not expect to invest a material portion of its
portfolio in such fractional loans or other securities.  Servicer Risk 
The Fund expects that all of its direct and indirect investments in loans originated by alternative lending platforms will be serviced by
a platform or a third-party servicer. In the event that the servicer is unable to service the loan, there can be no guarantee that a backup servicer will be able to assume responsibility for servicing the loans in a timely or cost-effective manner;
any resulting disruption or delay could jeopardize payments due to the Fund in respect of its investments or increase the costs associated with the Fund’s investments. If the servicer becomes subject to a bankruptcy or similar proceeding, there
is some risk that the Fund’s investments could be recharacterized as a secured loan from the Fund to the platform, as described more 
 
  17 




fully (with respect to the potential bankruptcy of a platform) under “Regulatory Risk,” which could result in uncertainty, costs and delays from having the Fund’s investment deemed
part of the bankruptcy estate of the platform, rather than an asset owned outright by the Fund.  Regulatory Risk 
The loan industry is highly regulated and the alternative lending-related securities in which the Fund invests are subject to extensive
rules and regulations issued by governmental authorities in each of the jurisdictions in which the Fund invests. These authorities also may impose obligations and restrictions on the platforms’ activities or those of other entities involved in
the alternative lending process.  The platforms’ failure to comply with the requirements of applicable law may cause,
among other things, the platforms to be required to register with governmental authorities and/or the revocation of requisite licenses, the voiding of loan contracts, impairment of the enforcement of loans, indemnification liability to contract
counterparties, class action lawsuits, administrative enforcement actions and/or civil and criminal liability in the relevant jurisdiction. The evolving nature of the platforms’ respective business models may complicate their ability to
determine the applicability of, and to effect compliance with, such requirements. Moreover, legal and regulatory requirements and any interpretations of those requirements are subject to periodic changes. Any such change necessitating new
significant compliance obligations could have an adverse effect on the platforms’ compliance costs and ability to operate. The platforms could seek to pass through any increase in their costs to their borrowers or investors, such as the Fund,
in the form of higher origination or servicing fees.  In connection with the sale and servicing of the whole loans, fractions
of whole loans or pools of whole loans, the platforms typically make representations and warranties to investors, such as the Fund, that the loans were originated and are being serviced in accordance with and in compliance with applicable laws (and
in some cases specifically with the laws described herein) in all material respects. Despite these representations and warranties, the Fund cannot guarantee that the platforms have been and will continue to be in compliance with all applicable laws.
If those representations and warranties were not correct, the platforms could be required to repurchase the loans, but the Fund cannot be certain that the platform would be required and able to repurchase loans in all such cases. 
In addition to laws governing the activities of lenders and servicers, a limited number of states require purchasers of certain loans,
primarily consumer loans, to be licensed or registered in order to own the loans or, in certain states, to collect a rate of interest above a specified rate. The Fund intends to obtain licenses where required in order to pursue its investment
strategy.  Lender Liability  A number of judicial decisions have upheld judgments of borrowers against lending institutions on the basis of various evolving legal theories, collectively termed “lender liability.” Generally,
lender liability is founded on the premise that a lender has violated a duty (whether implied or contractual) of good faith, commercial reasonableness and fair dealing, or a similar duty owed to the borrower or has assumed an excessive degree of
control over the borrower resulting in the creation of a fiduciary duty owed to the borrower or its other creditors or shareholders. If a loan held directly or indirectly by the Fund were found to have been made or serviced under circumstances that
give rise to lender liability, the borrower’s obligation to repay that loan could be reduced or eliminated or the Fund’s recovery on that loan could be otherwise impaired, which would adversely impact the value of that loan. 
In limited cases, courts have subordinated the loans of a senior lender to a borrower to claims of other creditors of the borrower when
the senior lender or its agents, such as a loan servicer, is found to have engaged in unfair, inequitable or fraudulent conduct with respect to the other creditors. If a loan held directly or indirectly by the

 
  18 




Fund were subject to such subordination, it would be junior in right of payment to other indebtedness of the borrower, which could adversely impact the value of that loan. 
Privacy and Data Security Laws  While the Fund will adopt policies and procedures regarding the platforms’ and custodian’s protection and use of non-public personal information, the Fund cannot guarantee the security of that
data and cannot guarantee that service providers have been and will continue to comply with the U.S. Federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (“GLBA”), other data security and privacy laws and any other related regulatory requirements. Violations of
GLBA and other laws could subject the Fund to litigation and/or fines, penalties or other regulatory action, which, individually or in the aggregate, could have an adverse effect on the Fund. The Fund may also face regulations related to privacy and
data security in the other jurisdictions in which the Fund invests.  Leverage Risk 
The Fund or a Subsidiary of the Fund may obtain financing to make investments in alternative lending-related securities and may obtain
leverage through derivative instruments or asset-backed securities that afford the Fund economic leverage. Leverage magnifies the Fund’s exposure to declines in the value of one or more underlying reference assets or creates investment risk
with respect to a larger pool of assets than the Fund would otherwise have and may be considered a speculative technique. The value of an investment in the Fund will be more volatile and other risks tend to be compounded if and to the extent the
Fund borrows or uses derivatives or other investments that have embedded leverage.  Securitization Risk 
In connection with the sale or contribution by the Fund or its Subsidiaries of certain of their alternative lending-related investments
to any special purpose entity formed for the purpose of acquiring alternative lending-related investments and issuing securities, the Fund or its Subsidiaries may be required to make certain representations about the alternative lending-related
investments sold or contributed to such special purpose entity. The Fund or its Subsidiaries also may be required to indemnify such special purpose entity, or to repurchase the alternative lending-related investments to which such representations
relate, to the extent that any of such representation is found to have been inaccurate on the date that it was made.  Risk of Fraud
 The Fund may be subject to the risk of fraudulent activity associated with the various parties involved in alternative
lending, including the platforms, banks, borrowers and third parties handling borrower and investor information. Prospective borrowers may materially misrepresent any of the information they provide to the platforms, including their credit history,
the existence or value of purported collateral, the purpose of the loan, their occupation or their employment status. Platforms may not verify all of the information provided by prospective borrowers. Except where a platform is required to
repurchase loans or indemnify investors, fraud may adversely affect the Fund’s ability to receive the principal and interest payments that it expects to receive on its investments and, therefore, may negatively impact the Fund’s
performance. A platform may have the exclusive right and ability to investigate claims of borrower identity theft, which creates a conflict of interest, as platforms may be obligated to repurchase loans and/or indemnify investors in the loans in the
case of fraud and may, therefore, have an incentive to deny or fail to investigate properly a claim of fraud. Furthermore, there can be no guarantee that the resources, technologies or fraud prevention measures implemented by a platform will be
sufficient to accurately detect and prevent fraud.  The Fund is also subject to the risk of fraudulent activity by a platform
or a backup servicer. In the event that a platform or backup servicer engages in fraudulent activity, the pools of loans originated by the platform or any 
 
  19 




loans serviced by the platform or backup servicer may be impaired or may not be of the quality that the Fund anticipated, thereby increasing the risk of default in respect of such loans.
 Below Investment Grade Securities and Unrated Securities Risk 
The Fund may have exposure, without limitation, to investments that are rated below investment grade or that are unrated but are judged
by the Adviser to be of comparable quality. The alternative lending-related securities in which the Fund invests (or, in the case of asset-backed securities, the loans that back them) typically are not rated by a nationally recognized statistical
rating organization. Although the Fund’s Fundamental Investment Restrictions do not permit the Fund to invest in loans of subprime quality, some unrated securities purchased by the Fund may be of credit quality comparable to securities rated
below investment grade by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization. In addition, the Fund may invest in securities that are rated below investment grade. Below investment grade debt securities, which are commonly called “junk
bonds,” are rated below BBB- by Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services (“S&P”) or Baa3 by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., (“Moody’s”), or have comparable ratings by another rating organization.
Accordingly, certain of the Fund’s unrated investments could constitute a highly risky and speculative investment, similar to an investment in “junk bonds.” 
Below investment grade investments may be subject to greater risks than other investments, including greater levels of risk related to
changes in interest rates, credit risk (including a greater risk of default) and liquidity risk. There is a greater risk of loss associated with alternative lending-related securities investments and the ability of a borrower to make principal
and/or interest payments is predominantly speculative for below investment grade investments or unrated investments judged by the Adviser to have a similar quality. Below investment grade investments or unrated investments judged by the Adviser to
be of comparable quality may be more susceptible to real or perceived adverse economic and competitive industry or business conditions than higher-grade investments. Yields on below investment grade investments will fluctuate. 
Pursuant to the Fundamental Investment Restrictions, the Fund will not invest of loans of subprime quality. 
Interest Rate Risk  The
values of the Fund’s investments in income-producing alternative lending-related securities (such as whole loans, other debt instruments, preferred securities and convertible securities) change in response to interest rate changes. In general,
the value of a debt security is likely to fall as interest rates rise. This risk is generally greater for obligations with longer maturities or for debt securities that do not pay current interest. Debt securities with floating interest rates can be
less sensitive to interest rate changes, although, to the extent the Fund’s income is based on short-term interest rates that fluctuate over short periods of time, income received by the Fund may decrease as a result of a decline in interest
rates; floating rate loans can also decrease in value if their interest rates do not rise as quickly or as much as market interest rates. Conversely, variable rate instruments generally will not increase in value if interest rates decline. When
interest rates increase or for other reasons, debt securities may be repaid more slowly than expected. As a result, the maturity of the debt instrument may be extended, increasing the potential for loss. 
Interest rate changes can be sudden and unpredictable. A wide variety of factors can cause interest rates to fluctuate (e.g.,
central bank monetary policies, inflation rates, general economic conditions and market developments) and debt securities may be particularly volatile during such periods. Currently, certain interest rates are at or near historic lows and, as a
result, they are likely to rise over time, which may cause the value of the Fund’s investments and, therefore, the Fund’s net asset value, to decrease.  Prepayment Risk  In the event of a prepayment of all or a portion of the
remaining unpaid principal amount of a loan to which the Fund has investment exposure, the Fund will receive such prepayment but further interest will cease to accrue on 
 
  20 




the prepaid portion of the loan after the date of the prepayment. If the Fund buys a security at a premium, the premium could be lost in the event of a prepayment. In periods of falling interest
rates, the rate of prepayments (and price fluctuation) tends to increase as borrowers are incentivized to pay off debt and refinance at new lower rates. During such periods, the Fund generally will be forced to reinvest the prepayment proceeds at
lower rates of return than the Fund expected to earn on the prepaid assets, provided that the Fund is able to identify suitable reinvestment opportunities, which may adversely impact the Fund’s performance. 
Illiquidity Risk 
To the extent consistent with the repurchase liquidity requirement of an interval fund, the Fund may invest without limitation in
illiquid investments. Illiquidity risk is the risk that the investments held by the Fund may be difficult or impossible to sell at the time that the Fund would like or at the price that the Fund believes the security is currently worth. Alternative
lending-related securities, which typically are contractually non-transferable, are not listed on any securities exchange and/or are not registered under the Securities Act of 1933, are illiquid. Furthermore, an active, reliable secondary market for
alternative lending-related securities does not currently exist and there can be no assurance that an active market will develop. At any given time, the Fund’s portfolio will be substantially illiquid. 
The Fund’s ability to realize full value in the event of the need to liquidate certain assets may be impaired and/or result in
losses to the Fund. The Fund may be unable to sell its investments, even under circumstances when the Adviser believes it would be in the best interests of the Fund to do so. Illiquid investments may also be difficult to value and their pricing may
be more volatile than more liquid investments, which could adversely affect the price at which the Fund is able to sell such instruments. Illiquidity risk also may be greater in times of financial stress. The risks associated with illiquid
instruments may be particularly acute in situations in which the Fund’s operations require cash (such as in connection with repurchase offers) and could result in the Fund borrowing to meet its short-term needs or incurring losses on the sale
of illiquid instruments.  Valuation Risk  The Fund is subject to valuation risk, which is the risk that one or more of the securities in which the Fund invests are priced incorrectly, due to factors such as incomplete data, market instability or
human error. The Fund anticipates using a third-party pricing service to value the Fund’s investments in alternative lending-related securities, as market quotations generally are not available for the Fund’s investments in alternative
lending-related securities. There is no assurance that the Fund could sell a portfolio security for the value established for it at any time and it is possible that the Fund would incur a loss because a portfolio security is sold at a discount to
its established value. If securities are mispriced, shareholders could lose money upon redemption or could pay too much for Shares purchased.  Competition, Ramp-up and Exposure Risks  The Fund faces competition for
access to platforms and alternative lending-related securities, including from other institutional investors; such competitors may have higher risk tolerance, greater financial or other resources and/or other advantages. If the Fund is inhibited
from deploying capital in a timely or efficient manner, it may be forced to invest in cash, cash equivalents or other assets that may result in lower returns than may otherwise be available through investments in alternative lending-related
securities. The success of any given platform and, therefore, the success of the Fund will depend, among other things, on a continuous demand for loans from qualified borrowers. There can be no assurance that such demand will continue to exist.
 There can be no assurances as to how long it will take the Fund to invest the net proceeds of the offering, and the
longer the period the greater the likelihood that the Fund’s performance will be adversely affected. Pending 
 
  21 




deployment of the net proceeds of the offering, the Fund generally will invest cash held in cash deposits and cash equivalents. The Fund will limit the sale of its securities based on the
Adviser’s assessment of its ability to invest the proceeds in an effective and timely manner.  If the Fund’s access
to platforms is limited, whether due to ramp-up, termination of existing arrangements or failure to secure arrangements with other platforms, its exposure to the risks of the platforms to which the Fund is exposed, as discussed under “Platform
Risk,” and the risks of increased exposure to a potentially more limited pool of portfolio investments, may increase. Moreover, a platform may be unable to sustain its current lending model or may change its underwriting or credit models,
borrower acquisition channels, quality of debt collection procedures and/or servicing models in ways that may make such investments unsuitable for the Fund; such changes may occur after the Fund has already made its investments and, as most of the
Fund’s alternative lending-related securities are illiquid, the Fund may not be able to divest itself of the instruments at all or at an advantageous time or price. Even if the Fund is exposed to a varied pool of assets, the Fund’s
investment focus on alternative lending-related securities will cause the Fund to be subject to greater overall risk than if the Fund’s exposures were less focused, as it will be exposed to events affecting the alternative lending-related
industry.  Even if the Fund’s investments are varied as to borrower type, geographic location, loan purpose or other
features, they may nevertheless have some similar characteristics and may, therefore, be subject to many of the same risks and/or regulatory regimes and may respond in a similar manner to particular economic, market, political or other developments.
 Geographic Focus Risk  A geographic focus in a particular region may expose the Fund to an increased risk of loss due to risks associated with that region. Certain regions from time to time will experience weaker economic
conditions than others and, consequently, will likely experience higher rates of delinquency and loss than on similar investments across the geographic regions to which the Fund is exposed. In the event that a significant portion of the alternative
lending-related securities of the Fund relate to loans owed by borrowers resident or operating in certain specific geographic regions, any localized economic conditions, weather events, natural or man-made disasters or other factors affecting those
regions in particular could increase delinquency and defaults on the assets to which the Fund is exposed and could negatively impact Fund performance. Further, any focus of the Fund’s alternative lending-related investments in one or more
regions would have a disproportionate effect on the Fund if governmental authorities in any such region took action against any of the participants in the alternative lending industry doing business in that region. 
Foreign Securities Risk 
The Fund may invest directly or indirectly in the alternative lending-related securities of foreign issuers. Such investments may involve
risks not ordinarily associated with exposure to alternative lending-related securities of U.S. issuers. The foreign alternative lending industry may be subject to less governmental supervision and regulation than exists in the U.S.; conversely,
foreign regulatory regimes applicable to the alternative lending industry may be more complex and more restrictive than those in the U.S., resulting in higher costs associated with such investments, and such regulatory regimes may be subject to
interpretation or change without prior notice to investors, such as the Fund. Foreign platforms may not be subject to accounting, auditing and financial reporting standards and practices comparable to those in the U.S. 
The Fund’s exposure to alternative lending-related securities issued by foreign issuers may be subject to withholding and other
foreign taxes, which may adversely affect the net return on such investments. As described further under “Currency Risk,” fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and exchange controls may adversely affect the market value of the
Fund’s investments in alternative lending-related securities of foreign issuers. The Fund is unlikely to be able to pass through to its shareholders foreign income tax credits in respect of any foreign income taxes it pays. 
 
  22 



Currency Risk  Currency risk is the risk that fluctuations in exchange rates will adversely affect the market value of the Fund’s investments. Currency risk includes the risk that the foreign currencies in which
the Fund’s investments are traded, in which the Fund receives income or in which the Fund has taken a position will decline in value relative to the U.S. dollar. Currency risk also includes the risk that a currency to which the Fund has
obtained exposure through hedging declines in value relative to the currency being hedged, in which event the Fund may realize a loss both on the hedging instrument and on the currency being hedged. Currency exchange rates can fluctuate
significantly for many reasons. Derivative transactions in foreign currencies (such as futures, forwards, options and swaps) may involve leverage risk in addition to currency risk. In purchasing or selling local currency to fund trades denominated
in that currency, the Fund will be exposed to the risk that the value of the foreign currency will increase or decrease, which may impact the value of the Fund’s investments in foreign currencies, securities denominated in foreign currencies,
derivatives that provide exposure to foreign currencies and the Fund’s income available for distribution. Some countries have and may continue to adopt internal economic policies that affect their currency valuations in a manner that may be
disadvantageous for U.S. investors or U.S. companies seeking to do business in those countries.  Investments in Other Pooled
Investment Vehicles  Direct or indirect investing in another pooled investment vehicle, such as securitization vehicles
that issue asset-backed securities, exposes the Fund to all of the risks of that vehicle’s investments. The Fund will bear its pro rata share of the expenses of any such vehicle, in addition to its own expenses. The values of other pooled
investment vehicles are subject to change as the values of their respective component assets fluctuate. To the extent the Fund invests in managed pooled investment vehicles, the performance of the Fund’s investments in such vehicles will be
dependent upon the investment and research abilities of persons other than the Adviser. The securities offered by such vehicles typically are not registered under the securities laws because they are offered in transactions that are exempt from
registration.  Market Risk  The value of the Fund’s investments may decline, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably, due to general economic conditions that are not specifically related to a particular issuer or borrower, such as
real or perceived adverse economic or political conditions throughout the world, changes in interest or currency rates or adverse investor sentiment generally. The value of the Fund’s investments also may decline because of factors that affect
a particular industry or industries. These risks may be particularly acute for the Fund, as alternative lending is a new and evolving industry. 
Volatility Risk  The
market value of the alternative lending-related securities to which the Fund has exposure may increase or decrease, sometimes rapidly and unpredictably, based upon changes in an issuer’s financial condition and/or overall market and economic
conditions. Because many of the Fund’s investments may be illiquid and/or below investment grade (or unrated, but of a similar quality; debt securities that are below investment grade are commonly called “junk bonds”), the Fund may be
subject to increased volatility risk. In addition, the Fund’s use of leverage will increase the volatility of the Fund’s value. 
Management and Operational Risk  The Fund is subject to management risk because it relies on the Adviser’s ability to achieve its investment objective. The Fund runs the risk that the Adviser’s investment techniques will fail
to produce desired results and cause the Fund to incur significant losses. The Adviser may fail to use derivatives effectively, may select investments that do not perform as anticipated by the Adviser and may choose to hedge or not to hedge
positions at disadvantageous times. 
 
  23 



Any imperfections, errors, or limitations in quantitative analyses and models used by
the Adviser as part of its investment process could affect the Fund’s performance.  The Fund also is subject to the risk
of loss as a result of other services provided by the Adviser and other service providers, including pricing, administrative, accounting, tax, legal, custody, transfer agency and other services. Operational risk includes the possibility of loss
caused by inadequate procedures and controls, human error and cyber attacks, disruptions and failures affecting, or by, a service provider. 
Alternative Lending Operational and Technology Risk  Because the Fund depends on electronic systems maintained by the custodian and the platforms or their affiliates to maintain records, evidence ownership of the Fund’s investments, appropriately
safeguard such investments and to service and administer alternative lending-related securities (as applicable), the Fund is vulnerable to the risks associated with such electronic systems, including, among others: power loss, computer systems
failures and internet, telecommunications or data network failures; operator negligence or improper operation by, or supervision of, employees; physical and electronic loss of data or security breaches, misappropriation and similar events; computer
viruses; cyber attacks, intentional acts of vandalism and similar events; and hurricanes, fires, floods and other natural disasters.  These potential risks may cause a decrease in the amount of loans acquired by the platforms, which may directly affect the Fund and its ability to achieve its investment objective. The potential for
security breaches may also adversely affect the Fund due to its reputational impact on the platforms and wider effect on the alternative lending industry as a whole.  Derivatives Risk  The Fund may invest directly or indirectly in a variety
of derivatives, including futures contracts, forwards, swaps and other exchange-traded and over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives contracts. Derivatives are financial contracts the value of which depends on, or is derived from, an asset or other
underlying reference. Derivatives involve the risk that changes in their value may not move as expected relative to changes in the value of the underlying reference asset they are designed to track. The Fund may invest in derivatives for investment
purposes and for hedging and risk management purposes. See the Statement of Additional Information for additional information of the various types and uses of derivatives in the Fund’s strategy. 
The use of derivatives involves risks that are in addition to, and potentially greater than, the risks of investing directly in
securities and other more traditional assets. In particular, the Fund’s use of OTC derivatives exposes it to the risk that the counterparties will be unable or unwilling to make timely settlement payments or otherwise honor their obligations.
If the counterparty defaults, the Fund will still have contractual remedies but may not be able to enforce them. The Fund may invest in derivatives with a limited number of counterparties and events affecting the creditworthiness of any of those
counterparties may have a pronounced effect on the Fund.  Derivatives also present other risks described herein, including
market risk, illiquidity risk, currency risk and credit risk. Many derivatives, in particular OTC derivatives, are complex and their valuation often requires modeling and judgment, which increases the risk of mispricing or improper valuation.
 The Fund’s use of derivatives may not be effective or have the desired results. Moreover, suitable derivatives will not
be available in all circumstances. The Adviser may decide not to use derivatives to hedge or otherwise reduce the Fund’s risk exposures, potentially resulting in losses for the Fund. 
Swap contracts and other OTC derivatives are highly susceptible to illiquidity risk (see “Illiquidity Risk”). Because many
derivatives have a leverage component (i.e., a notional value in excess of the assets needed to 
 
  24 




establish and/or maintain the derivative position), adverse changes in the value or level of the underlying reference asset may result in a loss substantially greater than the amount invested in
the derivative itself. (See “Leverage Risk.”)  Subsidiary Risk 
By investing through its Subsidiaries, the Fund is exposed to the risks associated with the Subsidiaries’ investments. Subsidiaries
will not be registered as investment companies under the 1940 Act and will not be subject to all of the investor protections of the 1940 Act, although each Subsidiary will be managed pursuant to the compliance policies and procedures of the Fund
applicable to it. Changes in the laws of the United States and/or the jurisdiction in which a Subsidiary is organized could result in the inability of the Fund and/or the Subsidiary to operate as described in this prospectus and could adversely
affect the Fund.  Short Sale Risk  The Fund may incur a loss if the market price of the asset underlying the short sale increases between the date of the short sale and the date on which the Fund must replace the borrowed asset or
otherwise close out the transaction and such loss may exceed the initial investment. Under adverse market conditions, the Fund may have difficulty purchasing an asset to meet its short sale delivery obligations, and may have to sell portfolio assets
to raise sufficient capital to fulfill its short sale obligations at a disadvantageous time. Entering into short sales where the Fund does not own the underlying asset creates a form of investment leverage, which can magnify the Fund’s exposure
to changes in the value of the asset. Because the Fund may enter into short sales with respect to assets that it does not already own, the loss to the Fund from a short sale is theoretically unlimited, as the potential increase in the market price
of the asset is unlimited. The amount of any gain will be decreased, and the amount of any loss increased, by the amount of the premium, dividends, interest, or expenses the Fund may be required to pay in connection with a short sale. There can be
no assurance that the Fund will be able to close out a short sales position at an advantageous time or price. To the extent that the Fund enters into short sales for hedging purposes, there can be no guarantee that the investment will be effective;
any lack of correlation between the assets used in the short position and the exposure the Fund sought to hedge could result in losses. 
Tax Risk  The Fund
intends to qualify for treatment as a RIC under the Code. In order to qualify for such treatment, the Fund must derive at least 90% of its gross income each taxable year from qualifying income, meet certain asset diversification tests at the
end of each fiscal quarter, and distribute at least 90% of its investment company taxable income. The Fund’s investment strategy will potentially be limited by its intention to qualify for treatment as a RIC. The tax treatment of certain of the
Fund’s investments under one or more of the qualification or distribution tests applicable to RICs is not certain. An adverse determination or future guidance by the IRS might affect the Fund’s ability to qualify for such treatment.
 If, in any year, the Fund were to fail to qualify for treatment as a RIC under the Code for any reason, and were not able to
cure such failure, the Fund would be subject to tax on its taxable income at corporate rates, and all distributions from earnings and profits, including any distributions of net tax-exempt income and net long-term capital gains, would be taxable to
shareholders as ordinary income.  Non-Diversification Risk  The Fund is classified as a “non-diversified” fund under the 1940 Act. Accordingly, the Fund may invest a greater portion of its assets in the securities of a single issuer than if it were a
“diversified” fund. To the extent that the Fund invests a higher percentage of its assets in the securities of a single issuer, the Fund is subject to a higher degree of risk associated with and developments affecting that issuer than a
fund that invests more widely. 
 
  25 



Repurchase Offers Risk 
As described under “Periodic Repurchase Offers” below, the Fund is an “interval fund” and, in order to provide
liquidity to shareholders, the Fund, subject to applicable law, will conduct quarterly repurchase offers of the Fund’s outstanding Shares at NAV per quarter, subject to approval of the Board. In all cases such repurchases will be for at least
5% and not more than 25%, and are currently expected to be for 5%, of its outstanding Shares at NAV, pursuant to Rule 23c-3 under the 1940 Act. The Fund believes that these repurchase offers are generally beneficial to the Fund’s shareholders,
and repurchases generally will be funded from available cash or sales of portfolio securities, which are substantially illiquid. However, repurchase offers and the need to fund repurchase obligations may affect the ability of the Fund to be fully
invested or force the Fund to maintain a higher percentage of its assets in liquid investments, which may harm the Fund’s investment performance. Moreover, diminution in the size of the Fund through repurchases may result in untimely sales of
portfolio securities (with associated imputed transaction costs, which may be significant), and may limit the ability of the Fund to participate in new investment opportunities or to achieve its investment objective. In compliance with its
procedures, the Fund will, to the extent possible, hold at least 5% of net assets in cash or other liquid assets at all times in order to meet its repurchase obligations. The Fund may accumulate cash by holding back (i.e., not reinvesting)
payments received in connection with the Fund’s investments. The Fund believes that payments received in connection with the Fund’s investments will generate sufficient cash to meet the maximum potential amount of the Fund’s
repurchase obligations. If at any time cash and other liquid assets held by the Fund are not sufficient to meet the Fund’s repurchase obligations, the Fund intends, if necessary, to sell investments. Although the Fund’s investments are
illiquid and the secondary market for its investments is limited, the Fund believes that it would be able to find willing buyers for investments if such sales were ever necessary to supplement such cash generated by payments received in connection
with the Fund’s investments. If the Fund employed investment leverage, repurchases of Shares would compound the adverse effects of leverage in a declining market. In addition, if the Fund borrows to finance repurchases, interest on that
borrowing will negatively affect shareholders who do not tender their Shares by increasing the Fund’s expenses and reducing any net investment income. If a repurchase offer is oversubscribed the Fund will repurchase the Shares tendered on a pro
rata basis, and shareholders will have to wait until the next repurchase offer to make another repurchase request. As a result, shareholders may be unable to liquidate all or a given percentage of their investment in the Fund during a particular
repurchase offer. Some shareholders, in anticipation of proration, may tender more Shares than they wish to have repurchased in a particular quarter, thereby increasing the likelihood that proration will occur. A shareholder may be subject to market
and other risks, and the NAV of Shares tendered in a repurchase offer may decline between the Repurchase Request Deadline and the date on which the NAV for tendered Shares is determined. In addition, the repurchase of Shares by the Fund may be a
taxable event to shareholders.  Portfolio Turnover  A change in the securities held by the Fund is known as “portfolio turnover.” If the Fund realizes capital gains when it sells investments, it generally must pay those gains to shareholders,
increasing its taxable distributions, including distributions of short-term capital gain, which are taxable as ordinary income to shareholders. Increased portfolio turnover may also result in higher brokerage fees or other transaction costs, which
can reduce the Fund’s performance. Portfolio turnover will not be a limiting factor should the Adviser deem it advisable to purchase or sell securities.  Temporary Defensive and Interim Investments  For temporary defensive
purposes in times of adverse or unstable market, economic or political conditions, the Fund can invest up to 100% of its assets in investments that may be inconsistent with its principal investment strategies. Generally, the Fund would invest in
money market instruments or in other short-term U.S. or non-U.S. government securities. The Fund might also hold these types of securities as interim investments pending the 
 
  26 




investment of proceeds from the sale of its Shares or the sale of its portfolio securities or to meet anticipated redemptions of its Shares. To the extent the Fund invests in these securities, it
might not achieve its investment objective.  Expense Risk  Your actual costs of investing in the Fund may be higher than the expenses shown in “Annual Fund Operating Expenses” for a variety of reasons. The Fund’s expense limitation agreements,
which generally remain in effect for a period of one year, mitigate this risk. However, there is no assurance that the Adviser will renew such expense limitation agreements from year-to-year.  Anti-Takeover Provisions  The Fund’s Declaration of Trust, together
with any amendments thereto, includes provisions that could limit the ability of other entities or persons to acquire control of the Fund or convert the Fund to open-end status.  No Prior History  The Fund is a newly-organized closed-end management
investment company with no history of operations and is designed for long-term investors and not as a trading vehicle.

(1) 
 Amount assumes that the Fund sells $1.5 billion worth of Shares during the Fund’s first twelve months and that the Fund’s net offering
proceeds from such sales equal $1.5 billion. Expenses are estimated. Actual expenses will depend on the Fund’s net assets, which will be affected by the number of Shares the Fund sells in this offering. For example, if the Fund were to raise
proceeds significantly less than this amount over the following twelve months, average net assets would be significantly lower and some expenses as a percentage of net assets would be significantly higher. There can be no assurance that the Fund
will sell $1.5 billion worth of Shares during the following twelve months. 


(2) 
 “Interest Payments on Borrowed Funds” are based on estimated levels of borrowing and estimated interest rates for the current fiscal year.
If the Fund were to incur higher levels of borrowing or pay higher interest rates, interest payments on borrowed funds as a percentage of net assets would be higher. 


(3) 
 “Other Expenses” are based on estimated amounts for the current fiscal year. 


(4) 
 The Fund is responsible for its operating expenses, including its organization expenses, which are expensed as incurred and are subject to the
expense limitation agreement described below. Notwithstanding the foregoing, through the one-year anniversary of the date the Fund commences investment operations, the Adviser (defined below) has agreed to pay or otherwise bear operating and other
expenses of the Fund (including organizational and offering expenses, but excluding brokerage and transactional expenses; borrowing and other investment-related costs and fees including interest payments on borrowed funds, loan servicing fees, loan
collection and administration fees and expenses, interest and commitment fees; short dividend expense; acquired fund fees and expenses; taxes; litigation and indemnification expenses; judgments; and extraordinary expenses not incurred in the
ordinary course of the Fund’s business) solely to the extent necessary to limit the Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses to 2.00% of the average daily net assets of the Fund. The Adviser shall be permitted to recoup in later periods Fund
expenses that the Adviser has paid or otherwise borne to the extent that the expenses for the Fund fall below the annual limitation rate in effect at the time of the actual waiver/reimbursement and to the extent that they do not cause the Fund to
exceed the annual rate in effect at the time of the recoupment. Under the expense limitation agreement, the Adviser is not permitted to recoup such expenses beyond three years from the end of the fiscal year in which the Adviser reduced a fee or
reimbursed an expense. This expense limitation cannot be terminated prior to the one-year anniversary of the date the Fund commences investment operations.  Example. The following Example is intended to help you understand the various costs and expenses that you, as a holder of Shares, would bear directly or indirectly. The Example assumes that you
invest $1,000 in Shares of the Fund for the time periods indicated. Because there are no costs to you associated with repurchases of your shares, your costs would be the same whether you hold your Shares or tender your Shares for repurchase at the
end of the time periods indicated. The Example also assumes that your investment has a 5% return each year, that all dividends and distributions are reinvested at NAV and that the Fund’s operating expenses (as described above) remain the same,
except to reduce annual expenses upon completion of organization and offering expenses, and takes into account the effect of the fee waiver and/or expense reimbursement (if any) during the 
  28 



first year. The Example should not be considered a representation of the Fund’s future expenses. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs

FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS 
The Fund is newly organized and its Shares have not previously been offered. Therefore, the Fund does not have any financial history.
Additional information about the Fund’s investments will be available in the Fund’s annual and semi-annual reports when they are prepared.  THE FUND  Stone Ridge Alternative Lending Risk
Premium Fund (the “Fund”) is a newly organized, non-diversified, closed-end management investment company registered under the 1940 Act. The Fund was organized as a Delaware statutory trust on November 4, 2015, pursuant to a
Certificate of Trust. The Fund has no operating history. The Fund’s principal office is located at 510 Madison Ave, 21st Floor, New York City, NY 10022.  USE OF PROCEEDS  The Fund will invest the
proceeds of the offering of Shares in accordance with its investment objective and policies as stated below. It is currently anticipated that the Fund will be able to invest all or substantially all of the net proceeds according to its investment
objective and policies within approximately one month after receipt of the proceeds, depending on the amount and timing of proceeds available to the Fund as well as the availability of investments consistent with the Fund’s investment objective
and strategies. Pending investment of the net proceeds, the Fund will invest in high-quality, short-term debt securities, cash and/or cash equivalents.  INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE, POLICIES AND RISKS 
When used in this prospectus, the term “invest” includes both direct investing and indirect investing and the term
“investments” includes both direct investments and indirect investments. For example, the Fund may invest indirectly by investing in derivatives or through one or more wholly-owned and controlled subsidiaries (each, a
“Subsidiary”). The Fund may be exposed to the different types of investments described below through its investments in its Subsidiaries. The allocation of the Fund’s portfolio in a Subsidiary will vary over time and might not always
include all of the different types of investments described herein.  INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE 
The Fund’s investment objective is to achieve total return and current income. There can be no assurance that the Fund will achieve
its investment objective.  POLICIES  Stone Ridge Asset Management LLC (“Stone Ridge” or the “Adviser”) believes that investing should involve a long-term view and a systematic focus on sources of expected return, not on
security selection or market timing. In managing the Fund, the Adviser focuses primarily on one source of expected returns: the “credit risk premium” in certain loans and other investments described below. The “credit risk
premium” is positive if interest payments paid in connection with a pool of such investments, minus the principal losses actually experienced across that pool, exceed the risk free rate, on average and over time. The “risk-free rate”
is the rate of return that can be earned on high-quality, short-term government debt securities. There can be no assurance that the credit risk premium will be positive for the Fund’s investments at any time or on average and over time. For
example, a consumer or small business borrower typically pays a premium (interest) to a lender in exchange for use of the lender’s capital (the amount of the borrowing) for a pre-determined amount of time. On average and over time, if payments
of interest and repayments of principal on such borrowings are greater than losses incurred from defaults, the excess positive return represents the credit premium. By investing in these loans and other investments, the Fund is accepting the risk
that some borrowers will not repay their loans, in exchange for the expected returns associated with the receipt of interest payments and repayment of principal by those that do. The Fund seeks to benefit over the long-term from the difference
between the amount of interest and principal received and losses experienced. 
  30 


The Adviser will not purchase or sell investments for the Fund’s portfolio based on
an analysis of specific borrowers’ abilities to repay their loans or other criteria specific to individual securities. Instead, the Adviser seeks to identify alternative lending platforms that originate pools of loans and other securities on an
ongoing basis that can be purchased by the Fund and serve as part of a portfolio that will provide the Fund with broad exposure to the risk and return characteristics (and potential credit risk premium) of loans from a variety of geographic regions
and representing a variety of different borrower types for a variety of loan purposes, including, but not limited to:   


 
•
 
 individual consumers consolidating existing debt or funding large purchases 
 


 
•
 
 small or medium-sized businesses funding working capital such as property, plant, equipment, expansion, receivables or inventory
  


 
•
 
 students financing education or refinancing existing student loans. 
The Fund has adopted the following investment restrictions as fundamental policies that can only be changed with the approval of the
holders of a majority of the Fund’s outstanding voting securities (the “Fundamental Investment Restrictions”):   


 
•
 
 The Fund may not invest in loans that are of subprime quality at the time of investment. 
 


 
•
 
 The Fund may not purchase loans or other alternative lending-related securities from platforms whose business consists primarily of originating
loans of subprime quality.   


 
•
 
 The Fund may not purchase loans or other alternative lending-related securities originated in emerging markets. 
 


 
•
 
 The Fund may not purchase loans or other alternative lending-related securities from platforms whose financial statements are not audited by a
nationally recognized accounting firm.  The Adviser, as part of its portfolio construction process,
performs diligence on the platforms from which the Fund purchases alternative lending-related securities in order to evaluate both the process by which each platform extends loans to borrowers and provides related services and the characteristics of
the overall portfolio of loans made available through that platform. The Adviser’s diligence process includes on-site in-person meetings, supplemented by telephonic meetings, with the senior management and with the credit underwriting,
operations, technology, legal and compliance teams of the platform; evaluation of the platform’s credit underwriting policies, procedures and models; evaluation of the platform’s collections, operations, technology, legal and compliance
personnel, infrastructure, and procedures; and analysis of a “loan tape” that includes loan underwriting data and actual payment experience for all individual loans made by the platform since inception that are comparable to the loans
proposed to be purchased by the Fund. The Fund generally purchases a portfolio of loans from a particular platform that meet certain criteria (such as maturities and durations, borrower and loan types, borrower credit quality and geographic
locations of borrower) and that provide broad exposure to that particular platform’s loan originations. The Fund will invest solely in loans originated by platforms that will provide the Fund with a written commitment to deliver or cause to be
delivered individual loan-level data on an ongoing basis throughout the life of each individual loan that is updated periodically as often as the NAV is calculated to reflect new information regarding the borrower or loan, and the Fund will not
invest in loans sold on platforms for which the Fund cannot evaluate to its satisfaction the completeness and accuracy of the individual loan data relevant to the existence and valuation of the loans purchased that is provided by the platform and
used by the Fund in accounting for loans. Although the Fund conducts diligence on the platforms, the Fund generally does not have the ability to independently verify the information provided by the platforms, other than payment information regarding
loans and other alternative lending-related securities owned by the Fund, which the Fund will observe directly as payments are received. The Fund generally will not have access to personally identifiable information about the individual borrowers
(e.g., names or similar identifying information) prior to purchasing loans or other alternative lending-related securities, although the Fund’s custodian will have this information for whole loans owned by the Fund (and the Fund and the
Adviser have 
  31 



established procedures with the Fund’s custodian designed to prevent the inadvertent communication of personally identifiable borrower information by the Fund’s custodian to the Fund or
the Adviser). The Fund will monitor the characteristics of the alternative lending-related securities purchased from particular platforms on an ongoing basis. In this way, the Adviser seeks to construct a portfolio that provides broad,
representative investment exposure across the alternative lending asset class.  The Fund may invest more than 25% of its total
assets in loans originated by Funding Circle Limited, an alternative lending platform operating in the United States, the United Kingdom and Continental Europe that makes small business loans, LendingClub Corporation, an alternative lending platform
operating in the United States that makes consumer loans, or SoFi Lending Corp., an alternative lending platform operating in the United States that makes consumer loans. However, there can be no assurance that the Fund will invest more than 25% of
its total assets in loans originated by any of these platforms, and if the Fund invests more than 25% of its total assets in loans originated by any of these platforms at any time, there can be no assurance that the Fund will remain invested in
loans originated by that platform in the future.  The Adviser will determine whether loans offered to the Fund are of subprime
quality at the time of investment pursuant to guidelines approved by the Board from time to time. These guidelines currently provide that in order to be eligible for purchase by the Fund, the Adviser must determine that loans have a likelihood of
repayment that is greater than that of “subprime” consumer loans. “Subprime” does not have a specific legal or market definition, but is understood in the credit marketplace to signify that a loan has a material likelihood that
it will not be repaid. The Adviser will make the determination that loans purchased by the Fund are not of subprime quality based on the Adviser’s due diligence of the credit underwriting policies of the originating platform, which look to a
number of borrower-specific factors to determine a borrower’s ability to repay a particular loan, including employments status, income, assets, education, and credit bureau data where available. Although credit bureau data is only one factor
considered in determining the credit quality of a borrower and a loan, when FICO data is available with respect to a borrower, the Adviser’s guidelines do not allow the Adviser to cause the Fund to purchase any consumer loan to an individual
whose FICO score is below 600 at the time of origination.  PRINCIPAL INVESTMENT POLICIES 
The Fund pursues its investment objective by investing primarily in alternative lending-related securities, either directly or through
one or more wholly-owned and controlled subsidiaries (each, a “Subsidiary”) formed by the Fund. These securities typically provide the Fund with exposure to loans originated by alternative lending platforms. The Fund will invest primarily
in whole loans, but also may invest, to a lesser extent, in other types of alternative lending-related securities, which include:   


 
•
 
 shares, certificates, notes or other securities representing the right to receive principal and interest payments due on fractions of whole loans or
pools of whole loans (including “member-dependent payment notes” issued by some public U.S. platforms, which we refer to as “fractional loans” herein) 
 


 
•
 
 securities issued by special purpose entities that hold either of the foregoing types of alternative lending-related securities (“asset-backed
securities”)   


 
•
 
 equity or debt securities (publicly or privately offered), including warrants, of alternative lending platforms or companies that own or operate
alternative lending platforms   


 
•
 
 derivative instruments (which may include options, swaps or other derivatives) that provide exposure to any of the investments the Fund may make
directly.  The Fund may gain exposure directly or indirectly to loans that are unsecured, secured by a
perfected security interest in an enterprise or specific assets of an enterprise or individual borrower, and/or supported by a personal guarantee by individuals related to the borrower. The loans to which the Fund will gain exposure may pay fixed or
variable rates of interest, may have a variety of amortization schedules, may include borrowings that do not require amortization payments (i.e., are interest-only), and may have a term ranging from less than one year to

  32 



thirty years or longer. This universe of investments is subject to change under varying market conditions and as alternative lending-related instruments and markets evolve over time. 
Under normal circumstances, the Fund will invest at least 80% of its net assets, plus the amount of any borrowings for investment
purposes, directly or indirectly in alternative lending-related securities. As a matter of fundamental policy, the Fund will concentrate its investments in the alternative lending industry. 
The Fund may seek to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange or interest rate risks that arise as a result of its investments. The Fund
may use forwards, futures, swaps or other listed or over-the-counter (“OTC”) derivatives or may purchase or sell physical currency, bonds or other securities, including short sales on assets the Fund does not own, which may require the
Fund to pay a premium to borrow the assets sold short and to pay the lender any dividends or interest received on the assets while borrowed. There can be no guarantee the Fund’s hedging activities will effectively offset any adverse impact of
foreign exchange or interest rates.  In implementing the Fund’s investment strategy, the Adviser has broad discretion
to invest in alternative lending-related securities of different types and relating to a variety of borrower types and geographic regions (including regions inside and outside the U.S.), subject to the Fundamental Investment Restrictions, which
prohibit the Fund from investing in loans of subprime quality or loans originated in emerging markets. Initially, the Adviser expects to seek to invest in alternative lending-related securities through platforms that operate in (and that originate
loans to borrowers located in) the U.S., Europe, Australia and New Zealand and may in the future seek to gain exposure to other geographic regions, other than emerging markets. Within each region and borrower type, the Adviser has broad discretion
to invest in securities that provide the Fund with a variety of exposures, including to borrower creditworthiness, lines of business and loan purpose. Subject to any restrictions under applicable law (including diversification requirements under
U.S. federal income tax law applicable to regulated investment companies), the Fund is not restricted in its exposure to any particular borrower creditworthiness, line of business, loan purpose, term or form of security or guarantee or any other
loan terms or characteristics, except as provided in the Fundamental Investment Restrictions. There is no stated limit on the percentage of assets the Fund can invest in a particular investment or the percentage of assets the Fund will allocate to
any one loan type, borrower type, loan purpose, geographic region, borrower creditworthiness, term or form of security or guarantee permitted by the Fundamental Investment Restrictions. The Fund may, at times, focus its investments in instruments
meeting one or more of these criteria. The Fund intends to concentrate its investments in the alternative lending industry and, as a matter of fundamental policy, the Fund will invest, directly or indirectly, at least 25% of its total assets in the
alternative lending industry.  The Fund may make investments in alternative lending-related securities directly or
indirectly through one or more Subsidiaries. Each Subsidiary may invest, for example, in whole loans or in shares, certificates, notes or other securities representing the right to receive principal and interest payments due on fractions of whole
loans or pools of whole loans, or any other security that the Fund may hold directly. References herein to the Fund include references to a Subsidiary in respect of the Fund’s exposure to alternative lending-related securities. 
In addition, the Fund may directly or indirectly invest in and/or sell certain of its alternative lending-related investments to special
purpose entities formed by third parties for the purpose of acquiring alternative lending-related investments and issuing securities, the payments on which are funded by payments received on such entities’ underlying investments. Such
asset-backed securities may be issued in different tranches of debt and equity interests with different rights and preferences. The Fund may hold any tranche of such asset-backed securities. 
There is generally a limited secondary market available for many of the securities in which the Fund will invest and, as a result, the
Fund generally will hold investments to maturity. As described below, the Fund may sell certain of its investments to securitization vehicles, and, to the extent a more active secondary market develops over time, the Fund may selectively purchase or
sell loans in executing its investment strategy.  Leverage 
The Fund may obtain leverage in seeking to achieve its investment objective. The Fund or a Subsidiary of the Fund may obtain financing to
make investments in alternative lending-related securities. The Fund expects that 
  33 



borrowings by the Fund or a Fund’s Subsidiary will be secured by alternative lending-related securities held by the Fund or such Subsidiary. The Fund may also obtain leverage through
derivative instruments that afford the Fund economic leverage or other investments, such as asset-backed securities, that may have embedded leverage. The Fund is not limited in the form or manner in which it may incur leverage. 
The Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”), requires a closed-end fund to maintain asset coverage of not
less than 300% of the value of the outstanding amount of senior securities representing indebtedness (as defined in the 1940 Act). This means that the value of the Fund’s senior securities representing indebtedness may not exceed one-third of
the value of its total assets (including such senior securities), measured at the time the Fund issues the senior securities. Investments or trading practices that involve contractual obligations to pay in the future are subject to the same
requirements unless the Fund designates liquid assets in an amount the Fund believes to be equal to the Fund’s contractual obligations (marked-to-market on a daily basis) or appropriately “covers” such obligations with offsetting
positions.  Leverage can have the effect of magnifying the Fund’s exposure to changes in the value of its assets and may
also result in increased volatility in the Fund’s NAV. This means the Fund will have the potential for greater gains, as well as the potential for greater losses, than if the Fund owned its assets on an unleveraged basis. The value of an
investment in the Fund will be more volatile and other risks tend to be compounded if and to the extent that the Fund is exposed to leverage directly or indirectly.  Alternative Lending  Alternative lending, which is sometimes referred
to as peer-to-peer lending, online lending or marketplace lending, is a method of financing in which an alternative lending platform facilitates the borrowing and lending of money while generally not relying on deposits for capital to fund loans. It
is considered an alternative to more traditional debt financing done through a bank. There are several different models of alternative lending but, very generally, a platform typically matches consumers, small or medium-sized businesses or other
types of borrowers with investors that are interested in gaining investment exposure to the loans made to such borrowers. Prospective borrowers are usually required to provide or give access to certain financial information to the platform, such as
the intended purpose of the loan, income, employment information, credit score, debt-to-income ratio, credit history (including defaults and delinquencies) and home ownership status, and, in the case of small business loans, business financial
statements and personal credit information regarding any guarantor, some of which information is made available to prospective lenders. Often, platforms charge fees to borrowers to cover these screening and administrative costs. Based on this and
other relevant supplemental information, the platform usually assigns its own credit rating to the borrower and sets the interest rate for the requested borrowing. Platforms then post the borrowing requests online and investors may choose among the
loans, based on the interest rates the loans are expected to yield less any servicing or origination fees charged by the platform or others involved in the lending arrangement, the background data provided on the borrowers and the credit rating
assigned by the platform. In some cases, a platform partners with a bank to originate a loan to a borrower, after which the bank sells the loan to the platform; alternatively, some platforms may originate loans themselves. Some investors, including
the Fund, may not review the particular characteristics of the loans in which they invest at the time of investment, but rather negotiate in advance with platforms the general criteria of the investments, as described above. As a result, the Fund is
dependent on the platforms’ ability to collect, verify and provide information to the Fund about each loan and borrower.  Platforms may set minimum eligibility standards for borrowers to participate in alternative lending arrangements and may limit the maximum permitted borrowings. Depending on the purpose and nature of the
loan, its term may, for example, be as short as six months or shorter, or as long as thirty years or longer. Set forth below is additional information about some of the Fund’s alternative lending-related investments. 
Whole Loans. The Fund will invest primarily in whole loans. When the Fund invests directly or indirectly in whole loans, it will
typically purchase all rights, title and interest in the loans pursuant to a loan purchase agreement directly from the platform or its affiliate. The platform or a third-party servicer typically continues to

  34 



service the loans, collecting payments and distributing them to investors, less any servicing fees assessed against the Fund, and the servicing entity typically will make all decisions regarding
acceleration or enforcement of the loans following any default by a borrower. The Fund expects to have a backup servicer in case any platform or affiliate of the platform ceases or fails to perform these servicing functions. The Fund, as an investor
in a whole loan, would be entitled to receive payment only from the borrower and/or any guarantor, and would not be able to recover any deficiency from the platform, except under very narrow circumstances, which may include fraud by the borrower in
some cases. As described above, the whole loans in which the Fund may invest may be secured or unsecured.  Shares,
Certificates, Notes or Other Securities. The Fund may also invest directly or indirectly in shares, certificates, notes or other securities representing the right to receive principal and interest payments due on fractions of whole loans or
pools of whole loans. The platform or a separate special purpose entity organized by or on behalf of the platform may hold the whole loans underlying such securities on its books and issue to the Fund, as an investor, a share, certificate, note or
other security, the payments on which track and depend upon the borrower payments on the underlying loans. As with whole loans, the platforms or third-party servicers typically continue to service the underlying loans on which the performance of
such securities is based. Such securities may be linked to any of the types of whole loans in which the Fund may invest directly. Such securities may also track fractions of a whole loan. These securities may be sold through publicly registered
offerings or through unregistered private offerings.  Equity Securities. The Fund may invest directly or indirectly
in public or private equity securities issued by alternative lending platforms or companies that own or operate alternative lending platforms, including common stock, preferred stock, convertible stock and/or warrants. For example, the Fund may
invest in securities issued by a platform, which may provide the platform with the capital it requires to support its business. Equity investments may afford the Fund voting rights as well as the opportunity to receive dividends and/or capital
appreciation, although warrants, which are options to purchase equity securities at specific prices valid for a specific period of time, typically have no voting rights, receive no dividends and have no rights with respect to the securities of the
issuer unless and until they are exercised for the underlying equity securities. The Fund may also invest directly or indirectly in equity securities of both foreign and U.S. small and mid-cap companies. These equity investments may take any of the
following forms:   


 
•
 
 Common Stock. Holders of common stock generally have voting rights in the issuer and are entitled to receive common stock dividends when, as
and if declared by the corporation’s board of directors. Common stock normally occupies the most subordinated position in an issuer’s capital structure 
 


 
•
 
 Preferred Stocks. Preferred stock, unlike common stock, has a stated dividend rate payable from the corporation’s earnings. Preferred
stock dividends may be cumulative or non-cumulative, participating, or auction rate. “Cumulative” dividend provisions require all or a portion of prior unpaid dividends to be paid. Preferred stock may be “participating” stock,
which means that it may be entitled to a dividend exceeding the stated dividend in certain cases. Preferred stock may have mandatory sinking fund provisions, as well as provisions allowing calls or redemption prior to maturity, which also can have a
negative impact on prices when interest rates decline.   


 
•
 
 Rights and Warrants. Warrants are options to purchase equity securities at specific prices valid for a specific period of time. Their values
do not necessarily move parallel to the values of the underlying securities. Rights are similar to warrants, but normally have a short duration and are distributed directly by the issuer to its shareholders. Rights and warrants have no voting
rights, receive no dividends and have no rights with respect to the assets of the issuer.   


 
•
 
 Convertible Securities. Convertible securities are debt securities or preferred stock that may be converted in whole or in part into common
stock or other equity securities. Their prices do not necessarily move parallel to the prices of the underlying securities. Convertible securities generally have no voting rights. The value of a convertible security is a function of its “bond
value,” which is the value of the debt or preferred stock component of the security, and its “conversion value,” which is the value of the right to convert the securities into common stock or other equity securities. The bond value

  35 




 
 
will likely increase when interest rates fall and decrease when interest rates rise, and the conversion value will likely increase when the value of the underlying equity security increases and
decrease when the value of the underlying equity security decreases. If the bond value is relatively high compared to the conversion value, the security will behave more like a debt security, and if the conversion value is relatively high compared
to the bond value, the security will behave more like an equity security.  Other factors can affect a
particular equity security’s price, such as poor earnings reports by the issuer, loss of major customers, major litigation against the issuer, or changes in government regulations affecting the issuer or its industry. 
Debt Securities. The Fund may invest directly or indirectly in debt securities issued by alternative lending platforms or
companies that own or operate alternative lending platforms. The Fund may have exposure to the debt securities of U.S. or foreign issuers. These debt securities may have fixed or floating interest rates; may or may not be collateralized; and may be
below investment grade or unrated but judged by the Adviser to be of comparable quality (debt securities that are below investment grade are commonly called “junk bonds”). The Fund has no limits as to the maturity of debt securities in
which it invests directly or indirectly. Such investments may be within any maturity range (short, medium or long) depending on the Adviser’s evaluation of investment opportunities available within the debt securities market. Similarly, the
Fund has no limits as to the market capitalization range of the issuers.  Asset-Backed Securities. The Fund may invest
in securitization vehicles that issue asset-backed securities, which are debt securities backed by, or residual equity interests in, pools of alternative lending-related debt securities. Such a securitization vehicle may be formed by a platform, a
pooled investment vehicle or any other entity.  Changes to the Fund’s Investment Policies 
The Fund’s investment objective and policies may be changed without shareholder approval unless an objective or policy is identified
in the prospectus or in the Statement of Additional Information as “fundamental.” The Fund’s policy to invest, under normal circumstances, at least 80% of its net assets, plus the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes, in
alternative lending-related securities may be changed by the Board upon at least 60 days prior written notice to shareholders.  Temporary
Defensive Positions  During unusual market conditions, the Fund may invest up to 100% of its assets in cash or cash
equivalents temporarily, which may be inconsistent with its investment objective and other policies. The Fund might not use all of the strategies and techniques or invest in all of the types of securities described in this prospectus or the
Statement of Additional Information. While at times the Fund may use alternative investment strategies in an effort to limit its losses, it may choose not to do so.  Subsidiaries  The Fund may execute its strategy by investing directly or
through one or more Subsidiaries in alternative lending-related securities. The Fund does not currently intend to sell or transfer all or any portion of its ownership interest in a Subsidiary. The Fund reserves the right to establish additional
Subsidiaries through which the Fund may execute its strategy.  RISK CONSIDERATIONS 
Investors should carefully consider the Fund’s risks and investment objective, as an investment in the Fund may not be
appropriate for all investors and is not designed to be a complete investment program. An investment in the Fund involves a high degree of risk. It is possible that investing in the Fund may result in a loss of some or all of the amount invested.
Before making an investment/allocation decision, investors should (i) consider the suitability of this investment with respect to an investor’s or a client’s investment objectives

  36 



and individual situation and (ii) consider factors such as an investor’s or a client’s net worth, income, age and risk tolerance. Investment should be avoided where an
investor/client has a short-term investing horizon and/or cannot bear the loss of some or all of the investment.  The
Fund is subject to the principal risks noted below, whether through the Fund’s direct investments, investments through a Subsidiary or derivatives positions. As with any investment company, there is no guarantee that the Fund will achieve its
investment objective. You could lose all or part of your investment in the Fund, and the Fund could underperform other investments. 
Default Risk  The value
of the Fund’s investments in whole loans and other alternative lending-related securities, such as shares, certificates, notes or other securities representing an interest in and the right to receive principal and interest payments due on whole
loans or fractions of whole loans, is entirely dependent on the borrowers’ continued and timely payments. The Fund receives payments on such investments only if the party servicing the loans receives the borrower’s payments on the
corresponding or underlying loan and passes such payments through to the Fund. If a borrower fails to make interest payments or repay principal when due on a loan in which the Fund has investment exposure, or if the value of such a loan decreases,
the value of the Fund’s investments will be adversely affected. There can be no assurance that payments due on underlying loans will be made.  If a borrower is unable or fails to make payments on a loan for any reason, the Fund may be greatly limited in its ability to recover any outstanding principal or interest due, as (among other reasons)
the Fund may not have direct recourse against the borrower or may otherwise be limited in its ability to directly enforce its rights under the loan, whether through the borrower or the platform through which such loan was originated, the loan may be
unsecured or under-collateralized and/or it may be impracticable to commence a legal proceeding against the defaulting borrower. If the Fund were unable to recover unpaid principal or interest due, this would cause the Fund’s net asset value to
decrease. As described further under “Risks of Unsecured Loans,” the Fund generally will not be able to offset losses on defaulting loans by looking to collateral or obligations of guarantors, insurers or governmental authorities, as many
of the loans to which the Fund will have exposure are obligations not secured by collateral or (except for certain loans to businesses) backed by any guarantee. In certain cases, after the loan has matured, the servicing party may have no obligation
to make late payments to investors in such loan and, to the extent that the servicing party receives any funds from defaulting borrowers, the servicing party may retain those funds to cover attorneys’ fees, collection fees or other costs
incurred in pursuing collection, which will diminish or eliminate the amount that the servicing party would otherwise pass on to the investor.  Borrowings obtained through alternative lending platforms may not limit borrowers from incurring additional debt. If a borrower incurs additional debt obligations after obtaining a loan through an
alternative lending platform, the borrower’s creditworthiness may diminish and any additional obligations could cause the borrower to experience financial distress, insolvency or bankruptcy, all of which would impair the borrower’s ability
to repay the loan underlying the Fund’s investment. Under certain circumstances, payments to the Fund may be reclaimed in a bankruptcy proceeding if any such payment or distribution is later determined to have been a fraudulent conveyance or a
preferential payment, which will result in losses to the Fund. If the additional debt obligation of the borrower is secured by collateral and the borrowing through the alternative lending platform is unsecured, the borrower may be motivated to repay
the secured loan before meeting its obligations under the unsecured loan.  Furthermore, the ability of secured creditors to
pursue remedies against the collateral of the borrower may impair the borrower’s ability to repay its unsecured loan or it may impair the platform’s or loan servicer’s ability to collect on the loan upon default. The loans in which
the Fund invests generally will not include any cross-default provisions. Cross-default provisions render a default on one outstanding debt obligation an automatic default on another debt obligation of the borrower, which permits creditors to react
more quickly to take steps to protect their interests. In contrast, the loans in which the Fund will invest typically will be placed in default or referred to collection only if there are independent defaults on such loans, irrespective of whether
the borrower has defaulted 
  37 



on a different debt obligation. Not only will the Fund not benefit from such protective provisions, the Fund also generally will not be made aware of any additional debt incurred by a borrower or
whether such debt is secured or unsecured.  Default rates on loans obtained through alternative lending platforms may be
adversely affected by a number of factors outside the Fund’s control, such as economic downturns or general economic or political conditions, including prevailing interest rates, the rate of unemployment, the level of consumer confidence,
residential real estate values, the value of the various currencies, energy prices, changes in consumer spending, the number of personal bankruptcies, insolvencies, disruptions in the credit markets, the borrower’s personal circumstances and
other factors.  The default history for alternative lending borrowing arrangements is limited. Future defaults may be higher
than historical defaults and the timing of defaults may vary significantly from historical observations. As described further under “Credit/Counterparty Risk,” the credit profile and interest rates available to certain borrowers who seek
credit through alternative lending platforms may result in a higher rate of default for alternative lending-related securities as compared with the debt instruments associated with more traditional lending models, such as banks, although pursuant to
the Fundamental Investment Restrictions, the Fund will not invest in loans of subprime quality. If the impact of defaults on loans to which the Fund has exposure exceeds the profits on non-defaulting loans, the Fund will be unable to achieve its
investment objective.  The Fund’s investments in equity securities issued by the platforms themselves (or their
affiliates) are also subject to the risk of loss. If a platform defaults on its outstanding obligations, the Fund’s equity interest in the platform may be diminished or extinguished and the Fund can expect to realize on any such investments
only to the extent that the platform’s creditors are made whole and the platform still has residual profits that would benefit equity holders.  Risk of Unsecured Loans  Many of the Fund’s investments are
associated with loans that are unsecured obligations of borrowers. This means that they are not secured by any collateral, not insured by any third party, not backed by any governmental authority in any way and, except in the case of certain loans
to businesses, not guaranteed by any third party. When a borrower defaults on an unsecured loan, the holder’s only recourse is generally to accelerate the loan and enter into litigation to recover the outstanding principal and interest. There
is no assurance that such litigation would result in full repayment of the loan and the costs of such measures may frequently exceed the outstanding unpaid amount of the borrowing. The Fund generally will need to rely on the efforts of the
platforms, servicers or their designated collection agencies to collect on defaulted loans and there is no guarantee that such parties will be successful in their efforts to collect on loans. The Fund typically will not know the identity of
borrowers and will contract with the platforms or third-party loan servicers to service the loans and, therefore, does not expect to (and in many cases will have no way to) pursue borrowers that fail to repay principal or interest. In addition, the
Fund’s investments in shares, certificates, notes or other securities representing an interest in a special purpose entity organized by an alternative lending platform and the right to receive principal and interest payments due on whole loans
or fractions of whole loans owned by such entity are typically unsecured obligations of the issuer. As a result, the Fund generally may not look to the underlying loans to satisfy delinquent payments on such interests, even though payments on such
interests depend entirely on payments by underlying borrowers on their loans.  Risk of Inadequate Collateral or Guarantees on Loans
 Even if a loan in which the Fund has investment exposure is secured, there can be no assurance that the collateral will,
when recovered and liquidated, generate sufficient (or any) funds to offset any losses associated with the defaulting loan. It is possible that the same collateral could secure multiple loans, in which case the liquidation proceeds of the collateral
may be insufficient to cover the payments due on all the loans secured by that collateral. There can be no guarantee that the collateral can be liquidated and any costs associated with such 
  38 



liquidation could reduce or eliminate the amount of funds otherwise available to offset the payments due under the loan. As described further under “Risks of Unsecured Loans,” the Fund
generally will need to rely on the efforts of the platforms, servicers or their designated collection agencies to collect on defaulted loans and there is no guarantee that such parties will be successful in their efforts to collect on loans. To the
extent that the loan obligations in which the Fund directly or indirectly invests are guaranteed by a third party, there can be no assurance that the guarantor will perform its payment obligations should the underlying borrower default on its
payments. As described under “Default Risk,” the Fund could suffer delays or limitations on its ability to realize the benefits of the collateral to the extent the borrower becomes bankrupt or insolvent. Moreover, the Fund’s security
interests may be unperfected for a variety of reasons, including the failure to make a required filing by the servicer and, as a result, the Fund may not have priority over other creditors as it expected. 
Asset-Backed Securities Risk  The Fund’s investments in securitization vehicles or other special purpose entities that hold alternative lending-related securities (asset-backed securities) may involve risks that differ from or
are greater than risks associated with other types of investments. For example, such asset-backed securities may be more sensitive to changes in prevailing interest rates than other securities. In addition, prepayment on the underlying assets may
have the effect of shortening the weighted average maturity of the portfolio assets of such entities and may lower their return. The asset-backed securities in which the Fund invests are also subject to risks associated with their structure and the
nature of the underlying assets and the servicing of those assets; for this reason, many of the other risks described herein are relevant to the asset-backed securities to which the Fund will have exposure. There is risk that the underlying debt
securities will default and that recovery on repossessed collateral might be unavailable or inadequate to support payments on the underlying investments. Payment of interest and repayment of principal on asset-backed securities, as well as the
return associated with an equity investment in an asset-backed security, is largely dependent upon the cash flows generated by the underlying loans or other assets backing the securities. The risks and returns for investors like the Fund in
asset-backed securities depend on the tranche in which the investor holds an interest. The debt tranche(s) are entitled to receive payment before the equity if the cash flow generated by the underlying assets is insufficient to allow the vehicle to
make payments on all of the tranches. The debt tranche(s), therefore, may receive higher credit ratings (if rated) and the equity tranche may be considered more speculative. Many asset-backed securities in which the Fund invests may be difficult to
value and may be deemed illiquid. Asset-backed securities may have the effect of magnifying the Fund’s exposure to changes in the value of the underlying assets and may also result in increased volatility in the Fund’s NAV. This means the
Fund may have the potential for greater gains, as well as the potential for greater losses, than if the Fund owned the underlying asset directly. The value of an investment in the Fund may be more volatile and other risks tend to be compounded if
and to the extent that the Fund is exposed to asset-backed securities directly or indirectly. In the event that the market for asset-backed securities experiences high volatility and a lack of liquidity, the value of many of asset-backed securities
may decline. Any mishandling of related documentation by a servicer may also affect the rights of the security holders in and to the underlying collateral.  Credit/Counterparty Risk  The value of a debt security depends on the
issuer’s credit quality or ability to pay principal and interest when due. The securities in which the Fund may invest may have varying degrees of credit risk and, subject to the Fundamental Investment Restrictions, which, among other things,
prohibit the Fund from investing in loans of subprime quality, the Fund will not be restricted by any borrower credit criteria or credit risk limitation. The value of a debt security is likely to fall if an issuer or the guarantor of a security is
unable or unwilling (or perceived to be unable or unwilling) to make timely principal and/or interest payments or otherwise to honor its obligations or if the debt security’s rating is downgraded. The obligations of issuers are subject to
bankruptcy, insolvency and other laws affecting the rights and remedies of creditors. The value of a debt security can also decline in response to other changes in market, economic, industry, political and regulatory conditions that affect a
particular type of debt security or issuer or debt securities generally, such as conditions in the alternative lending market. The values of many debt securities may fall in response to a general increase in investor risk aversion or a decline in
the confidence of investors generally in the ability of issuers to meet their obligations. 
  39 


Unlike other debt instruments that are rated by nationally recognized statistical rating
organizations, the alternative lending-related securities in which the Fund invests are typically unrated or rated only by the platform. Platforms may evaluate prospective borrowers by looking to a number of factors, including the borrower’s
credit history and/or credit score as reported by one or more third-party credit reporting agencies. The Fund will rely on the borrower’s credit information, which is provided by the platforms. However, as described under “Default
Risk,” such information may be out of date, incomplete or inaccurate and may, therefore, not accurately reflect the borrower’s actual creditworthiness. Platforms may not have an obligation to update borrower information, and, therefore,
the Fund may not be aware of any impairment in a borrower’s creditworthiness subsequent to the making of a particular loan.  Although the Fund conducts diligence on the credit scoring methodology used by platforms from which the Fund purchases alternative lending-related securities, the Fund typically will not have access to
all of the data that platforms utilize to assign credit scores to particular loans purchased directly or indirectly by the Fund, and will not independently diligence or confirm the truthfulness of such information or otherwise evaluate the basis for
the platform’s credit score of those loans. As a result, the Fund may make investments based on outdated, inaccurate or incomplete information. In addition, the platforms’ credit decisions and scoring models are based on algorithms that
could potentially contain programming or other errors or prove to be ineffective or otherwise flawed. This could adversely affect loan pricing data and approval processes and could cause loans to be mispriced or misclassified, which could ultimately
have a negative impact on the Fund’s performance.  Platform Risk 
As discussed in more detail in “Default Risk” and “Risk of Unsecured Loans,” the Fund receives payments on whole
loans or securities representing the right to receive principal and interest payments due on loans only if the platform servicing the loans receives the borrower’s payments on such loans and passes such payments through to the Fund. If a
borrower is unable or fails to make payments on a loan for any reason, the Fund may be greatly limited in its ability to recover any outstanding principal or interest due, as (among other reasons) the Fund may not have direct recourse against the
borrower or may otherwise be limited in its ability to directly enforce its rights under the loan, whether through the borrower or the platform through which such loan was originated, the loan may be unsecured or under-collateralized and/or it may
be impracticable to commence a legal proceeding against the defaulting borrower.  The Fund may have limited knowledge about
the underlying loans and will be dependent upon the platform for information regarding underlying loans. Although the Fund conducts diligence on the platforms, the Fund generally does not have the ability to independently verify the information
provided by the platforms, other than payment information regarding loans and other alternative lending-related securities owned by the Fund, which the Fund will observe directly as payments are received. Some investors, including the Fund, may not
review the particular characteristics of the loans in which they invest at the time of investment, but rather negotiate in advance with platforms the general criteria of the investments, as described above. As a result, the Fund is dependent on the
platforms’ ability to collect, verify and provide information to the Fund about each loan and borrower.  The Fund will
rely on the borrower’s credit information, which is provided by the platforms. However, as described under “Default Risk,” such information may be out of date, incomplete or inaccurate and may, therefore, not accurately reflect the
borrower’s actual creditworthiness. Platforms may not have an obligation to update borrower information, and, therefore, the Fund may not be aware of any impairment in a borrower’s creditworthiness subsequent to the making of a particular
loan. Although the Fund conducts diligence on the credit scoring methodology used by platforms from which the Fund purchases alternative lending-related securities, the Fund typically will not have access to all of the data that platforms utilize to
assign credit scores to particular loans purchased directly or indirectly by the Fund, and will not independently diligence or confirm the truthfulness of such information or otherwise evaluate the basis for the platform’s credit score of those
loans. As a result, the Fund may make investments based on outdated, inaccurate or incomplete information. In addition, the platforms’ credit decisions and scoring models are based on algorithms that could potentially contain

  40 



programming or other errors or prove to be ineffective or otherwise flawed. This could adversely affect loan pricing data and approval processes and could cause loans to be mispriced or
misclassified, which could ultimately have a negative impact on the Fund’s performance.  In addition, the underlying
loans, in some cases, may be affected by the success of the platforms through which they are facilitated. Therefore, disruptions in the businesses of such platforms may also negatively impact the value of the Fund’s investments. In addition,
disruption in the business of a platform could limit or eliminate the ability of the Fund to invest in loans originated by that platform, and therefore the Fund could lose some or all of the benefit of its diligence effort with respect to that
platform.  The Fund may also invest directly or indirectly in public or private equity securities of alternative lending
platforms or enter into other financial transactions, including derivative transactions, to gain exposure to such investments. The performance of equity instruments issued by a platform or derivatives thereon will depend on the success of the
platform’s business and operations. As described above, the Fund may also invest in shares, certificates, notes or other securities representing the right to receive principal and interest payments due on fractions of whole loans or pools of
whole loans.  Platforms are for-profit businesses that, as a general matter, generate revenue by collecting fees on
funded loans from borrowers and by assessing a loan servicing fee on investors, which may be a fixed annual amount or a percentage of the loan or amounts collected. This business could be disrupted in multiple ways; for example, a platform could
file for bankruptcy or a platform might suffer reputational harm from negative publicity about the platform or alternative lending more generally and the loss of investor confidence in the event that a loan facilitated through the platform is not
repaid and the investor loses money on its investment. Many platforms and/or their affiliates have incurred operating losses since their inception and may continue to incur net losses in the future, particularly as their businesses grow and they
incur additional operating expenses.  The Fund’s investments could be adversely impacted if a platform that services the
Fund’s investments becomes unable or unwilling to fulfill its obligations to do so. In order to mitigate this risk, the Fund would seek to rely on a backup servicer provided through the platform or through an unaffiliated backup servicer. To
the extent that it is not possible to collect on defaulted loans or to the extent borrowers prepay loans, a platform that services loans may no longer be able to collect a servicing fee, which would negatively impact its business operations. These
or other similar negative events could adversely affect the platforms’ businesses and/or investor participation in a platform’s marketplace and, in turn, the business of the platforms, which creates a risk of loss for the Fund’s
investments in securities issued by a platform or derivatives thereon.  Platforms may have a higher risk profile than
companies engaged in lines of business with a longer, more established operating history and such investments should be viewed as longer-term investments. Alternative lending is a relatively new lending method and alternative lending platforms have
relatively limited operating histories. They have met with and will continue to meet with challenges, including navigating evolving regulatory and competitive environments; increasing the number of borrowers and investors utilizing their
marketplace; increasing the volume of loans facilitated through their marketplace and transaction fees received for matching borrowers and investors through their marketplace; entering into new markets and introducing new loan products; continuing
to revise the marketplace’s proprietary credit decisions and scoring models; continuing to develop, maintain and scale their platforms; effectively maintaining and scaling financial and risk management controls and procedures; maintaining the
security of the platform and the confidentiality of the information provided and utilized across the platform; and attracting, integrating and retaining an appropriate number of qualified employees. A platform may enter into various business
transactions, including mergers or acquisitions, which could require significant managerial attention, disrupt business and adversely affect its financial results. Platforms are subject to risk of litigation and any such litigation may be costly to
defend and distracting to management. If platforms are not successful in addressing these issues, the platforms’ businesses and their results of operations may be harmed, which may reduce the possible available investments for the Fund or
negatively impact the value of the Fund’s investments in platforms or in alternative lending-related securities more generally. 
  41 


Certain platforms may work with banks in order to originate loans to borrowers and may rely
on such banks to satisfy certain legal and/or regulatory requirements. If an originating bank suspended, limited or ceased its operations, if the bank’s relationship with the platform were terminated for any reason or if the bank’s ability
or willingness to continue to serve this function on the current or equivalent terms were in any way curtailed, the impacted platform would need to negotiate and implement a substantially similar arrangement with another bank, satisfy any regulatory
or licensing requirements with respect to the new bank or seek other solutions. There can be no assurances that the platform in this type of situation would not be forced to curtail or suspend its operations. Platforms may have limited or no prior
experience with transitioning loan originations to a new funding bank and the process may result in delays in the issuance of loans, a platform’s inability to facilitate loans or other unforeseeable consequences. If a platform is unable to
enter in an alternative arrangement with a different funding bank, the platform would need to obtain its own license in order to enable it to originate loans, as well as comply with other laws, which would be costly and time-consuming. In the U.S.,
this would entail, at minimum, obtaining a license in each state in which the platform operates. Platforms operating in other jurisdictions would be subject to the regulatory requirements of those jurisdictions, which may be burdensome and costly.
If a platform is unsuccessful in maintaining its relationships with the funding banks, its ability to provide loan products could be materially impaired and its operating results would suffer. The Fund relies on the continued success of the
platforms that facilitate the loans in which the Fund invests. If such platforms were impaired in their ability to operate their lending business, the Adviser may be required to seek alternative sources of investments, which could adversely affect
the Fund’s performance and/or prevent the Fund from pursuing its investment objective and strategies.  Platforms may rely
on debt facilities and other forms of borrowing in order to finance many of the borrower loans they facilitate. However, these financing sources may become unavailable after their current maturity dates or the terms may become less favorable to the
borrowing platforms. As the volume of loans that a platform facilitates increases, the platform may need to expand its borrowing capacity on its existing debt arrangements or may need to seek new sources of capital. The availability of such
financing depends on multiple factors, some of which are outside of the platform’s control. Platforms may also default on or breach their existing debt agreements, which could diminish or eliminate their access to funding at all or on terms
acceptable to the platforms. Such events could cause the Fund to incur losses on its investments that are dependent upon the performance of the platforms.  As discussed under “Alternative Lending Operational and Technology Risk,” platforms are subject to various risks relating to the extensive use of information technology. 
As discussed under “Regulatory Risk,” platforms may also be forced to defend legal action taken by regulators or governmental
bodies. Alternative lending is a new industry operating in an evolving legal environment. Platforms may be subject to risk of litigation alleging violations of law and/or regulations, including, for example, consumer protection laws, whether in the
U.S. or in foreign jurisdictions. Platforms may be unsuccessful in defending against such lawsuits or other actions and, in addition to the costs incurred in fighting any such actions, platforms may be required to pay money in connection with the
judgments, settlements or fines or may be forced to modify the terms of its borrower loans, which could cause the platform to realize a loss or receive a lower return on a loan than originally anticipated. Platforms may also be parties to litigation
or other legal action in an attempt to protect or enforce their rights or those of affiliates, including intellectual property rights, and may incur similar costs in connection with any such efforts. A platform may rely on data centers or
third-party service providers or vendors to deliver its services. Any disruption of the businesses of such third parties, which may be subject to all of the foregoing risks, could similarly impede the platform’s business and operations or could
interrupt or delay a platform’s ability to deliver on its obligations.  The Fund’s investments in the equity
securities of platforms, including common stock, preferred stock, warrants or convertible stock, are subject to equity securities risk. Equity securities risk is the risk that the value of equity securities to which the Fund is exposed will fall due
to general market or economic conditions; overall market changes; local, regional or global political, social or economic instability; currency, interest rate and commodity 
  42 



price fluctuations; perceptions regarding the industries in which the issuers participate and the particular circumstances and performance of the issuers. Market conditions may affect certain
types of equity securities to a greater extent than other types; for example, equity securities of issuers in new or emerging industries may be more susceptible to market conditions and may experience volatility in returns. Equities to which the
Fund may be exposed are structurally subordinated to bonds and other debt instruments in a company’s capital structure, in terms of priority to corporate income and, therefore, will be subject to greater risk than debt instruments of such
issuers. The prices of equities are also sensitive to rising interest rates, as the costs of capital rise and borrowing costs increase. The equity securities of smaller, less seasoned companies, such as platforms or their affiliates, are generally
subject to greater price fluctuations, limited liquidity, higher transaction costs and higher investment risk. Smaller companies may have limited product lines, markets or financial resources, may be dependent on a limited management group and may
lack substantial capital reserves or an established performance record. There may be generally less publicly available information about such companies than for larger, more established companies. To the extent that the Fund invests in unlisted
equity securities, the investments generally will involve a higher degree of valuation and performance uncertainty and greater liquidity risk than investments in listed securities. Such issuers tend to be more susceptible to the actions of
competitors and market conditions, including general economic downturns; often operate at a financial loss; are more likely to depend on small numbers of key management persons such that the departure of any such persons could have a material
adverse impact on the business and prospects of the company; and generally have less predictable operating results. Investments that are unlisted at the time of acquisition may remain unlisted and may, therefore, be difficult to value and/or
realize. Preferred securities may pay fixed or adjustable rates of return. Preferred securities are subject to issuer-specific and market risks applicable generally to equity securities. In addition, preferred securities generally pay a dividend and
rank ahead of common stocks and behind debt securities in claims for dividends and for assets of the issuer in a liquidation or bankruptcy. For this reason, the value of preferred securities will usually react more strongly than bonds and other debt
to actual or perceived changes in the company’s financial condition or prospects. Preferred securities may also be sensitive to changes in interest rates. When interest rates rise, the fixed dividend on preferred securities may be less
attractive, causing the price of preferred stocks to decline. Preferred securities of smaller companies may be more vulnerable to adverse developments than preferred stock of larger companies. Warrants are options to purchase equity securities at
specific prices valid for a specific period of time. Their prices do not necessarily move parallel to the prices of the underlying securities. Convertible securities are subject to the risks applicable generally to debt securities, including credit
risk. Convertible securities also react to changes in the value of the common stock into which they convert, and are thus subject to market risk. Because the value of a convertible security can be influenced by both interest rates and the common
stock’s market movements, a convertible security generally is not as sensitive to interest rates as a similar debt security, and generally will not vary in value in response to other factors to the same extent as the underlying common stock. In
the event of a liquidation of the issuing company, holders of convertible securities typically would be paid before the company’s common stockholders but after holders of any senior debt obligations of the company. 
The Fund’s investments in shares, certificates, notes or other securities issued by a platform, its affiliates or a special purpose
entity sponsored by a platform or its affiliates that represent the right to receive principal and interest payments due on fractions of whole loans or pools of whole loans may expose the Fund to the credit risk of the issuer. Generally, such
securities are unsecured obligations of the issuer; an issuer that becomes subject to bankruptcy proceedings may be unable to make full and timely payments on its obligations to the Fund, even if the payments on the underlying loan or loans continue
to be made timely and in full. In addition, when the Fund owns such fractional loans or other securities, the Fund and its custodian generally will not have a contractual relationship with, or personally identifiable information regarding,
individual borrowers, so the Fund will not be able to enforce underlying loans directly against borrowers and may not be able to appoint an alternative servicing agent in the event that a platform or third-party servicer, as applicable, ceases to
service the underlying loans. Therefore, the Fund will be more dependent on the platform for servicing than in the case in which the Fund owns whole loans. Where such interests are secured, the Fund relies on the platform to perfect the Fund’s
security interest. In addition, there may be a delay between the time the Fund commits to purchase a security issued by a platform, its affiliate or a special purpose entity sponsored by the platform or its affiliate and the

  43 



issuance of such security and, during such delay, the funds committed to such an investment will not earn interest on the investment nor will they be available for investment in other alternative
lending-related securities, which will reduce the effective rate of return on the investment. The Fund will invest primarily in whole loans, and does not expect to invest a material portion of its portfolio in such fractional loans or other
securities.  Servicer Risk  The Fund expects that all of its direct and indirect investments in loans originated by alternative lending platforms will be serviced by a platform or a third-party servicer. Loan servicing may entail
the assessment and/or collection of payments and fees from borrowers, the allocation and payment of such amounts to investors and the execution of collections processes upon nonpayment of borrower loans, which may include referral of overdue loans
to collections personnel or outside collection agencies. Fees charged by a loan servicer reduce the returns on the Fund’s investments. In the event that the servicer is unable to service the loan, there can be no guarantee that a backup
servicer will be able to assume responsibility for servicing the loans in a timely or cost-effective manner; any resulting disruption or delay could jeopardize payments due to the Fund in respect of its investments or increase the costs associated
with the Fund’s investments. If the servicer becomes subject to a bankruptcy or similar proceeding, there is some risk that the Fund’s investments could be recharacterized as a secured loan from the Fund to the platform, as described more
fully (with respect to the potential bankruptcy of a platform) under “Regulatory Risk,” which could result in uncertainty, costs and delays from having the Fund’s investment deemed part of the bankruptcy estate of the platform, rather
than an asset owned outright by the Fund. Servicers may be subject to other risks described herein, including “Platform Risk.” 
Regulatory Risk  The
loan industry is highly regulated and the alternative lending-related securities in which the Fund invests are subject to extensive rules and regulations issued by governmental authorities in each of the jurisdictions in which the Fund invests.
These authorities also may impose obligations and restrictions on the platforms’ activities or those of other entities involved in the alternative lending process.  The platforms’ failure to comply with the requirements of applicable law may cause, among other things, the platforms to be required to register with governmental authorities and/or the revocation of
requisite licenses, the voiding of loan contracts, impairment of the enforcement of loans, indemnification liability to contract counterparties, class action lawsuits, administrative enforcement actions and/or civil and criminal liability in the
relevant jurisdiction. The evolving nature of the platforms’ respective business models may complicate their ability to determine the applicability of, and to effect compliance with, such requirements. Moreover, legal and regulatory
requirements and any interpretations of those requirements are subject to periodic changes. Any such change necessitating new significant compliance obligations could have an adverse effect on the platforms’ compliance costs and ability to
operate. The platforms could seek to pass through any increase in their costs to their borrowers or investors, such as the Fund, in the form of higher origination or servicing fees. 
In connection with the sale and servicing of the whole loans, fractions of whole loans or pools of whole loans, the platforms typically
make representations and warranties to investors, such as the Fund, that the loans were originated and are being serviced in accordance with and in compliance with applicable laws (and in some cases specifically with the laws described herein) in
all material respects. Despite these representations and warranties, the Fund cannot guarantee that the platforms have been and will continue to be in compliance with all applicable laws. If those representations and warranties were not correct, the
platforms could be required to repurchase the loans, but the Fund cannot be certain that the platform would be required and able to repurchase loans in all such cases.  The information below provides additional detail on some of the laws, rules and regulations relevant to the Fund’s investments. 
  44 


Regulatory Regime in the United States 
The platforms may be subject to laws including (but not limited to) the following in the United States: 
 


 
•
 
 federal and state laws and regulations related to disclosures to and consents from borrowers and prospective borrowers and loan terms, credit
discrimination, credit reporting, debt servicing and collection and unfair or deceptive business practices;   


 
•
 
 state consumer loan, small loan, loan brokerage, loan servicing and collection agency licensing laws; 
 


 
•
 
 state usury laws and other laws that restrict the amount of interest or fees that may be charged on loans; 
 


 
•
 
 the Truth-in-Lending Act and Regulation Z promulgated thereunder, and similar state laws, which require certain disclosures to borrowers regarding
the terms and conditions of their loans and credit transactions;   


 
•
 
 Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, which prohibits unfair and deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce, and
Section 1031 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which prohibits unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices in connection with any consumer financial product or service;

These rules require extensive disclosure to, and consents from, borrowers and prospective
borrowers, prohibit discrimination and may impose multiple qualification and licensing obligations on platform activities. 
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) has broad authority over the U.S. consumer-focused businesses in which
certain platforms engage. This includes authority to write regulations under federal consumer financial protection laws, such as the Truth in Lending Act and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, to supervise and conduct regulatory examinations of banks
with more than $10 billion in assets and certain non-banks, and to enforce federal consumer financial protection laws against market participants, including the platforms. The CFPB is authorized to prevent “unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or
practices” through its regulatory, supervisory and enforcement authority. To assist in its enforcement, the CFPB maintains an online complaint system that allows consumers to log complaints with respect to various consumer finance products,
including the loans that platforms facilitate. This system could inform future CFPB decisions with respect to its regulatory, enforcement or examination focus. Until the CFPB issues a final rulemaking defining which non-bank larger participants in
the consumer lending market will be subject to the CFPB’s supervisory authority, which includes the ability to conduct regulatory examinations, the platforms are only subject to the CFPB’s rulemaking and enforcement authority. The CFPB is
expected to initiate a rulemaking setting forth new requirements and restrictions applicable to payday loans, automobile title loans and certain installment loans in the first quarter of 2016, which may impact some of the loans offered by certain
platforms. In connection with that rulemaking, the CFPB may issue a rule defining the non-bank larger participants in the consumer installment loan market that will become subject to CFPB supervision and examination, which could be written to cover
the platforms. There is uncertainty as to how the CFPB’s strategies and priorities, including in both its examination and enforcement processes, will impact the platforms’ businesses and their results of operations going forward. Actions
by the CFPB could result in requirements to alter or cease offering affected loan products and services, making them less attractive and restricting the platforms’ ability to offer them. Actions by the CFPB or other regulators against the
platforms, their funding banks or their competitors that discourage the use of the alternative lending model or suggest to consumers the desirability of other loan products or services could result in reputational harm and a loss of borrowers or
investors. The platforms’ compliance costs and litigation exposure could increase materially if the CFPB or other regulators enact new regulations, change regulations that were previously adopted, modify, through supervision or enforcement,
past regulatory guidance or interpret existing regulations in a manner different or stricter than previous interpretations. In addition to the CFPB, the Federal Trade Commission can investigate and enforce consumer protection statutes pursuant to
its authority under Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act. Also, the platforms may be subject to regulatory examination by state authorities, particularly in states where the platforms are licensed. Moreover, platforms that collaborate
with a bank to offer loans may be subject to the supervision of the bank’s regulator.  Different platforms adhere to
different business models subject to different regulatory requirements. For example, one platform may operate from a particular state to make loans to small- and mid-sized businesses across the United States. The platform must comply with that
state’s licensing requirements and possible usury limitations. However, other states could seek to regulate the platform on the basis that loans were made to borrowers located in such other states. In that case, loans made in those other states
could be subject to the maximum interest rate limits (usury laws), if any, of such jurisdiction, which in turn could limit revenues for the Fund. Moreover, it could further subject the platform to such states’ licensing requirements and,
potentially, to penalties for having previously conducted business in such states without a license, which could adversely impact the platform or, in some cases, the enforceability of some or all of the terms of loans made by the platform without a
license.  Another platform may follow a different model in which all loans sourced by the platform are made by a bank. The
platform may provide certain services to assist the bank in making the loan, but the loans will be made subject to the bank’s underwriting guidelines, funding for the loans will come from the bank’s own resources and the bank will be the
named payee on the loans. As a result, the bank is generally considered to be the “true lender” of the loans originated through the platform. However, if challenged, courts may instead decide that the platform is the true lender of the
loans. Plaintiffs have challenged various bank affiliation arrangements involving 
  46 



a variety of non-bank partners, often in market segments in which the Fund does not intend to invest, such as payday lending and refund anticipation lending. Given the fact specific nature of
these cases, courts have recently applied differing interpretations when determining which party is the true lender. The resulting uncertainty may increase the possibility of claims brought against the platforms by borrowers seeking to void their
loans or to subject the platforms to increased regulatory scrutiny and enforcement actions. To the extent that the platform is deemed to be the true lender in any jurisdiction instead of the originating bank (whether determined by a regulatory
agency at the state or federal level or by a court), loans made to borrowers in that jurisdiction would be subject to the maximum interest rate limits (usury laws) of such jurisdiction and existing loans may be unenforceable and the platform could
be subject to additional regulatory requirements in addition to any penalties and fines. Moreover, it may be determined that this business model is not sustainable in its current form, which could ultimately cause such platforms to alter or
terminate their businesses. In such circumstances, there could be a material adverse effect on the Fund’s ability to pursue its investment strategy.  Alternative lending platforms may be subject to risk of litigation alleging violations of federal and state laws and regulations and consumer law torts, including fraud. Moreover, many alternative
lending-related securities (loans, in particular) are written using standardized documentation. Thus, many borrowers may be similarly situated insofar as the provisions of their contractual obligations are concerned. Accordingly, allegations of
violations of the provisions of applicable federal or state consumer protection laws could potentially result in a large class of claimants asserting claims against the platforms and other related entities. 
The interest rates that certain U.S. platforms charge to borrowers are based upon the ability under U.S. federal law of the funding banks
that originate the loans to export the interest rates of its home state to provide uniform rates to all borrowers in all states that have not opted out. Certain primary funding banks for some of the platforms export the interest rates of Utah, which
generally allows parties to agree by contract to any interest rate. The current annual percentage rates offered by these banks through the platforms for personal loans range from approximately 6% to 29%. Certain states, including Utah, have no
statutory interest rate limitations on personal loans, while other jurisdictions have a maximum rate that is less than the current maximum rate offered by these banks through the platforms. If a borrower were to successfully bring claims against one
of the platforms for state usury law violations or other similar violations, and the rate on that borrower’s personal loan were greater than that allowed under the applicable state law, the platforms could be subject to, among other things,
fines and penalties. If the platforms’ ability to export the interest rates, and related terms and conditions, permitted under a particular state’s law to borrowers in other states is determined to violate applicable lending laws, a
platform could be subject to the interest rate restrictions and related terms and conditions of the lending laws of each of the states in which it operates. This could significantly and adversely impact the platforms’ operations and ability to
operate and they may be forced to end or significantly change their business and activities, resulting in a reduction in the volume of loans available for investment by investors such as the Fund. 
Even in the absence of regulations, plaintiffs may successfully challenge the funding bank or other lending models. Recent case law has
cast doubt on the viability of the model in which many platforms operate and, in particular, their ability to charge the same rate as a funding bank after a loan has been sold to the platform. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit
recently issued a significant decision that interpreted the scope of federal preemption under the National Bank Act (the “NBA”) and held that a non-bank assignee of loans sourced by a national bank was not entitled to the benefits of NBA
preemption as to state law claims of usury. Although the decision is binding only in Connecticut, New York and Vermont, it may significantly affect non-bank assignees of loans, including the loan origination practices of certain participants in the
alternative lending-related industry. At a minimum, non-bank assignees/purchasers of bank loans may face uncertainty regarding their ability to rely upon federal preemption of state usury laws; in addition, a number of alternative lending platforms
purchase loans from state-chartered banks promptly after origination and rely upon federal preemption to exempt the loans from state usury caps. The decision, although directly ruling on purchasers of national bank loans, could be applied to those
purchases by courts considering the scope of federal preemption under the Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act of 1980 (which generally preempts state usury laws in favor of federally insured state-chartered banks). The
Second Circuit’s decision appears to be contrary to 
  47 



other federal circuit court decisions and inconsistent with long-standing commercial practice. The decision has been appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court where the Court is considering whether to
accept the appeal. If the Court does not accept the appeal or upholds the Second Circuit’s ruling, additional legal issues, including the enforceability of the choice of law election in the borrowers’ contracts, will be determined by
further action at the U.S. District Court. Therefore, the impact of this decision is uncertain. Ultimately, if the decision is not accepted for appeal or is upheld on appeal and is widely applied, certain alternative lenders will likely be required
to restructure certain aspects of their operations and certain loans previously made by them through funding banks may not be subject to state usury limitations on the interest rate charged. As a result, if the Fund holds these U.S. loans (directly
or indirectly) at the time of such potential action, the Fund could suffer losses.  In addition, numerous other statutory
provisions, including federal bankruptcy laws and related state laws, may interfere with or affect the ability of an investor to enforce a loan facilitated through an alternative lending platform. If a platform or related entity were to go into
bankruptcy or become the subject of an insolvency proceeding, the platform or related entity may stop performing its services with respect to the loans. Any replacement servicer retained for such services may assess higher fees and/or demand
additional, less favorable terms with respect to its obligations. The servicer may also have the power, in connection with a bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding and with the approval of the court or the bankruptcy trustee or similar official, to
assign its rights and obligations as servicer to a third party without the consent, and even over the objection, of any affected parties. If the servicer is a debtor in bankruptcy or the subject of an insolvency or similar proceeding, this may limit
the ability of affected parties to enforce the obligations of the servicer, to collect any amount owing by the servicer or to terminate and replace the servicer. In addition, the sale of whole loans to the Fund may be found by a bankruptcy court not
to have been a true sale, but recharacterized as a secured loan from the Fund to the platform. If such a recharacterization occurs, most platform loan purchase agreements provide that the platform grants a security interest to the Fund in the loans
subject to the purchase agreement, but the Fund would incur the resulting uncertainty, costs and delays from having its loans deemed part of the bankruptcy estate of the platform, rather than assets owned outright by the Fund. A bankruptcy court may
also reduce the monthly payments due under the related contract or loan and/or change the rate of interest and time of repayment of the indebtedness. Borrowers may delay or suspend making payments on loans because of the uncertainties occasioned by
the bankruptcy or similar proceeding to which a platform or its related entities are subject, even if the borrowers have no legal right to do so. It is possible that a period of adverse economic conditions resulting in high defaults and
delinquencies on alternative lending-related securities will increase the potential bankruptcy risk to platforms and its related entities.  In July 2015, the U.S. Treasury Department issued an informational request about the benefits and risks associated with new online lending platforms. The information requested asked for responses on
various topics, including how alternative lenders manage the risk of fraud and hacker attacks, how they protect consumers against scams or default, how much investors in the loans rely on borrowed money and whether the lenders should have to put up
their own capital to back loans they originate or underwrite. The information request is in the information-collecting stage and no interpretive guidance has currently been released. The Fund cannot predict what form any such rulemaking or
interpretive guidance may take. In addition, the Fund cannot provide any assurance that the outcome of the information request will not require additional regulatory changes to the business models of platforms that may adversely affect the
platforms’ businesses. If a change in the laws or the interpretations of current laws were to occur, certain U.S. platforms could be required to either change the manner in which they conduct certain aspects of their operations or halt certain
business operations all together, which could have a material adverse effect on the Fund’s ability to pursue its investment strategy.  At any time there may be litigation pending against banks that issue or originate loans for the platforms. Any such litigation may significantly and adversely impact the platforms’ ability to make
loans or subject them to fines and penalties, which could consequently have a material adverse effect on the Fund. The platforms could also be forced to comply with the lending laws of all U.S. states, which may not be feasible and could result in
platforms ceasing to operate. Any increase in cost or regulatory burden on a platform could have a material adverse effect on the Fund. Specifically, adverse rulings by courts in pending and potential future litigation could

  48 



undermine the basis of platforms’ business models and could result ultimately in a platform or its lender members (investors) being characterized as a lender, which, as a consequence, would
mean that additional U.S. consumer protection laws would be applicable to the borrower member loans sourced on such platforms, potentially rendering such borrower member loans voidable or unenforceable. In addition, a platform or its lender members
could be subject to claims by borrower members, as well as enforcement actions by regulators. Even if a platform were not required to cease conducting business with residents of certain states or to change its business practices to comply with
applicable laws and regulations, the platform or its lender members could be required to register or obtain and maintain licenses or regulatory approvals in all 50 U.S. states at substantial cost. If a platform were subject to fines, penalties or
other regulatory action or ceased to operate, this could have a material adverse effect on the Fund’s ability to pursue its investment strategy.  In addition to laws governing the activities of lenders and servicers, a limited number of states require purchasers of certain loans, primarily consumer loans, to be licensed or registered in order to
own the loans or, in certain states, to collect a rate of interest above a specified rate. The Fund intends to obtain licenses where required in order to pursue its investment strategy. To the extent the Fund obtains such licenses or is required to
comply with related regulatory requirements, the Fund could be subject to increased costs and regulatory oversight by governmental authorities that may have an adverse effect on its results or operations. If the Fund were delayed in obtaining, or
were unable to obtain, required licenses in certain states, this could limit its ability to invest in loans to borrowers in those states.  Because loans are not ordinarily registered with the SEC or any state securities commission or listed on any securities exchange, there is usually less publicly available information about such
instruments. In addition, loans in which the Fund invests may not be considered “securities” for purposes of the anti-fraud protections of the federal securities laws. In the event certain loans in which the Fund invests are not considered
securities, as a purchaser of these instruments, the Fund may not be entitled to the anti-fraud protections of the federal securities laws. The Fund has been advised by the Staff of the SEC that it is the view of the SEC and its Staff that the
purchase of whole loans through alternative lending platforms involves the purchase of “securities” under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, issued by the originating platforms. 
If platforms or any related entities are required to register as investment companies under the 1940 Act or as investment advisers under
the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, their ability to conduct business may be materially adversely affected, and contracts entered into by a platform or related entity while in violation of the registration requirements may be voidable. This could
adversely affect the Fund’s ability to pursue its investment strategy.  The U.S. federal Fair Debt Collection Practices
Act (“FDCPA”) provides guidelines and limitations on the conduct of third-party debt servicers in connection with the collection of consumer debts. In order to ensure compliance with the FDCPA, U.S. platforms often contract with
professional third-party debt collection agencies to engage in debt collection activities with respect to consumer debts. The CFPB, the U.S. federal agency now responsible for administering the FDCPA, is engaged in comprehensive rulemaking regarding
the operation of the FDCPA, which likely will affect the obligations of sellers of debt to third parties, as well as change other regulatory requirements. Any such changes could have an adverse effect on any U.S. platforms following a certain model
and, therefore, on the Fund as an investor through such platforms. The U.S. Fair Credit Reporting Act (“FCRA”) regulates consumer credit reporting. Under the FCRA, liability may be imposed on furnishers of data to credit reporting agencies
to the extent that adverse credit information reported is false or inaccurate.  U.S. federal law provides borrower service
members on active military service with rights that may delay or impair a platform’s ability to collect on a loan. The Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (“SCRA”) requires that the interest rate on pre-existing debts, such as service
member loans, be set at no more than 6% while the qualified service member or reservist is on active duty. An investor in an alternative lending-related security that is dependent on the performance of such a loan, such as the Fund, will not receive
the difference between 6% and the original stated interest rate for the loan during any such period. This law also permits courts to stay proceedings and execution of judgments against service members and reservists on active duty, which may delay

  49 



recovery on any loans in default and, accordingly, payments on the instruments that are dependent on these loans. If there are any amounts under such a loan still due and owing to the platform
after the final maturity of the instrument that corresponds to the loan, a platform may have no further obligation to make payments on the instrument to the Fund, even if the platform later receives payments after the final maturity of the
instrument.  Platforms do not take military service into account in assigning loan grades to borrower service member loan
requests. In addition, platforms do not request prospective borrowers to confirm if they are a qualified service member or reservists within the meaning of the SCRA as part of the borrower registration process. 
Lender Liability  A
number of judicial decisions have upheld judgments of borrowers against lending institutions on the basis of various evolving legal theories, collectively termed “lender liability.” Generally, lender liability is founded on the premise
that a lender has violated a duty (whether implied or contractual) of good faith, commercial reasonableness and fair dealing, or a similar duty owed to the borrower or has assumed an excessive degree of control over the borrower resulting in the
creation of a fiduciary duty owed to the borrower or its other creditors or shareholders. If a loan held directly or indirectly by the Fund were found to have been made or serviced under circumstances that give rise to lender liability, the
borrower’s obligation to repay that loan could be reduced or eliminated or the Fund’s recovery on that loan could be otherwise impaired, which would adversely impact the value of that loan. 
In limited cases, courts have subordinated the loans of a senior lender to a borrower to claims of other creditors of the borrower when
the senior lender or its agents, such as a loan servicer, is found to have engaged in unfair, inequitable or fraudulent conduct with respect to the other creditors. If a loan held directly or indirectly by the Fund were subject to such
subordination, it would be junior in right of payment to other indebtedness of the borrower, which could adversely impact the value of that loan.  Regulatory Regime in the United Kingdom  The Fund may invest in
alternative lending-related securities through platforms domiciled in the UK. Such platforms must be authorized and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”) in order to engage in the regulated activity of “operating an
electronic system in relation to lending,” following changes to consumer credit regulation in April 2014. The FCA is currently allowing application periods, giving platforms with interim permission a three-month window in which they must apply
to the FCA for full authorization. If any platform through which the Fund invests were to fail to obtain full authorization, the platform might be forced to cease its operations, which would disrupt the servicing and administration of loans to which
the Fund has exposure through that platform. Any such disruption may impact the quality of debt collection procedures in relation to those loans and may result in reduced returns to the Fund from those investments. 
The FCA has recently also introduced new regulatory controls for platform operators, including the application of conduct of business
rules (in particular, relating to disclosure and promotions), minimum capital requirements, client money protection rules, dispute resolution rules and a requirement for firms to take reasonable steps to ensure existing loans continue to the
administered if the firm goes out of business. The introduction of these regulations and any further new laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on UK platforms’ businesses and may result in interruption of operations by such
platforms or the passing on of the costs of increased regulatory compliance to investors, such as the Fund, in the form of higher origination or servicing fees.  The Fund may invest in loans that constitute regulated credit agreements (consumer credit loans) under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (“FSMA”). Article 60B of the amended Financial
Services and Markets Act 2000 (Regulated Activities) Order 2001 (the “RAO”) provides that the activity of entering into a regulated credit agreement as lender or exercising or having the right to exercise the lender’s rights and
duties under such credit agreement requires FCA authorization. However, article 60I of the RAO and paragraph 55 of the schedule 
  50 



to the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Exemption Order) 2001 provide exemptions from authorization to persons who acquire rights under a regulated credit agreements (but who do not make
any such loans or extend any new credit), provided that the servicer of such loans is appropriately authorized by the FCA. 
The Fund is not authorized by the FCA in respect of consumer credit activities. To the extent that it acquires any loans which are
regulated credit agreements under FSMA, the Fund will be required to ensure that a person with the appropriate FCA authorization is engaged to service such regulated credit agreements in accordance with the exemptions from authorization under
article 60B and paragraph 55 outlined above. If the FCA were to successfully challenge the Fund’s reliance on this exemption, this could adversely affect the Fund’s ability to invest in consumer loans in the United Kingdom or other
alternative lending-related securities relating to such consumer loans, and could subject to the Fund to costs that could adversely affect the results of the Fund.  Regulatory Regime in Other Jurisdictions  The platforms and their
investors may face regulation in the other jurisdictions in which the Fund invests. Many other jurisdictions have regulatory regimes in place to authorize or regulate platforms. If any entity operating a platform through which the Fund invests, or
any entity that is the lender under a loan agreement facilitated by that platform, were to lose its license or have its license suspended or revoked, the platform might be forced to cease its operations, which could impair the ability of the Fund to
pursue its investment strategy by investing in loans originated by that platform, and could disrupt the servicing and administration of loans to which the Fund has exposure through that platform. Any such disruption could impact the quality of debt
collection procedures in relation to those loans and could result in reduced returns to the Fund from those investments. In addition, some jurisdictions may regulate the terms of loans issued through a platform or impose additional requirements on
investments in such loans, which could impact the value of alternative lending-related securities purchased from a platform operating in such a jurisdiction or the ability of the Fund to pursue its investment strategy by investing in loans
originated by such a platform. New or amended laws or regulations could disrupt the business operations of platforms operating in jurisdictions in which the Fund invests and could result in the platforms passing on of increased regulatory compliance
costs to investors, such as the Fund, in the form of higher origination or servicing fees.  Privacy and Data Security Laws 
GLBA and other laws limit the disclosure of certain non-public personal information about a consumer to non-affiliated third parties and
require financial institutions to disclose certain privacy policies and practices with respect to information sharing with both affiliates and non-affiliated third parties. Many states and a number of non-U.S. jurisdictions have enacted privacy and
data security laws requiring safeguards on the privacy and security of consumers’ personally identifiable information. Other laws deal with obligations to safeguard and dispose of private information in a manner designed to avoid its
dissemination. Privacy rules adopted by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission implement GLBA and other requirements and govern the disclosure of consumer financial information by certain financial institutions, ranging from banks to private investment
funds. U.S. platforms following certain models generally are required to have privacy policies that conform to these GLBA and other requirements. In addition, such platforms typically have policies and procedures intended to maintain platform
participants’ personal information securely and dispose of it properly.  The Fund generally does not intend to obtain
or hold borrowers’ non-public personal information, and the Fund intends to implement procedures designed to prevent the disclosure of borrowers’ non-public personal information to the Fund. However, service providers to the Fund,
including the Fund’s custodians and the platforms acting as loan servicers for the Fund, may obtain, hold or process such information. While the Fund will adopt policies and procedures regarding the platforms’ and custodian’s
protection and use of non-public personal information, the Fund cannot guarantee the security of that data and cannot guarantee that service providers have been and will continue to comply with GLBA, other data security and privacy laws and any
other related regulatory requirements. Violations of GLBA and other laws could subject the Fund to litigation and/or 
  51 



fines, penalties or other regulatory action, which, individually or in the aggregate, could have an adverse effect on the Fund. The Fund may also face regulations related to privacy and data
security in the other jurisdictions in which the Fund invests.  Leverage Risk 
The Fund or a Subsidiary of the Fund may obtain financing to make investments in alternative lending-related securities. The Fund expects
that such borrowings will be secured by alternative lending-related securities held by the Fund or a Subsidiary. The Fund also may obtain leverage through derivative instruments or asset-backed securities that afford the Fund economic leverage.
Leverage magnifies the Fund’s exposure to declines in the value of one or more underlying reference assets or creates investment risk with respect to a larger pool of assets than the Fund would otherwise have and may be considered a speculative
technique. For example, if the Fund obtains structural leverage through one or more Subsidiaries that finance their investments in alternative lending-related securities, a decrease in the value of those securities will negatively impact the
Fund’s net asset value to a greater extent than if the Fund had not used leverage. For this reason, the value of an investment in the Fund will be more volatile and other risks tend to be compounded if and to the extent the Fund borrows or uses
derivatives or other investments that have embedded leverage. In addition, the Fund’s interests in Subsidiaries that have entered into borrowing arrangements typically will rank after such borrowings and if the Subsidiaries’ assets decline
in value, the return on the Fund’s equity interest may be adversely affected.  Market conditions may unfavorably impact
the Fund’s or its Subsidiaries’ ability to secure borrowings on terms as favorable as more established borrowers in the market, or to obtain financing on commercially feasible terms. To the extent the Fund or a Subsidiary is able to secure
financing, fluctuations in interest rates could increase the costs associated with the Fund’s or Subsidiary’s use of certain forms of leverage, and such costs could reduce the Fund’s return. 
The 1940 Act requires a closed-end fund to maintain asset coverage of not less than 300% of the value of the outstanding amount of senior
securities representing indebtedness (as defined in the 1940 Act) and generally requires a closed-end fund to make provision to prohibit the declaration of any dividend (except a dividend payable in stock of the fund) or distribution on the
fund’s stock or the repurchase of any of the fund’s stock, unless, at the time of the declaration or repurchase, there is asset coverage of at least 300%, after deducting the amount of the dividend, distribution or purchase price, as the
case may be. To satisfy 1940 Act requirements in connection with leverage or to meet obligations, the Fund may be required to dispose of portfolio securities when such disposition might not otherwise be desirable. Engaging in such transactions may
cause the Fund to liquidate positions when it may not be advantageous to do so to satisfy its obligations or to meet segregation requirements. Because, as discussed in more detail under “Illiquidity Risk”, the Fund’s portfolio will be
substantially illiquid, any such disposition or liquidation could result in losses to the Fund. There can be no assurances that the Fund’s use of leverage will be successful.  Securitization Risk  In connection with the sale or contribution by the
Fund or its Subsidiaries of certain of their alternative lending-related investments to any special purpose entity formed for the purpose of acquiring alternative lending-related investments and issuing securities, the Fund or its Subsidiaries may
be required to make certain representations about the alternative lending-related investments sold or contributed to such special purpose entity. The Fund or its Subsidiaries also may be required to indemnify such special purpose entity, or to
repurchase the alternative lending-related investments to which such representations relate, to the extent that any of such representation is found to have been inaccurate on the date that it was made. In making such representations, the Fund or
applicable Subsidiary may rely upon certain representations and warranties made to the Fund by the platform from which the Fund or such Subsidiary originally acquired the relevant alternative lending-related investment. If the Fund or the applicable
Subsidiary relies on any such representations made by a platform, the Fund or such Subsidiary is expected to have a right of indemnification from, or a right to sell the relevant alternative lending-related investment back to, such platform if such
representations by such platform are found to have been 
  52 



inaccurate on the date on which they were made. In the event that the Fund or the applicable Subsidiary is required to indemnify, or to repurchase alternative lending-related investments from, a
special purpose entity as a result of a representation made by the Fund to such special purpose entity, it is expected that the Fund or such Subsidiary will seek to recoup its losses by exercising its rights to a similar remedy against the platform
from which it purchased such alternative lending-related investments. However, it is possible that the Fund or such Subsidiary will not be able to obtain representations from the relevant platform that back up all representations required to be made
by the Fund in connection with a securitization, and the Fund may be unable to recoup some or all of such losses through such arrangements. 
Risk of Fraud  The Fund
may be subject to the risk of fraudulent activity associated with the various parties involved in alternative lending, including the platforms, banks, borrowers and third parties handling borrower and investor information. Prospective borrowers may
materially misrepresent any of the information they provide to the platforms, including their credit history, the existence or value of purported collateral, the purpose of the loan, their occupation or their employment status. Platforms may not
verify all of the information provided by prospective borrowers. As discussed under “Credit/Counterparty Risk,” the accuracy of a platform’s evaluation of a borrower’s creditworthiness could be significantly impaired if based on
flawed information. Except where a platform is required to repurchase loans or indemnify investors, fraud may adversely affect the Fund’s ability to receive the principal and interest payments that it expects to receive on its investments and,
therefore, may negatively impact the Fund’s performance. A platform may have the exclusive right and ability to investigate claims of borrower identity theft, which creates a conflict of interest, as platforms may be obligated to repurchase
loans and/or indemnify investors in the loans in the case of fraud and may, therefore, have an incentive to deny or fail to investigate properly a claim of fraud. Furthermore, there can be no guarantee that the resources, technologies or fraud
prevention measures implemented by a platform will be sufficient to accurately detect and prevent fraud.  The Fund is also
subject to the risk of fraudulent activity by a platform or a backup servicer. In the event that a platform or backup servicer engages in fraudulent activity, the pools of loans originated by the platform or any loans serviced by the platform or
backup servicer may be impaired or may not be of the quality that the Fund anticipated, thereby increasing the risk of default in respect of such loans.  Below Investment Grade Securities and Unrated Securities Risk  The
Fund may have exposure, without limitation, to investments that are rated below investment grade or that are unrated but are judged by the Adviser to be of comparable quality. The alternative lending-related securities in which the Fund invests (or,
in the case of asset-backed securities, the loans that back them) typically are not rated by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization. Although the Fund’s Fundamental Investment Restrictions do not permit the Fund to invest in
loans of subprime quality, some unrated securities purchased by the Fund may be of credit quality comparable to securities rated below investment grade by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization. In addition, the Fund may invest in
securities that are rated below investment grade. Below investment grade debt securities, which are commonly called “junk bonds,” are rated below BBB- by Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services (“S&P”) or Baa3 by
Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., (“Moody’s”), or have comparable ratings by another rating organization. Accordingly, certain of the Fund’s unrated investments could constitute a highly risky and speculative investment,
similar to an investment in “junk bonds.” As described under “Credit/Counterparty Risk,” in evaluating the creditworthiness of borrowers of such unrated loans, the Adviser may rely on the ratings ascribed to such borrowers by the
relevant platform. The Adviser may also rely on reports from one or more independent vendors as part of its investment process or may create its own internal risk model for this purpose. 
The analysis of the creditworthiness of borrowers may be less reliable than for more traditional borrowings, such as bank loans, and more
complex than for issuers of higher-rated investments. The Fund’s ability to achieve its investment objective may, as a result, be more dependent upon the platform’s credit analysis than would be the

  53 



case if the Fund had exposure to more traditional investments. In addition, such investments may be subject to greater risks than other investments, including greater levels of risk related to
changes in interest rates, credit risk (including a greater risk of default) and liquidity risk. There is a greater risk of loss associated with alternative lending-related securities investments and the ability of a borrower to make principal
and/or interest payments is predominantly speculative for below investment grade investments or unrated investments judged by the Adviser to have a similar quality. Borrowers may be in default or have a currently identifiable vulnerability to
default on their payments of principal and/or interest or may otherwise present elements of danger with respect to payments of principal or interest. Below investment grade investments or unrated investments judged by the Adviser to be of comparable
quality may be more susceptible to real or perceived adverse economic and competitive industry or business conditions than higher-grade investments. Yields on below investment grade investments will fluctuate and may, therefore, cause the
Fund’s value to be more volatile. Certain investments of the Fund may be downgraded to below investment grade status (or may be judged by the Adviser to be of comparable quality) after the Fund purchases them. 
Pursuant to the Fundamental Investment Restrictions, the Fund will not invest of loans of subprime quality. 
Interest Rate Risk  The
values of the Fund’s investments in income-producing alternative lending-related securities (such as whole loans, other debt instruments, preferred securities and convertible securities) change in response to interest rate changes. In general,
the value of a debt security is likely to fall as interest rates rise. This risk is generally greater for obligations with longer maturities or for debt securities that do not pay current interest. Debt securities with floating interest rates can be
less sensitive to interest rate changes, although, to the extent the Fund’s income is based on short-term interest rates that fluctuate over short periods of time, income received by the Fund may decrease as a result of a decline in interest
rates; floating rate loans can also decrease in value if their interest rates do not rise as quickly or as much as market interest rates. Conversely, variable rate instruments generally will not increase in value if interest rates decline. When
interest rates increase or for other reasons, debt securities may be repaid more slowly than expected. As a result, the maturity of the debt instrument may be extended, increasing the potential for loss. 
Interest rate changes can be sudden and unpredictable. A wide variety of factors can cause interest rates to fluctuate (e.g.,
central bank monetary policies, inflation rates, general economic conditions and market developments) and debt securities may be particularly volatile during such periods. Currently, certain interest rates are at or near historic lows and, as a
result, they are likely to rise over time, which may cause the value of the Fund’s investments and, therefore, the Fund’s net asset value, to decrease.  Prepayment Risk  Borrowers may decide to prepay all or a portion of the
remaining principal amount due under a loan at any time, without penalty, unless the underlying loan agreement provides for prepayment penalties. Prepayment reduces the yield to maturity and the average life of a loan or other security. In the event
of a prepayment of all or a portion of the remaining unpaid principal amount of a loan to which the Fund has investment exposure, the Fund will receive such prepayment but further interest will cease to accrue on the prepaid portion of the loan
after the date of the prepayment. If the Fund buys a security at a premium, the premium could be lost in the event of a prepayment. In periods of falling interest rates, the rate of prepayments (and price fluctuation) tends to increase as borrowers
are incentivized to pay off debt and refinance at new lower rates. Borrowers may also seek to prepay debt obligations in order to refinance at lower interest rates if their credit standing improves such that they are eligible to borrow at a lower
interest rate. During such periods, the Fund generally will be forced to reinvest the prepayment proceeds at lower rates of return than the Fund expected to earn on the prepaid assets, provided that the Fund is able to identify suitable reinvestment
opportunities, which may adversely impact the Fund’s performance. 
  54 


Illiquidity Risk  To the extent consistent with the repurchase liquidity requirement of an interval fund, the Fund may invest without limitation in illiquid investments. Illiquidity risk is the risk that the investments
held by the Fund may be difficult or impossible to sell at the time that the Fund would like or at the price that the Fund believes the security is currently worth. Alternative lending-related securities, which typically are contractually
non-transferable, are not listed on any securities exchange and/or are not registered under the Securities Act of 1933, are illiquid. Furthermore, an active, reliable secondary market for alternative lending-related securities does not currently
exist and there can be no assurance that an active market will develop. To the extent that there is any secondary market for the Fund’s alternative lending-related investments, it is likely initially to be over-the-counter, as opposed to
exchange-traded, and may, therefore, provide less transparency; such markets may also be smaller and less active than the market for investments that are higher-rated, which may adversely affect the prices at which the Fund can sell its investments
and may result in losses to the Fund. At any given time, the Fund’s portfolio will be substantially illiquid.  The
Fund’s ability to realize full value in the event of the need to liquidate certain assets may be impaired and/or result in losses to the Fund. The Fund may be unable to sell its investments, even under circumstances when the Adviser believes it
would be in the best interests of the Fund to do so. Illiquid investments may also be difficult to value and their pricing may be more volatile than more liquid investments, which could adversely affect the price at which the Fund is able to sell
such instruments. Investors, like the Fund, that are acquiring or otherwise gaining exposure to such loans and other related instruments usually must, among other things, hold the loans through maturity in order to recoup their entire investment and
during that time will be unable to make additional investments using the capital that is put towards such investments or any proceeds on a potential sale of such investments. Illiquidity risk also may be greater in times of financial stress. The
risks associated with illiquid instruments may be particularly acute in situations in which the Fund’s operations require cash (such as in connection with repurchase offers) and could result in the Fund borrowing to meet its short-term needs or
incurring losses on the sale of illiquid instruments.  Valuation Risk 
The Fund is subject to valuation risk, which is the risk that one or more of the securities in which the Fund invests are priced
incorrectly, due to factors such as incomplete data, market instability or human error. The Fund anticipates using a third-party pricing service to value the Fund’s investments in alternative lending-related securities, as market quotations
generally are not available for the Fund’s investments in alternative lending-related securities. There is no assurance that the Fund could sell a portfolio security for the value established for it at any time and it is possible that the Fund
would incur a loss because a portfolio security is sold at a discount to its established value. If securities are mispriced, shareholders could lose money upon redemption or could pay too much for Shares purchased. 
Competition, Ramp-up and Exposure Risks  The market for alternative lending-related securities is highly competitive and rapidly evolving. The Fund faces competition for access to platforms and alternative lending-related securities, including
from other institutional investors; such competitors may have higher risk tolerance, greater financial or other resources and/or other advantages. The competitive pressures the Fund faces may impact the Fund’s ability to make investments
consistent with its investment objective. Various platforms also compete with one other as well as with more traditional lenders, including banks with substantially greater financial resources. If the Fund is inhibited from deploying capital in a
timely or efficient manner, it may be forced to invest in cash, cash equivalents or other assets that may result in lower returns than may otherwise be available through investments in alternative lending-related securities. The success of any given
platform and, therefore, the success of the Fund will depend, among other things, on a continuous demand for loans from qualified borrowers. There can be no assurance that such demand will continue to exist. 
  55 


There can be no assurances as to how long it will take the Fund to invest the net
proceeds of the offering, and the longer the period the greater the likelihood that the Fund’s performance will be adversely affected. Pending deployment of the net proceeds of the offering, the Fund generally will invest cash held in cash
deposits and cash equivalents. The Fund will limit the sale of its securities based on the Adviser’s assessment of its ability to invest the proceeds in an effective and timely manner. 
If the Fund’s access to platforms is limited, whether due to ramp-up, termination of existing arrangements or failure to secure
arrangements with other platforms, its exposure to the risks of the platforms to which the Fund is exposed, as discussed under “Platform Risk,” and the risks of increased exposure to a potentially more limited pool of portfolio
investments, may increase. Moreover, a platform may be unable to sustain its current lending model or may change its underwriting or credit models, borrower acquisition channels, quality of debt collection procedures and/or servicing models in ways
that may make such investments unsuitable for the Fund; such changes may occur after the Fund has already made its investments and, as most of the Fund’s alternative lending-related securities are illiquid, the Fund may not be able to divest
itself of the instruments at all or at an advantageous time or price. The Fund initially anticipates that a substantial portion of its alternative lending-related investments will be associated with the group of platforms that the Adviser has
diligenced at the time that the Fund commences investment operations. Even if the Fund is exposed to a varied pool of assets, the Fund’s investment focus on alternative lending-related securities will cause the Fund to be subject to greater
overall risk than if the Fund’s exposures were less focused, as it will be exposed to events affecting the alternative lending-related industry.  Even if the Fund’s investments are varied as to borrower type, geographic location, loan purpose or other features, they may nevertheless have some similar characteristics and may, therefore, be
subject to many of the same risks and/or regulatory regimes and may respond in a similar manner to particular economic, market, political or other developments.  Geographic Focus Risk  The Fund will seek to build a geographically
diverse portfolio, with assets initially focused primarily in the U.S., Europe, Australia and New Zealand. The Fund is not subject to any geographic restrictions when investing in alternative lending-related securities and, therefore, could focus
its investments in a particular geographic region, whether in the U.S. or abroad. A geographic focus in a particular region may expose the Fund to an increased risk of loss due to risks associated with that region. Certain regions from time to time
will experience weaker economic conditions than others and, consequently, will likely experience higher rates of delinquency and loss than on similar investments across the geographic regions to which the Fund is exposed. In the event that a
significant portion of the alternative lending-related securities of the Fund relate to loans owed by borrowers resident or operating in certain specific geographic regions, any localized economic conditions, weather events, natural or man-made
disasters or other factors affecting those regions in particular could increase delinquency and defaults on the assets to which the Fund is exposed and could negatively impact Fund performance. Further, any focus of the Fund’s alternative
lending-related investments in one or more regions would have a disproportionate effect on the Fund if governmental authorities in any such region took action against any of the participants in the alternative lending industry doing business in that
region.  Foreign Securities Risk  The Fund may invest directly or indirectly in the alternative lending-related securities of foreign issuers. Such investments may involve risks not ordinarily associated with exposure to alternative
lending-related securities of U.S. issuers. The foreign alternative lending industry may be subject to less governmental supervision and regulation than exists in the U.S.; conversely, foreign regulatory regimes applicable to the alternative lending
industry may be more complex and more restrictive than those in the U.S., resulting in higher costs associated with such investments, and such regulatory regimes may be subject to interpretation or change without prior notice to investors, such as
the Fund. Foreign platforms may not be subject to accounting, auditing, and financial reporting standards and practices comparable to those in the U.S. Due to difference in legal systems, there may

  56 



be difficulty in obtaining or enforcing a court judgment outside the U.S. For example, bankruptcy laws may differ across the jurisdictions in which the Fund may invest and it may be difficult for
the servicer to pursue borrowers who borrow through non-U.S. platforms. In addition, to the extent that investments are made in a limited number of countries, events in those countries will have a more significant impact on the Fund. The Fund’s
investments in foreign securities may be subject to risks of increased transaction costs, potential delays in settlement or unfavorable differences between the U.S. economy and foreign economies. 
The Fund’s exposure to alternative lending-related securities issued by foreign issuers may be subject to withholding and other
foreign taxes, which may adversely affect the net return on such investments. As described further under “Currency Risk,” fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and exchange controls may adversely affect the market value of the
Fund’s investments in alternative lending-related securities of foreign issuers. The Fund is unlikely to be able to pass through to its shareholders foreign income tax credits in respect of any foreign income taxes it pays. 
Currency Risk  Currency
risk is the risk that fluctuations in exchange rates will adversely affect the market value of the Fund’s investments. Currency risk includes the risk that the foreign currencies in which the Fund’s investments are traded, in which the
Fund receives income or in which the Fund has taken a position will decline in value relative to the U.S. dollar. Currency risk also includes the risk that a currency to which the Fund has obtained exposure through hedging declines in value relative
to the currency being hedged, in which event the Fund may realize a loss both on the hedging instrument and on the currency being hedged. There can be no assurances or guarantees that any efforts the Fund makes to hedge exposure to foreign exchange
rate risks that arise as a result of its investments will successfully hedge against such risks or that adequate hedging arrangements will be available on an economically viable basis, and in some cases, hedging arrangements may result in additional
costs being incurred or losses being greater than if hedging had not been used. Currency exchange rates can fluctuate significantly for many reasons. Derivative transactions in foreign currencies (such as futures, forwards, options and swaps) may
involve leverage risk in addition to currency risk. The Fund’s Shares are priced (purchased and redeemed) in U.S. dollars and the distributions paid by the Fund are paid in U.S. dollars. However, a portion of the Fund’s assets may be
denominated in foreign (non-U.S.) currencies and income received by the Fund from a portion of its investments may be paid in foreign currencies. In purchasing or selling local currency to fund trades denominated in that currency, the Fund will be
exposed to the risk that the value of the foreign currency will increase or decrease, which may impact the value of the Fund’s investments in foreign currencies, securities denominated in foreign currencies, derivatives that provide exposure to
foreign currencies and the Fund’s income available for distribution. Some countries have and may continue to adopt internal economic policies that affect their currency valuations in a manner that may be disadvantageous for U.S. investors or
U.S. companies seeking to do business in those countries. For example, a foreign government may unilaterally devalue its currency against other currencies, which typically would have the effect of reducing the U.S. dollar value of investments
denominated in that currency. In addition, a country may impose formal or informal currency exchange controls. These controls may restrict or prohibit the Fund’s ability to repatriate both investment capital and income, which could undermine
the value and liquidity of the Fund’s portfolio holdings and potentially place the Fund’s assets at risk of total loss. As a result, if the exchange rate for any such currency declines after the Fund’s income has been earned and
converted into U.S. dollars but before payment to shareholders, the Fund could be required to liquidate portfolio investments to make such distributions. Similarly, if the Fund incurs an expense in U.S. dollars and the exchange rate declines before
the expense is paid, the Fund would have to convert a greater amount to U.S. dollars to pay for the expense at that time than it would have had to convert at the time the Fund incurred the expense. 
Investments in Other Pooled Investment Vehicles  Direct or indirect investing in another pooled investment vehicle, such as securitization vehicles that issue asset-backed securities, exposes the Fund to all of the risks of that vehicle’s
investments. The Fund will bear its pro rata share of the expenses of any such vehicle, in addition to its own expenses. The values of other pooled 
  57 



investment vehicles are subject to change as the values of their respective component assets fluctuate. To the extent the Fund invests in managed pooled investment vehicles, the performance of
the Fund’s investments in such vehicles will be dependent upon the investment and research abilities of persons other than the Adviser. The securities offered by such vehicles typically are not registered under the securities laws because they
are offered in transactions that are exempt from registration.  Market Risk 
The value of the Fund’s investments may decline, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably, due to general economic conditions that are not
specifically related to a particular issuer or borrower, such as real or perceived adverse economic or political conditions throughout the world, changes in interest or currency rates or adverse investor sentiment generally. The value of the
Fund’s investments also may decline because of factors that affect a particular industry or industries. For example, the financial crisis that began in 2008 caused a significant decline in the value and liquidity of many securities. These risks
may be particularly acute for the Fund, as alternative lending is a new and evolving industry.  Volatility Risk 
The market value of the alternative lending-related securities to which the Fund has exposure may increase or decrease, sometimes rapidly
and unpredictably, based upon changes in an issuer’s financial condition and/or overall market and economic conditions. Because many of the Fund’s investments may be illiquid and/or below investment grade (or unrated, but of a similar
quality; debt securities that are below investment grade are commonly called “junk bonds”), the Fund may be subject to increased volatility risk. In addition, the Fund’s use of leverage will increase the volatility of the Fund’s
value.  Management and Operational Risk  The Fund is subject to management risk because it relies on the Adviser’s ability to achieve its investment objective. The Fund runs the risk that the Adviser’s investment techniques will fail
to produce desired results and cause the Fund to incur significant losses. The Adviser may fail to use derivatives effectively, may select investments that do not perform as anticipated by the Adviser and may choose to hedge or not to hedge
positions at disadvantageous times.  Any imperfections, errors, or limitations in quantitative analyses and models used by the
Adviser as part of its investment process could affect the Fund’s performance. Models that appear to explain prior market data can fail to predict future market events. Further, the data used in models may be inaccurate or may not include the
most recent information about a company or a security.  The Fund also is subject to the risk of loss as a result of other
services provided by the Adviser and other service providers, including pricing, administrative, accounting, tax, legal, custody, transfer agency and other services. Operational risk includes the possibility of loss caused by inadequate procedures
and controls, human error and cyber attacks, disruptions and failures affecting, or by, a service provider. For example, trading delays or errors (both human and systematic) could prevent the Fund from benefiting from potential investment gains or
avoiding losses.  Alternative Lending Operational and Technology Risk 
Alternative lending-related securities are typically originated and documented in electronic form and there are ordinarily no tangible
written documents evidencing such loans or any payments owed thereon. Because the Fund depends on electronic systems maintained by the custodian and the platforms or their affiliates to maintain records, evidence ownership of the Fund’s
investments, appropriately safeguard such investments and to service and administer alternative lending-related securities (as applicable), the Fund is vulnerable to the risks associated with such electronic systems, including, among others: power
loss, computer systems failures and internet, telecommunications or data network failures; operator negligence or improper operation by, or supervision of, 
  58 



employees; physical and electronic loss of data or security breaches, misappropriation and similar events; computer viruses; cyber attacks, intentional acts of vandalism and similar events; and
hurricanes, fires, floods and other natural disasters.  In addition, platforms rely on software that is highly technical and
complex and depend on the ability of such software to store, retrieve, process and manage immense amounts of data. Such software may contain errors or flaws. Some errors may only be discovered after the code has been released for external or
internal use. Errors or other design defects within the software on which a platform relies may result in a negative experience for borrowers who use the platform, delay introductions of new features or enhancements, result in errors or compromise
the platform’s ability to protect borrower or investor data or its own intellectual property. Any errors, flaws or defects discovered in the software on which a platform relies could negatively impact operations of the platform and the ability
of the platform to perform its obligations with respect to the loans associated with the platform. The electronic systems on which platforms rely may be subject to cyber attacks that could result, among other things, in data breaches and the release
of confidential information and thus expose the platform to significant liability. A security breach could also irreparably damage a platform’s reputation and thus its ability to continue to operate its business. 
In addition, despite any security measures established to safeguard the information in these systems, the highly automated nature of a
platform or other service providers involved in the alternative lending process may make it an attractive target and potentially more vulnerable to cyber attacks, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, employee error, malfeasance and
similar disruptions, which could negatively affect the Fund. If a platform or other service provider were unable to prevent such malicious activity, the breach could compromise the systems and result in the theft, loss or public dissemination of the
information stored therein. As a result, the platform or other service provider could suffer, among other things, financial loss, the disruption of its business, liability to third parties, regulatory intervention or reputational damage and the
platform’s or other service provider’s ability to fulfill its servicing or other obligations would be adversely affected, which may adversely effect the Fund. Because techniques used to sabotage or obtain unauthorized access to systems
change frequently and generally are not recognized until they are launched against a target, the platforms or other service providers may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. In addition, certain
legal or regulatory provisions may require companies to notify individuals of data security breaches involving their personal data. If security measures are breached because of third-party action, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise, or if
design flaws in software are exposed and exploited, relationships with borrowers and investors could be severely damaged. Any failure of the systems technology on which the Fund relies or other similar issues could have a material adverse effect on
the ability of the Fund to acquire, monitor or otherwise transact in alternative lending-related securities and, therefore, may impact the performance of the Fund.  All of these potential risks may cause a decrease in the amount of loans acquired by the platforms, which may directly affect the Fund and its ability to achieve its investment objective. The potential
for security breaches may also adversely affect the Fund due to its reputational impact on the platforms and wider effect on the alternative lending industry as a whole. Any of the foregoing failures or disruptions could have a material adverse
effect on the performance of the Fund.  Equity Investment Risk 
Equities fluctuate in price, and their short-term volatility at times may be great. To the extent that the Fund obtains exposure to
equity securities, the value of the Fund’s portfolio will be affected by changes in the stock markets. Market risk can affect the Fund’s net asset value per share, which will fluctuate as the values of the Fund’s portfolio securities
change. The prices of individual equity securities do not all move in the same direction uniformly or at the same time. Different stock markets may behave differently from one another. 
  59 


Small and Mid-Capitalization Investing Risk 
The Fund may gain exposure to the securities of small capitalization companies, mid-capitalization companies, recently organized
companies and derivative instruments related to those securities. For example, the Fund may invest in equity or debt securities of companies in or related to the alternative lending industry or may gain exposure to the borrowings of such issuers
facilitated through an alternative lending platform. Historically, such securities, and particularly securities of smaller capitalization companies, have been more volatile in price than those of larger capitalized, more established companies. Many
of the risks that apply to small capitalization companies apply equally to mid-capitalization companies, and such companies are included in the term “small capitalization companies” for the purposes of this risk factor. The securities of
small capitalization and recently organized companies pose greater investment risks because such companies may have limited product lines, distribution channels and financial and managerial resources. In particular, small capitalization companies
may be operating at a loss or have significant variations in operating results; may be engaged in a rapidly changing business with products subject to substantial risk of obsolescence; may require substantial additional capital to support their
operations, to finance expansion or to maintain their competitive position; and may have substantial borrowings or may otherwise have a weak financial condition. In addition, these companies may face intense competition, including competition from
companies with greater financial resources, more extensive development, manufacturing, marketing, and other capabilities and a larger number of qualified managerial and technical personnel. The equity securities of alternative lending platforms or
other issuers in this industry that are small capitalization companies are often traded over the counter or on regional exchanges and may not be traded in the volumes typical on a national securities exchange. Consequently, the Fund or entities in
which the Fund obtains exposure may be required to dispose of such securities or remain in a short position over a longer (and potentially less favorable) period of time than is required to dispose of or close out of a short position with respect to
the securities of larger, more established companies. Investments in equity or debt instruments issued by small capitalization companies may also be more difficult to value than other types of securities because of the foregoing considerations as
well as, if applicable, lower trading volumes. Investments in companies with limited or no operating histories are more speculative and entail greater risk than do investments in companies with an established operating record. 
Derivatives Risk  The
Fund may invest directly or indirectly in a variety of derivatives, including futures contracts, forwards, swaps and other exchange-traded and over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives contracts. Derivatives are financial contracts the value of which
depends on, or is derived from, an asset or other underlying reference. Derivatives involve the risk that changes in their value may not move as expected relative to changes in the value of the underlying reference asset they are designed to track.
The Fund may invest in derivatives for investment purposes and for hedging and risk management purposes. See the Statement of Additional Information for additional information of the various types and uses of derivatives in the Fund’s strategy.
 The use of derivatives involves risks that are in addition to, and potentially greater than, the risks of investing directly
in securities and other more traditional assets. In particular, the Fund’s use of OTC derivatives exposes it to the risk that the counterparties will be unable or unwilling to make timely settlement payments or otherwise honor their
obligations. An OTC derivatives contract typically can be closed only with the consent of the other party to the contract. If the counterparty defaults, the Fund will still have contractual remedies but may not be able to enforce them. Because the
contract for each OTC derivative is individually negotiated, the counterparty may interpret contractual terms differently than the Fund and, if it does, the Fund may decide not to pursue its claims against the counterparty to avoid incurring the
cost and unpredictability of legal proceedings. The Fund, therefore, may be unable to obtain payments the Adviser believes are owed to it under OTC derivatives contracts, or those payments may be delayed or made only after the Fund has incurred the
costs of litigation.  The Fund may invest in derivatives that (i) do not require the counterparty to post collateral
(e.g., foreign currency forwards), (ii) require collateral but that do not provide for the Fund’s security interest in it to be perfected, (iii) require a significant upfront deposit by the Fund unrelated to the
derivative’s intrinsic value or 
  60 



(iv) do not require that collateral be regularly marked-to-market. When a counterparty’s obligations are not fully secured by collateral, the Fund runs the risk of having limited
recourse if the counterparty defaults. Even when obligations are required by contract to be collateralized, the Fund often will not receive the collateral the day the collateral is required to be posted. 
The Fund may invest in derivatives with a limited number of counterparties and events affecting the creditworthiness of any of those
counterparties may have a pronounced effect on the Fund. During periods of market disruptions or stress, the Fund may have a greater need for cash to provide collateral for large swings in its mark-to-market obligations under the derivatives in
which it has invested.  Derivatives also present other risks described herein, including market risk, illiquidity risk,
currency risk and credit risk. Many derivatives, in particular OTC derivatives, are complex and their valuation often requires modeling and judgment, which increases the risk of mispricing or improper valuation. The pricing models used may not
produce valuations that are consistent with the values the Fund realizes when it closes or sells an OTC derivative. Valuation risk is more pronounced when the Fund enters into OTC derivatives with specialized terms because the value of those
derivatives in some cases is determined only by reference to similar derivatives with more standardized terms. As a result, incorrect valuations may result in increased cash payments to counterparties, undercollateralization and/or errors in the
calculation of the Fund’s NAV.  The Fund’s use of derivatives may not be effective or have the desired results.
Moreover, suitable derivatives will not be available in all circumstances. The Adviser may decide not to use derivatives to hedge or otherwise reduce the Fund’s risk exposures, potentially resulting in losses for the Fund. 
Swap contracts and other OTC derivatives are highly susceptible to illiquidity risk (see “Illiquidity Risk”). Because many
derivatives have a leverage component (i.e., a notional value in excess of the assets needed to establish and/or maintain the derivative position), adverse changes in the value or level of the underlying reference asset may result in a loss
substantially greater than the amount invested in the derivative itself. (See “Leverage Risk.”)  There is little
case or other law interpreting the terms of most derivatives or characterizing their tax treatment. The Fund’s use of derivatives may be subject to special tax rules and could generate additional taxable income for shareholders. See
“Distributions and Federal Income Tax Matters” below.  Futures Risk. A purchase or sale of a
futures contract may result in losses in excess of the amount invested in the futures contract. There can be no guarantee that there will be a correlation between price movements in the futures and in the underlying reference asset positions
covering them. Futures exchanges may limit the amount of fluctuation permitted in certain futures contract prices during a single trading day. Once the daily limit has been reached in a futures contract subject to the limit, no more trades may be
made on that day at a price beyond that limit. The daily limit governs only price movements during a particular trading day and therefore does not limit potential losses because the limit may work to prevent the liquidation of unfavorable positions.
There can be no assurance that a liquid market will exist at a time when the Fund seeks to close out a futures contract, and the Fund would remain obligated to meet margin requirements until the position is closed. 
Forwards Risk. Forward contracts are subject to some of the same risks as futures described above. However,
forwards are not traded on exchanges and are not standardized; rather, banks and dealers act as principals in these markets negotiating each transaction on an individual basis. Trading in forward contracts is generally unregulated. There is no
limitation on the daily price movements of forward contracts. Principals in the forward markets have no obligation to continue to make markets in the forward contracts traded. There have been periods during which certain banks or dealers have
refused to quote prices for forward contracts or have quoted prices with an unusually wide spread between the price at which they are prepared to buy and that at which they are prepared to sell. Disruptions can occur

  61 



in the forward markets because of unusually high trading volume, political intervention or other factors. For example, the imposition of credit controls by governmental authorities might limit
forward trading, to the possible detriment of the Fund.  Swaps Risk. The use of swaps involves
investment techniques and risks that are different from those associated with portfolio security transactions. These instruments typically are not traded on exchanges; under recently adopted rules and regulations, however, transactions in some types
of swaps (including interest rate swaps and credit default swaps on North American and European indices) are required to be centrally cleared (“cleared swaps”). For OTC swaps, there is a risk that the other party to certain of these
instruments will not perform its obligations to the Fund or that the Fund may be unable to enter into offsetting positions to terminate its exposure or liquidate its position under certain of these instruments when it wishes to do so. Such
occurrences could result in losses to the Fund. For cleared swaps, the Fund’s counterparty is a clearinghouse rather than a bank or broker. Since the Fund is not a member of the clearinghouses and only members of a clearinghouse (“clearing
members”) can participate directly in the clearinghouse, the Fund holds cleared swaps through accounts at clearing members. In cleared swaps, the Fund makes payments (including margin payments) to and receives payments from a clearinghouse
through its account at clearing members. Clearing members guarantee performance of their clients’ obligations to the clearinghouse.  In some ways, cleared swap arrangements are less favorable to mutual funds than bilateral arrangements. For example, the Fund may be required to provide more margin for cleared swaps positions than for
bilateral derivatives positions. Also, in contrast to a bilateral derivatives position, following a period of notice to the Fund, a clearing member generally can require termination of an existing cleared swap position at any time or an increase in
margin requirements above the margin that the clearing member required at the beginning of a transaction. Clearinghouses also have broad rights to increase margin requirements for existing positions or to terminate those positions at any time. Any
increase in margin requirements or termination of existing cleared derivatives positions by the clearing member or the clearinghouse could interfere with the ability of the Fund to pursue its investment strategy. Further, any increase in margin
requirements by a clearing member could expose the Fund to greater credit risk to its clearing member because margin for cleared swaps positions in excess of a clearinghouse’s margin requirements typically is held by the clearing member. Also,
the Fund is subject to risk if it enters into a derivatives transaction that is required to be cleared (or that the Adviser expects to be cleared), and no clearing member is willing or able to clear the transaction on the Fund’s behalf. In
those cases, the position might have to be terminated, and the Fund could lose some or all of the benefit of the position, including loss of an increase in the value of the position and loss of hedging protection. In addition, the documentation
governing the relationship between the Fund and clearing members is drafted by the clearing members and generally is less favorable to the Fund than typical bilateral derivatives documentation. 
These and other new rules and regulations could, among other things, further restrict the Fund’s ability to engage
in, or increase the cost to the Fund of, derivatives transactions, for example, by making some types of derivatives no longer available to the Fund, increasing margin or capital requirements, or otherwise limiting liquidity or increasing transaction
costs. These rules and regulations are new and evolving, so their potential impact on the Fund and the financial system is not yet known. While the new rules and regulations and central clearing of some derivatives transactions are designed to
reduce systemic risk (i.e., the risk that the interdependence of large derivatives dealers could cause them to suffer liquidity, solvency or other challenges simultaneously), there is no assurance that they will achieve that result, and in
the meantime, as noted above, central clearing and related requirements expose the Fund to new kinds of costs and risks.  Swap agreements may be subject to contractual restrictions on transferability and termination and they may have terms of greater than seven days. The Fund’s obligations under a swap agreement will be
accrued daily (offset against any amounts owed to the Fund under the swap). 
  62 


Subsidiary Risk  By investing through its Subsidiaries, the Fund is exposed to the risks associated with the Subsidiaries’ investments. Subsidiaries will not be registered as investment companies under the 1940 Act
and will not be subject to all of the investor protections of the 1940 Act, although each Subsidiary will be managed pursuant to the compliance policies and procedures of the Fund applicable to it. Changes in the laws of the United States and/or the
jurisdiction in which a Subsidiary is organized could result in the inability of the Fund and/or the Subsidiary to operate as described in this prospectus and could adversely affect the Fund.  Short Sale Risk  Short sales are transactions in which the Fund sells
directly or indirectly an asset it does not own to a third party by paying a premium to borrow the asset in anticipation of purchasing the same asset at the market price on a later date to close out the short position. The Fund may incur a loss if
the market price of the asset underlying the short sale increases between the date of the short sale and the date on which the Fund must replace the borrowed asset or otherwise close out the transaction and such loss may exceed the initial
investment. Under adverse market conditions, the Fund may have difficulty purchasing an asset to meet its short sale delivery obligations, and may have to sell portfolio assets to raise sufficient capital to fulfill its short sale obligations at a
disadvantageous time. Entering into short sales where the Fund does not own the underlying asset creates a form of investment leverage, which can magnify the Fund’s exposure to changes in the value of the asset. Because the Fund may enter into
short sales with respect to assets that it does not already own, the loss to the Fund from a short sale is theoretically unlimited, as the potential increase in the market price of the asset is unlimited. The amount of any gain will be decreased,
and the amount of any loss increased, by the amount of the premium, dividends, interest, or expenses the Fund may be required to pay in connection with a short sale. There can be no assurance that the Fund will be able to close out a short sales
position at an advantageous time or price. To the extent that the Fund enters into short sales for hedging purposes, there can be no guarantee that the investment will be effective; any lack of correlation between the assets used in the short
position and the exposure the Fund sought to hedge could result in losses.  Small and Mid-Capitalization Investing Risk 
The Fund may gain exposure to the securities of small capitalization companies, mid-capitalization companies, recently organized
companies and derivative instruments related to those securities. For example, the Fund may invest in equity or debt securities of companies in or related to the alternative lending industry or may gain exposure to the borrowings of such issuers
facilitated through an alternative lending platform. Historically, such securities, and particularly securities of smaller capitalization companies, have been more volatile in price than those of larger capitalized, more established companies. Many
of the risks that apply to small capitalization companies apply equally to mid-capitalization companies, and such companies are included in the term “small capitalization companies” for the purposes of this risk factor. The securities of
small capitalization and recently organized companies pose greater investment risks because such companies may have limited product lines, distribution channels and financial and managerial resources. In particular, small capitalization companies
may be operating at a loss or have significant variations in operating results; may be engaged in a rapidly changing business with products subject to substantial risk of obsolescence; may require substantial additional capital to support their
operations, to finance expansion or to maintain their competitive position; and may have substantial borrowings or may otherwise have a weak financial condition. In addition, these companies may face intense competition, including competition from
companies with greater financial resources, more extensive development, manufacturing, marketing, and other capabilities and a larger number of qualified managerial and technical personnel. The equity securities of alternative lending platforms or
other issuers in this industry that are small capitalization companies are often traded over the counter or on regional exchanges and may not be traded in the volumes typical on a national securities exchange. Consequently, the Fund or entities in
which the Fund obtains exposure may be required to dispose of such securities or remain in a short position over a longer (and potentially less favorable) period of time than is required to dispose of or close out of a short position with respect to
the securities of larger, more established companies. Investments in equity or debt instruments issued 
  63 



by small capitalization companies may also be more difficult to value than other types of securities because of the foregoing considerations as well as, if applicable, lower trading volumes.
Investments in companies with limited or no operating histories are more speculative and entail greater risk than do investments in companies with an established operating record.  Tax Risk  The Fund intends to qualify for treatment as a RIC under the
Code. In order to qualify for such treatment, the Fund must derive at least 90% of its gross income each taxable year from qualifying income, meet certain asset diversification tests at the end of each fiscal quarter, and distribute at least
90% of its investment company taxable income. The Fund’s investment strategy will potentially be limited by its intention to qualify for treatment as a RIC. The tax treatment of certain of the Fund’s investments under one or more of the
qualification or distribution tests applicable to RICs is not certain. An adverse determination or future guidance by the IRS might affect the Fund’s ability to qualify for such treatment. 
If, in any year, the Fund were to fail to qualify for treatment as a RIC under the Code for any reason, and were not able to cure such
failure, the Fund would be subject to tax on its taxable income at corporate rates, and all distributions from earnings and profits, including any distributions of net tax-exempt income and net long-term capital gains, would be taxable to
shareholders as ordinary income.  Non-Diversification Risk  The Fund is classified as a “non-diversified” fund under the 1940 Act. Accordingly, the Fund may invest a greater portion of its assets in the securities of a single issuer than if it were a
“diversified” fund. To the extent that the Fund invests a higher percentage of its assets in the securities of a single issuer, the Fund is subject to a higher degree of risk associated with and developments affecting that issuer than a
fund that invests more widely.  Repurchase Offers Risk  As described under “Periodic Repurchase Offers” below, the Fund is an “interval fund” and, in order to provide liquidity to shareholders, the Fund, subject to applicable law, will
conduct quarterly repurchase offers of the Fund’s outstanding Shares at NAV per quarter, subject to approval of the Board. In all cases such repurchases will be for at least 5% and not more than 25%, and are currently expected to be for 5%, of
its outstanding Shares at NAV, pursuant to Rule 23c-3 under the 1940 Act. The Fund believes that these repurchase offers are generally beneficial to the Fund’s shareholders, and repurchases generally will be funded from available cash or sales
of portfolio securities, which are substantially illiquid. However, repurchase offers and the need to fund repurchase obligations may affect the ability of the Fund to be fully invested or force the Fund to maintain a higher percentage of its assets
in liquid investments, which may harm the Fund’s investment performance. Moreover, diminution in the size of the Fund through repurchases may result in untimely sales of portfolio securities (with associated imputed transaction costs, which may
be significant), and may limit the ability of the Fund to participate in new investment opportunities or to achieve its investment objective. In compliance with its procedures, the Fund will, to the extent possible, hold at least 5% of net assets in
cash or other liquid assets at all times in order to meet its repurchase obligations. The Fund may accumulate cash by holding back (i.e., not reinvesting) payments received in connection with the Fund’s investments. The Fund believes
that payments received in connection with the Fund’s investments will generate sufficient cash to meet the maximum potential amount of the Fund’s repurchase obligations. If at any time cash and other liquid assets held by the Fund are not
sufficient to meet the Fund’s repurchase obligations, the Fund intends, if necessary, to sell investments. Although the Fund’s investments are illiquid and the secondary market for its investments is limited, the Fund believes that it
would be able to find willing buyers for investments if such sales were ever necessary to supplement such cash generated by payments received in connection with the Fund’s investments. If the Fund employed investment leverage, repurchases of
Shares would compound the adverse effects of leverage in a declining market. In addition, if the Fund borrows to finance repurchases, interest on that borrowing will negatively affect shareholders who do not tender their Shares by increasing the
Fund’s expenses and reducing any net investment 
  64 



income. If a repurchase offer is oversubscribed the Fund will repurchase the Shares tendered on a pro rata basis, and shareholders will have to wait until the next repurchase offer to make
another repurchase request. As a result, shareholders may be unable to liquidate all or a given percentage of their investment in the Fund during a particular repurchase offer. Some shareholders, in anticipation of proration, may tender more Shares
than they wish to have repurchased in a particular quarter, thereby increasing the likelihood that proration will occur. A shareholder may be subject to market and other risks, and the NAV of Shares tendered in a repurchase offer may decline between
the Repurchase Request Deadline and the date on which the NAV for tendered Shares is determined. In addition, the repurchase of Shares by the Fund may be a taxable event to shareholders.  Portfolio Turnover  A change in the securities held by the Fund is known
as “portfolio turnover.” If the Fund realizes capital gains when it sells investments, it generally must pay those gains to shareholders, increasing its taxable distributions, including distributions of short-term capital gain, which are
taxable as ordinary income to shareholders. Increased portfolio turnover may also result in higher brokerage fees or other transaction costs, which can reduce the Fund’s performance. Portfolio turnover will not be a limiting factor should the
Adviser deem it advisable to purchase or sell securities.  Temporary Defensive and Interim Investments 
For temporary defensive purposes in times of adverse or unstable market, economic or political conditions, the Fund can invest up to 100%
of its assets in investments that may be inconsistent with its principal investment strategies. Generally, the Fund would invest in money market instruments or in other short-term U.S. or non-U.S. government securities. The Fund might also hold
these types of securities as interim investments pending the investment of proceeds from the sale of its Shares or the sale of its portfolio securities or to meet anticipated redemptions of its Shares. To the extent the Fund invests in these
securities, it might not achieve its investment objective.  Expense Risk 
Your actual costs of investing in the Fund may be higher than the expenses shown in “Annual Fund Operating Expenses” for a
variety of reasons. For example, expense ratios may be higher than those shown if overall net assets decrease. The Fund’s expense limitation agreements, which generally remain in effect for a period of one year, mitigate this risk. However,
there is no assurance that the Adviser will renew such expense limitation agreements from year-to-year.  Reporting Requirements
 Shareholders who beneficially own Shares that constitute more than 5% of the Fund’s Shares are subject to certain
requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), and the rules promulgated thereunder. These include requirements to file certain reports with the SEC (e.g., reports pursuant to Section 13 of
the Exchange Act). The Fund has no obligation to file such reports on behalf of such shareholders or to notify shareholders that such reports are required to be made. Shareholders who may be subject to such requirements should consult with their
legal advisors.  Anti-Takeover Provisions  The Fund’s Declaration of Trust, together with any amendments thereto, includes provisions that could limit the ability of other entities or persons to acquire control of the Fund or convert the Fund
to open-end status.  No Prior History  The Fund is a newly-organized closed-end management investment company with no history of operations, thus has no financial statements or other meaningful operating or financial data on which potential
investors may evaluate the Fund and its performance, and is designed for long-term investors and not as a trading vehicle.

MANAGEMENT OF THE FUND 
Board of Trustees  The
Board oversees the conduct of the Fund’s affairs and the Adviser’s management of the Fund.  The Adviser 
Stone Ridge Asset Management LLC acts as the Fund’s investment manager under an Investment Advisory Agreement (the “Advisory
Agreement”). The Adviser’s principal office is located at 510 Madison Ave, 21st Floor, New York City, NY 10022. As of March 31, 2016, Stone Ridge managed approximately $6.35 billion of assets. Stone Ridge is a Delaware limited
liability company.  Under the general oversight of the Board, the Adviser will carry out the investment and reinvestment of
the assets of the Fund, will furnish continuously an investment program with respect to the Fund, will determine which investments should be purchased, sold or exchanged and will implement such determinations by causing the Fund to make investments
directly or through its Subsidiaries. The Adviser will compensate all trustees and officers of the Fund who are members of the Adviser’s organization and who render investment services to the Fund. The Fund pays a portion of the salary of the
chief compliance officer to the Fund. The Fund has agreed to pay the Adviser as compensation under the Advisory Agreement a fee in the amount of 1.50% of the average daily net assets of the Fund. Stone Ridge may voluntarily reimburse additional fees
and expenses but is under no obligation to do so. Any such voluntary reimbursements may be terminated at any time. A discussion regarding the basis for the Board’s approval of the Advisory Agreement will be available in the Fund’s
semi-annual report to Shareholders, which will cover the period ending September 30, 2016.  Paul Germain, Robert

Oversight Board.  Legal Counsel. Ropes & Gray LLP, located at 800 Boylston Street, Boston,
Massachusetts, acts as legal counsel to the Fund.  Distributions 
The Fund intends to declare and pay dividends of substantially all net investment income and net realized capital gains at least
annually, although the Fund may declare and pay dividends more frequently (e.g., quarterly). Unless shareholders specify otherwise, dividends will be reinvested in Shares of the Fund. The Fund may pay distributions from sources that may not
be available in the future and that are unrelated to the Fund’s performance, such as from offering proceeds, borrowings and amounts from the Fund’s affiliates that are subject to repayment by investors. 
SHAREHOLDER GUIDE  PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION  Quasar Distributors, LLC,
located at 615 East Michigan Street, Milwaukee, Wisconsin 53202 (the “Distributor”), is the principal underwriter of Shares of the Fund. Shares may be purchased only through the Distributor. The Distributor acts as the distributor of
Shares for the Fund on a best efforts basis, subject to various conditions, pursuant to the terms of its contract with the Fund. The Distributor is not obligated to sell any specific amount of Shares of the Fund. The Distributor will also act as
agent for the Fund in connection with repurchases of Shares.  Shares of the Fund will be continuously offered through the
Distributor, as the exclusive distributor. The Fund has authorized one or more intermediaries (e.g., brokers, investment advisers, etc. collectively “Intermediaries”) to receive orders on its behalf. Such Intermediaries are
authorized to designate other Intermediaries to receive orders on the Fund’s behalf. The Fund will be deemed to have received an order when an authorized broker or, if applicable, a broker’s authorized designee, receives the order. The
Shares will be offered at NAV per share calculated each regular business day.  The Fund and the Distributor will have the sole
right to accept orders to purchase Shares and reserve the right to reject any order in whole or in part.  Investors may be
charged a fee if they effect transactions through an Intermediary.  No market currently exists for the Fund’s Shares.
The Fund will not list its Shares for trading on any securities exchange. There is currently no secondary market for its Shares and the Fund does not anticipate that a secondary market will develop for its Shares. Neither the Adviser nor the
Distributor intends to make a market in the Fund’s Shares.  The Distributor is not obligated to buy any of the Shares and
does not intend to make a market in the Shares. The Fund has agreed to indemnify the Distributor and certain of the Distributor’s affiliates against certain liabilities, including certain liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933
Act, as amended. To the extent consistent with applicable law, the Distributor has agreed to indemnify the Fund and each Trustee against certain liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and in connection with the services rendered
to the Fund.

HOW TO BUY SHARES 
Shareholders who invest in the Fund through an Intermediary should contact their financial Intermediary regarding purchase procedures.
Shares generally are available for investment only by clients of registered investment advisers and a limited number of certain other Eligible Investors. All investments are subject to approval of the Adviser, and all investors must complete and
submit the necessary account registration forms in good order. The Fund reserves the right to reject any initial or additional investment and to suspend the offering of Shares. Purchase through an Intermediary does not affect these eligibility
requirements.  A purchase of Shares will be made at the NAV per share next determined following receipt of a purchase order in
good order by the Fund, its authorized agent, its Distributor’s authorized agent, or authorized Intermediary or the Intermediary’s authorized designee if received at a time when the Fund is open to new investments. A purchase order is in
“good order” when the Fund, its Distributor’s agent, an authorized Intermediary or, if applicable, an Intermediary’s authorized designee, receives all required information, including properly completed and signed documents, and
the purchase order is approved by the Adviser. Once the Fund (or one of its authorized agents) accepts a purchase order, you may not cancel or revoke it. The Fund reserves the right to cancel any purchase order it receives if the Fund believes that
it is in the best interest of the Fund’s shareholders to do so.  Clients of investment advisory organizations may also be
subject to investment advisory fees under their own arrangements with such organizations.  Shares are offered to the following
groups of investors (“Eligible Investors”):   


 
1.
 Institutional investors, including registered investment advisers (RIAs); 
 


 
2.
 Clients of institutional investors;   


 
3.
 Tax-exempt retirement plans of the Adviser and its affiliates and rollover accounts from those plans; 
 


 
4.
 Certain other Eligible Investors as approved from time to time by the Adviser. Eligible Investors include employees, directors and affiliates of the
Adviser and the Fund; and   


 
5.
 Other fiduciaries investing for their own accounts or for the account of their clients. 
Some Intermediaries may impose different or additional eligibility requirements. The Adviser has the discretion to further modify or
waive their eligibility requirements.  Shares of the Fund generally may be sold only to U.S. citizens, U.S. residents, and
U.S. domestic corporations, partnerships, trusts or estates. The Fund reserves the right to refuse any request to purchase Shares. The Shares are subject to the investment minimums described below. 
Investment Minimums 
The minimum initial account size is $15 million. This minimum investment requirement may be modified or reduced as follows: 
For eligibility groups 3, 4 and 5 described above under “How to Buy Shares,” there will be no minimum investment requirement.
 Investment minimums may be waived by the Board or pursuant to procedures adopted by the Board. 
Other Policies 
No Share Certificates. The issuance of Shares is recorded electronically on the books of the Fund. You will receive
a confirmation of, or account statement reflecting, each new transaction in your account, which will also 
  69 



show the total number of Shares of the Fund you own. You can rely on these statements in lieu of certificates. The Fund does not issue certificates representing Shares of the Fund. 
Customer Identification Program  To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify and record information that identifies each person
that opens a new account, and to determine whether such person’s name appears on government lists of known or suspected terrorists and terrorist organizations. As a result, the Fund must obtain the following information for each person that
opens a new account:   


 
•
 
 Name;   


 
•
 
 Date of birth (for individuals);   


 
•
 
 Residential or business street address (although post office boxes are still permitted for mailing); and 
 


 
•
 
 Social Security number, taxpayer identification number, or other identifying number. 
You may also be asked for a copy of your driver’s license, passport or other identifying document in order to verify your identity.
In addition, it may be necessary to verify your identity by cross-referencing your identification information with a consumer report or other electronic database. Additional information may be required to open accounts for corporations and other
entities.  Federal law prohibits the Fund and other financial institutions from opening a new account on behalf of a natural
person unless they receive the minimum identifying information listed above. After an account is opened, the Fund may restrict your ability to purchase additional Shares until your identity is verified. The Fund may close your account or take other
appropriate action if it is unable to verify your identity within a reasonable time. The Fund and its agents will not be responsible for any loss in an investor’s account resulting from the investor’s delay in providing all required
identifying information or from closing an account and redeeming an investor’s Shares when an investor’s identity is not verified.  In addition, the Fund may be required to “freeze” your account if there appears to be suspicious activity or if account information matches information on a government list of known terrorists
or other suspicious persons.  eDelivery  eDelivery allows you to receive your quarterly account statements, transaction confirmations and other important information concerning your investment in the Fund online. Select this option on your
account application to receive email notifications when quarterly statements and confirmations are available for you to view via secure online access. You will also receive emails whenever a new prospectus, semi-annual or annual fund report is
available. To establish eDelivery, call (855) 609-3680.  INITIAL ASSET CAP 
Upon commencement of investment operations, the Fund will initially cap its total assets at $1 billion (an “Initial Cap”). Once
the Initial Cap is met, the Fund will no longer accept new investors and only the reinvestment of dividends by existing investors will be permitted. Following the initial launch, the Fund may re-open to new investors and may subsequently close
again at any time at the discretion of the Adviser, irrespective of the Initial Cap amount.  In addition, upon commencement of
investment operations, the Fund will be made available for investment on a priority basis to a group of investors (the “Consortium”) who have participated in educational sessions regarding the Fund and the asset class in which it invests.
If capacity allows, once orders are fulfilled for the Consortium, the Fund will then be available for investment by other investors. The Fund may also prioritize and allocate 
  70 



capacity to the Consortium upon any subsequent re-opening of the Fund. The Consortium members do not have any special rights to offering price, dividends or liquidation. The Consortium is
expected to consist of a selected group of registered investment advisers who have discretionary authority to invest on their clients’ behalf and a fiduciary duty to their clients, and with whom the Adviser has a previous relationship. Members
of the Consortium and their clients are not obligated to invest in the Fund.  PERIODIC
REPURCHASE OFFERS  The Fund is a closed-end interval fund and, to provide liquidity and the ability to receive NAV on a
disposition of at least a portion of your Shares, makes periodic offers to repurchase Shares. Except as permitted by the Fund’s interval structure, no shareholder will have the right to require the Fund to repurchase its Shares. No public
market for Shares exists, and none is expected to develop in the future. Consequently, shareholders generally will not be able to liquidate their investment other than as a result of repurchases of their Shares by the Fund. 
The Fund has adopted, pursuant to Rule 23c-3 under the 1940 Act, a fundamental policy, which cannot be changed without shareholder
approval, requiring the Fund to offer to repurchase at least 5% and up to 25% of its Shares at NAV on a regular schedule. Although the policy permits repurchases of between 5% and 25% of the Fund’s outstanding Shares, for each quarterly
repurchase offer, the Fund currently expect to offer to repurchase 5% of the Fund’s outstanding Shares at NAV subject to approval of the Board. The schedule requires the Fund to make repurchase offers every three months. The Fund expects the
first repurchase offer to be issued in November 2016.  Repurchase Dates 
The Fund will make quarterly repurchase offers in the months of February, May, August and November. As discussed below, the date on which
the repurchase price for Shares is determined will be generally on or about the 15th day of the following month, but shall occur no later than the 14th day after the Repurchase Request Deadline (or the next business day, if the 14th day is not a
business day).  Repurchase Request Deadline  The date by which shareholders wishing to tender Shares for repurchase must respond to the repurchase offer typically falls approximately seven days before the Repurchase Pricing Date (defined below).
 When a repurchase offer commences, the Fund sends, at least 21 days before the Repurchase Request Deadline, written notice to
each shareholder setting forth, among other things:   


 
•
 
 The percentage of outstanding Shares that the Fund is offering to repurchase and how the Fund will purchase Shares on a pro rata basis if the offer
is oversubscribed.   


 
•
 
 The date on which a shareholder’s repurchase request is due (the repurchase deadline). 
 


 
•
 
 The date that will be used to determine the Fund’s NAV applicable to the repurchase offer (the “Repurchase Pricing Date”). See
“Repurchase Dates” above.   


 
•
 
 The date by which the Fund will pay to shareholders the proceeds from their Shares accepted for repurchase. 
 


 
•
 
 The NAV of the Shares as of a date no more than seven days before the date of the written notice and the means by which shareholders may ascertain
the NAV.   


 
•
 
 The procedures by which shareholders may tender their Shares and the right of shareholders to withdraw or modify their tenders before the Repurchase
Request Deadline.   


 
•
 
 The circumstances in which the Fund may suspend or postpone the repurchase offer.

This notice may be included in a shareholder report or other Fund document. The
Repurchase Request Deadline will be strictly observed. If a shareholder fails to submit a repurchase request in good order by the Repurchase Request Deadline, the shareholder will be unable to liquidate Shares until a subsequent repurchase
offer, and will have to resubmit a request in the next repurchase offer. Shareholders may withdraw or change a repurchase request with a proper instruction submitted in good form at any point before the Repurchase Request Deadline. 
Determination of Repurchase Price and Payment for Shares  The date on which the repurchase price for Shares is determined will be generally on or about the 15th day of the month that follows the repurchase offer (the “repurchase pricing date”), but
shall occur no later than the 14th day after the Repurchase Request Deadline (or the next business day, if the 14th day is not a business day). The Fund expects to distribute payment to shareholders between one and three business days after the
repurchase pricing date and will distribute such payment no later than seven (7) calendar days after such date. The Fund’s NAV per share may change materially between the date a repurchase offer is mailed and the Repurchase Request
Deadline, and it may also change materially between the Repurchase Request Deadline and repurchase pricing date. The method by which the Fund calculates NAV is discussed below under “Determination of Net Asset Value.” During the
period an offer to repurchase is open, shareholders may obtain the current NAV by calling the Fund’s transfer agent at (855) 609-3680.  The Fund does not currently charge a repurchase fee.  Suspension or Postponement of Repurchase
Offers  The Fund may suspend or postpone a repurchase offer in limited circumstances set forth in Rule 23c-3 under the
1940 Act, as described below, but only with the approval of a majority of the Trustees, including a majority of Trustees who are not “interested persons” of the Fund, as defined in the 1940 Act. 
The Fund may suspend or postpone a repurchase offer only: (1) if making or effecting the repurchase offer would cause the Fund to
lose its status as a regulated investment company under Subchapter M of the Code; (2) for any period during which the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) or any other market in which the securities owned by the Fund are principally
traded is closed, other than customary weekend and holiday closings, or during which trading in such market is restricted; (3) for any period during which an emergency exists as a result of which disposal by the Fund of securities owned by it
is not reasonably practicable, or during which it is not reasonably practicable for the Fund fairly to determine the value of its net assets; or (4) for such other periods as the SEC may by order permit for the protection of shareholders of the
Fund.  Oversubscribed Repurchase Offers  There is no minimum number of Shares that must be tendered before the Fund will honor repurchase requests. However, the Fund’s Trustees set for each repurchase offer a maximum percentage of Shares
that may be repurchased by the Fund. In the event a repurchase offer by the Fund is oversubscribed, the Fund may repurchase, but is not required to repurchase, additional Shares up to a maximum amount of 2% of the outstanding Shares of the Fund. If
the Fund determines not to repurchase additional Shares beyond the repurchase offer amount, or if shareholders tender an amount of Shares greater than that which the Fund is entitled to repurchase, the Fund will repurchase the Shares tendered on a
pro rata basis. The Fund does not currently expect to offer to repurchase additional Shares in the event a repurchase offer is oversubscribed.  If any Shares that you wish to tender to the Fund are not repurchased because of proration, you will have to wait until the next repurchase offer and resubmit a new repurchase request, and your repurchase
request will not be given any priority over other shareholders’ requests. Thus, there is a risk that the Fund may not purchase all of the Shares you wish to have repurchased in a given repurchase offer or in any subsequent repurchase offer. In
anticipation of the possibility of proration, some shareholders may tender more Shares than they wish to have repurchased in a particular quarter, increasing the likelihood of proration. 
  72 


There is no assurance that you will be able to tender your Shares when or in the amount
that you desire.  Consequences of Repurchase Offers  From the time the Fund distributes or publishes each repurchase offer notification until the repurchase pricing date for that offer, the Fund must maintain liquid assets at least equal to the percentage
of its Shares subject to the repurchase offer. For this purpose, “liquid assets” means assets that may be sold or otherwise disposed of in the ordinary course of business, at approximately the price at which the Fund values them, within
the period between the Repurchase Request Deadline and the repurchase payment deadline, or which mature by the repurchase payment deadline. The Fund will, to the extent possible, hold at least 5% of net assets in cash or other liquid assets at all
times in order to meet its repurchase obligations. The Fund is also permitted to borrow up to the maximum extent permitted under the 1940 Act to meet repurchase requests.  If the Fund borrows to finance repurchases, interest on that borrowing will negatively affect shareholders who do not tender their Shares by increasing the Fund’s expenses and reducing any net
investment income. There is no assurance that the Fund will be able sell a significant amount of additional Shares so as to mitigate these effects.  These and other possible risks associated with the Fund’s repurchase offers are described under “Principal Risks of Investment in the Fund — Repurchase Offers Risk” above. In addition,
the repurchase of Shares by the Fund will be a taxable event to shareholders, potentially even to those shareholders that do not participate in the repurchase. For a discussion of these tax consequences, see “Distributions and Federal Income
Tax Matters” below and “Tax Status” in the Statement of Additional Information. 
SERVICES AGREEMENT  The Fund has entered into a “Services Agreement” with the Adviser pursuant to which the Fund has appointed the Adviser as “servicing agent” to compensate financial industry
professionals for providing ongoing services in respect of clients with whom they have distributed Shares of the Fund. These financial industry professionals may provide varying investment products, programs, platforms and accounts, through which
investors may purchase, redeem and exchange Shares of the Fund. Shareholder servicing arrangements may include electronic processing of client orders, electronic fund transfers between clients and the Fund, account reconciliations with the
Fund’s transfer agent, facilitation of electronic delivery to clients of Fund documentation, monitoring client accounts for back-up withholding and any other special tax reporting obligations, maintenance of books and records with respect to
the foregoing, and such other information and liaison services as the Fund or the Adviser may reasonably request. Under the Services Agreement, the Fund pays the Adviser, quarterly in arrears, an investor services fee computed at an annual rate of
0.10% of the average daily net assets of the Fund, computed on a monthly basis.  PAYMENTS TO
FINANCIAL FIRMS  The Fund or the Adviser also may enter into agreements with certain Intermediaries under which the Fund
makes payments to the Intermediaries in recognition of the avoided transfer agency costs to the Fund associated with the Intermediaries’ maintenance of customer accounts or in recognition of the services provided by Intermediaries through fund
platforms. Payments made by the Fund or the Adviser under such agreements are generally based on either (1) a percentage of the average daily net asset value of the customer Shares serviced by the Intermediary, up to a set maximum, or
(2) a per account fee assessed against each account serviced by such Intermediary, up to a set maximum. These payments are in addition to other payments described in this prospectus such as the Services Agreement. Investors who invest through
financial firms are subject to the eligibility requirements set out herein.  DETERMINATION OF NET
ASSET VALUE  The NAV of the Fund’s Shares is determined by dividing the total value of the Fund’s portfolio
investments, plus cash and other assets, less any liabilities (including accrued expenses or dividends), by the total number of Shares 
  73 



outstanding. The Fund’s Shares are valued as of a particular time (the “Valuation Time”) on each day that the NYSE opens for business.1 The Valuation Time is ordinarily at the close of regular trading on
the NYSE (normally 4:00 p.m. Eastern time). Current net asset values per share of the Fund may be obtained by contacting the Transfer Agent by telephone at (855) 609-3680. 
The Board has approved procedures pursuant to which the Fund will value its investments. In accordance with these procedures, the
Fund’s investments for which market quotations are readily available are valued at market value. Market values for various types of securities and other instruments are determined on the basis of closing prices or last sale prices on an
exchange or other market, or based on quotes or other market information obtained from quotation reporting systems, established market makers, brokers, data delivery vendors or pricing services. To the extent the Fund invests in open-end management
companies that are registered under the 1940 Act, the Fund’s NAV will be calculated based upon the net asset value of such funds. The prospectuses for such funds explain the circumstances under which they will use fair value pricing and its
effects. Please see “Computation of Net Asset Value” in the Statement of Additional Information for more information. Short-term debt securities, which have a maturity date of 60 days or less, are valued at amortized cost. 
If market quotations are not readily available (including in cases where available market quotations are deemed to be unreliable or
infrequent), the Fund’s investments will be valued as determined in good faith pursuant to policies and procedures approved by the Board (“fair value pricing”). In these circumstances, the Fund determines fair value in a manner that
seeks to reflect the market value of the security on the valuation date based on consideration of any information or factors it deems appropriate as further described below. Pursuant to the Fund’s policies and procedures, most of the
Fund’s holdings in alternative lending-related securities are fair valued based on prices provided by a third-party pricing service. The Fund accounts for whole and fractional loans at the individual loan level for valuation purposes, and whole
loans are fair valued using inputs that take into account borrower-level data (e.g., payment history) that is updated periodically as often as the NAV is calculated to reflect new information regarding the borrower or loan. The Valuation
Committee (the “Committee”) (comprised of officers of the Adviser and established pursuant to the policies and procedures adopted by the Board) has the responsibility for overseeing the implementation of the Fund’s valuation
procedures and fair value determinations made on behalf of the Board. For purposes of determining the fair value of securities, the Committee may consider, without limitation: (i) indications or quotes from brokers, (ii) valuations
provided by a third-party pricing agent, (iii) internal models that take into consideration different factors determined to be relevant by the Adviser; or (iv) any combination of the above. Fair value pricing may require subjective
determinations about the value of an asset or liability. The values of the Funds’ investments in publicly traded foreign equity securities generally will be determined by a pricing service using pricing models designed to estimate likely
changes in the values of those securities between the times in which the trading in those securities is substantially completed and the close of the NYSE. Fair values used to determine the Fund’s NAVs may differ from quoted or published prices,
or from prices that are used by others, for the same investments. The use of fair value pricing may not always result in adjustments to the prices of securities or other assets or liabilities held by the Fund. 
It is possible that the fair value determined for a security may be materially different than the value that could be realized upon the
sale of such security. Thus, fair valuation may have an unintended dilutive or accretive effect on the value of shareholders’ investments in the Fund. Information that becomes known to the Funds or their agents after the NAV has been calculated
on a particular day will not be used to retroactively adjust the price of a security or the NAV determined earlier that day. 
It is expected that a substantial portion of the Fund’s investments will be U.S. dollar denominated investments. Investments
initially valued in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are converted to U.S. dollars using exchange   


1 
 The NYSE is open from Monday through Friday, 9:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m., Eastern time. NYSE, NYSE Arca, NYSE Bonds and NYSE Arca Options markets will
generally close on, and in observation of the following holidays: New Year’s Day, Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, Washington’s Birthday, Good Friday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day.

  74 



rates obtained from pricing services. As a result, the NAV of the Fund’s Shares may be affected by changes in the value of currencies in relation to the U.S. dollar. International markets
are sometimes open on days when U.S. markets are closed, which means that the value of foreign securities owned by the Fund could change on days when Fund Shares cannot be bought or sold. The value of investments traded in markets outside the U.S.
or denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar may be affected significantly on a day that the NYSE is closed, and the NAV of the Fund’s Shares may change on days when an investor is not able to purchase, redeem or exchange Shares. The
calculation of the Fund’s NAV may not take place contemporaneously with the determination of the prices of foreign securities used in NAV calculations.  DISTRIBUTIONS AND FEDERAL INCOME TAX MATTERS 
It is the Fund’s policy to make distributions at least annually of all or substantially all of its net investment income and net
realized capital gains, if any. Unless you elect to receive your distributions in cash, your ordinary income and capital gain distributions will be reinvested in additional Shares of the same share class of the Fund at the NAV calculated as of the
payment date. The Fund will pay distributions on a per-share basis. As a result, on the ex-dividend date of such a payment, the NAV of the Fund will be reduced by the amount of the payment. 
This section summarizes some of the important U.S. federal income tax consequences of investing in the Fund. This discussion does not
address all aspects of taxation that may apply to shareholders or to specific types of shareholders such as tax-deferred retirement plans and persons who are not “U.S. persons” within the meaning of the Code. You should consult your tax
adviser for information concerning the possible application of federal, state, local or non-U.S. tax laws to you. Please see the Statement of Additional Information for additional information regarding the tax aspects of investing in the Fund.
 The Fund intends to elect to be treated and to qualify and be treated each year as a “regulated investment company”
(“RIC”) under Subchapter M of Chapter 1 of the Internal Review Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). To qualify for treatment as a RIC, the Fund must meet certain income, asset diversification and distribution requirements.
 The Fund’s investment strategy will potentially be limited by its intention to qualify for treatment as a regulated
investment company. The tax treatment of certain of the Fund’s investments under one or more of the qualification or distribution tests applicable to RICs is not certain. An adverse determination or future guidance by the IRS might affect the
Fund’s ability to qualify for such treatment. Failure of the Fund to qualify and be eligible to be treated as a RIC would result in fund-level taxation and, consequently, a reduced return on your investment. The Fund could in some cases cure
such failure, including by paying a Fund-level tax or interest, making additional distributions, or disposing of certain assets.  The Fund may invest in one or more wholly-owned Subsidiaries. It is currently expected that any such Subsidiary will be a disregarded entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In the case of a
Subsidiary that is a disregarded entity for such purposes (i) the Fund is treated as owning the Subsidiary’s assets directly; (ii) any income, gain, loss, deduction or other tax items arising in respect of the Subsidiary’s assets
will be treated as if they are realized or incurred, as applicable, directly by the Fund; and (ii) any distributions the Fund receives from the Subsidiary will have no effect on the Fund’s U.S. federal income tax liability. 
The tax treatment of the Fund’s investments in the securities of special purpose entities that acquire and hold alternative
lending-related securities will depend on the terms of such investments and may affect the amount, timing or character of income recognized by the Fund.  The Fund’s investment in foreign securities may be subject to foreign withholding or other taxes, which may decrease the Fund’s yield on those securities. 
In addition, the Fund’s investments in debt instruments, foreign securities, foreign currencies, and options and other derivatives
may increase or accelerate the Fund’s recognition of income or gain and may affect the timing, amount or character of the Fund’s distributions. 
  75 


For federal income tax purposes, distributions of net investment income are generally
taxable to shareholders as ordinary income. The tax treatment of Fund distributions of capital gains is determined by how long the Fund owned (or is deemed to have owned) the investments that generated them, rather than how long you owned your
Shares. Distributions of net capital gains (the excess of the Fund’s net long-term capital gains over its net short-term capital losses) that are properly reported by the Fund as capital gain dividends (“Capital Gain Dividends”) will
be taxable as long-term capital gains, which are taxed to non-corporate shareholders at reduced rates. Distributions of net gains from the sale or deemed disposition of investments that the Fund held or is treated as having held for one year or less
will be taxable as ordinary income.  Distributions of investment income properly reported by the Fund as derived from
“qualified dividend income,” if any, will be taxed in the hands of individuals at the rates applicable to long-term capital gains, provided that certain holding period and other requirements are met at both the shareholder and Fund level.
 If, in and with respect to any taxable year, the Fund makes a distribution to a shareholder in excess of the Fund’s
current and accumulated earnings and profits, the excess distribution will be treated as a return of capital to the extent of such shareholder’s tax basis in its shares, and thereafter as capital gain. A return of capital is not taxable, but it
reduces a shareholder’s tax basis in its shares, thus reducing any loss or increasing any gain on a subsequent taxable disposition by the shareholder of its shares.  A 3.8% Medicare contribution tax is imposed on the “net investment income” of certain individuals, estates and trusts to the extent their income exceeds certain threshold amounts. “Net
investment income” generally includes dividends, interest, and net gains from the disposition of investment property (including the Fund’s ordinary income dividends, Capital Gain Dividends, and capital gains recognized on the sale,
repurchase, or exchange of Fund Shares). Shareholders should consult their own tax advisers regarding the effect, if any, that this provision may have on their investment in Fund Shares. 
A distribution will be treated as paid on December 31 of the current calendar year if it is declared by the Fund in October,
November or December with a record date in such a month and paid by the Fund during January of the following calendar year. 
Distributions are taxable to you even if they are paid from income or gains earned by the Fund prior to your investment (and thus were
included in the price you paid for your Shares). For example, if you purchase Shares on or just before the record date of a Fund distribution, you will pay full price for the Shares and could receive a portion of your investment back as a taxable
distribution. In general, you will be taxed on the distributions you receive from the Fund, whether you receive them as additional Shares or in cash.  Any gain or loss resulting from the sale or exchange of your Shares in the Fund generally will be treated as a capital gain or loss for federal income tax purposes, which will be long-term or short-term
depending on how long you have held your Shares.  Shareholders who offer all of the Shares they hold or are deemed to hold in
response to a Periodic Repurchase Offer (see “Periodic Repurchase Offers” above) generally will be treated as having sold their Shares and generally will recognize a capital gain or loss. If a shareholder tenders fewer than all of its
common Shares, it is possible that any amounts that the shareholder receives in such repurchase will be taxable as a dividend to such shareholder, and there is a risk that shareholders who do not tender any of their Shares for repurchase will be
treated as having received a dividend distribution as a result of their proportionate increase in the ownership of the Fund. The Fund’s use of cash to repurchase Shares could adversely affect its ability to satisfy the distribution requirements
for treatment as a RIC. The Fund could also recognize income in connection with its liquidation of portfolio securities to fund Share repurchases. Any such income would be taken into account in determining whether the distribution requirements are
satisfied.  In general, dividends (other than Capital Gain Dividends) paid by the Fund to a person who is not a “U.S.
person” within the meaning of the Code (a “foreign shareholder”) are subject to withholding of U.S. federal 
  76 



income tax at a rate of 30% (or lower applicable treaty rate). However, the Code provides a withholding tax exemption, if the Fund so elects for certain interest-related dividends and short-term
capital gain dividends paid to foreign shareholders.  Sections 1471-1474 of the Code, and the U.S. Treasury Regulations and
IRS guidance issued thereunder (collectively, “FATCA”), generally require the Fund to obtain information sufficient to identify the status of each of its shareholders under FATCA or under an applicable intergovernmental agreement (an
“IGA”). If a shareholder fails to provide this information or otherwise fails to comply with FATCA or an IGA, the Fund or its agent may be required to withhold under FATCA 30% of the dividends it pays, and, on or after January 1, 2017
(which date, under recent Treasury guidance, is expected to be delayed until on or after January 1, 2019), 30% of the gross proceeds of share repurchases and certain Capital Gain Dividends it pays. If a payment by the Fund is subject to FATCA
withholding, the Fund or its agent is required to withhold even if the payment would otherwise be exempt from withholding under rules applicable to non-U.S. shareholders (e.g., Capital Gain Dividends). Each prospective shareholder is urged to
consult its tax adviser regarding the applicability of FATCA and any other reporting requirements. In addition, foreign countries are considering, and may implement, laws similar in purpose and scope to FATCA, as more fully described above.
 The discussion above is very general. Please consult your tax adviser about the effect that an investment in the Fund could
have on your own tax situation, including possible foreign, federal, state, or local tax consequences, or about any other tax questions you may have.  DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN  Dividends and
capital gains distributions are automatically reinvested, unless otherwise noted. You may notify the Transfer Agent in writing to:   


 
•
 
 Choose to receive dividends or distributions (or both) in cash; or 
 


 
•
 
 Change the way you currently receive distributions.  Shares may be distributed in lieu of cash. The number of Shares that will be distributed in lieu of cash is determined by dividing the dollar amount of the distribution to be reinvested by the NAV as of
the close of business on the day of the distribution.  Your taxable income is the same regardless of which option you choose.
For further information about dividend reinvestment, contact the Transfer Agent by telephone at (855) 
609-3680.  DESCRIPTION OF THE FUND 
The Fund is an investment portfolio of Stone Ridge Trust V (the “Trust”), a statutory trust established under the laws of State
of Delaware by the Certificate of Trust dated November 4, 2015. The Trust’s Declaration of Trust authorizes the issuance of an unlimited number of common Shares of beneficial interest, par value, unless the Trustees shall otherwise
determine, $0.001 per share. All Shares have equal rights to the payment of dividends and other distributions and the distribution of assets upon liquidation. Shares will, when issued, be fully paid and non-assessable by the Fund and will have no
pre-emptive or conversion rights or rights to cumulative voting.  Shareholders are entitled to share equally in dividends
declared by the Board payable to holders of Shares and in the net assets of the Fund available for distribution to holders of Shares upon liquidation after payment of the preferential amounts payable to holders of any outstanding preferred shares.
 The Declaration of Trust provides for indemnification out of Fund property for all loss and expense of any shareholder or
former shareholder held personally liable for the obligations of the Fund solely by reason of such person’s status as a shareholder or former shareholder. Thus, the risk of a shareholder incurring financial loss on account of shareholder
liability is limited to circumstances in which the Fund would be unable to meet its obligations. 
  77 


Shareholders have no pre-emptive or conversion rights. Upon liquidation of the Fund, after
paying or adequately providing for the payment of all liabilities of the Fund, and upon receipt of such releases, indemnities and refunding agreements as they deem necessary for their protection, the Trustees may distribute the remaining assets of
the Fund among the holders of the Shares.  The Board may classify or reclassify any issued or unissued Shares of the Fund into
shares of any class by redesignating such Shares or by setting or changing in any one or more respects, from time to time, the preferences, conversion or other rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to dividends, qualifications, or
terms or conditions of repurchase of such Shares. Any such classification or reclassification will comply with the provisions of the Declaration of Trust and the 1940 Act.  As of April 15, 2016, the following amount of Shares of the Fund was authorized and outstanding:

 Anti-Takeover Provisions. The Declaration of Trust includes provisions that could have
the effect of limiting the ability of other entities or persons to acquire control of the Trust or to change the composition of the Board by discouraging a third party from seeking to obtain control of the Trust. These provisions may have the effect
of discouraging attempts to acquire control of the Trust, which attempts could have the effect of increasing the expenses of the Fund and interfering with the normal operation of the Fund. The Trustees are elected for indefinite terms and do not
stand for reelection. A Trustee may be removed from office without cause only by a written instrument signed or adopted by a majority of the remaining Trustees or by a vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the class of Shares of the Trust
that are entitled to elect a Trustee and that are entitled to vote on the matter. The Declaration of Trust does not contain any other specific inhibiting provisions that would operate only with respect to an extraordinary transaction such as a
merger, reorganization, tender offer, sale or transfer of substantially all of the Fund’s asset, or liquidation. Reference should be made to the Declaration of Trust on file with the SEC for the full text of these provisions. 
REPORTS TO SHAREHOLDERS  The Fund will send to common shareholders unaudited semi-annual and audited annual reports, including a list of investments held.  ADDITIONAL INFORMATION  The prospectus and the
Statement of Additional Information do not contain all of the information set forth in the Registration Statement that the Fund has filed with the SEC. The complete Registration Statement may be obtained from the SEC upon payment of the fee
prescribed by its rules and regulations. The Statement of Additional Information can be obtained without charge by calling (855) 609-3680.

STONE RIDGE’S PRIVACY NOTICE1  Stone Ridge’s Commitment to Its Customers2 
Stone Ridge recognizes and respects the privacy expectation of each of its customers. Stone Ridge believes that the confidentiality and
protection of its customers’ non-public personal information is one of its fundamental responsibilities. This means, most importantly, that Stone Ridge does not sell customers’ non-public personal information to any third parties. Stone
Ridge uses its customers’ non-public personal information primarily to complete financial transactions that its customers request or to make its customers aware of other financial products and services offered by a Stone Ridge affiliated
company.  Information Stone Ridge Collects About Its Customers 
Stone Ridge collects non-public personal information about its customers from the following sources: 
 


 
•
 
 Account Applications and Other Forms, which may include a customer’s name and address, social security number or tax identification
number, total assets, income, and accounts at other institutions;   


 
•
 
 Account History, which may include information about the transactions and balances in accounts with Stone Ridge; and
  


 
•
 
 Correspondence, which may include written, telephonic or electronic communications. 
How Stone Ridge Handles Its Customers’ Personal Information  As emphasized above, Stone Ridge does not sell non-public personal information about current or former customers to third parties. Below are the details of circumstances in which Stone Ridge may disclose
non-public personal information to third parties:   


 
•
 
 In order to complete certain transactions or account changes that a customer directs, it may be necessary to provide certain non-public personal
information about that customer to companies, individuals, or groups that are not affiliated with Stone Ridge. For example, if a customer asks Stone Ridge to transfer assets from another financial institution, Stone Ridge will need to provide
certain non-public personal information about that customer to the company to complete the transaction.   


 
•
 
 In order to alert a customer to other financial products and services that a Stone Ridge affiliated company offers, Stone Ridge may share non-public
personal information it has about that customer with a Stone Ridge affiliated company.   


 
•
 
 In certain instances, Stone Ridge may contract with non-affiliated companies to perform services for or on behalf of Stone Ridge. Where necessary,
Stone Ridge will disclose non-public personal information it has about its customers to these third parties. In all such cases, Stone Ridge will provide the third party with only the information necessary to carry out its assigned responsibilities
and only for that purpose. In addition, Stone Ridge requires these third parties to treat Stone Ridge customers’ non-public information with the same high degree of confidentiality that Stone Ridge does. 
 


 
•
 
 Finally, Stone Ridge will release non-public information about customers if directed by that customer to do so or if Stone Ridge is authorized by
law to do so.

Trust V. 


2 
 For purposes of this notice, the term “customer” or “customers” includes both individuals who have investments with a Stone
Ridge-affiliated company and individuals who have provided non-public personal information to a Stone Ridge affiliated company, but did not invest with a Stone Ridge affiliated company. 
  80 


How Stone Ridge Safeguards Its Customers’ Personal Information 
Stone Ridge restricts access to information about customers to its employees and to third parties, as described above. Stone Ridge
maintains physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards reasonably designed to protect the confidentiality of its customers’ non-public personal information.  Keeping Its Customers Informed  As required by federal law, Stone Ridge
will notify customers of Stone Ridge’s Privacy Policy annually. Stone Ridge reserves the right to modify this policy at any time, but in the event that there is a change, Stone Ridge will promptly inform its customers of that change.

ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT INFORMATION AND RESTRICTIONS 
Additional Investment Information 
Stone Ridge Alternative Lending Risk Premium Fund (the “Fund”) is a newly organized non-diversified closed-end management investment
company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”), and is structured as an “interval fund.” The Fund is an investment portfolio of Stone Ridge Trust V (the “Trust”), a Delaware
statutory trust organized on November 4, 2015. Capitalized terms used in this SAI and not otherwise defined have the meanings given to them in the Fund’s Prospectus. 
The Prospectus discusses the investment objective of the Fund, as well as the principal investment strategies it employs to achieve its
objective and the principal investment risks associated with those strategies. Additional information about the strategies and other investment practices the Fund may employ and certain related risks of the Fund are described below.

Additional Information about the Fund’s Investments in Alternative Lending-Related Securities 
Bankruptcy Risk. In the event that a platform or third-party servicer become subject to a bankruptcy, the Fund’s investments in the
alternative lending-related securities serviced by such entity may be negatively impacted. Although many of the loan servicers may have been organized and operated in a manner that is intended to minimize the likelihood that they will become
insolvent, if the servicing entity were to become subject to bankruptcy proceedings, payments on the corresponding alternative lending-related securities could be substantially delayed or reduced, and any interest accrued on those obligations may
never be paid to investors.  In the event that a platform becomes subject to bankruptcy, the Fund’s investments in securities issued
by the platform may be negatively impacted. If a platform becomes subject to bankruptcy proceedings, the Fund can expect to realize on any investments only to the extent that the platform’s creditors are made whole and the platform still has
residual profits that would benefit investors.  In the event that a borrower becomes subject to a bankruptcy proceeding, the Fund’s
investments in any loan that is an unsecured obligation of the borrower may be negatively impacted. If a borrower enters bankruptcy, an automatic stay of all proceedings against the borrower’s property will typically be granted. This stay will
prevent the platform or third-party servicer from foreclosing on such property unless relief from the stay can be obtained from the bankruptcy court, and there is no guarantee that any such relief will be obtained. The Fund may incur significant
legal fees and costs in attempting to obtain relief from a bankruptcy stay from the bankruptcy court and, even if such relief is ultimately granted, it may take several months or more to obtain. In addition, bankruptcy courts have broad powers to
permit the sale of any real property free of any lien that a loan servicer may have, to compel the servicer to accept an amount less than the balance due under a loan and to permit the borrower to repay the loan over a term which may be
substantially longer than the original term of the loan, all of which could negatively impact the value of the Fund’s investments. 
Chargeback Risk. Because the Fund expects to receive payments received by the loan servicing agent from borrowers, the Fund may be
affected by “borrower chargebacks,” which occur when a borrower who has made a payment on an underlying loan has its bank cancel the payment or request a refund of that payment. In the event that a borrower successfully processes a
chargeback on a loan payment after proceeds have been distributed to the Fund, the loan servicing agent will deduct the amount of that payment from the Fund’s account with the loan servicing agent and amounts that would otherwise be credited to
the Fund’s account (including amounts deposited or that are payable on other loans) are subject to set-off against any such negative cash balance.  
Distressed and Defaulted Instruments or Special Situations Investments Risks. The Fund may invest directly or indirectly in securities
of financially distressed issuers, which involve substantial risks. The Fund may invest in or acquire loans to companies involved in or undergoing work-outs, liquidations, spinoffs, reorganizations,

  3




bankruptcies or other catalytic changes or similar transactions. Such investments may include debtor-in-possession financing. Distressed debt may present a substantial risk of default or may be
in default at the time the Fund invests. The Fund may incur additional expenses to the extent it is required to seek recovery upon a default in the payment of principal or interest on its investments. In any reorganization or liquidation proceeding
relating to an investment in a financially distressed issuer, the Fund may lose its entire investment or may be required to accept cash or securities with a value substantially less than its original investment. Among the risks inherent in
investments in a troubled issuer is that it is often difficult to obtain information as to the true financial condition of the issuer. The Adviser’s judgments about the credit quality of a financially distressed issuer and the relative value of
its instruments may prove to be inaccurate. Further, distressed investing gives rise to the risks that the contemplated transaction will be unsuccessful, will be considerably drawn out over time or will result in a distribution of cash or a new
security with a value less than the purchase price of the security or other financial instrument in respect of which such distribution is received. Similarly, if an anticipated transaction does not in fact occur, the Fund may be required to sell its
investment at a loss or, if there is no secondary market for such investment, may be required to hold an investment with little or no value. When dealing with investments in distressed issuers, the Fund may also experience other risks, including
legal difficulties and negotiations with creditors and other claimants. Because there is substantial uncertainty concerning the outcome of transactions involving the financially troubled issuers in which the Fund may invest, there is a potential
risk of loss by the Fund of its entire investment in such issuers.  Financial Institutions and Government Regulation. The collapse
of various large financial institutions and investment funds across the globe and widespread related losses have resulted in an ongoing severe liquidity crisis throughout the global credit markets during the last several years. Sectors of the credit
markets continue to experience difficulty including the collateralized mortgage-backed securities and leveraged finance markets, along with various other areas of consumer finance. The lack of transparency and reliable pricing of assets has resulted
in some investors withdrawing from the markets for asset-backed securities and related securities. The resulting lack of liquidity has become sufficiently widespread to cause credit issues in areas of the capital markets that have limited exposure
to subprime mortgages and has prompted central banks in the United States, the European Union, the United Kingdom and elsewhere to take action to attempt to ease these liquidity issues and has also resulted in the United States experiencing a broad
and ongoing economic recession. Delinquencies and losses with respect to certain of these asset types, such as auto loans, have increased and may continue to increase. High unemployment and the continued lack of availability of credit may lead to
increased default rates on the collateral underlying many of these securities. As a result, this may adversely affect the performance and market value of the Fund. 
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”), which was signed into law in July 2010, has
resulted in significant revisions of the U.S. financial regulatory framework. The Dodd-Frank Act covers a broad range of topics, including, among many others, a reorganization of federal financial regulators; a process designed to ensure financial
systematic stability and the resolution of potentially insolvent financial firms; new rules for derivatives trading; the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau; the registration and regulation of private funds; the regulation of credit
rating agencies; and new federal requirements for residential mortgage loans. The ultimate impact of the Dodd-Frank Act, and any resulting regulation, is not yet certain and issuers in which the Fund invests may also be affected by the new
legislation and regulation in ways that are currently unforeseeable. Governments or their agencies also may acquire distressed assets from financial institutions and acquire ownership interests in those institutions. The long-term implications of
government ownership and disposition of these assets are unclear, and may have positive or negative effects on the liquidity, valuation and performance of the Fund’s portfolio holdings. 
As the alternative lending industry grows, governments and/or other regulatory bodies both inside and outside the U.S. may impose restrictions
on participants in the alternative lending industry, including platforms, investors, such as the Fund, or others, that could adversely impact the Fund’s investment performance. Such restrictions could include regulations limiting the
Fund’s ability to acquire loans or interests in loans or to collect the stipulated levels of interest on the loans underlying the Fund’s alternative lending-related investments. 
  4



Real Property Risks. The Fund may gain exposure to loans collateralized by real property.
The value of the real property underlying a loan will be subject to the risks generally incident to the ownership of improved and unimproved real estate, such as changes in general or local economic conditions, increases in interest rates for real
estate financing, physical damage that is not covered by insurance, zoning and entitlements.   Some borrowers may intend to use
resale proceeds to repay their loans. A decline in property values could result in a loan amount that is greater than the property value, which could increase the likelihood of borrower default. The payment schedules with respect to many real
estate-related loans are based on projected revenues generated by the property over the term of the loan. These projections are based on factors such as expected vacancy rates, expense rates and other projected income and expense figures relating to
the property. The actual revenues generated by a property could fall short of projections, due to factors such as lower-than-expected rental revenues, or greater-than-expected vacancy rates or property management expenses. In such cases, a borrower
may be unable to repay a loan. To the extent the Fund has exposure to construction or rehabilitation loans, it may be adversely impacted by, among other things, risks involving the timeliness of the project’s completion, the integrity of
appraisal values, whether or not the completed property can be sold for the amount anticipated and the length of the construction and/or sale process. 
A borrower’s ability to repay a loan relating to real property might also be adversely affected if toxic environmental contamination were
to be discovered to exist on the property. A platform or third-party servicer could be forced to take on potential additional liabilities and responsibilities in the event of foreclosure. Environmental contamination may give rise to a diminution in
value of the underlying property or may lead to liability for clean-up costs or other remedial actions. A platform may choose not to foreclose on a contaminated property as the potential liability could exceed the value of the real property or the
principal balance of the related loan. The failure to perform the required remedial actions could, in some jurisdictions, give rise to a lien on mortgaged property to ensure the reimbursement of remedial costs, which could decrease the value of the
property that serves as collateral.  The state of law is currently unclear as to whether and under what circumstances clean-up costs, or
the obligation to take remedial actions, can be imposed on a secured lender. If a platform does become liable for cleanup costs, it may bring an action for contribution against the current owners or operators, the owners or operators at the time of
on-site disposal activity or any other party who contributed to the environmental hazard, but these persons or entities may be bankrupt or otherwise judgment-proof. Furthermore, an action against the borrower may be adversely affected by the
limitations on recourse in the loan documents.
 Servicer Autonomy Risk. A servicer may be authorized to waive or modify
non-material terms of a loan, to consent to the postponement of strict compliance with certain non-material terms or to grant a non-material indulgence to a borrower. In the event that a loan is in default or the servicer determines that default is
reasonably foreseeable, the servicer may be permitted to waive or modify a material term of a loan, to accept payment of an amount less than the principal balance in final satisfaction of a loan or to grant any indulgence to a borrower, provided
that the servicer has reasonably determined that such action will not be materially adverse to the interests of the holders of any security interest in such loan.

Servicer Resources Risk. A platform may derive a substantial amount, if not all, of its revenue from fees generated through making and
arranging loans. As a result, a platform may be incentivized to finance as many projects as possible in order to maximize the amount of origination fees it is able to generate. Increased project volume increases the demands on a platform’s
servicing resources, which could impact the platform’s ability to devote adequate attention and resources to servicing loans. In the event that a platform takes on loan volumes that exceed its ability to service outstanding loans, payments on
the Fund’s loans may be adversely affected.  Risks Related to Investments in Receivables or Invoices. The Fund may
invest in alternative lending-related securities with exposure to receivables or invoice financing. In making such investments, the Fund is dependent upon the platforms’ ability to monitor and curtail fraud, including factoring fraud, which
involves the 
  5




falsification of invoice documents. False invoices can easily be created online to appear as if they have been issued by legitimate debtors or as if the invoiced amounts are higher than they
actually are. Platforms that originate trade receivables financing loans to corporations usually conduct due diligence but do not always conduct on-site visits to verify that the business exists and is in good standing. For this reason, the risk of
fraud may be greater with corporate trade receivables. Typically, a platform will seek to validate that the debtor has received the goods or services for which it has been invoiced and is willing to pay the creditor before making the receivables
available for investment, although this may not always be the case. There can be no assurance, however, that the debtor will not subsequently dispute the quality or price of the goods or services and withhold payments. Fraud, delays or write-offs
associated with such disputes could directly impact the profitability of the Fund’s investments in alternative lending-related securities with exposure to trade receivables. In the event of insolvency of any debtor owing funds on a receivable
that the Fund has purchased directly or indirectly, the Fund may only rank as an unsecured creditor. In the case of receivables transferred with recourse, when a debtor defaults on its obligations to the purchaser of the receivable (such as the
Fund, directly or indirectly), the seller of the receivable will become obligated to fulfill any remaining invoice amounts owed to the purchaser. In the case of receivables transferred without recourse, the Fund or other direct owner of the
receivable will have no such “back-up” obligor in the event of a debtor default. In either scenario, there is a risk that the party with the payment obligation will fail to make payments timely or at all. 
Additional Information about the Fund’s Use of Derivatives 
In addition to the derivatives transactions described in the Prospectus, the Fund may also enter into derivatives contracts with respect to any
security or other instrument in which it is permitted to invest or with respect to any related security, instrument or index (“reference instruments” or “reference securities”). The Fund may enter into a variety of derivative
contracts, but typically expects to enter into futures contracts and swaps, and may also enter into put and call options or options on futures contracts or other derivatives. This universe of investments is subject to change under varying market
conditions and as these instruments evolve over time. The Fund may enter into derivatives contracts with standardized terms and no or few special or unusual components, which are generally traded on an exchange, as well as derivatives with more
complex features, such as caps, floors, knock-outs, look-backs or other “exotic” elements, singly or in combination, which are generally traded over the counter. Over-the-counter (“OTC”) derivatives may be standardized or have
customized features and may have limited or no liquidity. The Fund’s derivatives contracts may be centrally cleared or settled bilaterally directly with a counterparty. The Fund’s derivatives contracts may be cash or physically
settled.  The derivatives contracts the Fund may enter into involve substantial risk. Derivatives typically allow the Fund to seek to
increase or decrease the level of risk to which it is exposed more quickly and efficiently than transactions in other types of instruments. The Fund incurs costs in connection with opening and closing derivatives positions.

The use of derivatives can lead to losses because of adverse movements in the price or value of the reference instrument, due to failure of a
counterparty or due to tax or regulatory constraints. Derivatives may create economic leverage in the Fund, which magnifies the Fund’s exposure to the reference instrument and magnifies potential losses. When derivatives are used to gain or
limit exposure to a particular market or market segment, their performance may not correlate as expected to the performance of such market, thereby causing the Fund to fail to achieve its original purpose for using such derivatives. A decision as to
whether, when and how to use derivatives involves the exercise of specialized skill and judgment, and a transaction may be unsuccessful in whole or in part because of market behavior, unexpected events or the Stone Ridge Asset Management’s (the
“Adviser”) failure to use derivatives effectively. Derivative instruments may be difficult to value, may be illiquid and may be subject to wide swings in valuation caused by changes in the value of the reference instrument. 
Futures. The Fund may buy and sell a variety of futures contracts that relate to, among other things, debt securities (these are
referred to as “interest rate futures”), broadly-based securities indices (“stock index futures” and “bond index futures”), foreign currencies, commodities and individual equity securities (“single stock

  6




futures”). Futures are standardized, exchange-traded contracts that obligate a purchaser to take delivery, and a seller to make delivery, of a specific amount of an asset at a specified
future date at a specified price. A futures contract on an index is an agreement pursuant to which two parties agree to take or make delivery of an amount of cash equal to the difference between the value of the index at the close of the last
trading day of the contract and the price at which the index contract originally was written. The primary risks associated with the use of futures contracts and options are imperfect correlation, liquidity, unanticipated market movement and
counterparty risk.   A broadly-based stock index is used as the basis for trading stock index futures. They may in some cases be
based on equity securities of issuers in a particular industry or group of industries. A stock index assigns relative values to the securities included in the index and its value fluctuates in response to the changes in value of the underlying
securities. A stock index cannot be purchased or sold directly. Bond index futures are similar contracts based on the future value of the basket of securities that comprise the index. These contracts obligate the seller to deliver, and the purchaser
to take, cash to settle the futures transaction. There is no delivery made of the underlying securities to settle the futures obligation. Either party may also settle the transaction by entering into an offsetting contract.

An interest rate future obligates the seller to deliver (and the purchaser to take) cash or a specified type of debt security to settle the
futures transaction. Either party could also enter into an offsetting contract to close out the position. Similarly, a single stock future obligates the seller to deliver (and the purchaser to take) cash or a specified equity security to settle the
futures transaction. Either party could also enter into an offsetting contract to close out the position. Single stock futures trade on a very limited number of exchanges, with contracts typically not fungible among the exchanges.

No money is paid or received by the Fund on the purchase or sale of a future. Upon entering into a futures transaction, the Fund will be
required to deposit an initial margin payment with the futures commission merchant (the “FCM”). Initial margin payments will be deposited with the Fund’s custodian bank in an account registered in the futures broker’s name.
However, the FCM can gain access to that account only under specified conditions. As the future is marked to market (that is, its value on the Fund’s books is changed to reflect changes in its market value), subsequent margin payments, called
variation margin, will be paid to or by the FCM daily.  At any time prior to expiration of the future, the Fund may elect to close out its
position by taking an opposite position, at which time a final determination of variation margin is made and any additional cash must be paid by or released to the Fund. All futures transactions (except forward contracts) are effected through a
clearinghouse associated with the exchange on which the contracts are traded.
  


•
 
 Commodity Futures Contracts. The Fund may invest in futures contracts on various commodities and
options on commodity futures. Compared to investing in futures contracts generally, commodity futures contracts are associated with additional risks including, but not limited to, the following:

 


 
¡ 
 
 Storage. In commodity futures markets there are physical storage costs associated with
purchasing the underlying commodity. The price of a commodity futures contract reflects the storage costs of purchasing the physical commodity, including the time value of money invested in the physical commodity. The value of a commodity futures
contract may also change to the extent that the storage costs for an underlying commodity change while the Fund is invested in futures contracts on that commodity.

 


 
¡ 
 
 Reinvestment. In the commodity futures markets, producers of the underlying commodity may decide to
hedge the price risk of selling the commodity by selling futures contracts to lock in the price of the commodity at delivery. In order to induce speculators to purchase the other side (the long side) of the same futures contract, the commodity
producer generally must sell the futures contract at a lower price than the expected future spot price. Conversely, if most hedgers in the futures market are end-users of the underlying product and are, therefore, purchasing futures

  7





 
 
contracts to hedge against a rise in commodity prices, then speculators will only sell the other side of the futures contract at a higher futures price than the expected future spot price of the
commodity. The changing nature of the participants in the commodity markets will influence whether futures prices are above or below the expected future spot price, which can have significant implications for the Fund. As a result, when the Adviser
reinvests the proceeds from a maturing contract, it may purchase a new futures contract at a higher or lower price than the expected futures spot price of the maturing contract or choose to pursue other investments.

 


 
¡ 
 
 Speculative Position Limits. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the “CFTC”) and
domestic exchanges have established speculative position limits (“position limits”) on the maximum speculative position that any person, or group of persons acting in concert, may hold or control in particular contracts and certain related
swaps. Under current regulations, other accounts managed by the Adviser are combined with the positions held by the Fund under the Adviser’s management for position limit purposes. This trading could prelude additional trading in such contracts
by the Adviser for the account of the Fund.  Swaps. The Fund may enter into swap agreements, including interest
rate, total return, credit default and volatility swaps. Swap agreements are two-party contracts entered into primarily by institutional investors for a specified period of time typically ranging from a few weeks to more than one year. The swapped
returns are generally calculated with respect to a notional amount, that is, the return on a particular dollar amount invested in the underlying asset. In a standard swap transaction, two parties agree to exchange the returns (or the difference
between the returns) earned or realized on a particular asset, such as an equity or debt security, commodity or currency, or non-asset reference, such as an interest rate or index. The Fund may enter into swap agreements to, among other reasons,
gain exposure to certain markets in the most economical way possible, protect against currency fluctuations, or reduce risk arising from a particular portfolio position.

The Fund may enter into swap transactions with certain counterparties pursuant to master netting agreements. A master netting agreement
provides that all swaps done between the Fund and that counterparty shall be regarded as parts of an integral agreement. If amounts are payable on a particular date in the same currency in respect of more than one swap transaction, the amount
payable shall be the net amount. In addition, the master netting agreement may provide that if one party defaults generally or on any swap, the counterparty can terminate all outstanding swaps with that party. As a result, to the extent the Fund
enters into master netting agreements with a counterparty, the Fund may be required to terminate a greater number of swap agreements than if it had not entered into such an agreement, which may result in losses to the Fund.

The use of swap agreements by the Fund entails certain risks. Swap agreements entail credit risk arising from the possibility that the
counterparty will default. If the counterparty defaults, the Fund’s loss will consist of the net amount of contractual payments that the Fund has not yet received. The Adviser will monitor the creditworthiness of counterparties to the
Fund’s swap transactions on an ongoing basis. Swap agreements may effectively add leverage to the Fund’s portfolio because the Fund would be subject to investment exposure on the notional amount of the swap. Swap agreements also involve
liquidity risk.   


•
 
 Interest Rate Swaps. The Fund may enter into interest rate swaps. In an interest rate swap, the Fund
and another party exchange the right to receive or the obligation to pay interest on a security or other reference rate. For example, they might swap the right to receive floating rate payments for fixed rate payments. There is a risk that, based on
movements of interest rates, the payments made by the Fund under a swap agreement will be greater than the payments it receives.
  


•
 
 Total Return Swaps. The Fund may enter into total return swaps, under which one party agrees to pay the
other the total return of a defined underlying asset, such as a security or basket of securities, or non-asset reference, such as a securities index, during the specified period in return for periodic payments based on a fixed or variable interest
rate or the total return from different underlying assets or references. Total return swaps could result in losses if the underlying asset or reference does not perform as anticipated by the Adviser.

  8





•
 
 Credit Default Swaps. The Fund may enter into credit default swaps. A credit default swap enables an
investor to buy or sell protection against a credit event, such as a borrower’s or issuer’s failure to make timely payments of interest or principal, bankruptcy or restructuring. The Fund may seek to enhance returns by selling protection
or attempt to mitigate credit risk by buying protection against the occurrence of a credit event by a specified borrower or issuer. The Fund may enter into credit default swaps, both directly (“unfunded swaps”) and indirectly (“funded
swaps”) in the form of a swap embedded within a structured security. Unfunded and funded credit default swaps may refer to a single security or a basket of securities. 
If the Fund buys credit protection using a credit default swap and a credit event occurs, the Fund will deliver the defaulted
bond underlying the swap and the swap counterparty will pay the par amount of the bond. If the Fund sells credit protection using a credit default swap and a credit event occurs, the Fund will pay the par amount of the defaulted bond underlying the
swap and the swap counterparty will deliver the bond. If the swap is on a basket of assets, the notional amount of the swap is reduced by the par amount of the defaulted asset, and the fixed payments are then made on the reduced notional amount.
 Risks of credit default swaps include counterparty credit risk (if the counterparty fails to meet its obligations) and the
risk that the Fund will not properly assess the cost of the instrument based on the lack of transparency in the market. If the Fund is selling credit protection, there is a risk that a credit event will occur and that the Fund will have to pay par
value on defaulted bonds. If the Fund is buying credit protection, there is a risk that no credit event will occur and the Fund will receive no benefit for the premium paid. In addition, if the Fund is buying credit protection and a credit event
does occur, there is a risk when the Fund does not own the underlying asset, that the Fund will have difficulty acquiring the asset on the open market and may receive adverse pricing.

 


•
 
 Volatility Swap Contracts. The Fund may enter into volatility swaps to hedge the direction of
volatility in a particular asset or non-asset reference, or for other non-speculative purposes. For volatility swaps, counterparties agree to buy or sell volatility at a specific level over a fixed period. Volatility swaps are subject to credit
risks (if the counterparty fails to meet its obligations), and the risk that the Adviser is incorrect in forecasts of volatility of the underlying asset or reference.

 


•
 
 Swap Options and Swap Forwards. The Fund also may enter into options on swaps as well as forwards on
swaps. A swap option is a contract that gives a counterparty the right (but not the obligation) to enter into a new swap agreement or to shorten, extend, cancel, or otherwise modify an existing swap agreement on pre-designated terms. The Fund may
write (sell) and purchase put and call swap options. A swap forward is an agreement to enter into a swap agreement at some point in the future, usually three to six months from the date of the contract.

The writer of the contract receives the premium and bears the risk of unfavorable changes in the preset rate on the underlying
swap. The Fund generally will incur a greater risk when it writes a swap option than when it purchases a swap option. When the Fund purchases a swap option it risks losing only the amount of the premium it has paid if the Fund lets the option expire
unexercised. When the Fund writes a swap option it will become obligated, upon exercise of the option by the counterparty, according to the terms of the underlying agreement.

Options. The Fund may buy or write (sell) call options and put options on securities, indices and currencies, forward foreign currency
exchange contracts, stock index futures, swaps, including event-linked swaps, commodities , futures and other derivative instruments. A call option typically gives the option buyer the right (but not the obligation) to buy, and requires the option
seller to sell, a reference instrument at an agreed-upon price; a put option gives the option buyer the right (but not the obligation) to sell, and requires the option seller to purchase, a reference instrument at an agreed-upon price. If an option
is exercised, the Fund will either purchase or sell the reference instrument at the strike price or pay or receive the difference between the strike price and the current price level of the reference instrument, depending on the terms of the option.
The premium, the exercise price and the market value of the applicable underlying instrument together will determine the gain or loss realized by the Fund as the seller of the option.  
  9



The value of options may be adversely affected if the market for such options becomes less liquid
or smaller. The Fund’s ability to close out its position as a seller of an OTC option or exchange listed put or call option is dependent, in part, upon the liquidity of the option market. The Fund’s ability to terminate OTC options is more
limited than with exchange-traded options and may involve the risk that broker-dealers participating in such transactions will not fulfill their obligations. 
Options are marked to market daily and their value will be affected by changes in the value of the underlying securities, changes in the
dividend rates of the underlying securities, an increase in interest rates, changes in the actual or perceived volatility of the stock market and the underlying instruments and the remaining time to the options’ expiration. Additionally, the
exercise price of an option may be adjusted downward before the option’s expiration as a result of the occurrence of certain corporate or other events affecting the underlying instrument, such as extraordinary dividends, stock splits, merger or
other extraordinary distributions or events. A reduction in the exercise price of an option would reduce the Fund’s capital appreciation potential on the underlying instrument. 
Options on Futures. The Fund may enter into options on futures contracts. An option on a futures contract gives the buyer, in return
for the premium paid, the right (but not the obligation) to either buy or sell the underlying futures contract during a certain period of time for a fixed price. The writing of a put or call option on a futures contract involves risks similar to the
risks applicable to the purchase or sale of futures contracts. However, the difficulty of predicting changes in the value of the underlying futures contract may expose the Fund to a somewhat different set of risks. For example, variations in
speculative market demand for futures on the relevant underlying reference asset can cause the value of the futures to change at an unanticipated time or to an unanticipated degree; this or other factors may bring the value of the underlying future
closer to the option’s strike price, increasing the potential for risk of loss to the Fund. To the extent that the Fund enters into options on futures contracts for hedging purposes, an imperfect correlation between this derivative position and
the value of the instrument underlying such a position could lead to losses.  Foreign Currency Transactions. The Fund also may
purchase and sell foreign currency options and foreign currency futures contracts and related options, and may engage in foreign currency transactions either on a spot (cash) basis at the rate prevailing in the currency exchange market at the time
or through deliverable and non-deliverable forward foreign currency exchange contracts (“forwards”). The Fund may (but is not required to) engage in these transactions in order to protect against uncertainty in the level of future foreign
exchange rates in the purchase and sale of securities. The Fund may also use foreign currency options and foreign currency forward contracts to increase exposure to a foreign currency or to shift exposure to foreign currency fluctuations from one
country to another. Suitable currency hedging transactions may not be available in all circumstances and the Adviser may decide not to use hedging transactions that are available. 
Under a forward contract, one party agrees to purchase, and another party agrees to sell, a specific currency at a future date. That date may
be any fixed number of days from the date of the contract agreed upon by the parties. The transaction price is set at the time the contract is entered into. These contracts are traded in the inter-bank market conducted directly among currency
traders (usually large commercial banks) and their customers.
 The Fund may use currency forward contracts to protect against uncertainty
in the level of future exchange rates. The use of forward contracts does not eliminate the risk of fluctuations in the prices of the underlying securities the Fund owns or intends to acquire, but it does fix a rate of exchange in advance. Although
forward contracts may reduce the risk of loss from a decline in the value of the hedged currency, at the same time they limit any potential gain if the value of the hedged currency increases.

When the Fund enters into a contract for the purchase or sale of a security denominated in a foreign currency, or when it anticipates
receiving dividend payments in a foreign currency, the Fund might desire to “lock-in” the U.S. dollar price of the security or the U.S. dollar equivalent of the dividend payments. To do so, the Fund could enter into a forward contract for
the purchase or sale of the amount of foreign currency involved in the 
  10




underlying transaction, in a fixed amount of U.S. dollars per unit of the foreign currency. This is called a “transaction hedge.” The transaction hedge will protect the Fund against a
loss from an adverse change in the currency exchange rates during the period between the date on which the security is purchased or sold or on which the payment is declared, and the date on which the payments are made or received. 
The Fund could also use forward contracts to lock in the U.S. dollar value of portfolio positions. This is called a “position
hedge.” When the Fund believes that a foreign currency might suffer a substantial decline against the U.S. dollar, it could enter into a forward contract to sell an amount of that foreign currency approximating the value of some or all of the
Fund’s portfolio securities denominated in that foreign currency. When the Fund believes that the U.S. dollar might suffer a substantial decline against a foreign currency, it could enter into a forward contract to buy that foreign currency for
a fixed dollar amount. Alternatively, the Fund could enter into a forward contract to sell a different foreign currency for a fixed U.S. dollar amount if the Fund believes that the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency to be sold pursuant to its
forward contract will fall whenever there is a decline in the U.S. dollar value of the currency in which portfolio securities of the Fund are denominated. That is referred to as a “cross hedge.” 
To avoid excess transactions and transaction costs, the Fund may maintain a net exposure to forward contracts in excess of the value of the
Fund’s portfolio securities or other assets denominated in foreign currencies, subject to appropriate cover or asset segregation. 
The precise matching of the amounts under forward contracts and the value of the securities involved generally will not be possible because
the future value of securities denominated in foreign currencies will change as a consequence of market movements between the date the forward contract is entered into and the date it is sold. In some cases the Adviser might decide to sell the
security and deliver foreign currency to settle the original purchase obligation. If the market value of the security is less than the amount of foreign currency the Fund is obligated to deliver, the Fund might have to purchase additional foreign
currency on the “spot” (that is, cash) market to settle the security trade. If the market value of the security instead exceeds the amount of foreign currency the Fund is obligated to deliver to settle the trade, the Fund might have to
sell on the spot market some of the foreign currency received upon the sale of the security. There will be additional transaction costs on the spot market in those cases. 
The projection of short-term currency market movements is extremely difficult, and the successful execution of a short-term hedging strategy
is highly uncertain. Forward contracts involve the risk that anticipated currency movements will not be accurately predicted, causing the Fund to sustain losses on these contracts and to pay additional transaction costs. The use of forward contracts
in this manner might reduce the Fund’s performance if there are unanticipated changes in currency prices to a greater degree than if the Fund had not entered into such contracts. 
At or before the maturity of a forward contract requiring the Fund to sell a currency, the Fund might sell a portfolio security and use the
sale proceeds to make delivery of the currency. In the alternative the Fund might retain the security and offset its contractual obligation to deliver the currency by purchasing a second contract. Under that contract the Fund will obtain, on the
same maturity date, the same amount of the currency that it is obligated to deliver. Similarly, the Fund might close out a forward contract requiring it to purchase a specified currency by entering into a second contract entitling it to sell the
same amount of the same currency on the maturity date of the first contract. The Fund would realize a gain or loss as a result of entering into such an offsetting forward contract under either circumstance. The gain or loss will depend on the extent
to which the exchange rate or rates between the currencies involved moved between the execution dates of the first contract and offsetting contract.

The costs to the Fund of engaging in forward contracts varies with factors such as the currencies involved, the length of the contract period
and the market conditions then prevailing. Because forward contracts are usually entered into on a principal basis, no brokerage fees or commissions are involved. Because these contracts are not

  11




traded on an exchange, the Fund must evaluate the credit and performance risk of the counterparty under each forward contract.

Although the Fund values its assets daily in terms of U.S. dollars, it does not intend to convert its holdings of foreign currencies into U.S.
dollars on a daily basis. The Fund may convert foreign currency from time to time, and will incur costs in doing so. Foreign exchange dealers do not charge a fee for conversion, but they do seek to realize a profit based on the difference between
the prices at which they buy and sell various currencies. Thus, a dealer might offer to sell a foreign currency to one Fund at one rate, while offering a lesser rate of exchange if the Fund desires to resell that currency to the dealer.

Hedging. Although it is not obligated to do so, the Fund can use derivatives to hedge. The Fund can use hedging to attempt to
protect against declines in the market value of the Fund’s portfolio, to permit the Fund to retain unrealized gains in the value of portfolio securities that have appreciated or to facilitate selling securities for investment reasons. The
Fund can use hedging to establish a portfolio position as a temporary substitute for purchasing particular securities. In that case, the Fund would normally seek to purchase the securities and then terminate that hedging position. The Fund might
also use this type of hedge to attempt to protect against the possibility that its portfolio securities would not be fully included in a rise in value of the market.  
The Fund can use derivatives to hedge by taking or long or short positions in the underlying securities, related securities, or other
derivatives positions. To gain long investment exposure, the Fund may invest in securities directly. To gain short investment exposure, the Fund may use derivatives (including futures). Some of the hedging strategies the Fund can use are described
below. The Fund may use additional hedging strategies as discussed elsewhere in this SAI, and it may employ new hedging strategies when they are developed, if those investment methods are consistent with the Fund’s investment objectives and are
permissible under applicable regulations governing the Fund.   


•
 
 “Structured” Notes. The Fund can invest in “structured” notes, which are
specially-designed derivative debt investments whose principal payments or interest payments are linked to the value of an underlying asset, such as an equity or debt security, currency or commodity or non-asset reference, such as an interest rate
or index. The terms of the instrument may be “structured” by the purchaser (the Fund) and the borrower issuing the note. 
The values of these notes will fall or rise in response to changes in the values of the underlying asset or reference and the
Fund might receive less principal or interest if the underlying asset or reference does not perform as anticipated. In some cases, these notes may pay an amount based on a multiple of the relative change in value of the asset or reference. This
type of note offers the potential for increased income or principal payments, but at a greater risk of loss than a typical debt security of the same maturity and credit quality. 
Subordinated “structured” notes, which are subordinated to the right of payment of another class, typically have
higher yields and present greater risks than unsubordinated “structured” notes.  The values of these notes are
also subject to both credit risk (if the counterparty fails to meet its obligations) and interest rate risk and, therefore, the Fund could receive more or less than it originally invested when a note matures. The prices of these notes may be
very volatile and they may have a limited trading market, making it difficult for the Fund to value them or sell them at an acceptable price.   


•
 
 Swaps, Swap Options and Swap Forwards. The Fund can invest in swap agreements, including
interest rate, total return, credit default, and volatility swaps, and options and forwards thereon for hedging purposes, as described more fully under “Swaps” above. 
Hedging with Options and Futures — Risks. The use of hedging strategies requires special skills and knowledge of investment
techniques that are different than what is required for normal portfolio management. If the Adviser uses a hedging strategy at the wrong time or judges market conditions incorrectly, hedging strategies

  12




may reduce the Fund’s return. The Fund could also experience losses if the prices of its futures and options positions were not correlated with its other investments. 
The Fund’s option activities could affect its portfolio turnover rate and brokerage commissions. The exercise of calls written by the
Fund might cause the Fund to sell related portfolio securities, thus increasing its turnover rate. The exercise by the Fund of puts on securities will cause the sale of underlying investments, increasing portfolio turnover. Although the decision
whether to exercise a put it holds is within the Fund’s control, holding a put might cause the Fund to sell the related investments for reasons that would not exist in the absence of the put. 
The Fund could pay a brokerage commission each time it buys a call or put, sells a call or put, or buys or sells an underlying investment in
connection with the exercise of a call or put. Those commissions could be higher on a relative basis than the commissions for direct purchases or sales of the underlying investments. Premiums paid for options are small in relation to the market
value of the underlying investments. Consequently, put and call options offer large amounts of leverage. The leverage offered by trading in options could result in the Fund’s net asset value being more sensitive to changes in the value of the
underlying investment.  If a covered call written by the Fund is exercised on an underlying investment that has increased in value, the
Fund will be required to sell the investment at the call price. It will not be able to realize any profit if the investment has increased in value above the call price.

An option position may be closed out only on a market that provides secondary trading for options of the same series, and there is no
assurance that a liquid secondary market will exist for any particular option. The Fund might experience losses if it could not close out a position because of an illiquid market for the future or option.

There is a risk in using short hedging by selling futures or purchasing puts on broadly-based indices or futures to attempt to protect against
declines in the value of the Fund’s portfolio securities. The risk is that the prices of the futures or the applicable index will correlate imperfectly with the behavior of the cash prices of the Fund’s securities. For example, it is
possible that while the Fund has used derivative instruments in a short hedge, the market may advance and the value of the securities held in the Fund’s portfolio might decline. If that occurred, the Fund would lose money on the derivative
instruments and also experience a decline in the value of its portfolio securities.  The risk of imperfect correlation increases as the
composition of the Fund’s portfolio diverges from the securities included in the applicable index. To compensate for the imperfect correlation of movements in the price of the portfolio securities being hedged and movements in the price of the
hedging instruments, the Fund might use derivative instruments in a greater dollar amount than the dollar amount of portfolio securities being hedged. It might do so if the historical volatility of the prices of the portfolio securities being hedged
is more than the historical volatility of the applicable index.  The ordinary spreads between prices in the cash and futures markets are
subject to distortions, due to differences in the nature of those markets. First, all participants in the futures market are subject to margin deposit and maintenance requirements. Rather than meeting additional margin deposit requirements,
investors may close futures contracts through offsetting transactions which could distort the normal relationship between the cash and futures markets. Second, the liquidity of the futures market depends on participants entering into offsetting
transactions rather than making or taking delivery. To the extent participants decide to make or take delivery, liquidity in the futures market could be reduced, thus producing distortion. Third, from the point of view of speculators, the deposit
requirements in the futures market are less onerous than margin requirements in the securities markets. Therefore, increased participation by speculators in the futures market may cause temporary price distortions.

The Fund can use derivative instruments to establish a position in the securities markets as a temporary substitute for the purchase of
individual securities (long hedging) by buying futures and/or calls on such futures, broadly-
  13




based indices or on securities. It is possible that when the Fund does so the market might decline. If the Fund then concludes not to invest in securities because of concerns that the market
might decline further or for other reasons, the Fund will realize a loss on the hedge position that is not offset by a reduction in the price of the securities purchased.

Counterparty Risk. The Fund will be exposed to the credit risk of the counterparties with which, or the brokers, dealers and
exchanges through which, it deals, whether it engages in exchange traded or off-exchange transactions. If the Fund’s FCM becomes bankrupt or insolvent, or otherwise defaults on its obligations to the Fund, the Fund may not receive all amounts
owed to it in respect of its trading, despite the clearinghouse fully discharging all of its obligations. The Commodity Exchange Act requires an FCM to segregate all funds received from its customers with respect to cleared derivatives transactions
from such FCM’s proprietary funds. If an FCM were not to do so to the full extent required by law, the assets of an account might not be fully protected in the event of the bankruptcy of an FCM. Furthermore, in the event of an FCM’s
bankruptcy, the Fund would be limited to recovering only a pro rata share of all available funds segregated on behalf of an FCM’s combined customer accounts, even though certain property specifically traceable to the Fund (for example, U.S.
Treasury bills deposited by the Fund) may be held by the FCM. FCM bankruptcies have occurred in which customers were unable to recover from the FCM’s estate the full amount of their funds owed and on deposit with such FCM. Such situations could
arise due to various factors, or a combination of factors, including inadequate FCM capitalization, inadequate controls on customer trading and inadequate customer capital. In addition, an FCM will generally provide the clearinghouse the net
amount of variation margin required for cleared swaps for all of its customers in the aggregate, rather than individually for each customer. The Fund is, therefore, subject to the risk that a clearinghouse will not make variation margin payments
owed to the Fund if another customer of the clearing member has suffered a loss and is in default. The Fund may also be subject to the risk that it will be required to provide additional variation margin to the clearinghouse before the clearinghouse
will move the Fund’s cleared derivatives transactions to another clearing member. Furthermore, in the event of the bankruptcy or insolvency of a clearinghouse, the Fund might experience a loss of funds deposited through its FCM as margin with
the clearinghouse, a loss of unrealized profits on its open positions and the loss of funds owed to it as realized profits on closed positions. Such a bankruptcy or insolvency might also cause a substantial delay before the Fund could obtain the
return of funds owed to it by an FCM who was a member of such clearinghouse.  In the case of cleared swaps, the FCM is required to notify
the clearinghouse of the initial margin provided by the clearing member to the clearinghouse that is attributable to each customer. However, if the FCM does not accurately report the Fund’s initial margin, the Fund is subject to the risk that a
clearinghouse will use the Fund’s assets held in an omnibus account at the clearinghouse to satisfy payment obligations of a defaulting customer of the clearing member to the clearinghouse. 
Because bilateral derivative transactions are traded between counterparties based on contractual relationships, the Fund is subject to the
risk that a counterparty will not perform its obligations under the related contracts. Although the Fund intends to enter into transactions only with counterparties which the Adviser believes to be creditworthy, there can be no assurance that a
counterparty will not default and that the Fund will not sustain a loss on a transaction as a result. In situations where the Fund is required to post margin or other collateral with a counterparty, the counterparty may fail to segregate the
collateral or may commingle the collateral with the counterparty’s own assets. As a result, in the event of the counterparty’s bankruptcy or insolvency, the Fund’s collateral may be subject to the conflicting claims of the
counterparty’s creditors, and the Fund may be exposed to the risk of a court treating the Fund as a general unsecured creditor of the counterparty, rather than as the owner of the collateral. 
The Fund is subject to the risk that issuers of the Fund’s portfolio instruments may default on their obligations under those instruments
and that certain events may occur that have an immediate and significant adverse effect on the value of those instruments. There can be no assurance that an issuer of an instrument in which the Fund invests will not default or that an event that has
an immediate and significant adverse effect on the value of an instrument will not occur and that the Fund will not sustain a loss on a transaction as a result. 
  14



Transactions entered into by the Fund may be executed on various U.S. and non-U.S. exchanges and
may be cleared and settled through various clearinghouses, custodians, depositories and prime brokers throughout the world. Although the Fund attempts to execute, clear and settle the transactions through entities the Adviser believes to be sound,
there can be no assurance that a failure by any such entity will not lead to a loss to the Fund.
 Margin. The Fund may post cash,
securities or other assets and these instruments may not be denominated in the same currency as the contract they secure or the underlying instrument of the contract. This may give rise to a form of currency exposure, where changes in the value of
foreign currencies can impact the value of the margin on deposit. The Fund may at times have significant margin obligations to broker-dealers or other entities as a result of listed or OTC derivatives positions. The Fund may use a tri-party
collateral protection mechanism; tri-party arrangements may result in higher costs than if the Fund had posted margin directly. The Fund may also establish alternative collateral mechanisms in order to achieve a balance between cost and counterparty
credit risk to the Fund.  Asset Segregation/Cover. To the extent obligations created by the Fund may be deemed to create
“senior securities” (as defined in the 1940 Act), the Fund may be required to segregate or earmark liquid assets. The Fund will segregate with its custodian or otherwise designate on its records (“earmark”) cash, cash equivalents
or liquid assets in an amount the Fund believes to be adequate to ensure that it has sufficient liquid assets to meet its obligations under its derivatives contracts, or the Fund may engage in other measures to “cover” its obligations with
respect to such transactions in accordance with applicable requirements under the 1940 Act and related guidance of the Commission and its Staff. The amounts that are segregated or earmarked may be based on the derivative’s notional value or on
the daily mark-to-market obligation under the derivatives contract and may be reduced by amounts on deposit with the applicable broker or counterparty to the derivatives transaction. The Fund may segregate or earmark amounts in addition to the
amounts described above. For example, if the Fund writes a physically settled put option, it will typically segregate or earmark liquid assets equal to the exercise price of the option, less margin on deposit, or hold the reference instrument
directly; if the Fund writes a cash settled put option, it will typically segregate or earmark liquid assets equal to the amount the option is in the money (meaning the difference between the exercise price of the option and the current market price
of the reference instrument, when the exercise price of the option is higher than the market price of the reference instrument), marked to market on a daily basis, less margin on deposit. Alternatively, the Fund may, in certain circumstances, enter
into an offsetting position rather than segregating or designating liquid assets (e.g., the Fund may cover a written put option with a purchased put option with the same or higher exercise price or cover a written call option with a purchased
call option with the same or lower exercise price). Although the Adviser will attempt to ensure that the Fund has sufficient liquid assets in respect of its obligations under its derivative contracts, it is possible that the Fund’s liquid
assets may be insufficient to support such obligations under its derivatives positions. The Fund may modify its asset segregation policies from time to time. 
Regulatory Issues. The Adviser is registered with the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the “CFTC”) as a commodity
pool operator (“CPO”); however, with respect to the Fund, the Adviser has claimed an exclusion from the definition of the term CPO under the Commodity Exchange Act (the “CEA”) pursuant to CFTC Rule 4.5. Accordingly, the Adviser
(with respect to the Fund) is not subject to registration or regulation as a CPO under the CEA. To remain eligible for the exclusion, the Fund will be limited in its ability to use certain financial instruments regulated under the CEA
(“commodity interests”), including futures and options on futures and certain swaps transactions.  Tax Aspects of Certain
Derivative Instruments Risks. The Fund’s investments in options and other derivative instruments could affect the amount, timing and character of its distributions to the Fund, which, in turn, could affect the amount, timing, and
character of the Fund’s distributions; in some cases, the tax treatment of such investments may not be certain. The tax issues relating to these and other types of investments and transactions are described more fully under “Tax
Status” below. 
  15



Additional Information about Other Investments of the Fund 
REITs. The Fund may invest in pooled real estate investment vehicles (“REITs”) and other real estate-related investments such
as securities of companies principally engaged in the real estate industry. REITs are subject to risks similar to those associated with direct ownership of real estate. Factors affecting real estate values include the supply of real property in
particular markets, overbuilding, changes in zoning laws, casualty or condemnation losses, delays in completion of construction, changes in operations costs and property taxes, levels of occupancy, adequacy of rent to cover operating expenses,
possible environmental liabilities, regulatory limitations on rent, fluctuations in rental income, increased competition, and other risks related to local and regional market conditions. The value of real estate-related investments also may be
affected by changes in interest rates, macroeconomic developments, and social and economic trends. For instance, during periods of declining interest rates, certain mortgage REITs may hold mortgages that the mortgagors elect to prepay, which
prepayment may diminish the yield on securities issued by those REITs. Some REITs have relatively small market capitalizations, which can tend to increase the volatility of the market prices of their securities. 
REITs are pooled investment vehicles that invest in real estate or real estate-related companies. The Funds may invest in different types of
REITs, including equity REITs, mortgage REITs, and hybrid REITs. Equity REITs, which invest in and own real estate directly, generally invest a majority of their assets in income-producing properties to generate cash flow from rental income and
gradual asset appreciation. The income-producing properties in which equity REITs invest typically include land, office, retail, industrial, hotel and apartment buildings, self storage, specialty and diversified and healthcare facilities. Equity
REITs can realize capital gains (or losses) by selling properties that have appreciated (or depreciated) in value. Mortgage REITs, which make construction, development, or long-term mortgage loans, generally invest the majority of their assets in
real estate mortgages or mortgage-backed securities and derive their income primarily from interest payments on the mortgages. Hybrid REITs share characteristics of equity REITs and mortgage REITs.

REITs can be listed and traded on national securities exchanges or can be traded privately between individual owners. An exchange-traded REIT
is generally more liquid than a REIT that is not traded on a securities exchange. The Fund may invest in both exchange-traded and privately traded REITs.

In general, the value of a REIT’s shares changes in light of factors affecting the real estate industry. In addition, equity REITs may be
affected by any changes in the value of the underlying property owned by the trusts, while mortgage REITs may be affected by the quality of any credit extended. REITs are also subject to the risk of fluctuations in income from underlying real estate
assets, poor performance by the REIT’s manager and the manager’s inability to manage cash flows generated by the REIT’s assets, prepayments and defaults by borrowers, self-liquidation, adverse changes in the tax laws, and, with regard
to certain REITs, the risk of failing to qualify for tax-free pass-through of income under the Code and/or to maintain exempt status under the 1940 Act. If a REIT were not to be eligible for the favorable tax treatment afforded to REITs under
the Code, it would be subject to federal income tax, thus reducing its value.  By investing in REITs indirectly through the Fund, an
investor will bear not only his or her proportionate share of the expenses of the Fund, but also, indirectly, similar expenses of REITs. In addition, REITs depend generally on their ability to generate cash flow to make distributions to investors.
 Leverage. The Fund may use leverage. Although the use of leverage may create an opportunity for increased returns of the Fund, it
also results in additional risks and can magnify the effect of any losses and thus could negatively impact the Fund’s business and results of operation and have important adverse consequences to the Fund’s investments. The loss on leverage
transactions may substantially exceed the initial investment.  The terms of financing arrangements entered into by the Fund or its
Subsidiaries may restrict the Fund’s or a Subsidiary’s operating flexibility, including covenants that, among others, may limit the Fund’s ability to: (i) pay distributions in certain circumstances, (ii) incur additional
debt, and (iii) engage in certain transactions. If the 
  16




Fund or a Subsidiary secures its leverage through the pledging of collateral, the Fund or Subsidiary may, if the Fund or Subsidiary is unable to generate sufficient cash flow to meet principal
and interest payments on its indebtedness, be subject to risk that it is required to surrender its collateral and that such collateral may be liquidated at inopportune times or at prices that are not favorable to the Fund and cause significant
losses. If a lender seizes and liquidates pledged collateral, such collateral may be sold at distressed price levels. The Fund will fail to realize the full value of such asset in a distressed sale.

The Fund or its Subsidiaries may be required to pay commitment fees and other costs of borrowings under the terms of a credit facility.
Moreover, interest on borrowings will be an expense of the Fund. With the use of borrowings, there is a risk that the interest rates paid by the Fund or a Subsidiary on the amount it borrows will be higher than the return on the Fund’s
investments. Such additional costs and expenses may affect the operating results of the Fund.  If the Fund or its Subsidiaries cannot
generate sufficient cash flow from investments, they may need to refinance all or a portion of indebtedness on or before maturity. The U.S. capital markets have recently experienced historic dislocations and liquidity disruptions, which have caused
financing to be unavailable in many cases and, even if available, have caused the cost of prospective financings to increase. These circumstances have materially impacted liquidity in the debt markets, making financing terms for borrowers able to
find financing less attractive, and in many cases have resulted in the unavailability of certain types of debt financing. Continued uncertainty in the debt and equity markets may negatively impact the Fund’s or a Subsidiary’s ability to
access financing on favorable terms or at all. The inability to obtain additional financing could have a material adverse effect on the Fund’s operations and on its ability to meet its debt obligations. If it is unable to refinance any of its
indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all, the Fund’s returns may be harmed.  Operational Risk. The Fund, its
service providers and other market participants increasingly depend on complex information technology and communications systems to conduct business functions. These systems are subject to a number of different threats or risks that could adversely
affect the Fund and its shareholders.   For example, unauthorized third parties may attempt to improperly access, modify, disrupt
the operations of or prevent access to these systems or data within them (a “cyber-attack”), whether systems of the Fund, the Fund’s service providers, counterparties or other market participants. Power or communications outages, acts
of God, information technology equipment malfunctions, operational errors (both human and systematic) and inaccuracies within software or data processing systems may also disrupt business operations or impact critical data. Market events also may
occur at a pace that overloads current information technology and communication systems and processes of the Fund, the Fund’s service providers or other market participants, impacting the ability to conduct the Fund’s operations. 
Cyber-attacks, disruptions or failures that affect the Fund’s service providers or counterparties may adversely affect the Fund and its
shareholders, including by causing losses for the Fund or impairing Fund operations. In addition, cyber-attacks, disruptions, or failures may cause reputational damage and subject the Fund or its service providers to regulatory fines, litigation
costs, penalties or financial losses, reimbursement or other compensation costs and/or additional compliance costs. The Fund and its service providers may also incur substantial costs for cybersecurity risk management in order to prevent or mitigate
cyber security incidents, and the Fund and its shareholders could be negatively impacted as a result of such costs.  As described under
“Alternative Lending Operational and Technology Risk” in the Prospectus, similar types of operational (both human and systematic) and technology risks are also present for issuers of securities or other instruments in which the Fund
invests, which could result in material adverse consequences for such issuers and may cause the Fund’s investments to lose value. In addition, cyber-attacks involving a Fund counterparty could affect such counterparty’s ability to meet its
obligations to the Fund, which may result in losses to the Fund and its shareholders. Furthermore, as a result of cyber-attacks, disruptions or failures, an exchange or market may close or issue trading halts on specific securities or the entire
market, which may result in, among other things, 
  17




the Fund’s inability to buy or sell certain securities or financial instruments or to accurately price its investments. The Fund cannot directly control any cybersecurity plans or systems
put in place by its service providers, Fund counterparties, issuers in which the Fund invests or securities markets and exchanges. 
Money Market Instruments. The Fund can invest in money market instruments, which are U.S. dollar-denominated, high-quality, short-term
debt obligations, to provide liquidity, for temporary defensive purposes, or for other purposes. Money market instruments may have fixed, variable or floating interest rates. Examples of money market instruments include obligations issued or
guaranteed by the U.S. government (or any of its agencies or instrumentalities); bank obligations, such as time deposits, certificates of deposit and bankers’ acceptances; commercial paper; and variable amount master demand notes. 
Obligations Issued or Guaranteed by U.S. Government Agencies or Instrumentalities. These include direct obligations and
mortgage-related securities that have different levels of credit support from the U.S. government. Some are supported by the full faith and credit of the United States, such as Government National Mortgage Association pass-through mortgage
certificates (called “Ginnie Maes”). Some are supported by the right of the issuer to borrow from the U.S. Treasury under certain circumstances, such as Federal National Mortgage Association bonds (“Fannie Maes”) and Federal Home
Loan Mortgage Corporation obligations (“Freddie Macs”). Others are supported only by the credit of the entity that issued them. Securities issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are also supported by commitments from the U.S. Treasury to
purchase certain of those agencies’ securities during market conditions in which the U.S. Treasury deems it necessary for the promotion of market stability. In September 2008, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, an independent regulatory
agency, placed the Federal National Mortgage Corporation and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation into conservatorship. The U.S. Department of Treasury also entered into a new secured lending credit facility with those companies and a preferred
stock purchase agreement. Under the preferred stock purchase agreement, the Treasury will ensure that each company maintains a positive net worth. 
U.S. Treasury Obligations. These include Treasury bills (which have maturities of one year or less when issued), Treasury notes (which
have maturities of one to ten years when issued), and Treasury bonds (which have maturities of more than ten years when issued). Treasury securities are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States as to timely payments of interest and
repayments of principal. Similar to other issuers, changes to the financial condition or credit rating of a government may cause the value of the Fund’s direct or indirect investment in Treasury obligations to decline. On August 5, 2011,
S&P downgraded U.S. Treasury securities from AAA rating to AA+. A downgrade of the ratings of U.S. government debt obligations, which are often used as a benchmark for other borrowing arrangements, could result in higher interest rates for
individual and corporate borrowers, cause disruptions in the international bond markets and generally have a substantial negative effect on the U.S. economy. A downgrade of Treasury securities from another ratings agency or a further downgrade
beyond AA+ rating by S&P may cause the value of the Fund’s Treasury obligations to decline.  The Fund can also buy or gain
exposure to U.S. Treasury securities whose interest coupons have been “stripped” by a Federal Reserve Bank, zero-coupon U.S. Treasury securities described below, and Treasury Inflation-Protection Securities (“TIPS”). The U.S.
Treasury securities called “TIPS” are designed to provide an investment that is not vulnerable to inflation. The interest rate paid by TIPS is fixed. The principal value rises or falls semi-annually based on changes in the published
Consumer Price Index. If inflation occurs, the principal and interest payments on TIPS are adjusted to protect investors from inflationary loss. If deflation occurs, the principal and interest payments will be adjusted downward, although the
principal will not fall below its face amount at maturity.  Any increase in the principal amount of an inflation-indexed bond will be
considered taxable ordinary income, even though investors do not receive their principal until maturity.

  18



Zero-Coupon Securities. The Fund can invest directly or indirectly in zero-coupon
securities. Zero-coupon U.S. government securities will typically be U.S. Treasury notes and U.S. Treasury bonds that have been stripped of their interest coupons or certificates representing interests in those stripped debt obligations and
coupons.  Zero-coupon securities do not make periodic interest payments and are sold at a deep discount from their face value at
maturity. The buyer recognizes a rate of return determined by the gradual appreciation of the security, which is redeemed at face value on a specified maturity date. This discount depends on the time remaining until maturity, as well as prevailing
interest rates, the liquidity of the security and the credit quality of the issuer. The discount typically decreases as the maturity date approaches.

Because zero-coupon securities pay no interest and compound semi-annually at the rate fixed at the time of their issuance, their value is
generally more volatile than the value of other debt securities that pay interest. Their value may fall more dramatically than the value of interest-bearing securities when interest rates rise. When prevailing interest rates fall, zero-coupon
securities tend to rise more rapidly in value because they have a fixed rate of return.
 The Fund’s exposure to zero-coupon
securities may cause the Fund to recognize income for federal income tax purposes without a corresponding receipt of cash; this can require the Fund to dispose of investments, including when not otherwise advantageous to do so, to meet distribution
requirements.  The Fund may also obtain exposure to zero-coupon and delayed interest securities, and “stripped” securities of
U.S. and foreign corporations and of foreign government issuers. These are similar in structure to zero-coupon and “stripped” U.S. government securities, but in the case of foreign government securities may or may not be backed by the
“full faith and credit” of the issuing foreign government. Zero-coupon securities issued by foreign governments and by corporations will be subject to greater credit risks than U.S. government zero-coupon securities. 
Additional Investment Strategies and Risks of the Fund 
Exchange-Traded Funds. The Fund may invest directly or indirectly in ETFs, which are investment companies or special purpose trusts
whose primary objective is to achieve the same rate of return as a particular market index while trading throughout the day on an exchange. The Fund may purchase and sell individual shares of ETFs in the secondary market. These secondary market
transactions require the payment of commissions.  Investments in ETFs are subject to the same risks as investments in other
investment companies, as described above. Certain risks of investing in an ETF are similar to those of investing in an indexed mutual fund, including tracking error risk (the risk of errors in matching the ETF’s underlying assets to the index);
and the risk that because an ETF is not actively managed, it cannot sell poorly performing stocks as long as they are represented in the index. Other ETF risks include the risk that ETFs may trade in the secondary market at a discount from their
NAVs and the risk that the ETFs may not be liquid. Furthermore, there may be times when the exchange halts trading, in which case the investors owning ETF shares would be unable to sell them until trading is resumed. In addition, because ETFs often
invest in a portfolio of common stocks and “track” a designated index, an overall decline in stocks comprising an ETF’s benchmark index could have a greater impact on the ETF and investors than might be the case in an investment
company with a more widely diversified portfolio. Losses could also occur if the ETF is unable to replicate the performance of the chosen benchmark index. Other risks associated with ETFs include the possibility that: (i) an ETF’s
distributions may decline if the issuers of the ETF’s portfolio securities fail to continue to pay dividends; and (ii) under certain circumstances, an ETF could be terminated. Should termination occur, the ETF could have to liquidate its
portfolio when the prices for those assets are falling. In addition, inadequate or irregularly provided information about an ETF or its investments could expose investors in ETFs to unknown risks. 
  19



Exchange-Traded Notes (“ETNs”). An investment in an ETN involves risks,
including possible loss of principal. ETNs are unsecured debt securities issued by a bank that are linked to the total return of a market index. Risks of investing in ETNs also include limited portfolio diversification, uncertain principal payment,
and illiquidity. Additionally, the investor fee will reduce the amount of return on maturity or at redemption, and as a result the investor may receive less than the principal amount a maturity or upon redemption, even if the value of the relevant
index has increased.  Floating Rate and Variable Rate Obligations. The Fund can invest directly or indirectly in debt
securities unrelated to the alternative lending industry that have floating or variable interest rates. Those variable rate obligations may have a demand feature that allows the Fund to tender the obligation to the issuer or a third party prior to
its maturity. The tender may be at par value plus accrued interest, according to the terms of the obligations.  Because the
interest rates on floating rate bonds adjust periodically to reflect current market rates, falling short-term interest rates should tend to decrease the income payable to the Fund on its floating rate investments and rising rates should tend to
increase that income. However, investments in floating rate and variable rate obligations should also mitigate the fluctuations in the Fund’s net asset value during periods of changing interest rates, compared to changes in values of fixed-rate
debt securities. Nevertheless, changes in interest rates can affect the value of the Fund’s floating rate investments, especially if rates change sharply in a short period, because the resets of the interest rates on the investments occur
periodically and will not all happen simultaneously with changes in prevailing rates. Having a shorter average reset period for their portfolio of investments may help mitigate that risk. 
The interest rate on a floating rate demand note is adjusted automatically according to a stated prevailing market rate, such as the Prime
Rate, the 91-day U.S. Treasury Bill rate, or some other standard. The instrument’s rate is adjusted automatically each time the base rate is adjusted. The interest rate on a variable rate note is also based on a stated prevailing market rate
but is adjusted automatically at specified intervals. Generally, the changes in the interest rate on such securities reduce the fluctuation in their market value. As interest rates decrease or increase, the potential for capital appreciation or
depreciation is less than that for fixed-rate obligations of the same maturity.  Floating rate and variable rate demand notes that have a
stated maturity in excess of one year may have features that permit the holder to recover the principal amount of the underlying security at specified intervals not exceeding one year and upon no more than 30 days’ notice. The issuer of that
type of note normally has a corresponding right in its discretion, after a given period, to prepay the outstanding principal amount of the note plus accrued interest. Generally the issuer must provide a specified number of days’ notice to the
holder. The Fund can also invest directly or indirectly in step-coupon bonds that have a coupon rate that changes periodically during the life of the security on pre-determined dates that are set when the security is issued. 
Portfolio Turnover. Purchases and sales of portfolio investments may be made as considered advisable by the Adviser in the best
interests of the shareholders. The Fund’s portfolio turnover rate may vary from year-to-year, as well as within a year. The Fund’s distributions of any net short-term capital gains realized from portfolio transactions are taxable to
shareholders as ordinary income. In addition, higher portfolio turnover rates can result in corresponding increases in portfolio transaction costs for the Fund. 
For reporting purposes, the Fund’s portfolio turnover rate is calculated by dividing the lesser of purchases or sales of portfolio
securities for the fiscal year by the monthly average of the value of the portfolio securities owned by the Fund during the fiscal year. In determining such portfolio turnover, all securities whose maturities at the time of acquisition were one year
or less are excluded. A 100% portfolio turnover rate would occur, for example, if all of the securities in the Fund’s investment portfolio (other than short-term money market securities) were replaced once during the fiscal year. Portfolio
turnover will not be a limiting factor should the Adviser deem it advisable to purchase or sell securities. 
  20



Repurchase Agreements. The Fund may enter into repurchase agreements with banks and
broker-dealers. It might do so with temporarily available cash (e.g., pending the investment of the proceeds from sales of Fund shares or pending the settlement of portfolio securities transactions) or for temporary defensive
purposes, as described below. A repurchase agreement is a contract under which the Fund acquires a security for a relatively short period (usually less than a week) for cash and subject to the commitment of the seller to repurchase the security for
an agreed-upon price on a specified date. The repurchase price exceeds the acquisition price and reflects an agreed-upon market rate unrelated to the coupon rate on the purchased security. Approved sellers include U.S. commercial banks, U.S.
branches of foreign banks, or broker-dealers that have been designated as primary dealers in government securities. They must meet credit requirements set by the Adviser from time to time. Repurchase agreements afford the Fund the opportunity to
earn a return on temporarily available cash without market risk, although the Fund bears the risk of a seller’s failure to meet its obligation to pay the repurchase price when it is required to do so. Such a default may subject the Fund to
expenses, delays, and risks of loss including: (i) possible declines in the value of the underlying security while the Fund seeks to enforce its rights thereto, (ii) possible reduced levels of income and lack of access to income during
this period, and (iii) the inability to enforce its rights and the expenses involved in attempted enforcement. Entering into repurchase agreements entails certain risks, which include the risk that the counterparty to the repurchase agreement
may not be able to fulfill its obligations, as discussed above, that the parties may disagree as to the meaning or application of contractual terms, or that the instrument may not perform as expected. There is no limit on the amount of the
Fund’s net assets that may be subject to repurchase agreements having maturities of seven days or less.  Reverse Repurchase
Agreements. The Fund may enter into reverse repurchase agreements with banks and brokers. Reverse repurchase agreements involve sales by the Fund of portfolio securities concurrently with an agreement by the Fund to repurchase the same
securities at a later date at a fixed price. During the reverse repurchase agreement period, the Fund continues to receive principal and interest payments on the securities and also has the opportunity to earn a return on the collateral furnished by
the counterparty to secure its obligation to redeliver the securities.  If the buyer in a reverse repurchase agreement files
for bankruptcy or becomes insolvent, the Fund’s use of proceeds from the sale of its securities may be restricted while the other party or its trustee or receiver determines whether to honor the Fund’s right to repurchase the securities.
Furthermore, in that situation the Fund may be unable to recover the securities it sold in connection with a reverse repurchase agreement and as a result would realize a loss equal to the difference between the value of the securities and the
payment it received for them. This loss would be greater to the extent the buyer paid less than the value of the securities the Fund sold to it (e.g., a buyer may only be willing to pay $95 for a bond with a market value of $100). The
Fund’s use of reverse repurchase agreements also subjects the Fund to interest costs based on the difference between the sale and repurchase price of a security involved in such a transaction. Additionally, reverse repurchase agreements entail
the same risks as OTC derivatives. These include the risk that the counterparty to the reverse repurchase agreement may not be able to fulfill its obligations, that the parties may disagree as to the meaning or application of contractual terms, or
that the instrument may not perform as expected. Reverse repurchase agreements and dollar rolls are not considered borrowings by the Fund for purposes of the Fund’s fundamental investment restriction on borrowings if the Fund covers its
obligations under these transactions or maintains liquid assets equal in value to its obligations in respect of these transactions. 
Securities Lending. The Fund may seek to earn income by lending portfolio securities to broker-dealers or other institutional
borrowers. The Fund may lend up to one-third of the value of its total assets (including borrowings) or such other amount as is permitted under relevant law. The Fund will not lend portfolio securities if, as a result, the aggregate of such loans
exceeds 33 1⁄3% of the value of the Fund’s total assets (including such loans). Loan arrangements made by the Fund will comply with all other applicable
regulatory requirements for securities lending, including with respect to changes in market values, termination, interest paid on loaned securities and ability to call back loaned securities for voting. 
  21



“Stripped” Securities. In addition to buying stripped Treasury securities (as
described herein), the Fund can invest directly or indirectly in stripped mortgage-related securities that are created by segregating the cash flows from underlying mortgage loans or mortgage securities to create two or more new securities. Each has
a specified percentage of the underlying security’s principal or interest payments. These are a form of derivative investment. 
Mortgage securities may be partially stripped so that each class receives some interest and some principal. However, they may be completely
stripped. In that case all of the interest is distributed to holders of one type of security, known as an “interest-only” security, or “I/O,” and all of the principal is distributed to holders of another type of security, known
as a “principal-only” security or “P/O.” Strips can be created for pass-through certificates or collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs). 
The yields to maturity of I/Os and P/Os are very sensitive to principal repayments (including prepayments) on the underlying mortgages. If the
underlying mortgages experience greater than anticipated prepayments of principal, the Fund might not fully recoup its investment in an I/O based on those assets. If underlying mortgages experience less than anticipated prepayments of principal, the
yield on the P/Os based on them could decline substantially.
 “When-Issued” and “Delayed-Delivery”
Transactions. The Fund may invest in securities on a “when-issued” basis and may purchase or sell securities on a “delayed-delivery” (or “forward-commitment”) basis. “When-issued” and
“delayed-delivery” are terms that refer to securities whose terms and indenture are available and for which a market exists, but which are not available for immediate delivery. 
When such transactions are negotiated, the price (which is generally expressed in yield terms) is fixed at the time the commitment is made.
Delivery and payment for the securities take place at a later date. The securities are subject to change in value from market fluctuations during the period until settlement. The value at delivery may be less than the purchase price. For example,
changes in interest rates in a direction other than that expected by the Adviser before settlement will affect the value of such securities and may cause a loss to the Fund. During the period between purchase and settlement, the Fund makes no
payment to the issuer and no interest accrues to the Fund from the investment until it receives the security at settlement.
 The Fund may
engage in when-issued transactions to secure what the Adviser considers to be an advantageous price and yield at the time the obligation is entered into. When the Fund enters into a when-issued or delayed-delivery transaction, it relies on the other
party to complete the transaction. Its failure to do so may cause the Fund to lose the opportunity to obtain the security at a price and yield the Adviser considers to be advantageous.

When the Fund engages in when-issued and delayed-delivery transactions, it does so for the purpose of acquiring or selling securities
consistent with its investment objective and policies or for delivery pursuant to options contracts it has entered into, and not for the purpose of investment leverage. Although the Fund’s purpose in entering into delayed-delivery or
when-issued purchase transactions is to acquire securities, it may dispose of a commitment prior to settlement. If the Fund chooses to dispose of the right to acquire a when-issued security prior to its acquisition or to dispose of its right to
delivery or receive against a forward commitment, it may incur a gain or loss.  At the time the Fund makes the commitment to purchase or
sell a security on a when-issued or delayed-delivery basis, it records the transaction on its books and reflects the value of the security purchased in determining the Fund’s net asset value. In a sale transaction, it records the proceeds to be
received. The Fund will identify on its books liquid assets at least equal in value to the value of the Fund’s purchase commitments until the Fund pays for the investment. 
When-issued and delayed-delivery transactions can be used by the Fund as a defensive technique to hedge against anticipated changes in
interest rates and prices. For instance, in periods of rising interest rates and falling prices, the Fund might sell securities in its portfolio on a forward commitment basis to attempt to limit its

  22




exposure to anticipated falling prices. In periods of falling interest rates and rising prices, the Fund might sell portfolio securities and purchase the same or similar securities on a
when-issued or delayed-delivery basis to obtain the benefit of currently higher cash yields.
 Illiquid Securities 
The Fund may hold illiquid securities, including, among other instruments, securities of some private issuers, securities traded in unregulated
or shallow markets and securities that are purchased in private placements and are subject to legal or contractual restrictions on resale. Because relatively few purchasers of these securities may exist, especially in the event of adverse economic
and liquidity conditions or adverse changes in the issuer’s financial condition, the Fund may not be able to initiate a transaction or liquidate a position in such investments at a desirable price or time. Disposing of illiquid securities may
involve time-consuming negotiation and legal expenses, and selling them promptly at an acceptable price may be difficult or impossible. 
Certain of the securities in which the Fund obtains exposure may be Rule 144A securities, which are securities that generally can be purchased
and sold only by certain sophisticated investors (called “qualified institutional buyers” or “QIBs”). Rule 144A securities are considered “restricted” securities. While certain restricted securities may, notwithstanding
limitations on resale, be treated as liquid if the Adviser determines, pursuant to the applicable procedures, that such treatment is warranted, there can be no guarantee that any such determination will continue. Illiquid securities may be difficult
to value, the Fund may be required to hold illiquid securities when it otherwise would sell such securities or may be forced to sell securities at a price lower than the price the Fund has valued such securities. This may result in losses to the
Fund and investors.  Investment Restrictions 
Fundamental Investment Restrictions of the Fund 
The following investment restrictions of the Fund are designated as fundamental policies and as such cannot be changed without the approval of
the holders of a majority of the Fund’s outstanding voting securities. Under the 1940 Act, a “majority” vote is defined as the vote of the holders of the lesser of: (a) 67% or more of the shares of the Fund present at a meeting
if the holders of more than 50% of the outstanding shares are present or represented by proxy at the meeting; or (b) more than 50% of the outstanding shares of the Fund. Under these restrictions, the Fund: 
(1) may issue senior securities to the extent permitted by applicable law;

(2) may borrow money to the extent permitted by applicable law;

(3) may underwrite securities to the extent permitted by applicable law;

(4) may purchase, sell or hold real estate to the extent permitted by applicable law;

(5) may make loans to the extent permitted by applicable law;

(6) may purchase and sell commodities to the extent permitted by applicable law;

(7) may not invest 25% or more of its total assets in a particular industry or group of industries (other than securities issued or guaranteed
by the U.S. government or its agencies or instrumentalities), provided that the Fund will invest, directly or indirectly, at least 25% of its total assets in the alternative lending industry;

(8) may not invest in loans that are of subprime quality at the time of investment, as determined by the Adviser pursuant to guidelines
approved by the Board;

  23



(9) may not purchase loans or other alternative lending-related securities from platforms whose
business consists primarily of originating loans of subprime quality, as determined by the Adviser pursuant to guidelines approved by the Board;

(10) may not purchase loans or other alternative lending-related securities originated in emerging markets, as determined by the Adviser
pursuant to guidelines approved by the Board; and
 (11) may not purchase loans or other alternative lending-related securities from
platforms whose financial statements are not audited by a nationally recognized accounting firm.
 Where applicable, the foregoing
investment restrictions shall be interpreted based on the applicable rules, regulations and pronouncements of the SEC and its staff.

The Adviser will determine whether loans offered to the Fund are of subprime quality at the time of investment pursuant to guidelines approved
by the Board from time to time. These guidelines currently provide that in order to be eligible for purchase by the Fund, the Adviser must determine that loans have a likelihood of repayment that is greater than that of “subprime” consumer
loans. “Subprime” does not have a specific legal or market definition, but is understood in the credit marketplace to signify that a loan has a material likelihood that it will not be repaid. The Adviser will make the determination that
loans purchased by the Fund are not of subprime quality based on the Adviser’s due diligence of the credit underwriting policies of the originating platform, which look to a number of borrower-specific factors to determine a borrower’s
ability to repay a particular loan, including employments status, income, assets, education, and credit bureau data where available. Although credit bureau data is only one factor considered in determining the credit quality of a borrower and a
loan, when FICO data is available with respect to a borrower, the Adviser’s guidelines do not allow the Adviser to cause the Fund to purchase any consumer loan to an individual whose FICO score is below 600 at the time of origination. 
The Adviser will determine whether loans offered to the Fund are originated in emerging markets pursuant to guidelines approved by the Board
from time to time. These guidelines currently provide that in order to be eligible for purchase by the Fund, the Adviser must determine that loans were originated in a “developed market” country as classified by MSCI Inc. by inclusion in
the MSCI World Index. The countries currently included in the MSCI World Index consist of Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal,
Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States.  The Fund has also adopted the following
fundamental policies in connection with administering its investment portfolio:
 (A) The Fund will value each whole loan owned by the Fund
individually for purposes of determining net asset value.
 (B) The Fund will determine net asset value daily.

(C) The Fund will only sell shares to or through fiduciaries (such as registered investment advisers or retirement plans) or institutional
investors, or to employees, directors and affiliates of the Fund or the Adviser.
 The Fund has also adopted the following fundamental policies in
order to repurchase its shares:
  


•
 
 On a quarterly basis, in the months of February, May, August and November, the Fund will make an offer to
repurchase a designated percentage of the outstanding shares from shareholders (a “Repurchase Offer”), pursuant to Rule 23c-3 under the 1940 Act, as it may be amended from time to time. 
 


•
 
 The Fund will repurchase shares that are tendered by a specific date (the “Repurchase Request
Deadline”). The Fund’s Board will establish the Repurchase Request Deadline for each Repurchase Offer. The 
  24





 
 
Repurchase Request Deadline will ordinarily be on a date approximately seven days before the date on which the Fund’s net asset value applicable to the Repurchase Offer is determined (the
“Repurchase Pricing Date”) but may be revised by the Adviser, in its sole discretion, based on factors such as market conditions, the level of the Fund’s assets and shareholder servicing considerations provided that the Board is
notified of this change and the reasons for it.   


•
 
 There will be a maximum 14 calendar day period (or the next business day if the 14th calendar day is not a
business day) between the Repurchase Request Deadline and the Repurchase Pricing Date.
 Summary of 1940 Act Restrictions on
Certain Activities  The fundamental investment limitations set forth above permit the Fund to engage in certain practices and
purchase securities and other instruments as permitted by, or consistent with, the 1940 Act. Relevant limitations of the 1940 Act as they presently exist are described below. These limitations are based either on the 1940 Act itself, the rules or
regulations thereunder or applicable orders of the SEC. In addition, interpretations and guidance provided by the SEC staff may be taken into account, where deemed appropriate by the Fund, to determine if a certain practice or the purchase of
securities or other instruments is permitted by the 1940 Act, the rules or regulations thereunder or applicable orders of the SEC. As a result, the foregoing fundamental investment policies may be interpreted differently over time as the statute,
rules, regulations or orders (or, if applicable, interpretations) that relate to the meaning and effect of these policies change.

Fundamental Investment Restriction (1). The ability of a closed-end fund to issue senior securities is circumscribed by complex regulatory
constraints under the 1940 Act that restrict, for instance, the amount, timing, and form of senior securities that may be issued. Certain portfolio management techniques may be considered senior securities unless appropriate steps are taken to
segregate the Fund’s assets or otherwise cover its obligations. To the extent the Fund covers its commitment under these transactions, including by the segregation of liquid assets, such instrument will not be considered a “senior
security” by the Fund. See “Additional Information About the Fund’s Use of Derivatives – Asset Segregation/Cover” above. Under the 1940 Act, a “senior security” does not include (i) any promissory note or
other evidence of indebtedness issued in consideration of any loan, extension, or renewal thereof, made by a bank or other person and privately arranged, and not intended to be publicly distributed or (ii) any promissory note or evidence of
indebtedness where such loan is for temporary purposes only and in an amount not exceeding 5% of the value of the total assets of the issuer at the time the loan is made. A loan is presumed to be for temporary purposes if it is repaid within sixty
days and is not extended or renewed.  Fundamental Investment Restriction (2). The Fund may borrow money in an amount not exceeding 33 1/3%
of its total assets (including the amount borrowed) less liabilities (other than borrowings) or in connection with engaging in transactions considered by the SEC to constitute a form of borrowing under the 1940 Act (e.g., reverse repurchase
agreements) to the extent permitted by the Fund’s investment objectives and policies.  Fundamental Investment Restriction (3). This
restriction would permit the underwriting of securities to the extent permitted under the 1940 Act.
 Fundamental Investment Restriction
(4). This restriction would permit the purchase, sale, or holding of real estate to the extent permitted under the 1940 Act. Real estate-related instruments include real estate investment trusts, commercial and residential mortgage-backed
securities, and real estate financings. The Fund does not intend to purchase, sell or hold any real estate as part of its principal investment strategy except to the extent associated with alternative lending-related securities, for example in the
case of a small business loan secured in part by real estate owned by the borrower.
 Fundamental Investment Restriction (5). Under the
1940 Act, the Fund may only make loans if expressly permitted to do so by its investment policies. As set forth in the Fund’s Principal Investment Strategies, the Fund 
  25




is permitted to make loans. The Fund may not make loans to persons who control or are under common control with the Fund.

Fundamental Investment Restriction (6). This restriction would permit investment in commodities to the extent permitted under the 1940 Act.
Commodities may be deemed to include any commodities contracts (including those with underlying bulk goods, such as grains, metals and foodstuffs), futures contracts and related options, options, and forward contracts. The 1940 Act does not directly
limit the Fund’s ability to invest directly in physical commodities. However, the Fund’s direct and indirect investments in physical commodities may be limited by the Fund’s intention to qualify as a regulated investment company, the
Fund’s investment strategy, and other regulatory requirements. While the Fund does not intend to invest in commodities, the Fund may invest in certain derivatives that are regulated by the CFTC for the purpose of hedging currency or interest
rate risk. See “Additional Information about the Fund’s Use of Derivatives — Regulatory Issues” above and “Tax Status” below. 
TRUSTEES AND OFFICERS 
Board of Trustees  The
business and affairs of the Fund are managed under the oversight of the Board subject to the laws of the State of Delaware and the Fund’s Agreement and Declaration of Trust (the “Declaration of Trust”). The Trustees are responsible
for oversight of the practices and processes of the Fund and its service providers, rather than active management of the Fund, including in matters relating to risk management. The Trustees seek to understand the key risks facing the Fund, including
those involving conflicts of interest, how Fund management identifies and monitors those risks on an ongoing basis; how Fund management develops and implements controls to mitigate those risks; and how Fund management tests the effectiveness of
those controls. The Board cannot foresee, know or guard against all risks, nor are the Trustees guarantors against risk. The officers of the Fund conduct and supervise the Fund’s daily business operations. Trustees who are not deemed to be
“interested persons” of the Fund as defined in the 1940 Act are referred to as “Independent Trustees.” Trustees who are deemed to be “interested persons” of the Fund are referred to as “Interested Trustees.”
 The Board meets as often as necessary to discharge its responsibilities. Currently, the Board conducts regular quarterly meetings,
including in-person or telephonic meetings, and holds special in-person or telephonic meetings as necessary to address specific issues that require attention prior to the next regularly scheduled meeting. At these meetings, Fund officers provide the
Board (or one of its committees) with written and oral reports on regulatory and compliance matters, operational and service provider matters, organizational developments, product proposals, audit results, and insurance and fidelity bond coverage.
In addition, it is expected that the Independent Trustees meet at least annually to review, among other things, investment management agreements, service plans and related agreements, transfer agency agreements and certain other agreements, and to
consider such other matters as they deem appropriate.
 The Board has established two standing committees — an Audit Committee and a
Valuation Committee — to assist the Board in its oversight of risk as part of its broader oversight of the Fund’s affairs. The Committees, both of which are comprised solely of the Board’s Independent Trustees, are described below.
The Board may establish other committees, or nominate one or more Trustees to examine particular issues related to the Board’s oversight responsibilities, from time to time. Each Committee meets periodically to perform its delegated oversight
functions and reports its findings and recommendations to the Board.  The Board does not have a lead Independent Trustee. The Board,
taking into consideration its oversight responsibility of the Fund, including the Fund’s regular use of fair valuation and the Board’s extensive experience overseeing the development and implementation of fair valuation processes for the
Adviser’s other registered funds, believes that its leadership structure is appropriate. In addition, the Board’s use of Committees 
  26




(each of which is chaired by an Independent Trustee with substantial industry experience) and the chair’s role as chief executive officer of the Adviser, serve to enhance the Board’s
understanding of the operations of the Fund and the Adviser.  Information About Each Board Member’s Experience, Qualifications,
Attributes or Skills. Board members of the Trust, together with information as to their positions with the Trust, principal occupations and other board memberships, are shown below. Unless otherwise noted, each Trustee has held each principal
occupation and board membership indicated for at least the past five years. Each Trustee’s mailing address is c/o Stone Ridge Asset Management LLC, 510 Madison Avenue, 21st Floor, New York, NY 10022.

 Mr. Stevens is an “interested person” of the Trust, as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the
1940 Act, due to his position with the Adviser.  Additional Information about the Trustees. 
Jeffery Ekberg – Through his experience as a senior officer, director and accountant of financial and other organizations,
Mr. Ekberg contributes experience overseeing financial and investment organizations to the Board. The Board also benefits from his experience as a member of the board of other funds. 
Daniel Charney – Through his experience as a senior officer of financial and other organizations, Mr. Charney contributes his
experience in the investment management industry to the Board.  Ross Stevens – Through his experience as a senior executive of
financial organizations, Mr. Stevens contributes his experience in the investment management industry to the Board.  Additional Information about
the Board’s Committees.  The Trust has an Audit Committee and a Valuation Committee. The members of both the Audit Committee and
the Valuation Committee consist of all the Independent Trustees, namely Messrs. Ekberg and Charney. Mr. Ekberg is the Audit Committee Chair and has been designated as the Audit Committee financial expert. Mr. Charney is the Valuation
Committee Chair.  In accordance with its written charter, the Audit Committee’s primary purposes are: (1) to oversee the
Trust’s accounting and financial reporting policies and practices, and its internal controls and procedures; (2) to oversee the quality and objectivity of the Trust’s and the Fund’s financial statements and the independent audit
thereof; (3) to oversee the activities of the Trust’s Chief Compliance Officer (the “CCO”); (4) to oversee the Trust’s compliance program adopted pursuant to Rule 38a-1 under the 1940 Act, and the Trust’s
implementation and enforcement of its compliance policies and procedures thereunder; (5) to oversee the Trust’s compliance with applicable laws in foreign jurisdictions, if any; and (6) to oversee compliance with the Code of Ethics by
the Trust and the Adviser.  The Audit Committee reviews the scope of the Fund’s audits, the Fund’s accounting and financial
reporting policies and practices and its internal controls. The Audit Committee approves, and recommends to the Independent Trustees for their ratification, the selection, appointment, retention or termination of the Fund’s independent
registered public accounting firm and approves the compensation of the independent registered public accounting firm. The Audit Committee also approves all audit and permissible non-audit services provided to the Fund by the independent registered
public accounting firm and all permissible non-audit services provided by the Fund’s independent registered public accounting firm to the Adviser and any affiliated service providers if the engagement relates directly to the Fund’s
operations and financial reporting.  The Valuation Committee also operates pursuant to a written charter. The duties and powers, to be
exercised at such times and in such manner as the Valuation Committee shall deem necessary or appropriate, are as follows: (1) reviewing, from time to time, the Trust’s valuation policy and procedures (the “Valuation Policy”),

Codes of Ethics. The Trust, the Adviser, and the Distributor each have adopted a code of ethics in accordance with Rule 17j-1 under the
1940 Act. These codes of ethics permit the personnel of these entities to invest in securities, including securities that the Fund may purchase or hold. The codes of ethics are on public file with, and are available from, the SEC.

The codes of ethics can be reviewed and copied by visiting the SEC’s Public Reference Room in Washington, D.C. Information on the
operation of the Public Reference Room may be obtained by calling the SEC at (202) 551-8090. The codes of ethics are also available on the EDGAR database of the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov. In addition, copies of the codes of
ethics may be obtained, after mailing the appropriate duplicating fee, by writing to the SEC’s Public Reference Section, 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549, or by e-mail request to publicinfo@sec.gov. 
Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures. Attached as Appendix B is the summary of the guidelines and procedures that the Adviser uses to
determine how to vote proxies relating to portfolio securities, including the procedures that the Adviser uses when a vote presents a conflict between the interests of Fund shareholders, on the one hand, and those of the Adviser or any affiliated
person of the Fund or the Adviser, on the other. This summary of the guidelines gives a general indication as to how the Adviser will vote proxies relating to portfolio securities on each issue listed. However, the guidelines do not address all
potential voting issues or the intricacies that may surround individual proxy votes. For that reason, there may be instances in which votes may vary from the guidelines presented. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Adviser always endeavors to vote
proxies relating to portfolio securities in accordance with the Fund’s investment objective. Information on how the Fund voted proxies relating to portfolio securities during the most recent prior 12-month period ending June 30 will be

  30




available without charge, (1) upon request, by calling (855) 609-3680, and (2) on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov.

CONTROL PERSONS AND PRINCIPAL HOLDERS OF SECURITIES 
A principal shareholder is any person who owns of record or beneficially 5% or more of any class of the Fund’s outstanding equity
securities. A control person is one who owns beneficially, either directly or through controlled companies, more than 25% of the voting securities of the Fund or acknowledges the existence of control. A controlling person possesses the ability to
control the outcome of matters submitted for shareholder vote by the Fund.  As of the date of this SAI, Stone Ridge owned of record
and beneficially 100% of the outstanding shares of the Fund.
 INVESTMENT ADVISORY AND OTHER SERVICES
 The Adviser 
Stone Ridge Asset Management LLC is the Adviser of the Fund. The Adviser was organized as a Delaware limited liability company in 2012. The
managing member of the Adviser is Ross Stevens. Ross Stevens, Chief Executive Officer and President of the Adviser, Patrick Kelly, Chief Operating Officer of the Adviser, and Lauren D. Macioce, General Counsel of the Adviser, are affiliated persons
of the Trust.
 Stone Ridge Asset Management LLC serves as the Adviser of the Fund pursuant to an investment advisory agreement. The
investment advisory agreement has an initial term of two years from its effective date and continues in effect with respect to the Fund (unless terminated sooner) if its continuance is specifically approved at least annually by the affirmative vote
of: (i) a majority of the Independent Trustees, cast in person at a meeting called for the purpose of voting on such approval; and (ii) a majority of the Board or the holders of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the Fund.
The investment advisory agreement may nevertheless be terminated at any time without penalty, on 60 days’ written notice, by the Board, by vote of holders of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the Fund, or by the Adviser. The
investment advisory agreement terminates automatically in the event of its assignment (as defined in the 1940 Act).  Pursuant to the
investment advisory agreement, the Adviser agrees to manage the investment and reinvestment of the Fund’s assets, determine what investments will be purchased, held, sold or exchanged by the Fund and what portion, if any, of the assets of the
Fund will be held uninvested, and continuously review, supervise and administer the investment program of the Fund. The Adviser bears its own operating and overhead expenses attributable to its duties under the investment advisory agreement (such as
salaries, bonuses, rent, office and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization, and auditing expenses), except that the Fund bears travel expenses (or an appropriate portion thereof) of Trustees or Fund officers who are partners,
directors, trustees, or employees of the Adviser to the extent that such expenses relate to attendance at meetings of the Board or any committees thereof or advisers thereto, and the Fund bears all or a portion of the expenses related to the
Fund’s chief compliance officer, as may be approved by the Board from time to time.  The Fund bears all other costs of its
operations, including, without limitation, the compensation of the Independent Trustees; ordinary administrative and operating expenses, including the management fee and all expenses associated with the pricing of Fund assets; risk management
expenses; ordinary and recurring investment expenses, including all fees and expenses directly related to portfolio transactions and positions for the Fund’s account (including brokerage, clearing and settlement costs), custodial costs and
interest charges; professional fees (including, without limitation, expenses of consultants, experts, and specialists); fees and 
  31




expenses in connection with repurchase offers and any repurchases or redemptions of Fund shares; legal expenses (including legal and other out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the
organization of the Fund and the offering of its shares); accounting and auditing expenses incurred in preparing, printing and delivering all reports (including such expenses incurred in connection with any Fund document) and tax information for
shareholders and regulatory authorities, and all filing costs, fees, travel expenses and any other expenses directly related to the investment of the Fund’s assets. The Fund will pay any extraordinary expenses it may incur, including any
litigation expenses.  As compensation for its services, the Fund pays the Adviser a fee, computed daily and paid monthly in arrears,
at the annual rate of 1.50% of the average daily net assets of the Fund. As described in the Prospectus, the Adviser has entered into an expense limitation agreement with the Fund.

If the Adviser receives compensation for providing management services to one or more wholly-owned and controlled Subsidiaries formed
by the Fund, the Adviser will not receive compensation from the Fund in respect of the assets of the Fund that are invested in the Subsidiary (i.e., the compensation paid to the Adviser for services to the Fund will be calculated based on the
Fund’s average daily net assets excluding the net assets of the Subsidiary).   Portfolio Managers 
Paul Germain, Robert Gutmann, Tomer Seifan, and Ross Stevens are jointly and primarily responsible for the day-to-day management of the Fund.
The following tables set forth certain additional information with respect to Paul Germain, Robert Gutmann, Tomer Seifan, and Ross Stevens. The information is as of March 31, 2016.

 Potential Conflicts of Interest 
The Adviser and the Fund have adopted compliance policies and procedures that are designed to avoid, mitigate, monitor and oversee areas that
could present potential conflicts of interest. The Adviser attempts to address these potential conflicts of interest through various compliance policies that are generally intended to place all accounts, regardless of fee structure, on the same
footing for investment management purposes. The Adviser has adopted trade allocation procedures that are designed to facilitate the fair allocation of limited investment opportunities among multiple clients. The Adviser’s trade allocation
policies generally provide that each day’s transactions in securities that are purchased or sold by multiple accounts are averaged as to price and allocated between clients in a manner that is fair and equitable to each client. Trade
allocations are reviewed on a periodic basis as part of the Adviser’s trade oversight procedures in an attempt to ensure fairness over time across clients and to monitor whether any client is systematically favored over time. There is no
guarantee, however, that the policies and procedures adopted by the Adviser and the Fund will be able to detect and/or prevent every situation in which an actual or potential conflict may appear. 
These potential conflicts include:

Allocation of Limited Time and Attention. A portfolio manager who is responsible for managing multiple client accounts may devote
unequal time and attention to the management of those accounts. As a result, the portfolio manager may not be able to formulate as complete a strategy or identify equally attractive investment opportunities for each of the accounts as might be the
case if he were to devote substantially more attention to the management of a single account. The effects of this potential conflict may be more pronounced where accounts overseen by a particular portfolio manager have different investment
strategies.
 Allocation of Limited Investment Opportunities. If a portfolio manager identifies a limited investment opportunity
that may be suitable for multiple clients, the opportunity may be allocated among these several clients, which may limit the Fund’s ability to take full advantage of the investment opportunity. 
As a result of regulations governing the ability of certain clients of the Adviser to invest side-by-side, it is possible that the Fund may
not be permitted to participate in an investment opportunity at the same time as another fund or another client of the Adviser. These limitations may limit the scope of investment opportunities that would otherwise be available to the Fund. The
decision as to which funds or other clients of the Adviser may participate in any particular investment opportunity will take into account the suitability of the investment opportunity for, and the strategy of, the applicable funds or other clients.
It is possible that the Fund may be prevented from participating due to such investment opportunity being more appropriately within the primary strategy of another fund or other client of the Adviser.

  33



Conflicts of Interest Among Strategies. At times, a portfolio manager may determine
that an investment opportunity may be appropriate for only some of the clients for which he exercises investment responsibility, or may decide that certain of the clients should take differing positions with respect to a particular security. In
these cases, the portfolio manager may place separate transactions for one or more clients, which may affect the market price of the security or the execution of the transaction, or both, to the detriment or benefit of one or more other clients.
Similarly, the Adviser or its personnel may take positions that are different from those taken by one or more clients. Conflicts may also arise in cases when clients invest in different parts of an issuer’s capital structure, including
circumstances in which one or more clients own private securities or obligations of an issuer and other clients may own public securities of the same issuer. Actions by investors in one part of the capital structure could disadvantage investors in
another part of the capital structure. In addition, purchases or sales of the same investment may be made for two or more clients on the same date. There can be no assurance that a client will not receive less (or more) of a certain investment than
it would otherwise receive if this conflict of interest among clients did not exist. In effecting transactions, it may not be possible, or consistent with the investment objectives of clients, to purchase or sell securities at the same time or at
the same prices.  Selection of Brokers/Dealers. Portfolio managers may be able to select or influence the selection of the brokers
and dealers that are used to execute securities transactions for the clients that they supervise. In addition to executing trades, some brokers and dealers provide portfolio managers with brokerage and research services (as those terms are defined
in Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)), which may result in the payment of higher brokerage fees than might have otherwise been available. These services may be more beneficial to
certain funds than to others.  Related Business Opportunities. The Adviser or its affiliates may provide more services (such as
distribution or recordkeeping) for some types of clients than for others. In such cases, a portfolio manager may benefit, either directly or indirectly, by devoting disproportionate attention to the management of clients that provide greater overall
returns to the Adviser and its affiliates.
 Variation in Compensation. A conflict of interest may arise where the financial or
other benefits available to a portfolio manager differ among the accounts that he manages. If the structure of the Adviser’s management fee and/or a portfolio manager’s compensation differs among clients (such as where certain clients pay
higher management fees), a portfolio manager might be motivated to help certain clients over others. A portfolio manager might be motivated to favor accounts in which he has an interest or in which the Adviser and/or its affiliates have interests.
Similarly, the desire to maintain or raise assets under management or to enhance a portfolio manager’s performance record or to derive other rewards, financial or otherwise, could influence a portfolio manager to lend preferential treatment to
those accounts that could most significantly benefit a portfolio manager.  Investments by Adviser or Related Entities. The
Adviser or a related entity has made investments in alternative lending-related securities for its or their own accounts prior to the commencement of investment operations of the Fund in order to test the investment strategy and infrastructure of
the Fund and its service providers. The Adviser or a related entity may make new investments in alternative lending-related securities following commencement of investment operations of the Fund.

In addition, the Adviser or a related entity may invest in entities that may act as sources of leverage for the Fund.

In addition, the Adviser or a related entity has made, and may from time to time make, equity investments in one or more companies that
operate alternative lending platforms from which the Fund may purchase alternative lending-related securities.

  34



Portfolio Manager Compensation 
As of March 31, 2016, portfolio managers receive a base salary and may also receive a bonus. Compensation of a portfolio manager is
determined at the discretion of the Adviser. It may be based on a number of factors including the portfolio manager’s experience, responsibilities, the perception of the quality of his or her work efforts, and the consistency with which he or
she demonstrates kindness to other employees, trading counterparties, vendors, and clients. As a firm focused on beta, the compensation of portfolio managers is not based upon the performance of client accounts that the portfolio managers
manage. The Adviser reviews the compensation of each portfolio manager at least annually.  Portfolio Manager Securities Ownership
 None of the portfolio managers listed above beneficially owned any shares of the Fund as of the date of this SAI because the Fund
had not yet commenced operations.
 Principal Underwriter 
Quasar Distributors, LLC, located at 615 East Michigan Street, Milwaukee, Wisconsin 53202 (the “Distributor”), is the principal
underwriter of shares of the Fund. Shares may be purchased only through the Distributor. The Distributor acts as the distributor of shares for the Fund on a best efforts basis, subject to various conditions, pursuant to the terms of a
distributor’s contract with the Fund. The Distributor is not obligated to sell any specific amount of shares of the Fund. The Distributor will also act as agent for the Fund in connection with repurchases of shares. 
Other Service Providers 
Administrator  The
Trust has entered into an administration agreement with U.S. Bancorp Fund Services, LLC (the “Administrator”) pursuant to which the Administrator provides administrative services to the Fund. The Administrator is responsible for
(i) the general administrative duties associated with the day-to-day operations of the Fund; (ii) conducting relations with the custodian, independent registered public accounting firm, legal counsel and other service providers;
(iii) providing regulatory reporting; and (iv) providing necessary office space, equipment, personnel, compensation and facilities for handling the affairs of the Fund. In performing its duties and obligations under the Administration
Agreement, the Administrator shall not be held liable except in the case of its bad faith, negligence or willful misconduct in the performance of its duties. 
U.S. Bancorp Fund Services, LLC also serves as fund accountant to the Fund under a separate agreement with the Trust and is responsible for
calculating the Fund’s total NAV, total net income and NAV per share of the Fund on a daily basis.  Transfer Agent/Dividend
Disbursing Agent  U.S. Bancorp Fund Services, LLC (the “Transfer Agent”) is the transfer agent for the Fund’s shares
and the dividend disbursing agent for payment of dividends and distributions on Fund shares. The principal business address of the Transfer Agent is 615 East Michigan Street, Milwaukee, Wisconsin 53202. 
  35



Custodian 
U.S. Bank, NA, located at 1555 N. Rivercenter Drive, Suite 302, Milwaukee, Wisconsin 53212, and Millennium Trust Company, LLC
(“Millennium”) located at 2001 Spring Rd #700, Oak Brook, IL 60523 serve as co-custodians for the Fund’s assets (together, the “Custodians” and each, a “Custodian”). Millennium also serves as the custodian for
assets held by the Fund’s Subsidiaries. As such, each Custodian holds in safekeeping certificated securities and cash belonging to the Fund and, in such capacity, is the registered owner of securities in book-entry form belonging to the Fund.
Upon instruction, each Custodian receives and delivers cash and securities of the Fund in connection with Fund transactions and collects all dividends and other distributions made with respect to Fund portfolio securities. Each Custodian also
maintains certain accounts and records of the Fund.  Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
Ernst & Young LLP, serves as the Fund’s independent registered public accountant. Ernst & Young LLP provides audit
services and assistance and consultation in connection with the review of SEC filings and certain tax compliance services. Ernst & Young LLP is located at 5 Times Square, New York, New York 10036. 
Counsel  Ropes & Gray LLP serves
as counsel to the Fund, and is located at 800 Boylston Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02199.  PURCHASE AND
REDEMPTION OF SHARES  The Fund currently offers one class of shares. The Declaration of Trust authorizes the issuance of an unlimited
number of shares. The Trustees of the Fund have authority under the Declaration of Trust to create and classify shares into separate series and to classify and reclassify any series of shares into one or more classes without further action by
shareholders. The Trustees of the Fund may designate additional series and classes in the future from time to time.
 The shares will be
issued with a par value of $0.01 per share. All shares of the Fund have equal rights as to the payment of dividends and the distribution of assets upon liquidation of the Fund. The shares will, when issued, be fully paid and non-assessable by the
Fund and will have no preemptive or conversion rights to cumulative voting.
 The shares are designed primarily for long-term investors,
and investors in the shares should not view the Fund as a vehicle for short-term trading purposes.
 Unlike most closed-end funds, the
Fund expects to continuously offer its shares. The Fund’s shares will not be listed on any securities exchange and will not be publicly traded. Thus, there is no secondary market for the Fund’s shares and the Fund expects that no secondary
market will develop. In order to provide liquidity to shareholders, the Fund has determined that commencing in November 2016 and quarterly thereafter, it will make offers to repurchase typically for 5% of the Fund’s outstanding shares at NAV
subject to approval of the Board and in all cases such repurchases will be for at least 5% and not more than 25% of its outstanding shares at NAV. In connection with any given Repurchase Offer, it is possible that the Fund may offer to repurchase
only the minimum amount of 5% of its outstanding shares. It is also possible that a Repurchase Offer may be oversubscribed, with the result that shareholders may only be able to have a portion of their shares repurchased. The Fund intends to offer
the shares in a continuous offering of its shares at net asset value, plus the applicable sales charge. There can be no assurance that the Fund will offer its shares on a continuous basis, or if so offered, that it will do so indefinitely. 
  36



COMPUTATION OF NET ASSET VALUE 
The Fund’s shares are valued as of a particular time (the “Valuation Time”) on each day that the New York Stock Exchange
(“NYSE”) opens for business. The Valuation Time is ordinarily at the close of regular trading on the NYSE (normally 4:00 p.m. Eastern time). The Trust expects that the holidays upon which the NYSE will be closed are as follows: New
Year’s Day, Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, Washington’s Birthday, Good Friday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day. 
Fund liabilities plus any distribution and/or servicing fees and any other expenses are deducted from the Fund’s assets, and the
resulting amount is divided by the number of shares outstanding to produce the Fund’s per share NAV. In accordance with regulations governing registered investment companies, the Fund’s transactions in portfolio securities and purchases
and sales of Fund shares (which bear upon the number of Fund shares outstanding) are generally not reflected in the NAV determined for the Business Day on which the transactions are effected (the trade date), but rather on the following Business
Day.  The Board has approved procedures pursuant to which the Fund will value its investments (the “Valuation Procedures”). The
Trustees have established a Valuation Committee comprised of officers of the Adviser to which they have delegated responsibility for overseeing the implementation of the Valuation Procedures and fair value determinations made on behalf of the Board.
In accordance with these procedures, the Fund’s investments for which market quotations are readily available are valued at market value. Listed below is a summary of certain of the methods generally used to value investments (some or all of
which may be held by the Fund) under the Valuation Procedures:  Short-term debt instruments, such as commercial paper,
bankers’ acceptances and U.S. Treasury Bills, having a maturity of less than 60 days are valued at amortized cost. 
Other debt securities, including corporate and government debt securities (of U.S. or foreign issuers) and municipal debt
securities in each case having a remaining maturity in excess of 60 days, loans, mortgage-backed securities, collateralized mortgage obligations, and other asset-backed securities are valued by an independent pricing service.

Equity securities are valued at the last sale, official close or if there are no reported sales at the mean between the bid and
asked price on the primary exchange on which they are traded. The values of the Fund’s investments in publicly traded foreign equity securities generally will be determined by a pricing service using pricing models designed to estimate likely
changes in the values of those securities between the times in which the trading in those securities is substantially completed and the close of the NYSE. 
Domestic exchange-traded options are generally valued at the mean of their highest bid and lowest ask, taken across all
exchanges where the options are traded. Over the counter domestic options not traded on an exchange are valued at the mean of the bid and asked quotations. Foreign options are valued at the settlement price on the exchange on which they are
primarily traded.
 Non-exchange traded derivatives are generally valued on the basis of valuations provided by a pricing
service or using quotes provided by a broker/dealer (typically the counterparty).
 Pursuant to the Fund’s policies
and procedures, most of the Fund’s holdings in alternative lending-related securities are fair valued based on prices provided by a third-party pricing service. The Fund accounts for whole and fractional loans at the individual loan level for
valuation purposes, and whole loans are fair valued using inputs that take into account borrower-level data (e.g., payment history) that is updated periodically as often as the NAV is calculated to reflect new information regarding the borrower or
loan.  If market quotations are not readily available (including in cases where available market quotations are deemed to be
unreliable or infrequent), the Fund’s investments will be valued as determined in good faith pursuant to the Valuation Procedures (so-called “fair value pricing”). Fair value pricing may require subjective determinations about the
value of a security or other asset, and fair values used to determine the Fund’s NAV may differ from 
  37




quoted or published prices, or from prices that are used by others, for the same investments. Also, the use of fair value pricing may not always result in adjustments to the prices of securities
or other assets held by the Fund and it is possible that the fair value determined for a security may be materially different than the value that could be realized upon the sale of such security. The Prospectus provides additional information
regarding the circumstances in which fair value pricing may be used and related information.
 PORTFOLIO
TRANSACTIONS AND BROKERAGE  Investment Decisions and Portfolio Transactions 
Investment decisions for the Fund are made with a view to achieving its investment objective. Investment decisions are the product of many
factors in addition to basic suitability for the particular client involved (including the Fund). Some securities considered for investment by the Fund also may be appropriate for other clients served by the Adviser. Thus, a particular security may
be bought or sold for certain clients even though it could have been bought or sold for other clients at the same time. If a purchase or sale of securities consistent with the investment policies of the Fund and one or more of these clients is
considered at or about the same time, transactions in such securities will be allocated among the Fund and clients in a manner deemed fair and reasonable by the Adviser. The Adviser will generally execute transactions for the Fund on an aggregated
basis when the Adviser believes that to do so will allow it to obtain best execution and to negotiate more favorable commission rates or other transaction costs that might have otherwise been paid had such orders been placed independently.
Aggregation, or “bunching,” describes a procedure whereby an investment adviser combines the orders of two or more clients into a single order for the purpose of obtaining better prices and lower execution costs. 
Brokerage and Research Services  There is
generally no stated commission in the case of securities traded on a principal basis in the over-the-counter markets, but the price paid by the Fund usually includes an undisclosed dealer commission or markup. In underwritten offerings, the price
paid by the Fund includes a disclosed, fixed commission or discount retained by the underwriter or dealer. Transactions on U.S. stock exchanges and other agency transactions involve the payment by the Fund of negotiated brokerage commissions. Such
commissions vary among different brokers. Also, a particular broker may charge different commissions according to such factors as the difficulty and size of the transaction. Transactions in non-U.S. securities generally involve the payment of fixed
brokerage commissions, which are generally higher than those in the United States. The purchase by the Fund of participations or assignments may be pursuant to privately negotiated transactions pursuant to which the Fund may be required to pay fees
to the seller or forego a portion of payments in respect of the participation agreement.
 The Adviser places orders for the purchase and
sale of portfolio securities, options and futures contracts and buys and sells such securities, options and futures for the Fund through multiple brokers and dealers. The Adviser will place trades for execution only with approved brokers or dealers.
In effecting such purchases and sales, the Adviser seeks the most favorable price and execution of the Fund’s orders. In doing so, the Fund may pay higher commissions than the lowest available when the Adviser believes it is reasonable to do
so. In seeking the most favorable price and execution, the Adviser, having in mind the Fund’s best interests, considers all factors it deems relevant, including, price, the size of the transaction, the nature of the market for the security, the
amount of the commission, the timing of the transaction taking into account market prices and trends, the reputation, experience and financial stability of the broker-dealer involved and the quality of service rendered by the broker-dealer in that
or other transactions.  It has for many years been a common practice in the investment advisory business for advisers of investment
companies and other institutional investors to receive research and brokerage products and services (together,

  38




“services”) from broker-dealers which execute portfolio transactions for the clients of such advisers. Consistent with this practice, the Adviser receives services from many
broker-dealers with which the Adviser places the Fund’s portfolio transactions. These services, which in some cases also may be purchased for cash, may include, among other things, such items as general economic and security market reviews,
industry and company reviews, evaluations of securities, recommendations as to the purchase and sale of securities, and services related to the execution of securities transactions. The advisory fees paid by the Fund are not reduced because the
Adviser receives such services even though the receipt of such services relieves the Adviser from expenses they might otherwise bear. Research and brokerage services provided by broker-dealers chosen by the Adviser to place the Fund’s portfolio
transactions may be useful to the Adviser in providing services to the Adviser’s other clients, although not all of these services may be necessarily useful and of value to the Adviser in managing the Fund. Conversely, research and brokerage
services provided to the Adviser by broker-dealers in connection with trades executed on behalf of other clients of the Adviser may be useful to the Adviser in managing the Fund, although not all of these services may be necessarily useful and of
value to the Adviser in managing such other clients.  In reliance on the “safe harbor” provided by Section 28(e) of the
Exchange Act, the Adviser may cause the Fund to pay a broker-dealer which provides “brokerage and research services” (as defined for purposes of Section 28(e)) to the Adviser an amount of commission for effecting a securities
transaction for the Fund in excess of the commission which another broker-dealer would have charged for effecting that transaction if the Adviser makes a good faith determination that the commissions are reasonable in relation to the value of
brokerage and research services provided, viewed in terms of either a particular transaction or the Adviser’s overall responsibilities to all discretionary accounts. 
The Adviser may place orders for the purchase and sale of exchange-listed portfolio securities with a broker-dealer that is an affiliate of
the Adviser where, in the judgment of the Adviser, such firm will be able to obtain a price and execution at least as favorable as other qualified broker-dealers. Pursuant to rules of the SEC, a broker-dealer that is an affiliate of the Adviser may
receive and retain compensation for effecting portfolio transactions for the Fund on a securities exchange if the commissions paid to such an affiliated broker-dealer by the Fund on exchange transactions do not exceed “usual and customary
brokerage commissions.” The rules define “usual and customary” commissions to include amounts which are “reasonable and fair compared to the commission, fee or other remuneration received or to be received by other brokers in
connection with comparable transactions involving similar securities being purchased or sold on a securities exchange during a comparable period of time.” 
Regular Broker Dealers  The Fund is
required to identify the securities of its regular brokers or dealers (as defined in Rule 10b-1 under the 1940 Act) or their parent companies held by the Fund as of the close of their most recent fiscal year and state the value of such holdings. As
of the date of this SAI, the Fund did not hold any securities of its regular brokers or dealers or their parent companies because the Fund had not yet begun investment operations.

TAX STATUS 
The following discussion of U.S. federal income tax consequences of investment in the Fund is based on the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the “Code”), U.S. Treasury regulations, and other applicable authority, as of the date of the preparation of this SAI. These authorities are subject to change by legislative or administrative action, possibly with retroactive
effect. The following discussion is only a summary of some of the important U.S. federal income tax considerations generally applicable to investments in the Fund. There may be other tax considerations applicable to particular shareholders.
Shareholders should consult their own tax advisors regarding their particular situation and the possible application of federal, state, local or non-U.S. tax laws. 
  39



Taxation of the Fund 
The Fund intends to elect and intends to qualify and be treated each year as a regulated investment company under Subchapter M of the Code. In
order to qualify for the special tax treatment accorded regulated investment companies and their shareholders, the Fund must, among other things:

(a) derive at least 90% of its gross income for each taxable year from (i) dividends, interest, payments with respect to
certain securities loans, and gains from the sale or other disposition of stock, securities or foreign currencies, or other income (including but not limited to gains from options, futures, or forward contracts) derived with respect to its business
of investing in such stock, securities, or currencies, and (ii) net income derived from interests in “qualified publicly traded partnerships” (as defined below); 
(b) diversify its holdings so that, at the end of each quarter of the Fund’s taxable year, (i) at least 50% of the
value of the Fund’s total assets is represented by cash and cash items, U.S. government securities, securities of other regulated investment companies, and other securities limited in respect of any one issuer to a value not greater than 5% of
the value of the Fund’s total assets and not more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of such issuer, and (ii) not more than 25% of the value of the Fund’s total assets is invested, including through corporations in which
the Fund owns a 20% or more voting stock interest, (x) in the securities (other than those of the U.S. government or other regulated investment companies) of any one issuer or of two or more issuers that the Fund controls and that are engaged
in the same, similar, or related trades or businesses, or (y) in the securities of one or more qualified publicly traded partnerships (as defined below); and 
(c) distribute with respect to each taxable year at least 90% of the sum of its investment company taxable income (as that term
is defined in the Code without regard to the deduction for dividends paid—generally, taxable ordinary income and the excess, if any, of net short-term capital gains over net long-term capital losses) and any net tax-exempt interest income for
such year.  In general, for purposes of the 90% gross income requirement described in paragraph (a) above, income derived from a
partnership will be treated as qualifying income only to the extent such income is attributable to items of income of the partnership that would be qualifying income if realized directly by the regulated investment company. However, 100% of the net
income derived from an interest in a “qualified publicly traded partnership” (a partnership (x) the interests in which are traded on an established securities market or are readily tradable on a secondary market or the substantial
equivalent thereof, and (y) that derives less than 90% of its income from the qualifying income described in paragraph (a)(i) above) will be treated as qualifying income. In general, such entities will be treated as partnerships for federal
income tax purposes because they meet the passive income requirement under Code section 7704(c)(2). In addition, although in general the passive loss rules of the Code do not apply to regulated investment companies, such rules do apply to a
regulated investment company with respect to items attributable to an interest in a qualified publicly traded partnership.  For
purposes of the diversification test in (b) above, the term “outstanding voting securities of such issuer” will include the equity securities of a qualified publicly traded partnership. Also, for purposes of the diversification test
in (b) above, the identification of the issuer (or, in some cases, issuers) of a particular Fund investment can depend on the terms and conditions of that investment. In some cases, identification of the issuer (or issuers) is uncertain under
current law, and an adverse determination or future guidance by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) with respect to issuer identification for a particular type of investment may adversely affect the Fund’s ability to meet the
diversification test in (b) above. In addition, if the Fund were to own 20% or more of the voting interests of a corporation, the Fund would be required to “look through” such corporation to its holdings and combine the appropriate
percentage of such corporation’s assets with the Fund’s assets for purposes of satisfying the 25% diversification test described in (b)(ii) above. Gains from foreign currencies (including foreign currency options, foreign currency swaps,
foreign currency futures and foreign currency forward contracts) currently constitute qualifying income for purposes of the 90% gross income test, described in (a) above. However, the Treasury Department has the authority to issue regulations
(possibly with retroactive effect) excluding from the definition of “qualifying income” the Fund’s foreign currency gains to the extent that such income is not directly related to the Fund’s principal business of investing in
stock or securities. 
  40



The Fund’s investment strategy will potentially be limited by its intention to qualify for
treatment as a regulated investment company. The tax treatment of certain of the Fund’s investments under one or more of the qualification or distribution tests applicable to RICs is not certain. An adverse determination or future guidance by
the IRS might affect the Fund’s ability to qualify for such treatment.  If the Fund qualifies as a regulated investment company that
is accorded special tax treatment, the Fund generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on income distributed in a timely manner to its shareholders in the form of dividends (including Capital Gain Dividends, as defined below). If the
Fund were to fail to meet the income, diversification or distribution tests described above, the Fund could in some cases cure such failure, including by paying a Fund-level tax, paying interest, making additional distributions or disposing of
certain assets. If the Fund were ineligible to or otherwise did not cure such failure for any year, or if the Fund were otherwise to fail to qualify as a regulated investment company accorded special tax treatment for such year, the Fund would be
subject to tax on its taxable income at corporate rates, and all distributions from earnings and profits, including any distributions of net tax-exempt income and net long-term capital gains, would be taxable to shareholders as ordinary income. Some
portions of such distributions could be eligible for the dividends-received deduction in the case of corporate shareholders and may be eligible to be treated as “qualified dividend income” in the case of shareholders taxed as individuals,
provided, in both cases, that the shareholder meets certain holding period and other requirements in respect of the Fund’s shares (as described below). In addition, the Fund could be required to recognize unrealized gains, pay substantial taxes
and interest and make substantial distributions before re-qualifying as a regulated investment company that is accorded special tax treatment. 
The Fund intends to distribute to its shareholders, at least annually, substantially all of its investment company taxable income (computed
without regard to the dividends paid deduction), any net tax-exempt income and any net capital gains. Investment company taxable income that is retained by the Fund will be subject to tax at regular corporate rates. The Fund may also retain for
investment its net capital gain. If the Fund retains any net capital gain, it will be subject to tax at regular corporate rates on the amount retained, but it may designate the retained amount as undistributed capital gains in a notice mailed within
60 days of the close of the Fund’s taxable year to its shareholders who, in turn, (i) will be required to include in income for U.S. federal income tax purposes, as long-term capital gain, their shares of such undistributed amount, and
(ii) will be entitled to credit their proportionate shares of the tax paid by the Fund on such undistributed amount against their U.S. federal income tax liabilities, if any, and to claim refunds on properly-filed U.S. tax returns to the extent
the credit exceeds such liabilities. If the Fund makes this designation, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the tax basis of shares owned by a shareholder of the Fund will be increased by an amount equal under current law to the difference
between the amount of undistributed capital gains included in the shareholder’s gross income, under clause (i) of the preceding sentence, and the tax deemed paid by the shareholder under clause (ii) of the preceding sentence. The Fund
is not required to, and there can be no assurance that the Fund will, make this designation if it retains all or a portion of its net capital gain in a taxable year. 
In determining its net capital gain, including in connection with determining the amount available to support a Capital Gain Dividend (as
defined below), its taxable income and its earnings and profits, a RIC generally may elect to treat part or all of any post-October capital loss (defined as any net capital loss attributable to the portion, if any, of the taxable year after
October 31, or, if there is no such loss, the net long-term capital loss or net short-term capital loss attributable to any such portion of the taxable year), or late-year ordinary loss (generally, the sum of its (i) net ordinary loss from
the sale, exchange or other taxable disposition of property attributable to the portion, if any, of the taxable year after October 31, and its (ii) other net ordinary loss attributable to the portion, if any, of the taxable year after
December 31) as if incurred in the succeeding taxable year.  If the Fund fails to distribute in a calendar year an amount at least
equal to the sum of 98% of its ordinary income for such year and 98.2% of its capital gain net income for the one-year period ending on October 31 of such year, plus any retained amount for the prior year, the Fund will be subject to a
nondeductible 4% excise tax on the undistributed amounts. For these purposes, ordinary gains and losses from the sale, exchange or other taxable disposition of property that would be properly taken into account after October 31 are treated as
arising on January 1 
  41




of the following calendar year. For purposes of the excise tax, the Fund will be treated as having distributed any amount on which it has been subject to corporate income tax in the taxable year
ending within the calendar year. A dividend paid to shareholders in January of a year generally is deemed to have been paid on December 31 of the preceding year, if the dividend is declared and payable to shareholders of record on a date in
October, November or December of that preceding year. The Fund intends generally to make distributions sufficient to avoid imposition of the 4% excise tax, although there can be no assurance that it will be able to do so. 
Fund Distributions  Shareholders subject
to U.S. federal income tax will be subject to tax on dividends received from the Fund, regardless of whether received in cash or reinvested in additional shares. Such distributions generally will be taxable to shareholders in the calendar year in
which the distributions are declared, rather than the calendar year in which the distributions are received. Distributions received by tax-exempt shareholders generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax to the extent permitted under
applicable tax law.
 For U.S. federal income tax purposes, distributions of investment income generally are taxable to shareholders as
ordinary income. Taxes to shareholders on distributions of capital gains are determined by how long the Fund owned (and is treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as having owned) the investments that generated them, rather than how long a
shareholder has owned his or her shares. In general, the Fund will recognize long-term capital gain or loss on investments it has owned (or is deemed to have owned) for more than one year, and short-term capital gain or loss on investments it has
owned (or is deemed to have owned) for one year or less. Tax rules can alter the Fund’s holding period in investments and thereby affect the tax treatment of gain or loss on such investments. Distributions of net capital gain (that is, the
excess of net long-term capital gain over net short-term capital loss, in each case determined with reference to any loss carryforwards) that are properly reported by the Fund as capital gain dividends (“Capital Gain Dividends”) generally
will be taxable to shareholders as long-term capital gains includible in net capital gain and taxed to individuals at reduced rates. Distributions of net short-term capital gain (as reduced by any long-term capital loss for the taxable year) will be
taxable to shareholders as ordinary income, and shareholders will not be able to offset distributions of the Fund’s net short-term capital gains with capital losses that they recognize with respect to their other investments. 
As required by federal law, detailed federal tax information with respect to each calendar year will be furnished to each shareholder early in
the succeeding year.
 The ultimate tax characterization of the Fund’s distributions made in a taxable year cannot finally be
determined until after the end of that taxable year. As a result, there is a possibility that the Fund may make total distributions during a taxable year in an amount that exceeds the Fund’s “current and accumulated earnings and
profits” (generally, the net investment income and net capital gains of the Fund with respect to that year), in which case the excess generally will be treated as a return of capital, which will be tax-free to the holders of the shares, up to
the amount of the shareholder’s tax basis in the applicable shares, with any amounts exceeding such basis treated as gain from the sale of such shares. 
Capital losses in excess of capital gains (“net capital losses”) are not permitted to be deducted against the Fund’s net
investment income. Instead, potentially subject to certain limitations, the Fund may carry net capital losses from any taxable year forward to subsequent taxable years without expiration to offset capital gains, if any, realized during such
subsequent taxable years. Capital loss carryforwards are reduced to the extent they offset current-year net realized capital gains, whether the Fund retains or distributes such gains. The Fund must apply such carryforwards first against gains of the
same character. The Fund’s available capital loss carryforwards, if any, will be set forth in its annual shareholder report for each fiscal year. 
“Qualified dividend income” received by an individual will be taxed at the rates applicable to long-term capital gain. In order for
some portion of the dividends received by the Fund shareholder to be qualified dividend income, the Fund must meet holding period and other requirements with respect to some portion of the dividend-
  42




paying stocks in its portfolio and the shareholder must meet holding period and other requirements with respect to the Fund’s shares. In general, a dividend will not be treated as qualified
dividend income (at either the Fund or shareholder level) (1) if the dividend is received with respect to any share of stock held for fewer than 61 days during the 121-day period beginning on the date that is 60 days before the date on which
such share becomes ex-dividend with respect to such dividend (or, in the case of certain preferred stock, 91 days during the 181-day period beginning 90 days before such date), (2) to the extent that the recipient is under an obligation
(whether pursuant to a short sale or otherwise) to make related payments with respect to positions in substantially similar or related property, (3) if the recipient elects to have the dividend income treated as investment income for purposes
of the limitation on deductibility of investment interest, or (4) if the dividend is received from a foreign corporation that is (a) not eligible for the benefits of a comprehensive income tax treaty with the United States (with the
exception of dividends paid on stock of such a foreign corporation readily tradable on an established securities market in the United States) or (b) treated as a passive foreign investment company. 
In general, distributions of investment income reported by the Fund as derived from qualified dividend income will be treated as qualified
dividend income by a shareholder taxed as an individual, provided both the shareholder and the Fund meet the holding period and other requirements described above. If the aggregate qualified dividends received by the Fund during any taxable year are
95% or more of its gross income (excluding net long-term capital gain over net short-term capital loss), then 100% of the Fund’s dividends (other than Capital Gain Dividends) will be eligible to be treated as qualified dividend income. It is
unclear whether or to what extent distributions from the Fund will constitute qualified dividend income.  In general, dividends of net
investment income received by corporate shareholders of the Fund will qualify for the 70% dividends-received deduction generally available to corporations to the extent of the amount of eligible dividends received by the Fund from domestic
corporations for the taxable year. A dividend received by the Fund will not be treated as a dividend eligible for the dividends-received deduction (1) if it has been received with respect to any share of stock that the Fund has held for less
than 46 days (91 days in the case of certain preferred stock) during the 91-day period beginning on the date which is 45 days before the date on which such share becomes ex-dividend with respect to such dividend (during the 181-day period beginning
90 days before such date in the case of certain preferred stock) or (2) to the extent that the Fund is under an obligation (pursuant to a short sale or otherwise) to make related payments with respect to positions in substantially similar or
related property. Moreover, the dividends received deduction may otherwise be disallowed or reduced (1) if the corporate shareholder fails to satisfy the foregoing requirements with respect to its shares of the Fund or (2) by application
of various provisions of the Code (for instance, the dividends-received deduction is reduced in the case of a dividend received on debt-financed portfolio stock (generally, stock acquired with borrowed funds)). It is unclear whether or to what
extent distributions from the Fund will qualify for the dividends-received deduction.  Any distribution of income that is attributable to
(i) income received by the Fund in lieu of dividends with respect to securities on loan pursuant to a securities lending transaction or (ii) dividend income received by the Fund on securities it temporarily purchased from a counterparty
pursuant to a repurchase agreement that is treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a loan by the Fund, will not constitute qualified dividend income to individual shareholders and will not be eligible for the dividends-received deduction for
corporate shareholders.  The Code generally imposes a 3.8% Medicare contribution tax on the net investment income of certain individuals,
trusts and estates to the extent their income exceeds certain threshold amounts. For these purposes, “net investment income” generally includes, among other things, (i) distributions paid by the Fund of net investment income and
capital gains as described above, and (ii) any net gain from the sale, redemption or exchange of Fund shares. Shareholders are advised to consult their tax advisors regarding the possible implications of this additional tax on their investment
in the Fund.  Dividends and distributions on shares of the Fund are generally subject to U.S. federal income tax as described herein to
the extent they do not exceed the Fund’s realized income and gains (“current and accumulated earnings 
  43




and profits”), even though such dividends and distributions may economically represent a return of a particular shareholder’s investment. Such distributions are likely to occur in
respect of shares purchased at a time when the net asset value of the Fund reflects either unrealized gains, or realized undistributed income or gains, that were therefore included in the price the shareholder paid. The Fund may be required to
distribute realized income or gains regardless of whether the Fund’s net asset value also reflects unrealized losses. Such distributions may reduce the fair market value of the Fund’s shares below the shareholder’s cost basis in those
shares.  Sale, Exchange or Redemption of Shares 
The repurchase, sale or exchange of Fund shares may give rise to a gain or loss. In general, any gain or loss realized upon a taxable
disposition of shares will be treated as long-term capital gain or loss if the shareholder has held the shares for more than 12 months. Otherwise the gain or loss will generally be treated as short-term capital gain or loss. However, any loss
realized upon a taxable disposition of shares held for six months or less will be treated as long-term, rather than short-term, to the extent of any Capital Gain Dividends received (or deemed received) by the shareholder with respect to the shares.
All or a portion of any loss realized upon a taxable disposition of shares will be disallowed under the Code’s “wash sale” rule if other substantially identical shares of the Fund are purchased within 30 days before or after the
disposition. In such a case, the basis of the newly purchased shares will be adjusted to reflect the disallowed loss.  Shareholders who
tender all of the shares they hold or are deemed to hold in response to a Periodic Repurchase Offer (as defined in the Prospectus) generally will be treated as having sold their shares and generally will recognize a capital gain or loss, as
described in the preceding paragraph. However, if a shareholder tenders fewer than all of the shares it holds or is deemed to hold, such shareholder may be treated as having received a distribution under Section 301 of the Code (“Section
301 distribution”) unless the redemption is treated as being either (i) “substantially disproportionate” with respect to such shareholder or (ii) otherwise “not essentially equivalent to a dividend” under the
relevant rules of the Code. A Section 301 distribution is not treated as a sale or exchange giving rise to capital gain or loss, but rather is treated as a dividend to the extent supported by the Fund’s current and accumulated earnings and
profits, with the excess treated as a return of capital reducing the shareholder’s tax basis in its Fund shares, and thereafter as capital gain. Where a redeeming shareholder is treated as receiving a dividend, there is a risk that other
shareholders of the Fund whose percentage interests in the Fund increase as a result of such redemption will be treated as having received a taxable distribution from the Fund. 
The Fund’s use of cash to repurchase shares could adversely affect its ability to satisfy the distribution requirements for treatment as
a RIC. The Fund could also recognize income in connection with its liquidation of portfolio securities to fund share repurchases. Any such income would be taken into account in determining whether the distribution requirements are satisfied. 
Options, Futures, Forward Contracts, Swap Agreements, Hedges, Straddles and Other Transactions 
Due to the Fund’s options strategies, a substantial portion of the Fund’s income potentially will consist of short-term capital
gains, taxable to shareholders as ordinary income when distributed to them; such income will not constitute qualified dividend income or qualify for the dividends-received deduction. 
In general, option premiums received by the Fund are not immediately included in the income of the Fund. Instead, the premiums are recognized
(i) when the option contract expires, (ii) the option is exercised by the holder, or (iii) the Fund transfers or otherwise terminates the option (e.g., through a closing transaction). If a call option written by the Fund is
exercised and the Fund sells or delivers the underlying security, the Fund generally will recognize capital gain or loss equal to (a) the sum of the strike price and the option premium received by the Fund minus (b) the Fund’s basis
in the security. Such gain or loss generally will be short-term or long-term depending upon the holding period of the underlying security. If securities are purchased by the Fund pursuant to the exercise of a put option written by it, the Fund
generally will subtract the premium received for purposes of 
  44




computing its cost basis in the securities purchased. In either case, provided the tax treatment of an option transaction is not governed by Section 1256 of the Code (discussed further
below), the gain or loss that may arise in respect of a termination of the Fund’s obligation under the option other than through the exercise of the option will be short-term gain or loss, depending on whether the premium income received by the
Fund is greater or less than the amount paid by the Fund (if any) in terminating the transaction. Thus, for example, if an option written by the Fund expires unexercised, the Fund generally will recognize short-term gain equal to the premium
received.  Certain covered call writing activities of the Fund may trigger the U.S. federal income tax straddle rules contained primarily
in Section 1092 of the Code. Very generally, where applicable, Section 1092 requires (i) that losses be deferred on positions deemed to be offsetting positions with respect to “substantially similar or related property,” to
the extent of unrealized gain in the latter, and (ii) that the holding period of such a straddle position that has not already been held for the long-term holding period be terminated and begin anew once the position is no longer part of a
straddle. Options on single stocks that are not “deep in the money” may constitute qualified covered calls, which generally are not subject to the straddle rules; the holding period on stock underlying qualified covered calls that are
“in the money” although not “deep in the money” will be suspended during the period that such calls are outstanding. Thus, the straddle rules and the rules governing qualified covered calls could cause gains that would otherwise
constitute long-term capital gains to be treated as short-term capital gains, and distributions that would otherwise constitute “qualified dividend income” or qualify for the dividends-received deduction to fail to satisfy the holding
period requirements and therefore to be taxed as ordinary income or fail to qualify for the 70% dividends-received deduction, as the case may be. 
The tax treatment of certain positions entered into by the Fund, including regulated futures contracts, certain foreign currency positions and
certain listed non-equity options, will be governed by section 1256 of the Code (“Section 1256 Contracts”). Gains or losses on Section 1256 Contracts generally are considered 60% long-term and 40% short-term capital gains or losses
(“60/40”), although certain foreign currency gains and losses from such contracts may be treated as ordinary in character. Also, Section 1256 Contracts held by the Fund at the end of each taxable year (and, for purposes of the 4%
excise tax, on certain other dates as prescribed under the Code) are “marked to market” with the result that unrealized gains or losses are treated as though they were realized and the resulting gain or loss is treated as ordinary or 60/40
gain or loss, as applicable.  In addition to the special rules described above in respect of futures and options transactions, the
Fund’s transactions in other derivative instruments (e.g., forward contracts and swap agreements) as well as any of its other hedging, short sale, securities loan or similar transactions, may be subject to one or more special tax rules
(e.g., mark-to-market, notional principal contract, straddle, constructive sale, wash sale and short sale rules). These rules may affect whether gains and losses recognized by the Fund are treated as ordinary or capital or as short-term or
long-term, accelerate the recognition of income or gains to the Fund, defer losses to the Fund, and cause adjustments in the holding periods of the Fund’s securities. These rules could therefore affect the amount, timing and/or character of
distributions to shareholders. Because these and other tax rules applicable to these types of transactions are in some cases uncertain under current law, an adverse determination or future guidance by the IRS with respect to these rules may affect
whether the Fund has made sufficient distributions, and otherwise satisfied the relevant requirements, to maintain its qualification as a regulated investment company and avoid a Fund-level tax. 
The Fund’s use of commodity-linked derivatives can be limited by the Fund’s intention to qualify as a regulated investment company,
and can bear on the Fund’s ability to so qualify. Income and gains from certain commodity-linked derivatives does not constitute qualifying income to a regulated investment company for purposes of the 90% gross income test described above. The
tax treatment of certain other commodity-linked instruments in which the Fund might invest, including (“ETNs”) and certain structured notes, is not certain, in particular with respect to whether income or gains from such instruments
constitute qualifying income to a RIC. If the Fund were to treat income or gain from a particular instrument as qualifying income and the income or gain were later determined not to constitute qualifying income and, together with any other
nonqualifying income, 
  45




caused the Fund’s nonqualifying income to exceed 10% of its gross income in any taxable year, the Fund would fail to qualify as a regulated investment company unless it is eligible to and
does pay a tax at the Fund level.  Certain of the Fund’s investments in derivative instruments and foreign currency-denominated
instruments, and any of the Fund’s transactions in foreign currencies and hedging activities, are likely to produce a difference between the Fund’s book income and the sum of its taxable income and net tax-exempt income (if any). If the
Fund’s book income is less than the sum of its taxable income and net tax-exempt income (if any), the Fund could be required to make distributions exceeding book income to qualify as a regulated investment company that is accorded special tax
treatment and to avoid a Fund-level tax. If, in the alternative, the Fund’s book income exceeds the sum of its taxable income (including realized capital gains) and net tax-exempt income (if any), the distribution (if any) of such excess will
be treated as (i) a dividend to the extent of the Fund’s remaining earnings and profits (including earnings and profits arising from tax-exempt income), (ii) thereafter, as a return of capital to the extent of the recipient’s
basis in its shares, and (iii) thereafter, as gain from the sale or exchange of a capital asset.  Foreign Currency Transactions 
The Fund’s transactions in foreign currencies, foreign currency-denominated debt obligations and certain foreign currency options, futures
contracts and forward contracts (and similar instruments) may give rise to ordinary income or loss to the extent such income or loss results from fluctuations in the value of the foreign currency concerned. Any such net gains could require a larger
dividend toward the end of the calendar year. Any such net losses will generally reduce and potentially require the recharacterization of prior ordinary income distributions. Such ordinary income treatment may accelerate Fund distributions to
shareholders and increase the distributions taxed to shareholders as ordinary income. Any net ordinary losses so created cannot be carried forward by the Fund to offset income or gains earned in subsequent taxable years. 
Taxation of the Subsidiaries  It is
currently expected that any wholly-owned Subsidiary will be a disregarded entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In the case of a Subsidiary that is a disregarded entity for such purposes (i) the Fund is treated as owning the
Subsidiary’s assets directly; (ii) any income, gain, loss, deduction or other tax items arising in respect of the Subsidiary’s assets will be treated as if they are realized or incurred, as applicable, directly by the Fund; and
(iii) any distributions the Fund receives from the Subsidiary will have no effect on the Fund’s U.S. federal income tax liability.  Passive
Foreign Investment Companies  A passive foreign investment company (“PFIC”) is any foreign corporation: (i) 75% or more
of the gross income of which for the taxable year is passive income, or (ii) the average percentage of the assets of which (generally by value, but by adjusted tax basis in certain cases) that produce or are held for the production of passive
income is at least 50%. Generally, passive income for this purpose means dividends, interest (including income equivalent to interest), royalties, rents, annuities, the excess of gains over losses from certain property transactions and commodities
transactions, and foreign currency gains. Passive income for this purpose does not include rents and royalties received by the foreign corporation from active business and certain income received from related persons. 
Equity investments by the Fund in certain PFICs could potentially subject the Fund to a U.S. federal income tax or other charge (including
interest charges) on the distributions received from the PFIC or on proceeds received from the disposition of shares in the PFIC. This tax cannot be eliminated by making distributions to Fund shareholders. However, the Fund may elect to avoid the
imposition of that tax. For example, if the Fund is in a position to and elects to treat a PFIC as a “qualified electing fund” (i.e., make a “QEF election”), the Fund will be required to include its share of the
PFIC’s income and net capital gains annually, regardless of whether it 
  46




receives any distribution from the PFIC. Alternatively, the Fund may make an election to mark the gains (and to a limited extent losses) in such holdings “to the market” as though it
had sold and repurchased its holdings in those PFICs on the last day of the Fund’s taxable year. Such gains and losses are treated as ordinary income and loss. The QEF and mark-to-market elections may accelerate the recognition of income
(without the receipt of cash) and increase the amount required to be distributed by the Fund to avoid taxation. Making either of these elections therefore may require the Fund to liquidate other investments (including when it is not advantageous to
do so) to meet its distribution requirement, which also may accelerate the recognition of gain and affect the Fund’s total return. Dividends paid by PFICs will not be eligible to be treated as “qualified dividend income.” 
It is not always possible to identify a foreign corporation as a PFIC, and the Fund may therefore incur the tax and interest charges described
above in some instances.
 Foreign Taxation 
Income and proceeds received by the Fund from sources within foreign countries may be subject to withholding and other taxes imposed by such
countries. Tax treaties between certain countries and the U.S. may reduce or eliminate such taxes.
 If more than 50% of the Fund’s
assets at the close of the taxable year consist of the securities of foreign corporations, the Fund may elect to permit shareholders to claim a credit or deduction on their income tax returns for their pro rata portions of qualified taxes paid by
the Fund to foreign countries in respect of foreign securities that the Fund has held for at least the minimum period specified in the Code. For this purpose, “securities of foreign corporations” generally includes securities of foreign
governments. In such cases, shareholders will include in gross income from foreign sources their pro rata shares of such taxes paid by the Fund. A shareholder’s ability to claim an offsetting foreign tax credit or deduction in respect of such
foreign taxes is subject to certain limitations imposed by the Code, which may result in the shareholder’s not receiving a full credit or deduction (if any) for the amount of such taxes. For example, shareholders who do not itemize on their
U.S. federal income tax returns may claim a credit but not a deduction for such foreign taxes. In addition, shareholders that are not subject to U.S. federal income tax, and those who invest in the Fund through tax-advantaged accounts (including
those who invest through individual retirement accounts or other tax-advantaged retirement plans), generally will receive no benefit from any tax credit or deduction passed through by the Fund. 
Investments in Other Investment Companies 
If the Fund receives dividends from another investment company, including an ETF, that qualifies as a RIC, and the investment company reports
such dividends as qualified dividend income, then the Fund is permitted in turn to report a portion of its distributions as qualified dividend income, provided the Fund meets holding period and other requirements with respect to shares of the
investment company.
 If the Fund receives dividends from such an investment company and the investment company reports such dividends as
eligible for the dividends-received deduction, then the Fund is permitted in turn to report its distributions derived from those dividends as eligible for the dividends-received deduction as well, provided the Fund meets holding period and other
requirements with respect to shares of the investment company.
 Certain Investments in REITs and Mortgage-Related Securities 
The Fund may invest in REITs. The Fund’s investments in REIT equity securities may result in the Fund’s receipt of cash in excess of
the REIT’s earnings; if the Fund distributes such amounts, such distribution could constitute a return of capital to Fund shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Dividends received by the Fund from a REIT will not qualify for the
corporate dividends-received deduction and generally will not constitute qualified dividend income. 
  47



Short Sales 
To the extent the Fund participates in short sales by contracting for the sale of stock it does not own and later purchasing stock necessary to
close the sale, the character of the gain or loss realized on such a short sale is determined by reference to the property used to close the short sale and is thus generally short-term. Because net short-term capital gain (after reduction by any
long-term capital loss) is generally taxed at ordinary income rates, the Fund’s short sale transactions will likely increase the percentage of the Fund’s gains that are taxable to shareholders as ordinary income. 
Original Issue Discount, Pay-In-Kind Securities and Market Discount 
Some debt obligations with a fixed maturity date of more than one year from the date of issuance (and all zero-coupon debt obligations with a
fixed maturity date of more than one year from the date of issuance) will be treated as debt obligations that are issued originally at a discount. Generally, the amount of the original issue discount (“OID”) is treated as interest income
and is included in the Fund’s taxable income (and required to be distributed by the Fund) over the term of the debt obligation, even though payment of that amount is not received until a later time (i.e., upon partial or full repayment
or disposition of the debt security) or is received in kind rather than in cash. Increases in the principal amount of inflation-indexed bonds will also be treated as OID.

Some debt obligations with a fixed maturity date of more than one year from the date of issuance, that are acquired by the Fund in the
secondary market may be treated as having “market discount.” Very generally, market discount is the excess of the stated redemption price of a debt obligation (or in the case of an obligation issued with OID, its “revised issue
price”) over the purchase price of such obligation. Generally, any gain recognized on the disposition of, and any partial payment of principal on, a debt obligation having market discount is treated as ordinary income to the extent the gain, or
principal payment, does not exceed the “accrued market discount” on such debt obligation. Alternatively, the Fund may elect to accrue market discount currently, in which case the Fund will be required to include the accrued market discount
in the Fund’s income (as ordinary income) and thus distribute it over the term of the debt security, even though payment of that amount is not received until a later time, upon partial or full repayment or disposition of the debt security. The
rate at which the market discount accrues, and thus is included in the Fund’s income, will depend upon which of the permitted accrual methods the Fund elects. 
Some debt obligations with a fixed maturity date of one year or less from the date of issuance may be treated as having “acquisition
discount” (very generally, the excess of the stated redemption price over the purchase price) or OID in the case of certain types of debt obligations. Generally, the Fund will be required to include the acquisition discount, or OID, in income
(as ordinary income) over the term of the debt obligation, even though payment of that amount is not received until a later time (i.e., upon partial or full repayment or disposition of the debt security) or is received in kind rather than in
cash. The Fund may make one or more of the elections applicable to debt obligations having acquisition discount, or OID, which could affect the character and timing of recognition of income.

In addition, payment-in-kind securities will give rise to income that is required to be distributed and is taxable even though the Fund
holding the security receives no interest payment in cash on the security during the year.
 The Fund that holds the foregoing kinds of
securities may be required to pay out as an income distribution each year an amount that is greater than the total amount of cash interest the Fund actually received. Such distributions may be made from the cash assets of the Fund or if necessary,
by liquidation of portfolio securities (including when it is not advantageous to do so). The Fund may realize gains or losses from such liquidations. In the event the Fund realizes net capital gains from such transactions, its shareholders may
receive a larger capital gain distribution than they would in the absence of such transactions.

  48



Securities Purchased at a Premium 
Very generally, where the Fund purchases a bond at a price that exceeds the redemption price at maturity (i.e., a premium), the premium
is amortizable over the remaining term of the bond. In the case of a taxable bond, if the Fund makes an election applicable to all such bonds it purchases, which election is irrevocable without consent of the IRS, the Fund reduces the current
taxable income from the bond by the amortized premium and reduces its tax basis in the bond by the amount of such offset; upon the disposition or maturity of such bonds, the Fund is permitted to deduct any remaining premium allocable to a prior
period. In the case of a tax-exempt bond, tax rules require the Fund to reduce its tax basis by the amount of amortized premium.
 Higher-Risk
Securities  Investments in debt obligations that are at risk of or in default present special tax issues for the Fund. Tax rules are
not entirely clear about issues such as whether, when or to what extent the Fund should recognize market discount on a debt obligation; when the Fund may cease to accrue interest, OID or market discount; when and to what extent deductions may be
taken for bad debts or worthless securities; and how payments received on obligations in default should be allocated between principal and income. These and other related issues will be addressed by the Fund when, as and if it invests in such
securities, in order to seek to ensure that it distributes sufficient income to preserve its eligibility for treatment as a regulated investment company and does not become subject to U.S. federal income or excise tax.

Issuer Deductibility of Interest  A
portion of the interest paid or accrued on certain high yield discount obligations owned by the Fund may not be deductible to (and thus, may affect the cash flow of) the issuer. If a portion of the interest paid or accrued on certain high yield
discount obligations is not deductible, that portion will be treated as a dividend for purposes of the corporate dividends received deduction. In such cases, if the issuer of the high yield discount obligations is a domestic corporation, dividend
payments by the Fund may be eligible for the dividends-received deduction to the extent of the deemed dividend portion of such accrued interest. Interest paid on debt obligations owned by the Fund, if any, that are considered for U.S. tax purposes
to be payable in the equity of the issuer or a related party will not be deductible to the issuer, possibly affecting the cash flow of the issuer.

Tax-Exempt Shareholders  Income of a
regulated investment company that would be UBTI if earned directly by a tax-exempt entity will not generally be attributed as UBTI to a tax-exempt shareholder of a regulated investment company. Notwithstanding this “blocking” effect, a
tax-exempt shareholder could recognize UBTI by virtue of its investment in the Fund if shares in the Fund constitute debt-financed property in the hands of the tax-exempt shareholder within the meaning of Code Section 514(b). 
Foreign Shareholders  In general, the
Fund’s dividends are not subject to a U.S. withholding tax when paid to a shareholder that is not a “U.S. Person within the meaning of the Code (such a shareholder, a “foreign shareholder”) to the extent properly reported by the
Fund as (1) interest-related dividends or short-term capital gains dividends, each as defined below and subject to certain conditions described below, (2) Capital Gain Dividends or (3) distributions treated as a return of capital with
respect to such foreign shareholder.  The exception to withholding for “interest-related dividends” generally applies with
respect to distributions (other than distributions to a foreign shareholder (w) that does not provide a satisfactory statement that the beneficial owner is not a U.S. person, (x) to the extent that the dividend is attributable to certain
interest on an obligation if the foreign shareholder is the issuer or is a 10% shareholder of the issuer, (y) that is within certain 
  49




foreign countries that have inadequate information exchange with the United States, or (z) to the extent the dividend is attributable to interest paid by a person that is a related person of
the foreign shareholder and the foreign shareholder is a controlled foreign corporation) from U.S.-source interest income of types similar to those not subject to U.S. federal income tax if earned directly by an individual foreign shareholder, to
the extent such distributions are properly reported as such by the Fund in a written notice to shareholders (“interest-related dividends”). The exception to withholding for “short-term capital gain dividends” generally applies
with respect to distributions (other than (a) distributions to an individual foreign shareholder who is present in the United States for a period or periods aggregating 183 days or more during the year of the distribution or
(b) distributions subject to special rules regarding the disposition of U.S. real property interests) of net short-term capital gains in excess of net long-term capital losses to the extent such distributions are properly reported by the Fund
(“short-term capital gain dividends”). The Fund is permitted to report such part of its dividends as interest-related or short-term capital gain dividends as are eligible, but is not required to do so. In the case of shares held through an
intermediary, the intermediary may withhold even if the Fund reports all or a portion of a payment as an interest-related or short-term capital gain dividend to shareholders. These exemptions from withholding will not be available to foreign
shareholders of the Fund if it does not currently report its dividends as interest-related or short-term capital gain dividends. Foreign shareholders should contact their intermediaries regarding the application of these rules to their accounts.
 Distributions by the Fund to foreign shareholders other than Capital Gain Dividends, interest-related dividends, and short-term capital
gain dividends (e.g., distributions attributable to dividends and foreign-source interest income) are generally subject to withholding of U.S. federal income tax at a rate of 30% (or lower applicable treaty rate).

Under U.S. federal tax law, a foreign shareholder generally is not subject to U.S. federal income tax on gains (and is not allowed a deduction
for losses) realized on the sale of shares of the Fund or on Capital Gain Dividends, interest-related dividends and short-term capital gain dividends unless (i) such gain or dividend is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or
business carried on by such holder within the United States, (ii) in the case of an individual holder, the holder is present in the United States for a period or periods aggregating 183 days or more during the year of the sale or the receipt of
the Capital Gain Dividend and certain other conditions are met, or (iii) the special rules relating to gain attributable to the sale or exchange of “U.S. real property interests” (“USRPIs”) apply to the foreign
shareholder’s sale of shares of the Fund or to the Capital Gain Dividend the foreign shareholder received (as described below). 
Special rules would apply if the Fund were a qualified investment entity (“QIE”) because it is either a “U.S. real property
holding corporation” (“USRPHC”) or would be a USRPHC but for the operation of certain exceptions to the definition of USRPIs described below. Very generally, a USRPHC is a domestic corporation that holds USRPIs the fair market value
of which equals or exceeds 50% of the sum of the fair market values of the corporation’s USRPIs, interests in real property located outside the United States, and other trade or business assets. USRPIs generally are defined as any interest in
U.S. real property and any interest (other than solely as a creditor) in a USRPHC or, very generally, an entity that has been a USRPHC in the last five years. A Fund that holds, directly or indirectly, significant interests in REITs may be a USRPHC.
Interests in domestically controlled QIEs, including REITs and RICs that are QIEs, not-greater-than-10% interests in publicly traded classes of stock in REITs and not-greater-than-5% interests in publicly traded classes of stock in RICs generally
are not USRPIs, but these exceptions do not apply for purposes of determining whether a Fund is a QIE.  If an interest in the Fund were a
USRPI, a greater-than-5% foreign shareholder or any foreign shareholder if shares of the Fund are not considered regularly traded on an established securities market generally would be required to file a U.S. tax return in connection with the sale
of its Fund shares, and pay related taxes due on any gain realized on the sale.
 Moreover, if the Fund were a USRPHC or, very generally,
had been one in the last five years, it would be required to withhold on amounts distributed to a greater-than-5% foreign shareholder to the extent such amounts

  50




would not be treated as a dividend, i.e., are in excess of the Fund’s current and accumulated “earnings and profits” for the applicable taxable year. Such withholding generally is
not required if the Fund is a domestically controlled QIE.  If the Fund were a QIE, under a special “look-through” rule, any
distributions by the Fund to a foreign shareholder attributable directly or indirectly to (i) distributions received by the Fund from a lower-tier RIC or REIT that the Fund is required to treat as USRPI gain in its hands and (ii) gains
realized on the disposition of USRPIs by the Fund would retain their character as gains realized from USRPIs in the hands of the Fund’s foreign shareholders and would be subject to U.S. tax withholding. In addition, such distributions could
result in the foreign shareholder being required to file a U.S. tax return and pay tax on the distributions at regular U.S. federal income tax rates. The consequences to a foreign shareholder, including the rate of such withholding and character of
such distributions (e.g., as ordinary income or USRPI gain), would vary depending upon the extent of the foreign shareholder’s current and past ownership of the Fund. 
Foreign shareholders of the Fund also may be subject to “wash sale” rules to prevent the avoidance of the tax-filing and –
payment obligations discussed above through the sale and repurchase of Fund shares.  Foreign shareholders should consult their tax
advisors and, if holding shares through intermediaries, their intermediaries, concerning the application of these rules to their investment in the Fund. Foreign shareholders with respect to whom income from the Fund is effectively connected with a
trade or business conducted by the foreign shareholder within the United States will in general be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the income derived from the Fund at the graduated rates applicable to U.S. citizens, residents or domestic
corporations, whether such income is received in cash or reinvested in shares of the Fund and, in the case of a foreign corporation, may also be subject to a branch profits tax. If a foreign shareholder is eligible for the benefits of a tax treaty,
any effectively connected income or gain will generally be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net basis only if it is also attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by the shareholder in the United States. More generally, foreign
shareholders who are residents in a country with an income tax treaty with the United States may obtain different tax results than those described herein, and are urged to consult their tax advisors.

In order to qualify for any exemptions from withholding described above or for lower withholding tax rates under income tax treaties, or to
establish an exemption from backup withholding, a foreign shareholder must comply with special certification and filing requirements relating to its non-US status (including, in general, furnishing an IRS Form W-8BEN or Form W-8BEN-E, or substitute
form). Foreign shareholders in the Fund should consult their tax advisors in this regard.
 Special rules (including withholding and
reporting requirements) apply to foreign partnerships and those holding Fund shares through foreign partnerships. Additional considerations may apply to foreign trusts and estates. Investors holding Fund shares through foreign entities should
consult their tax advisors about their particular situation. A beneficial holder of Fund shares who is a foreign shareholder may be subject to state and local tax and to the U.S. federal estate tax in addition to the federal tax on income referred
to above.
 Expenses Subject to 2% “Floor” and Special Pass-Through Rules 
The Fund will not be considered to be a “publicly offered” RIC if it does not have at least 500 shareholders at all times during a
taxable year and its Shares are not treated as continuously offered pursuant to a public offering. It is possible that the Fund will not be treated as a “publicly offered” RIC for one or more of its taxable years. Very generally, pursuant
to Treasury Department regulations, expenses of a RIC that is not “publicly offered,” except those specific to its status as a RIC or separate entity (e.g., registration fees or transfer agency fees), are subject to special
“pass-through” rules. These expenses (which include direct and certain indirect advisory fees) are treated as additional dividends to certain Fund shareholders (generally including other RICs that are not “publicly offered,”
individuals and entities that compute their taxable income in the same manner as an individual), and are 
  51




deductible by those shareholders, subject to the 2% “floor” on miscellaneous itemized deductions and other significant limitations on itemized deductions set forth in the Code. 
Backup Withholding  The Fund generally is
required to withhold and remit to the U.S. Treasury a percentage of the taxable distributions and redemption proceeds paid to any individual shareholder (i) who fails to properly furnish the Fund with a correct taxpayer identification number,
(ii) who has under-reported dividend or interest income, or (iii) who fails to certify to the Fund that he or she is not subject to such withholding. The backup withholding tax rate is 28%. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any
amounts withheld may be credited against the shareholder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, provided the appropriate information is furnished to the IRS. 
Tax Basis Information  The Fund (or its
administrative agent) must report to the IRS and furnish to the Fund shareholders the cost basis information and holding period for Fund shares. The Fund will permit Fund shareholders to elect from among several IRS-accepted cost basis methods,
including average cost. In the absence of an election, shareholder cost basis will be determined under the default method selected by the Fund. The cost basis method a shareholder elects (or the cost basis method applied by default) may not be
changed with respect to a redemption of shares after the settlement date of the redemption. Fund shareholders should consult with their tax advisors to determine the best IRS-accepted cost basis method for their tax situation and to obtain more
information about how the new cost basis reporting rules apply to them.
 Tax Shelter Reporting Regulations 
Under U.S. Treasury regulations, if a shareholder recognizes a loss with respect to the Fund’s shares of $2 million or more for an
individual shareholder or $10 million or more for a corporate shareholder, the shareholder must file with the IRS a disclosure statement on Form 8886. Direct shareholders of portfolio securities are in many cases excepted from this reporting
requirement, but under current guidance, shareholders of a regulated investment company are not excepted. Future guidance may extend the current exception from this reporting requirement to shareholders of most or all regulated investment companies.
The fact that a loss is reportable under these regulations does not affect the legal determination of whether the taxpayer’s treatment of the loss is proper. Shareholders should consult their tax advisors to determine the applicability of these
regulations in light of their individual circumstances.  Shareholder Reporting Obligations with Respect to Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts 
Shareholders that are U.S. persons and own, directly or indirectly, more than 50% of the Fund by vote or value could be required to report
annually their “financial interest” in the Fund’s “foreign financial accounts,” if any, on FinCEN Form 114, Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts. Shareholders should consult a tax advisor, and persons investing in
the Fund through an intermediary should contact their intermediary, regarding the applicability to them of this reporting requirement.  Other Reporting
and Withholding Requirements  Sections 1471-1474 of the Code and the U.S. Treasury Regulations and IRS guidance issued thereunder
(collectively, “FATCA”) generally require the Fund to obtain information sufficient to identify the status of each of its shareholders under FATCA or under an applicable intergovernmental agreement (an “IGA”). If a shareholder
fails to provide this information or otherwise fails to comply with FATCA or an IGA, the Fund may be required to withhold under FATCA 30% of the distributions, other than distributions properly reported as Capital Gain Dividends, the Fund pays to
shareholders and, on or after January 1, 2017 (which date, under recent Treasury guidance, is expected to be delayed until on or after January 1, 2019), 30% of the gross proceeds of 
  52




share redemptions or exchanges and certain Capital Gain Dividends it pays. If a payment by the Fund is subject to FATCA withholding, the Fund or its agent is required to withhold even if such
payment would otherwise be exempt from withholding under the rules applicable to foreign shareholders described above (e.g., Capital Gain Dividends).

Each prospective investor is urged to consult its tax advisor regarding the applicability of FATCA and any other reporting requirements with
respect to the prospective investor’s own situation, including investments through an intermediary. In addition, foreign countries are considering, and may implement, laws similar in purpose and scope to FATCA, as more fully described above.
 Shares Purchased through Tax-Qualified Plans 
Special tax rules apply to investments through defined contribution plans and other tax-qualified plans. Shareholders should consult their tax
advisors to determine the suitability of shares of the Fund as an investment through such plans, and the precise effect of an investment on their particular tax situation.

DESCRIPTION OF THE TRUST 
The Trustees are responsible for the management and supervision of the Trust. The Declaration of Trust permits the Trustees to issue an
unlimited number of full and fractional shares of beneficial interest of the Fund or other series of the Trust with or without par value. Under the Declaration of Trust, the Trustees have the authority to create and classify shares of beneficial
interest in separate series and classes without further action by shareholders. As of the date of this SAI, the Fund is the only series of the Trust. To the extent permissible by law, additional series may be added in the future.

The shares of the Fund represent an equal proportionate interest in the net assets attributable to such shares of the Fund. Shareholders have
certain exclusive voting rights on matters relating to their respective distribution plan, if any. Different classes of the Fund, if any, may bear different expenses relating to the cost of holding shareholder meetings necessitated by the exclusive
voting rights of any class of shares.
 Unless otherwise required by the 1940 Act or the Declaration of Trust, the Trust has no intention
of holding annual meetings of shareholders. Trust shareholders may remove a Trustee by the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the Trust’s outstanding shares and the Trustees shall promptly call a meeting for such purpose when requested
to do so in writing by the record holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Trust. Shareholders may, under certain circumstances, communicate with other shareholders in connection with requesting a special meeting of shareholders.
However, at any time that less than a majority of the Trustees holding office were elected by the shareholders, the Trustees will call a special meeting of shareholders for the purpose of electing Trustees. 
In the event of liquidation, shareholders of each Class are entitled to share pro rata in the net assets of the applicable Fund available for
distribution to these shareholders. Shares entitle their holders to one vote per share (and fractional votes for fractional shares), are freely transferable and have no preemptive, subscription or conversion rights. When issued, shares are fully
paid and non-assessable.
 The Declaration of Trust disclaims shareholder liability for acts or obligations of the Trust. The Declaration
of Trust further provides for indemnification out of the Fund’s property for all loss and expense of any shareholder held personally liable for the obligations of the Fund by reason of owning shares of the Fund. Thus, the risk of a shareholder
incurring financial loss on account of shareholder liability is considered remote since it is limited to circumstances in which the disclaimer is inoperative and the Fund itself would be unable to meet its obligations. 
The Declaration of Trust further provides that the Board will not be liable for errors of judgment or mistakes of fact or law. However,
nothing in the Declaration of Trust protects a Trustee against any liability to which the

  53




Trustee would otherwise be subject by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of his or her office. The Declaration
of Trust of the Trust provides for indemnification by the Trust of Trustees and officers of the Trust; however, such persons may not be indemnified against any liability to the Trust or the Trust’s shareholders to whom he or she would otherwise
be subject by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of his or her office. 
The Fund reserves the right to reject any purchase order application that conflicts with the Fund’s internal policies or the policies of
any regulatory authority. The Fund does not accept starter, credit card or third party checks. All checks returned by the post office as undeliverable will be reinvested at NAV in the Fund from which a redemption was made or dividend paid.
Information provided on the account application may be used by the Fund to verify the accuracy of the information or for background or financial history purposes. A joint account will be administered as a joint tenancy with right of survivorship,
unless the joint owners notify the transfer agent of a different intent. A shareholder’s account is governed by the laws of the State of Delaware. For telephone transactions, the transfer agent will take measures to verify the identity of the
caller, such as asking for name, account number, Social Security or other taxpayer ID number and other relevant information. If appropriate measures are taken, the transfer agent is not responsible for any loss that may occur to any account due to
an unauthorized telephone call. Also for your protection telephone redemptions are not permitted on accounts whose names or addresses have changed within the past 30 days. Proceeds from telephone transactions can only be mailed to the address of
record.  OTHER INFORMATION 
Miscellaneous  The
Prospectus and this SAI do not contain all the information included in the Registration Statement filed with the SEC under the 1933 Act with respect to the securities offered by the Prospectus. Certain portions of the Registration Statement have
been omitted from the Prospectus and this SAI pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC. The Registration Statement including the exhibits filed therewith may be examined at the office of the SEC in Washington, D.C.

Statements contained in the Prospectuses or in this SAI as to the contents of any contract or other document referred to are not necessarily
complete, and, in each instance, reference is made to the copy of such contract or other document filed as an exhibit to the Registration Statement of which the Prospectuses and this SAI form a part, each such statement being qualified in all
respects by such reference.
 In the interest of economy and convenience, the Fund does not issue certificates representing the Fund’s
shares. Instead, the Transfer Agent maintains a record of each shareholder’s ownership. Each shareholder receives confirmation of purchase and repurchase orders from the Transfer Agent. Fund shares and any dividends and distributions paid by
the Fund are reflected in account statements from the Transfer Agent.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Trustees and Shareholders of Stone Ridge Trust V

We have audited the accompanying consolidated statement of assets and liabilities of Stone Ridge Alternative Lending Risk Premium Fund (the
portfolio constituting Stone Ridge Trust V (the Trust)), as of March 9, 2016 and the related consolidated statement of operations for the period from November 4, 2015 (Organization of Trust) to March 9, 2016. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Trust’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. 
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. We were not engaged to perform an audit of the Trust’s internal control over financial
reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of
the Trust’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of
Stone Ridge Alternative Lending Risk Premium Fund (the portfolio constituting Stone Ridge Trust V) at March 9, 2016 and the consolidated results of its operations for the period from November 4, 2015 (Organization of Trust) to March 9, 2016, in
conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

Stone Ridge Trust V

Stone Ridge Alternative Lending Risk Premium Fund
 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 March 9, 2016   


1.
 Organization 
Stone Ridge Trust V (the “Trust”) was organized as a Delaware statutory trust on November 4, 2015, and is
registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “1940 Act”), as amended, as a continuously-offered closed-end management investment company issuing shares. The Trust’s sole series is the Stone Ridge Alternative Lending Risk
Premium Fund (the “Fund”). The Fund is non-diversified for the purposes of the 1940 Act.  As of March 9,
2016, the Trust has had no operations other than those actions relating to organizational and registration matters, including the sale and issuance to Stone Ridge Asset Management LLC (the “Adviser”) of 10,000 shares of the Fund at an
aggregate purchase amount of $100,000. The proceeds of the 10,000 shares were held in cash. There are an unlimited number of authorized shares. The investment objective of the Fund is to achieve total return and current income. The Fund will pursue
its investment objective primarily by investing in alternative lending-related securities that generate interest or other streams of payments and that the Adviser believes offer access to the credit risk premium. The “credit risk premium”
is positive if interest payments paid in connection with a pool of such investments, minus the principal losses actually experienced across that pool, exceed the risk free rate, on average and over time. 
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Stone Ridge Alternative Lending Luxembourg Holdings S.a r.l.
(the “Subsidiary”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Fund. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The Adviser has committed to providing capital of $20,000 to fund the Subsidiary. 
 


2.
 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
The following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently followed by the Fund in the preparation of its
consolidated financial statements. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). 
(a) Use of Estimates

The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

(b) Indemnifications

In the normal course of business the Fund enters into contracts that contain a variety of representations which provide general
indemnifications. The Fund’s maximum exposure under these arrangements cannot be known; however, the Fund expects any risk of loss to be remote. 
(c) Federal Income Taxes

The Fund intends to qualify for treatment as a “regulated investment company’ under Subchapter M of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. If so qualified, the Fund will not be subject to federal income tax to the extent it distributes substantially all of its net investment income and capital gains to shareholders. Therefore, no federal income tax
provision is required.

3.
 Agreements   


 
(a)
 Investment Advisory Agreement

Stone Ridge Asset Management LLC (“Stone Ridge” or the “Adviser”) is the investment adviser of the Fund.
The Adviser was organized as a Delaware limited liability company in 2012. Its primary place of business is at 510 Madison Avenue, 21st Floor, New York, NY 10022. The Adviser’s primary business is to provide a variety of investment management
services, including an investment program for the Fund. The Adviser is responsible for all business activities and oversight of the investment decisions made for its Funds. 
Upon commencement of operations and in return for providing management services to the Fund, the Fund will pay the adviser an
annual fee of 1.50% of the Fund’s average daily net assets.  Through the one-year anniversary of the date the Fund
commences investment operations, the Adviser has agreed to pay or otherwise bear operating and other expenses of the Fund (including organizational and offering expenses, but excluding brokerage and transactional expenses, borrowing and other
investment-related costs and fees including interest payments on borrowed funds, loan servicing fees, loan collection and administration fees and expenses, interest and commitment fees, short dividend expense, acquired fund fees and expenses, taxes,
litigation and indemnification expenses, judgments and extraordinary expenses not incurred in the ordinary course of the Fund’s business) solely to the extent necessary to limit the total annualized expenses of the Fund to 2.00% of the average
daily net assets of the Fund. The Adviser shall be permitted to recoup in later periods Fund expenses that the Adviser has paid or otherwise borne (whether through reduction of its management fee or otherwise) to the extent that the expenses
for the Fund fall below the annual limitation rate in effect at the time of the actual waiver/reimbursement and to the extent that they do not cause the Fund to exceed the annual rate in effect at the time of the recoupment. Under the expense
limitation agreement, the Fund is not obligated to reimburse such expenses beyond three years from the end of the fiscal year in which the Adviser waived a fee or reimbursed an expense. 
(b) Distributor

Quasar Distributors, LLC (the “Distributor”) serves as the Fund’s Distributor. Its principal business address is
615 East Michigan Street, Milwaukee, WI, 53202. The Distributor is an affiliate of U.S. Bank, N.A.  (c) Administrator,
Custodian and Transfer Agent
 The custodians to the Trust are U.S. Bank, N.A., located at 1555 N RiverCenter Drive, Suite
302, Milwaukee, WI 53212, and Millennium Trust Company, located at 2001 Spring Road, Suite 700, Oak Brook, IL 60523. The administrator and transfer agent to the Trust is U.S. Bancorp Fund Services, LLC, an affiliate of US. Bank, N.A., located at 615
East Michigan Street, Milwaukee, WI 53202.
  


4.
 Organization and Offering Costs 
Organization costs consist of costs incurred to establish the Fund and enable it legally to do business. Certain organization
costs were paid by the Adviser, subject to potential recoupment, and are estimated to be $547,777. The remaining organization costs are estimated to be $882,754 and may also be subject to recoupment. Total organization costs are estimated to be
approximately $1,430,531. Offering costs include state registration fees and legal fees regarding the preparation of the initial registration statement. Organization costs are expensed as incurred. Offering costs are accounted for as deferred costs
until operations begin. Offering costs are then amortized to expense over twelve months on a straight-line basis. Certain offering costs were paid by the Adviser, subject to recovery, and are estimated to be $442,554. The remaining offering costs
will be paid by the Fund, and are estimated to be $223,827. The total amount of the offering costs incurred by the Fund is estimated to be approximately $666,381.

  6





5.
 Capital Shares 
The Fund will be continuously offering an unlimited number of shares through the Distributor. Shares are offered in a
continuous offering at the Fund’s current NAV per share.  The Fund is a closed-end “interval” fund and will
make periodic offers to repurchase shares. Except as permitted by the Fund’s structure, no shareholder will have the right to require the Fund to repurchase its shares. No public market for shares exists, and none is expected to develop in the
future. Consequently, shareholders generally will not be able to liquidate their investment other than as a result of repurchases of their shares by the Fund. 
The Fund will make quarterly offers to repurchase between 5% and 25% of its outstanding shares at NAV in the months of
February, May, August and November. The Fund, subject to applicable law, will conduct quarterly repurchase offers typically for 5% of the Fund’s outstanding shares at NAV subject to approval of the Board of Trustees. 
 


6.
 Related Parties 
At March 9, 2016, the officers of the Trust were also employees of the Adviser.

APPENDIX A 
SECURITIES RATINGS  The
rating of a rating service represents the service’s opinion as to the credit quality of the security being rated. However, the ratings are general and are not absolute standards of quality or guarantees as to the creditworthiness of an issuer.
Consequently, the Adviser believes that the quality of debt securities in which the Fund invests should be continuously reviewed. A rating is not a recommendation to purchase, sell or hold a security, because it does not take into account market
value or suitability for a particular investor. When a security has received a rating from more than one service, each rating should be evaluated independently. Ratings are based on current information furnished by the issuer or obtained by the
ratings services from other sources, which they consider reliable. Ratings may be changed, suspended or withdrawn as a result of changes in or unavailability of such information, or for other reasons. 
The following is a description of the characteristics of ratings used by Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s. 
Moody’s Ratings* 
Aaa—Obligations rated Aaa are judged to be of the highest quality, subject to the lowest level of credit risk.

Aa—Obligations rated Aa are judged to be of high quality and are subject to very low credit risk.

A—Obligations rated A are judged to be upper-medium grade and are subject to low credit risk.

Baa—Obligations rated Baa are judged to be medium-grade and subject to moderate credit risk and as such may
possess certain speculative characteristics.
 Ba—Obligations rated Ba are judged to be speculative and are
subject to substantial credit risk.
 B—Obligations rated B are considered speculative and are subject to high
credit risk.
 Caa—Obligations rated Caa are judged to be speculative of poor standing and are subject to very
high credit risk.
 Ca—Obligations rated Ca are highly speculative and are likely in, or very near, default,
with some prospect of recovery of principal and interest.
 C—Obligations rated C are the lowest rated and are
typically in default, with little prospect for recovery of principal or interest.
 *Moody’s appends numerical
modifiers 1, 2, and 3 to each generic rating classification from Aa through Caa. The modifier 1 indicates that the obligation ranks in the higher end of its generic rating category; the modifier 2 indicates a mid-range ranking; and the modifier 3
indicates a ranking in the lower end of that generic rating category.  Standard & Poor’s Ratings* 
AAA—An obligation rated ‘AAA’ has the highest rating assigned by Standard & Poor’s. The
obligor’s capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation is extremely strong.  AA—An
obligation rated ‘AA’ differs from the highest-rated obligations only to a small degree. The obligor’s capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation is very strong. 
  A-1



A—An obligation rated ‘A’ is somewhat more susceptible to
the adverse effects of changes in circumstances and economic conditions than obligations in higher-rated categories. However, the obligor’s capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation is still strong. 
BBB—An obligation rated ‘BBB’ exhibits adequate protection parameters. However, adverse economic
conditions or changing circumstances are more likely to lead to a weakened capacity of the obligor to meet its financial commitment on the obligation. 
BB; B; CCC; CC; and C—Obligations rated ‘BB’, ‘B’, ‘CCC’, ‘CC’, and
‘C’ are regarded as having significant speculative characteristics. ‘BB’ indicates the least degree of speculation and ‘C’ the highest. While such obligations will likely have some quality and protective
characteristics, these may be outweighed by large uncertainties or major exposures to adverse conditions. 
BB—An obligation rated ‘BB’ is less vulnerable to nonpayment than other speculative issues. However, it
faces major ongoing uncertainties or exposure to adverse business, financial, or economic conditions which could lead to the obligor’s inadequate capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation. 
B—An obligation rated ‘B’ is more vulnerable to nonpayment than obligations rated ‘BB’, but
the obligor currently has the capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation. Adverse business, financial, or economic conditions will likely impair the obligor’s capacity or willingness to meet its financial commitment on the
obligation.  CCC—An obligation rated ‘CCC’ is currently vulnerable to nonpayment, and is dependent
upon favorable business, financial, and economic conditions for the obligor to meet its financial commitment on the obligation. In the event of adverse business, financial, or economic conditions, the obligor is not likely to have the capacity to
meet its financial commitment on the obligation.  CC—An obligation rated ‘CC’ is currently highly
vulnerable to nonpayment. The ‘CC’ rating is used when a default has not yet occurred, but Standard & Poor’s expects default to be a virtual certainty, regardless of the anticipated time to default. 
C—An obligation rated ‘C’ is currently highly vulnerable to nonpayment, and the obligation is expected
to have lower relative seniority or lower ultimate recovery compared to obligations that are rated higher. 
D—An obligation rated ‘D’ is in default or in breach of an imputed promise. For non-hybrid capital
instruments, the ‘D’ rating category is used when payments on an obligation are not made on the date due, unless Standard & Poor’s believes that such payments will be made within five business days in the absence of a stated
grace period or within the earlier of the stated grace period or 30 calendar days. The ‘D’ rating also will be used upon the filing of a bankruptcy petition or the taking of similar action and where default on an obligation is a virtual
certainty, for example due to automatic stay provisions. An obligation’s rating is lowered to ‘D’ if it is subject to a distressed exchange offer. 
NR—This indicates that no rating has been requested, or that there is insufficient information on which to base a
rating, or that Standard & Poor’s does not rate a particular obligation as a matter of policy.  *The ratings from
‘AA’ to ‘CCC’ may be modified by the addition of a plus (+) or minus (-) sign to show relative standing within the major rating categories.

APPENDIX B 
STONE RIDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT LLC 
PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES   


I.
 Governing Standards 
Stone Ridge Asset Management LLC (the “Adviser”) has adopted written proxy voting policies and guidelines (“the
Proxy Policy”) as required under Rule 206(4)-6 (the “Rule”) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (“Advisers Act”). In addition to covering the voting of equity securities, the Proxy Policy also applies generally to voting
and/or consent rights of fixed income securities, including but not limited to, plans of reorganization, waivers and consents under applicable indentures. The Proxy Policy, which has been designed to ensure that Adviser votes proxies in the best
interest of its clients and provides clients with information about how their proxies are voted, contains procedures to mitigate conflicts of interests between clients and Adviser and its advisory affiliates1 when voting proxies.
  


II.
 Policy 
The Proxy Policy applies to those client accounts that contain voting securities and for which Adviser has been delegated the
authority to vote client proxies. When voting proxies for client accounts, Adviser’s primary objective is to make voting decisions solely in the best interest on behalf of all clients for which it manages assets. The Adviser has selected an
unaffiliated third party proxy research and voting service, Institutional Shareholder Services Inc. (“ISS” or “Proxy Voting Service”) to assist it in researching, recordkeeping and voting of proxies. With respect to each proxy
received, the Proxy Voting Service researches the financial implications of the proposals and provides a recommendation to Adviser as to how to vote on each proposal based on the Proxy Voting Service’s research of the individual facts and
circumstances and the Proxy Voting Service’s application of its research findings to a set of guidelines, ISS’ U.S. Proxy Voting Summary Guidelines. These guidelines have been approved by Adviser, and though Adviser intends to vote
consistent with the voting recommendation of the Proxy Voting Service, upon the recommendation of the applicable portfolio managers, Adviser may determine to override any recommendation made by the Proxy Voting Service or abstain from voting. In the
event that the Proxy Voting Service does not provide a recommendation with respect to a proposal, Adviser may determine to vote on the proposals directly. 
With respect to the voting of proxies relating to fixed income securities or other debt instruments, the Proxy Policy does not
apply, however, to consent rights that primarily entail decisions to buy or sell investments, such as tender or exchange offers, conversions, put options, redemption and Dutch auctions. The Proxy Policy is designed and implemented in a manner
reasonably expected to ensure that voting and consent rights are exercised in the best interests of the Funds and their shareholders.

Adviser may determine not to vote a proxy for a debt or equity security if: (1) the effect on the applicable economic
interests or the value of the portfolio holding is insignificant in relation to an individual’s account portfolio or in the aggregate with all clients; (2) the cost of voting the proxy outweighs the possible benefit to the applicable
account, including, without limitation, situations where a jurisdiction imposes share blocking restrictions which may affect the ability of the portfolio managers to effect trades in the related security; or (3) Adviser otherwise has determined
that it is consistent with its fiduciary obligations not to vote the proxy.  In addition, neither Adviser nor the Proxy
Voting Service will be able to vote for any securities on loan by an account. In the event that Adviser is aware of a material vote on behalf of the mutual fund and Adviser has the ability to call back loans and is aware of the securities on loan by
the custodian, Adviser may call back the loan and vote the proxy if time permits.
  


1 
 A firm’s advisory affiliates are defined in this Policy to include: 1) all officers, partners, directors
(or any person performing similar functions); 2) all persons directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by the adviser; and 3) all current employees. 
  B-1



Adviser will not accept direction on how to vote individual proxies for which it
has voting responsibility from any other person or organization other than the research and information provided by its independent Proxy Voting Service, subject to specific provisions in a client’s account documentation related to exception
voting. In fulfilling its obligations to clients, Adviser will act in a manner deemed to be prudent and diligent and which is intended to enhance the economic value of the underlying securities held in client accounts. 
 


III.
 Conflicts of Interest Procedures 
For voting of securities, Adviser believes that application of the guidelines to vote proxies should, in most cases, adequately
address any possible conflicts of interest since the guidelines are predetermined. However, the potential for conflicts of interest exists to the extent the portfolio managers have discretion to vote differently than the guidelines. As a general
practice, Adviser will vote in accordance with the voting recommendation provided by the Proxy Voting Service. In the event that Adviser wishes to vote against the independent voting recommendation, Adviser requires Chief Compliance Officer
(“CCO”) approval prior to a vote being cast.  For voting of fixed income securities, Adviser believes the
potential for material conflicts of interest to arise between the interests of the client and the interests of Adviser is limited. However, there may be a potential for a conflict of interest which Adviser or its related persons or entities may be a
named party to, or participating in a bankruptcy work-out or other similar committee with respect to the issuer. In such instances the portfolio manager must notify the CCO prior to casting any decision on behalf of clients.

Upon the identification or notice received by the CCO that there is a conflict of interest with respect to casting a vote, the
CCO will discuss the proxy with the relevant portfolio manager(s) and other senior management in order to determine if the conflict is material. In instances where a portfolio manager proposes to vote a proxy inconsistent with the Guidelines and a
potential immaterial conflict is identified, the CCO will review the proxy votes in order to determine whether a portfolio manager’s voting rationale appears reasonable. Upon the detection of a material conflict of interest, the CCO has final
decision-making authority regarding Adviser’s course of action for the proxy. The CCO’s determination will be based on maximizing value for Adviser’s Clients.   


IV.
 Voting Guidelines 
For accounts that invest in voting securities, Adviser has approved the ISS’ U.S. Proxy Voting Summary Guidelines. These
guidelines are intended to provide a general overview of ISS’ United States Policy Guidelines by highlighting the key policies that ISS applies to companies listed in the United States. However, ISS’ analysis is on a case-by-case basis,
taking into consideration sector, industry and business performance factors.  For a list of the voting guidelines please
visit:
 http://www.issgovernance.com/policy/2013/policy_information

 


V.
 Amendment 
Adviser may, from time to time, amend this Policy, and/or adopt such interpretations of this Policy as it deems appropriate
provided, however, that such changes are approved by Adviser management.
 Adviser will supervise and periodically review
its proxy voting activities and the implementation of the Proxy Policy. All reports and any other information filed with Adviser pursuant to this Policy shall be treated as confidential, except that the same may be disclosed to Adviser’s
management, any regulatory or self-regulatory authority or agency upon its request, or as required by law or court or administrative order. All records of Adviser’s proxy voting policies and voting activity are retained in accordance with Rule
204 2(C)(2) of the Advisers Act.   


VI.
 Information Available to Clients 
If you require additional information on this policy or on how proxies were voted, please contact the CCO.

Item 30.
Indemnification  The Registrant’s Agreement and Declaration of Trust, incorporated
hereto by reference, contains provisions limiting the liability, and providing for indemnification, of the Trustees, officers, employees and other “Covered Persons” (including their respective heirs, assigns, successors or other legal
representatives) to the fullest extent permitted by law, including advancement of payments of all expenses incurred in connection with the preparation and presentation of any defense (subject to repayment obligations in certain circumstances).
The Registrant’s Form of Distribution Agreement, filed herewith, contains provisions limiting the liability, and providing for
indemnification, of the Trustees and officers under certain circumstances.  Further, the Registrant’s Form of Investment Management
Agreement with Stone Ridge, filed herewith, contains provisions limiting the liability, and providing for indemnification, of Stone Ridge and its personnel under certain circumstances. 
Registrant’s Trustees and officers are expected to be insured under a standard investment company errors and omissions insurance policy
covering loss incurred by reason of negligent errors and omissions committed in their official capacities as such.  Insofar as
indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the Registrant pursuant to the provisions described in this
Item 30, or otherwise, the Registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is therefore
unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the Registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the Registrant in the successful defense of
any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the Registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling
precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue. 
 


Item 31.
Business and Other Connections of Investment Adviser  Stone Ridge is a Delaware
limited liability company that offers investment management services and is a registered investment adviser. In addition to advising the Fund, Stone Ridge is the investment adviser to each series of Stone Ridge Trust, Stone Ridge
Trust II and Stone Ridge Trust III. Stone Ridge’s offices are located at 510 Madison Avenue, 21st Floor, New York, NY 10022. Information as to the officers and directors of Stone Ridge is included in its current
Form ADV (File No. 801-77228) filed with the SEC.
