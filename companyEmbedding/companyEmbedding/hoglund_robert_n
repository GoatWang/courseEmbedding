Question: When Farmer Hoglund applies N pounds of
fertilizer...








When Farmer Hoglund applies N pounds of
fertilizer per acre, the marginal product of fertilizer is 1
-N/200 bushels of corn. If the price of corn is $4 per
bushel and the price of fertilizer is $1.20 per pound, then how
many pounds of fertilizer per acre should Farmer Hoglund use in
order to maximize his profits?
I already know the answer, I was just hoping for some
help on the steps.
