BBB Reports On









Licensing









                        Licensing information is provided in the BBB Business Profiles to inform the public about industries that may require professional licensing, bonding, or registration. Better Business Bureau encourages you to check with the appropriate agency to be certain any requirements are currently being met.
                    





Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.
                    





Government Actions









                        BBB reports on known significant government actions involving the business's marketplace conduct.
                    





Out of Business









                        BBB reports on a company that is out of business for three years from the date the company closes its doors or ceases to do business.
                    





Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo









                        BBB reports on unauthorized use of the Better Business Bureau's name and/or logo for as long as the business continues to use it in any advertising, or for one year after the business ceases any repeated unauthorized uses.
                    





Bankruptcy









                        BBB reports on a business’s bankruptcy as long as the business remains in bankruptcy.
                    





Mail Returned









                        BBB reports when mail sent to the business was returned by the Postal Service.

BBB Rating System Overview














Customer Review Rating:









                        The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business.
                        The Customer Review Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive,
                        neutral, and negative reviews posted.

Composite Score:





                        ECS Tuning, LLC has received 3.85 out of 5 stars based on 12 Customer Reviews and a BBB Rating of A+.
                        






                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.

Parts were missing with my order


                Parts were missing with my order. I contacted them 4 times and finally got ONE response and that was the only response I got and it didn't resolve anything.

Good part


                Good part, too bad it went on sale before mine arrived. Fedex is hard to track but the part got to me in a reasonable time frame.

                Easy to find the parts I needed and they were knowledgeable about shipping options. They told me the free shipping could show up when ever and since I had to have the parts for a specific date they advised me to pick a different form of shipping. I plan on buying from them again.

Great company overall


                Great company overall, offer a vast amount of parts and nearly everything you could possibly need to maintain your vehicle with OE parts. Like most I agree that their customer service needs more people that understand cars. It completely depends on who you get. I got a wrong part in one of my orders and the next day it was already sent out for delivery before I got the email that it would be taken care of. However, if you have technical issues with an order it is best to talk with a tech rep rather than a sales rep. The tech reps can and have done customer service related tasks for me and they're generally better and more understanding about the issues than the sales reps. For example. I got a strut tower bar a few weeks back and it was rubbing in my rain tray/pinch seam on backside of my engine bay.  I regretfully attempted to talk with a customer service rep about the issues I was having and they clearly had no idea what I was talking about. I asked if I could be transferred to a tech rep and was told I would need to start that interaction myself.Overall, I use ECS for nearly all my product needs and will likely continue to do so. Their engineering/R&D departments go above and beyond some of the other aftermarket suppliers.

On their way to being a great company.


                Good company, but the customer service could definitely use work. I ordered some parts from the and paid for extra shipping charges so that I could get them faster. Turns out the part was on back order, even though the website said nothing about this back order. So I ended up waiting just under a month for parts that were supposed to be at my house in about a week.I cracked and emailed customer service, assuming they would understand my frustration and offer a refund for my extra shipping charges, nope. I was told by Jacob that he could send a different part and we could work out the difference. I declined and directed the conversation towards the extra money I paid for no reason. He didn't respond. So long story short I paid for faster shipping, it took way longer than normal speed shipping because ECS failed to mention the back order, and Jacob or ECS never offered me a refund for my extra pay. I will admit they are a good company, but customer service is very important and I don't think their whole customer service department understands that. The money wasn't a big deal, but the thought counts. Offer the refunds, and if you can't then offer something else, or at least acknowledge the problem with the customer. Don't just ignore them. I would have taken a free sticker and a "We're sorry note". A pen, a .01% discount on a future item, a letter from the customer service manager. Guys, it's literally just the thought. I originally left a 4/5 for this review. However, I was immediately contacted the next day and spoke with the head of their sales department. He went on to apologize for the issue, thank me for my honest review, gave me a discount, and really took control of the situation. Though the discount wasn't a necessity, I did feel that he understood what had happened and why the review was the way it was. He took the time out of his day, twice, to email me and make my problem a thing of the past. I realize that this may all be in response to the 4/5, but at the same time, a step in the right direction for the wrong reason is still a step in the right direction. I hope they continue to do follow ups and to help everybody so that they will become the great company I'm sure they strive to be. Thank you, ECS.

Overall Great Site


                I have bought many things for all of my VW's. Most recently an intake system. I love that they have many OEM options, plus other aftermarket alternatives. It depends on the items you buy, but most products ship fast, and come with all of the parts listed, along with directions for installation. Yes there are other sites, but ECS has a unique balance of products for European cars and are just as reasonably priced as other sites.
