Includes all share classes available for the fund
For performance reporting purposes, the inception date for Classes A, R, R6, Z, and Advisor Class shares of all Franklin Templeton Funds is the date of effectiveness of the fund's registration statement or the first day the fund commenced operations. For Class C shares, generally the inception date is the first day the fund commenced offering such shares. Exceptions: Templeton Global Balanced Fund Classes A and C use the inception date of the old Class A and C shares, renamed Class A1 and Class C1. For Mutual Series Funds, Franklin International Small Cap Growth Fund, Franklin Large Cap Equity Fund and Franklin Pelagos Commodities Strategy Fund, the inception date for Classes A, C, R and R6 shares is the funds' oldest class', Z or Advisor, inception date. Franklin U.S. Government Money Fund Class R6 inception date is the first day it commenced offering such shares. For Franklin Ultra-Short California Tax-Free Income Fund Classes A1 and Advisor Class use the inception date of its predecessor, Franklin California Tax-Exempt Money Fund.

Distributions are made to those who are registered shareholders of the fund on the record date. Distributions are paid on the pay date. Estimates can change prior to the record date depending on market conditions and number of shares outstanding. All dates and distributions are subject to board approval. Net investment income distribution estimates do not include short- or long-term capital gain distributions the funds may be making. The actual amounts of net investment income shareholders will receive will be reported, along with any short-term capital gain distributions, as Ordinary Dividends on Form 1099-DIV.

Includes all share classes available for the fund
For performance reporting purposes, the inception date for Classes A, R, R6, Z, and Advisor Class shares of all Franklin Templeton Funds is the date of effectiveness of the fund's registration statement or the first day the fund commenced operations. For Class C shares, generally the inception date is the first day the fund commenced offering such shares. Exceptions: Templeton Global Balanced Fund Classes A and C use the inception date of the old Class A and C shares, renamed Class A1 and Class C1. For Mutual Series Funds, Franklin International Small Cap Growth Fund, Franklin Large Cap Equity Fund and Franklin Pelagos Commodities Strategy Fund, the inception date for Classes A, C, R and R6 shares is the funds' oldest class', Z or Advisor, inception date. Franklin U.S. Government Money Fund Class R6 inception date is the first day it commenced offering such shares. For Franklin Ultra-Short California Tax-Free Income Fund Classes A1 and Advisor Class use the inception date of its predecessor, Franklin California Tax-Exempt Money Fund.

Franklin Templeton Investment Funds ("FTIF")
IMPORTANT INFORMATION

Franklin Templeton Investment Funds (the "Fund") is an umbrella fund and contains different sub-funds with different risk profiles that invest in equities, fixed income securities, money market instruments and derivatives.
Some sub-funds may invest up to 100% of their total net assets in structured products, mortgage- and asset-backed securities and derivatives (such as credit default swaps, forwards and options) and may significantly invest in non-investment grade debt securities. These investments involve significant liquidity and counterparty default risks which may result in loss of part or entire amount of your investment.
Some sub-funds may invest in defaulted debt securities on which the issuers are not currently making interest payment and in securities of companies undergoing restructuring. These investments are subject to significant liquidity and counterparty default risks.
Some sub-funds may invest in emerging market securities which are exposed to higher risk of economic, political and regulatory changes that may pose additional risk to the sub-funds.
Some sub-funds may invest primarily in a single market or sector or in small-sized companies. These investments are subject to higher concentration risk and are more volatile than funds following a more diversified policy.
Some sub-funds may invest extensively in financial derivative instruments for hedging purposes as well as investment purposes which may expose the sub-funds to the potential for significant losses and as a result may be subject to counterparty and volatility risk.
Some sub-funds may invest in investment funds, i.e. Underlying Funds, which will be subject to the risks associated with such Underlying Funds. There is no assurance on the Underlying Funds that (1) the liquidity will always be sufficient to meet redemption requests; and (2) the investment objective and strategy will be successfully achieved while the sub-funds do not have control of the investments of the Underlying Funds.
Some sub-funds may distribute income gross of expense and/or at its discretion pay dividend out of the capital of the sub-funds.
Payment of dividends out of capital amounts to a return or withdrawal of part of an investor’s original investment or from any capital gains attributable to that original investment.
Any distributions involving payment of dividends out of the sub-funds’ capital or payment of dividends effectively out of the sub-funds’ capital (as the case may be) may result in an immediate reduction of the net asset value per share.
Investors should not invest in the Fund unless the intermediary who sells it to you has advised you that it is suitable for you and has explained how it is consistent with your investment objectives.

 
Franklin Templeton Asia Fund Series (“FTAFS”)

A sub-fund may invest in investment funds which there can be no assurance that (1) the liquidity of the underlying investment funds will always be sufficient to meet redemption requests; and (2) the investment objective will be successfully achieved despite the due diligence and monitoring procedures undertaken by the Manager.
A sub-fund may invest in non-investment grade debt securities, and as a result may be subject to liquidity and counterparty default risks.

The sub-funds’ value may be affected by exchange control regulations and changes in exchange rates.
Investors should not invest in the sub-funds unless the intermediary who sells them to you has advised you that they are suitable for you and has explained how they are consistent with your investment objectives.
