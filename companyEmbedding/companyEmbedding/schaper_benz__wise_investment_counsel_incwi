Fixed Income & Money Market Strategy - Bonds, Mutual Funds, Securities - SBW of WI











homeservicesinvestment managementfamily wealth counselphilosophyequityfixed incomeabout usprofessionalseconomic & market summarycontactlinks





Looking for portfolio management?Contact us for an informational, no-obligation consultation.


PHILOSOPHY - FIXED INCOME & MONEY MARKET
Fixed Income
Our fixed income strategy is geared toward the following objectives:

Principal preservation
Inflation protection
Stable, predictable income generation

Our portfolios are, generally, laddered maturities of treasury issues and investment-grade corporate or municipal issues.  Becuase credit quality is extremely important, we are highly selectively in our use of non-investment grade bonds. Portfolio average maturities range from three to eight years in most cases. We are not involved in active trading or swapping techniques or forecasting of short-term changes in interest rates.  Typically, we hold fixed income investments to maturity.  


Our money market strategy is to provide maximum safety and liquidity, while realizing a competitive yield. We utilize high-quality money market mutual funds, and treasury bills.
