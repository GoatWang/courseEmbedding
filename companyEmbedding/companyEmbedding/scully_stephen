               Laser Image is located at 181 Swan Street in Methuen, MA. We have been in business since 2002, helping both men and women improve their appearance. There is no longer reason to live with skin imperfections and unwanted hair. Our lasers are purchased from Cutera, Candella, Palomar, and Syneron which are all rated top companies for laser equipment. All of our treatments typically take between 5 to 30 minutes and can be done during a lunch hour. Many clients report procedures as being mild, with little to no pain or side effects. Our well-trained staff of medical aesthetic technicians consults with our medical director and plastic surgeon, Dr. Stephen J. Scully, for all medical treatments. Dr. Scully is a board-certified plastic surgeon who has been trained at New York University Hospital Center for Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery and New England Medical Center Hospitals after graduating from Georgetown University, School of Medicine, in 1962. Our services at Laser Image include laser removal of hair, stretch marks, acne and acne scarring, brown spots/age spots (melasma), leg and facial veins, port-wine stains, redness/rosacea, wrinkles, and sagging skin. We also offer treatment for hair loss, microdermabrasion, chemical peels, ultrasonic facials, laser teeth whitening, specialized facials, and Botox, Rystahine + Juvéderm XC. We have chosen products that work very effectively to correct damaged skin and are designed to suit every skin type. In order to achieve maximum results, we chose Obagi and Glymed home care to compliment and be used in conjunction with all of our services. Free consultations are provided to answer any questions and concerns you may have. At that time, we will determine what treatment and product care will be best suitable for your condition.

Top positive reviewSee all 63 positive reviews› 4.0 out of 5 starsA fun read, but sad to know it's the lastByWilliam D. Curnutton December 10, 2011This Stephen Cannell novel is #11 in the Shane Scully series and will be the last, the novel is shorter than the other novels and probably reflects the fact that Cannell passed away recently.  Whether this was finished by a ghost writer or not it still keeps the flavor of Cannells writing and is an appropriate finality for the series.Scully and Hitchens (his partner) are attached to the special Homicide division of the LAPD.  They are called out to take over a case involving the death of a high profile individual who has been a thorn in the side of the department for years.  Her death will bring with it a higher amount of scrutiny because so many police officers are happy that she is dead.But what makes this even more dangerous turf is the fact that Nix Nixon from Vigilante TV has picked up the scent of the case and wants to use it as his third season project.  His program is not one favored by Police Departments because he thinks that the police are inept an he does his best to discredit them while solving the case before them, thus shaming the detectives and the department that he profiles.Scully and Hitchens are going to be dogged at every step of the investigation by Nix and his TV crew.  What makes it even harder is the fact that several former police officers, a former FBI agent and a former Attorney from the DA's office are now working with Nix on his show and do their best to also influence the public into thinking that the police departments are not doing their job.This case is going to go through several twists and turns as the investigation heats up.  Nix is going to do his best to send the detectives off in the wrong direction while solving the case himself.  He also adds to the mix a cold case that is several years old that he claims he can also solve before the LAPD.The stakes keep getting higher in this investigation.  It appears that there may be two police officers involved (high ranking ones) that will make this even more dangerous political turf for the detectives to walk.The killer also may have a desire to polish off the detectives before they get to close.The ride is a good one as we follow the detectives through their paces of trying to solve two cases and keep ahead of a TV show that wants to embarrass them.I felt the plot was good, the characters well developed and you found a good novel that shows the moral failures of both citizens and police officers as they let evil take control of their lives.I enjoyed the novel and am grateful for a good read, it is just sad that Cannell is not with us any longer to keep bringing us good novels to pursue.Enjoy!

3.0 out of 5 starsNot the Cannell I loved..:-((ByLinda Holmanon December 28, 2011I was so shocked when I heard that Stephen J Cannell had died. I felt like I had lost a member of my own family.  I happened to be trolling the new release section on Amazon, and saw this book, Vigilante, was being released in December.  I was thrilled!  I immediately put in my advance order, and couldn't wait to read the final book in the Shane Scully series.  In fact, when it arrived, I hesitated on reading it right away, as I wanted it to last a long time.So, when I finally started reading Vigilante, I was a bit confused.  It wasn't that long ago that I had read The Prostitute's Ball. Did I remember the characters ever behaving this way?  Was this really the Shane Scully and his beautiful wife, Alexa, head of the homicide detective division, that I had grown to love and admire? What happened to them making love at least 2-3 times per book, and their meaningful collaborations?  Where is their beloved son Chooch, who was barely a footnote in this entire book?When did Shane start feeling like everyone had more than him?  Why didn't he pet his cat more?! Since when was Shane concerned about his career when he was always like a stinger missile locked on a target?I felt the plot for Vigilante could have been exciting, and a great finale of a great series, by an extraordinary writer.  Instead, I felt a bit ripped off; like someone else either wrote this book, or finished this from an outline or draft.  This has happened with several authors; Dick Francis, who handed over his empire to his son, Felix, and the Ludlum series, the Robert B Parker series, etc. and all of these books had an additional author name on them, the exception being the Parker series.I lost count of the number of times Shane said "I think we're being set up".  Well, I feel like I was set up. I feel that if someone else assisted in writing this book, the fans should know this, and then, consider it when deciding to purchase the book.One of the things I always admired about Cannell's books were the exciting twists and turns, and the obscure references that a police "insider" would know.  This book was predictable, mildly exciting, and for me, a sad let down. I feel just awful giving this book a 3. The only other book he wrote that I didn't like was a stand alone book called At First Sight.If Vigilante was truly written 100% by Mr. Cannell before he passed away, I would love to know this.  It is quite possible that if he did write this, he probably wasn't feeling that well, and I would then look at this book in an entirely different light.If you have never read one of Stephen Cannell's books, I would highly recommend going back to the beginning and reading the Scully series in order...it's great to read how the characters evolved over the years, and most of the stories were fantastic.  His other stand alone novels were great too.Mr. Cannell, Rest in Peace...and thank you for all the wonderful adventures you gave me through your television shows and your novels. You were one of the all time greats, and will be sorely missed.

Where is their beloved son Chooch, who was barely a footnote in this entire book?When did Shane start feeling like everyone had more than him?  Why didn't he pet his cat more?! Since when was Shane concerned about his career when he was always like a stinger missile locked on a target?I felt the plot for Vigilante could have been exciting, and a great finale of a great series, by an extraordinary writer.  Instead, I felt a bit ripped off; like someone else either wrote this book, or finished this from an outline or draft.  This has happened with several authors; Dick Francis, who handed over his empire to his son, Felix, and the Ludlum series, the Robert B Parker series, etc. and all of these books had an additional author name on them, the exception being the Parker series.I lost count of the number of times Shane said "I think we're being set up".  Well, I feel like I was set up. I feel that if someone else assisted in writing this book, the fans should know this, and then, consider it when deciding to purchase the book.One of the things I always admired about Cannell's books were the exciting twists and turns, and the obscure references that a police "insider" would know.  This book was predictable, mildly exciting, and for me, a sad let down. I feel just awful giving this book a 3. The only other book he wrote that I didn't like was a stand alone book called At First Sight.If Vigilante was truly written 100% by Mr. Cannell before he passed away, I would love to know this.  It is quite possible that if he did write this, he probably wasn't feeling that well, and I would then look at this book in an entirely different light.If you have never read one of Stephen Cannell's books, I would highly recommend going back to the beginning and reading the Scully series in order...it's great to read how the characters evolved over the years, and most of the stories were fantastic.  His other stand alone novels were great too.Mr. Cannell, Rest in Peace...and thank you for all the wonderful adventures you gave me through your television shows and your novels. You were one of the all time greats, and will be sorely missed.22 comments|

There was a problem loading comments right now. Please try again later.4.0 out of 5 starsA fun read, but sad to know it's the lastByWilliam D. CurnuttVINE VOICEon December 10, 2011Format: Kindle Edition|Verified PurchaseThis Stephen Cannell novel is #11 in the Shane Scully series and will be the last, the novel is shorter than the other novels and probably reflects the fact that Cannell passed away recently.  Whether this was finished by a ghost writer or not it still keeps the flavor of Cannells writing and is an appropriate finality for the series.Scully and Hitchens (his partner) are attached to the special Homicide division of the LAPD.  They are called out to take over a case involving the death of a high profile individual who has been a thorn in the side of the department for years.  Her death will bring with it a higher amount of scrutiny because so many police officers are happy that she is dead.But what makes this even more dangerous turf is the fact that Nix Nixon from Vigilante TV has picked up the scent of the case and wants to use it as his third season project.  His program is not one favored by Police Departments because he thinks that the police are inept an he does his best to discredit them while solving the case before them, thus shaming the detectives and the department that he profiles.Scully and Hitchens are going to be dogged at every step of the investigation by Nix and his TV crew.  What makes it even harder is the fact that several former police officers, a former FBI agent and a former Attorney from the DA's office are now working with Nix on his show and do their best to also influence the public into thinking that the police departments are not doing their job.This case is going to go through several twists and turns as the investigation heats up.  Nix is going to do his best to send the detectives off in the wrong direction while solving the case himself.  He also adds to the mix a cold case that is several years old that he claims he can also solve before the LAPD.The stakes keep getting higher in this investigation.  It appears that there may be two police officers involved (high ranking ones) that will make this even more dangerous political turf for the detectives to walk.The killer also may have a desire to polish off the detectives before they get to close.The ride is a good one as we follow the detectives through their paces of trying to solve two cases and keep ahead of a TV show that wants to embarrass them.I felt the plot was good, the characters well developed and you found a good novel that shows the moral failures of both citizens and police officers as they let evil take control of their lives.I enjoyed the novel and am grateful for a good read, it is just sad that Cannell is not with us any longer to keep bringing us good novels to pursue.Enjoy!0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuseCommentInsert product linkPaste the product's web address below:Product not found.

Please try again later.4.0 out of 5 starsWell written.ByGloriaon December 11, 2013Format: Kindle Edition|Verified PurchaseI have read a number of Cannell's works and this is one of the most enjoyable. It is advantageous to read Cannell's books in series. The characters are constant in every book, enabling the reader to become familiar with each of them over time. When characters are constant, the narrative becomes more personal; the reader feels as though the story is about people you know and love. Cannell is a master at plotting the course of a mystery/puzzle. The hero always out-thinks the rotten guy. Very satisfactory.0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuseCommentInsert product linkPaste the product's web address below:Product not found.

Please try again later.5.0 out of 5 starsNo More Shane Scully?ByNancy C.on September 11, 2013Format: Hardcover|Verified PurchaseI read that this is the last book Shane Scully wrote before his untimely death. Shane and Hitch investigate the death of Lita Mendez, an aggressive police critic and gang activist. They become involved with the host of a hit reality show called "Vigilante TV" who is determined to beat the cops at their own game. It's Stephen Cannell at his best and I for one am going to miss him, along with vince Flynn. I highly recommend this series.0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuseCommentInsert product linkPaste the product's web address below:Product not found.

These individuals provide diagnoses and treatments for a wide variety of ailments, and preventative care and early detection for more serious illnesses. Whether you love or hate going to the doctor, the fact is your physician is there to listen to your health concerns, take preventative measures against diseases and advise you on your options for staying in tip-top shape.In 2013, there were more than 1 million doctors of medicine in the U.S., over 854,000 of which were active. Additionally, in 2012, there were about 18,000 active general surgeons in the country. It's important to know which type of physician or surgeon you need, how to choose the best one, and account for other considerations in order to stay healthy.Different Types of PhysiciansPatients can choose from a wide variety of physicians depending on doctor specialty and what problems they are experiencing. Here are a few of the most common types of physicians that you may see in your lifetime:General Practitioner
Your GP is the doctor that you go to for regular checkups, vaccines and to identify health issues. GPs can treat many different illnesses and injuries, from the common cold to a broken arm. If your health requires a second opinion or expert care, the GP will refer you to a specialist who has the skills to focus in on the issue.Cardiologist
Heart attacks and heart disease are some of the most common afflictions seen across the country, making cardiologists important to your long-term health. These physicians specialize in studying and treating the heart and related diseases.Dentist
Other than a GP, the dentist is likely the most common physician you'll ever see. These professionals work with the human mouth, ensuring that your teeth and gum health are up to par. Patients typically go to the dentist twice a year.Dermatologist
Dermatologists are focused on skin-related issues and diseases, from skin cancers, to acute acne, eczema, psoriasis, and general cosmetic concerns like aging and scars. Most will also perform annual or semi-annual mole checks to screen for any signs of melanoma, the most serious form of skin cancer.ENT
If you have a number of sinus infections or have had your tonsils taken out, you've likely seen an ENT specialist. ENTs handle ailments related to the ear, nose and throat, often related to taking out tonsils and treating hearing issues.OB/GYN
For many women, their gynecologist and obstetrician are the same person. These professionals work with the female reproductive system to focus on reproductive health, fertility issues, prenatal care, options for new and expectant mothers, neonatal care and childbirth. OB/GYNs can also help in the early detection of breast or cervical cancer.Choosing a PhysicianThere are obviously a number of physicians that you can choose from, but how do you know if they're the best choice for you? Here are a few considerations to help you pick a physician:Look at Your Insurance
Before you get down to the details, you need to verify which doctors are covered by your insurance and whether they are in or out of your carrier's network. Rates may be cheaper if the doc is in network – a doctor can be covered by your insurance but not necessarily in network. Out of network is typically more expensive. Doctors often add and drop plans, so it's important to ensure that your options are compatible with your insurance plan. Doing your homework will help you avoid unexpected expenses. Check for Board Certification
Your physician should be certified through the American Board of Medical Specialties. Doctors must earn a medical degree from a qualified school, complete three to seven years of residency training, be licensed by a state medical board and pass one or more ABMS exams to be certified.Examine the Reviews
Reviews of a doctor can reveal a lot about what your experience may be like. People may grade on staff friendliness, availability and effectiveness of treatment. Looking at these evaluations and getting recommendations from family and friends can direct you toward a physician for your needs.Choosing a SurgeonSurgeons can literally hold your life in their hands, and it's important to find the best one that can put you at ease and treat you effectivelyCompatibility Factor
You need to feel comfortable with your surgeon. It's important to communicate your concerns and that your surgeon can respond adequately. Surgeons should be willing to go over the details of your procedure and answer any questions that you may have. They must take the time to discuss and address your worries.Expertise Level
If you're going in for surgery, you want someone that knows what they're doing and has a high success rate. Ask how often the surgeon performs this surgery and try to find one that regularly does it. This will give you peace of mind that you're in capable hands.Understanding Your InsuranceYour decision on a physician or surgeon can be majorly affected by the insurance plan you have. You may have insurance through employment, your spouse, your parents if you're under 26, or the marketplace if the previous options don't apply to you. It's important to understand how your insurance works to have the full picture of what you'll need to pay for.Your insurance will have a deductible, which is the amount that you're responsible to pay for covered medical expenses. Some plans have coinsurances, where you must pay a certain percentage of the bill, and insurance will cover the rest. Co-pays state a flat rate for certain services, like paying $20 when you visit your GP or a $100 co-pay for an emergency room visit. Once you reach your out-of-pocket maximum, which will differ if you're an individual or within a family plan, your insurance may pay for 100 percent of covered medical expenses for the rest of the plan year.If you plan to go to the doctor, need medication or have been recommended for surgery, call your insurance provider or go online to see what your plan covers. You can choose the best doctor for your needs, understand your options and prevent yourself from being blindsided by medical expenses.Setting Your AppointmentMost doctors require a phone call for an appointment, although some may provide online scheduling as well. Be sure to have your insurance card with you when you set an appointment, and to bring it with you to the actual appointment. They need the ID numbers to verify your coverage, and will usually make a copy of the card for their files so you don't have to show it again unless your insurance changes.When you call, let them know if you're a new patient, as this will require you to complete some paperwork for your first visit. Tell them the reason for your visit, such as your symptoms if you're feeling sick. It's also important to inform them if you have Medicaid and to find out if you need to bring anything to the visit, like current medications or medical records.From here, the receptionist will likely ask what dates and times work best for you. During your call, it's important to be honest about your symptoms and the reason for your visit. This information will help the doctor treat you and give him or her an idea of what to expect. Your appointment may progress faster as a result, and the doctor can come prepared with a list of options to better care for you.RisksDoctors see a number of patients in a day, sometimes in 15-minute increments in areas where the physicians are in high demand. This can leave little time for doctors to perform thorough examinations, and they can end up missing certain problem indicators. While some problems, like a cold or flu, can be diagnosed in this time, more complex ailments require attention, which takes up time. Reviews can illuminate which doctors actively spend the necessary time with their patients and which ones are pressed against the clock to meet demand.Surgery has some more dire risks attached to it, so be sure to talk to your surgeon about the potential issues that can come up as a result of your procedure. If a patient has a reaction to anesthesia, it can cause very serious complications, but this is an uncommon occurrence. Blood clots can be a significant problem after surgery, often caused by inactivity during recovery. Infections, numbness, scarring, swelling and death are all possible, but the likelihood of these issues will vary depending on the type of surgery you're undergoing. Talk to your doctor about your concerns and your risk potential.AftercareSurgery affects people in different ways, but as you begin to emerge from anesthesia, you'll want to alert your nurse to any issues you may have. The nurse will tell you how the procedure went, what effect it will have on your condition, what to expect when you get home and how long it will take to get back to normal. If you start feeling pain, the nurse may give you medication to stop it from getting worse. When possible, it's also advised to move around to avoid blood clots from developing in your legs. This can be as simple as occasionally flexing your knee or rotating your foot. Some surgeries are outpatient procedures, where people are released the same day. For major surgeries, patients may stay at the hospital for a few days to be monitored and address any concerns before being sent home. Discuss with your surgeon the projected length of the hospital stay and what you need to bring.Recovery and Follow-upYour recovery time and follow-up expectations will vary depending on your procedure. For example, you can be expected to be on your feet within a few days of having your wisdom teeth taken out, but it may be weeks before you have fully recovered from a broken foot or heart-valve surgery. Your surgeon will give you a list of things that you'll need to do during this time, including what medications to take and when you'll be able to get back to work and other activities.Every surgery will have a follow-up call or appointment to discuss your recovery and allow you to ask any questions about unusual symptoms or changes in your overall health. If you have a major operation, like heart surgery, it's important to make regular checkups with your doctor or a specialist to ensure that everything is normal. Visiting a doctor will help deter infection and verify that everything is healing as expected. These appointments will give you peace of mind about your state of health and ensure that any issues are caught early on.
