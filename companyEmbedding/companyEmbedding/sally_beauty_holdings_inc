History[edit]
Sally Beauty Holdings, Inc. opened its first store in New Orleans in 1964. [2] Sally Beauty Company was started by C. Ray Farber in New Orleans and operated its flagship store on Magazine Street before selling out to Alberto-Culver. I worked as Mr. Farber's secretary for several years. He was a crafty businessman, originally from New York and had three sons and a daughter, Sally, therefore, Sally Beauty Company.

History[edit]
Sally Beauty Holdings, Inc. opened its first store in New Orleans in 1964. [2] Sally Beauty Company was started by C. Ray Farber in New Orleans and operated its flagship store on Magazine Street before selling out to Alberto-Culver. I worked as Mr. Farber's secretary for several years. He was a crafty businessman, originally from New York and had three sons and a daughter, Sally, therefore, Sally Beauty Company.
Corporate governance[edit]
Gary Winterhalter became the company's CEO in 2013.[citation needed] Winterhalter will step down from the CEO role at the end of the first quarter, 2015 and take the role of executive chairman, which he will hold through the beginning of 2018.[3] Coincident with Winterhalter's transition, Christian Brickman will take the CEO role.[3] Effective June 2, 2014, Brickman was the company's President and COO.[3]

Announces Fiscal 2017 First Quarter Results and Comprehensive Restructuring Plan to Drive EfficienciesBusiness WireFebruary 2, 2017ReblogShareTweetShareDENTON, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Sally Beauty Holdings, Inc. (SBH) (the “Company”) today announced financial results for the fiscal 2017 first quarter. The Company will hold a conference call today at 10:00 a.m. (Central) to discuss these results and its business.Fiscal 2017 First Quarter HighlightsConsolidated net sales were $999.6 million in the fiscal first quarter, an increase of 0.2% from the prior year’s first quarter. Same store sales growth of 0.4% and incremental sales from new stores were partially offset by the unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates of $15.7 million, or approximately 1.6% of sales.Gross margin for the quarter was 49.2%, a decline of 30 basis points from the prior year’s first quarter due to unfavorable product and customer mix shift, lower vendor allowances and higher promotions than the prior year.Selling, general and administrative expense (SG&A) during the quarter, excluding depreciation and amortization expense, was 34.8% of sales, an increase of 80 basis points from the prior year, driven by wage increases for store sales associates, higher expenses due to on-going upgrades to information technology systems and incremental expenses from new store openings.Operating earnings were $117.5 million, down 10.3% from $130.9 million in the prior year quarter primarily due to an increase in cost of goods sold and SG&A expenses outpacing the increase in sales.Net earnings were $55.8 million, up 32.2% compared to reported net earnings of $42.2 million in the prior year first quarter and down 14.2% compared to the prior year first quarter adjusted net earnings of $65.1 million.Diluted earnings per share were $0.39 compared to the prior year first quarter reported and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.28 and $0.43, respectively.Cash flow from operations was $90.5 million in the first quarter compared to $69.1 million, an increase of $21.3 million, over the prior year fiscal first quarter. Operating free cash flow was a strong $62.4 million in the fiscal first quarter, an increase of $33.9 million or 118.7% compared to the prior year quarter. The Company repurchased (and subsequently retired) a total of 2.5 million shares of common stock during the quarter at an aggregate cost of $67.0 million. Approximately $498.2 million authorization remains available under the current $1 billion share repurchase program.“We had a disappointing start to fiscal 2017, as sales growth and gross margins fell below expectations,” stated Chris Brickman, President and Chief Executive Officer. “In our core Sally business, our financial performance was negatively impacted by the challenging retail environment and promotional activity that failed to drive sufficient traffic to the stores. In response, we are today announcing a comprehensive restructuring plan and other aggressive cost reduction initiatives that we expect will meaningfully lower our cost structure without compromising our ability to serve the customer and execute on our strategic priorities. These actions should enable us to deliver low-to-mid single digit adjusted operating income growth in fiscal 2017 despite lowering our full year same store sales outlook to a range of flat to low-single-digit growth.“Looking forward, the Sally team will test a new loyalty program this spring and continue to focus on improving customer engagement and conversion, while BSG continues to strive towards gaining channel share and becoming the indisputable partner of choice for both stylists and manufacturers. Over the long-term, we remain focused on evolving our business model to better meet the needs of our customers, drive profitable growth and create value for our shareholders.”Additional Fiscal 2017 First Quarter DetailsInterest expense for the fiscal 2017 first quarter was $26.8 million, down $37.1 million from the fiscal 2016 first quarter. In the prior year’s first quarter, the Company recorded in interest expense the loss on the extinguishment of debt of $33.3 million in connection with the December 2015 redemption of its $750 million of 6.875% Senior Notes Due 2019 and the overlapping interest expense on such senior notes of $2.1 million.The Company’s effective tax rate in the fiscal 2017 first quarter was 38.4%, up 150 basis points compared to the prior year’s effective tax rate in the fiscal 2016 first quarter of 36.9%. The increase in the effective tax rate was due primarily to the absence of a prior year tax benefit from the retroactive reinstatement of certain tax credits.Read MoreAdjusted EBITDA for the fiscal 2017 first quarter was $148.1 million, a decrease of $11.8 million, or 7.4%, from the prior year’s first quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 14.8% in the quarter vs. 16.0% in the prior year’s quarter.Inventory at quarter end was $907.8 million, down $4.6 million, or 0.5%, vs. the prior year first quarter, reflecting the Company’s aggressive approach to inventory management during the challenging retail environment. Capital expenditures in the fiscal first quarter were $28.0 million, primarily for information technology projects, new stores openings and distribution facility upgrades.Restructuring Plan and Other Cost Reduction InitiativesOn January 26, 2017, the Board of Directors of the Company approved a comprehensive restructuring plan (the “Restructuring Plan”) for the Company’s businesses that includes a wide range of organizational efficiency initiatives and cost reduction opportunities.The Company expects that it will incur total aggregate charges of approximately $12 million to $14 million from the Restructuring Plan, including estimated severance and related costs of approximately $7 million. The Company expects to recognize most of these charges in the second quarter of 2017.The Restructuring Plan is expected to generate annualized pretax benefits in the range of $17 million to $19 million, with pretax benefits in fiscal 2017 estimated in the range of $10 million to $12 million.Other cost reduction initiatives, not included in the Restructuring Plan, are expected to further reduce planned operating expenses by approximately $20 million over the remainder of fiscal year 2017.Revised Fiscal 2017 Guidance The Company now expects full year same store sales in the range of flat to low-single-digit growth versus prior guidance of approximately 3%.  Net new store openings are expected to grow in the range of 2.0% to 3.0%, unchanged from prior guidance.  Full year consolidated gross margin is now expected to expand in the range of 20 to 30 basis points versus prior guidance of gross margin expansion in the range of 30 to 40 basis points.  Including the Restructuring Plan and other cost reduction initiatives, the Company now expects adjusted SG&A in the range of 34.1% to 34.4% of sales and adjusted operating income growth in the low-to-mid single digits in fiscal 2017.  Capital expenditures for the full fiscal year are expected in a range of $115 million to $120 million versus prior guidance of approximately $135 million. Fiscal 2017 First Quarter Segment ResultsSally Beauty Supply (“Sally”) Sales were $589.9 million, down 1.9% from $601.4 million in the fiscal 2016 first quarter. Sally’s sales performance was negatively impacted by the challenging retail environment and promotional activity that failed to drive sufficient traffic to the stores. Unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates of $15.7 million, or 260 basis points of sales growth, was partially offset by incremental sales from new store openings. Same store sales declined 0.6% in the quarter.  Net store count at quarter end increased by 104 from the prior year first quarter, to 3,815.  Gross margin was 55.0%, a 10 basis point increase from the prior year’s first quarter, driven by gross margin improvements in the U.K. and continental Europe, partially offset by the incremental promotional environment in the U.S.  Operating earnings were $92.5 million, down 13.1% from the prior year’s first quarter, driven by the sales decline, labor cost inflation and new store opening costs, partially offset by modest gross margin improvement. Beauty Systems Group (“BSG”) Sales were $409.8 million, up 3.3% from $396.6 million in the fiscal 2016 first quarter, driven by same store sales growth of 2.6%, new store openings and the acquisition of Peerless Beauty in September 2016. Foreign currency exchange rates did not have a material impact on BSG’s reported revenue growth.  Net store count at quarter end increased by 37 from the prior year to 1,340.  Gross margin declined 40 basis points from the fiscal 2016 first quarter to 40.9%, driven by unfavorable product mix shift and higher promotions than the prior year first quarter, and partially offset by favorable customer mix.  Operating earnings were $63.6 million, down 2.9% from the prior first year, driven by lower gross margin and higher SG&A costs (wages, store rent and computer expense) partially offset by sales growth.  Total BSG distributor sales consultants at quarter end were 900 versus 930 at the end of the prior year’s first quarter.

We have provided definitions below for these non-GAAP financial measures and have provided tables in the schedules hereto to reconcile these non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP financial measures.Adjusted EBITDA - We define the measure Adjusted EBITDA as GAAP net earnings before depreciation and amortization, interest expense, income taxes, share-based compensation, costs related to the Company’s previously disclosed data security incidents, management transition plan, executive separation expenses and asset impairment charges.Adjusted Net Earnings, Basic and Diluted Earnings Per Share and SG&A Expenses – Adjusted net earnings, basic and diluted earnings per share, operating earnings and SG&A expenses are GAAP net earnings, earnings per share, diluted earnings per share, operating earnings and SG&A expenses that exclude costs related to the Company’s previously disclosed management transition plan, executive separation expenses, data security incidents, asset impairment charges and the loss on extinguishment of debt and overlapping interest expense for the relevant time periods as indicated in the accompanying non-GAAP reconciliations to the comparable GAAP financial measures.We are unable to reconcile forecasted adjusted SG&A, as a percent to sales, and adjusted operating income growth to U.S. GAAP measures without unreasonable efforts because a forecast of certain charges, such as restructuring charges and costs related to data security incidents, is not practical.We believe that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Earnings, Basic and Diluted Earnings Per Share and SG&A Expenses provide valuable information regarding our earnings and business trends by excluding specific items that we believe are not indicative of the ongoing operating results of our businesses, providing a useful way for investors to make a comparison of our performance over time and against other companies in our industry.Operating Free Cash Flow – We define the measure Operating Free Cash Flow as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. We believe Operating Free Cash Flow is an important liquidity measure that provides useful information to investors about the amount of cash generated from operations after taking into account capital expenditures.We have provided these non-GAAP financial measures as supplemental information to our GAAP financial measures and believe these non-GAAP measures provide investors with additional meaningful financial information regarding our operating performance and cash flow. Our management and Board of Directors also use these non-GAAP measures as supplemental measures to evaluate our businesses and the performance of management, including the determination of performance-based compensation, to make operating and strategic decisions, and to allocate financial resources. We believe that these non-GAAP measures also provide meaningful information for investors and securities analysts to evaluate our historical and prospective financial performance and cash flow. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered a substitute for or superior to GAAP results. Furthermore, the non-GAAP measures presented by us may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.              Supplemental Schedules           Consolidated Statements of Earnings                       A     Segment Information             B     Non-GAAP Financial Measures Reconciliations (Adjusted EBITDA)             C     Non-GAAP Financial Measures Reconciliations (Continued)             D     Store Count and Same Store Sales             E     Selected Financial Data and Debt             F                                                              Supplemental Schedule A           SALLY BEAUTY HOLDINGS, INC.

Announces Fiscal Second Quarter ResultsBusiness WireMay 4, 2017ReblogShareTweetShareDENTON, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Sally Beauty Holdings, Inc. (SBH) (the “Company”) today announced financial results for its fiscal 2017 second quarter ended March 31, 2017. The Company will hold a conference call today at 7:30 a.m. (Central) to discuss these results and its business.Fiscal 2017 Second Quarter HighlightsReported diluted earnings per share in the second quarter were $0.40 compared to $0.41 in the prior year’s second quarter. Adjusted diluted earnings per share, excluding $9.2 million of charges related to the restructuring plan announced by the Company in February 2017 (the “Restructuring Plan”), were $0.44 in the second quarter, up 7.3% vs. the prior year.Consolidated net sales were $966.5 million in the second quarter, a decrease of 1.4% from the prior year. A 2.0% decline in same store sales was partially offset by incremental sales from new stores. The Company lost a day of selling in the second quarter due to the prior year being a Leap Year, and gained a day of selling in the second quarter due to the shift of this year’s Easter holiday to April. The net result of these two calendar items negatively impacted reported same store sales growth in the quarter by approximately 60 basis points. Additionally, a stronger U.S. dollar negatively impacted reported revenue by $9.8 million, or approximately 1.0%.Gross margin for the second quarter was 50.5%, an increase of 80 basis points from the prior year, driven primarily by strategic pricing initiatives, decreased promotional activity and increased vendor allowances.Selling, General and Administrative (“SG&A”) expenses in the second quarter, excluding depreciation and amortization expense, were 34.3% of sales, a decrease of 30 basis points from the prior year’s adjusted SG&A.Reported operating earnings and operating margin in the second quarter were $119.0 million and 12.3%, respectively, compared to reported operating earnings and operating margin of $122.5 million and 12.5%, respectively, in the prior year.Adjusted operating earnings in the second quarter, excluding the $9.2 million of charges related to the Restructuring Plan, was $128.2 million, growth of 3.2% from the prior year’s adjusted operating earnings. Adjusted operating margin was 13.3%, up 60 basis points vs. the prior year’s adjusted operating margin.The Company repurchased (and subsequently retired) a total of 4.4 million shares of common stock during the quarter at an aggregate cost of $101.9 million. Share repurchases through the first two quarters of the fiscal year totaled approximately $169 million.“Our financial results in the second quarter reflect our teams’ sharp focus on gross margin management and operating expense discipline, both of which enabled us to deliver solid mid-single digit growth in adjusted operating income and even stronger growth in adjusted earnings per share,” stated Chris Brickman, the Company’s President and Chief Executive Officer. “Store traffic was especially challenging in January and February, but improved in the last month of the quarter. Additionally, revenue performance in April – the first month of our third fiscal quarter – was in line with the expectations that are included in the full year revenue guidance being communicated today. We are focused on ‘controlling the things we can control’ and, most importantly, on profitable growth. As such, I was very pleased with the earnings delivery in the quarter.“We executed on many of our most important initiatives in the quarter, including zone and tactical pricing, as well as the introduction of new brands to BSG and Sally. In early April, we launched the test of our new Sally Beauty loyalty program and early customer feedback has been very positive. Further, we seamlessly executed on the most significant components of the Restructuring Plan that we announced in early February.“We will continue to execute on our strategic priorities, while being financially prudent in order to protect earnings growth. We have many reasons to be confident going into the second half of the fiscal year and into 2018, despite the continuing challenging retail environment. We recognize there is work to be done, but we believe we are taking the right steps to accelerate growth in both revenue and profitability.”Read MoreAdditional Fiscal 2017 Second Quarter DetailsInterest expense in the fiscal second quarter was $26.8 million compared to $27.0 million in the prior year.The effective income tax rate in the fiscal second quarter was 38.2%, up 120 basis points vs. the prior year. The higher effective tax rate is due primarily to a non-recurring tax deduction in the prior year’s second quarter.Reported net earnings in the fiscal second quarter were $57.0 million, a decrease of $3.2 million, or 5.3%, from the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA in the quarter was $158.5 million, an increase of $7.6 million, or 5.0%, from the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 16.4% in the quarter compared to 15.4% in the prior year.Inventory at quarter end was $917.3 million, up $16.0 million, or 1.8%, from the prior year. The increase was due primarily to new store growth and the addition of new brands, partially offset by the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar.Capital expenditures in the fiscal second quarter were $21.0 million, and fiscal year to date capital expenditures were $47.0 million, primarily for information technology projects, new stores openings and distribution facility upgrades.Restructuring Plan UpdateOn January 26, 2017, the Board of Directors of the Company approved a comprehensive restructuring plan (the “Restructuring Plan”) for the Company’s businesses that included a wide range of organizational efficiency initiatives and cost reduction opportunities.The initiatives contemplated by the Restructuring Plan include a reorganization of Sally Beauty’s field and operations teams in the U.S. and Canada to better align with a best-in-class retail model; the consolidation of four remote BSG office locations into corporate headquarters in Denton, TX; the centralization of support functions in continental Europe; and headcount reductions across most corporate backroom functions. Approximately $9.2 million was recorded as restructuring charges in the second fiscal quarter, primarily for employee separation costs.During the second quarter the Company identified additional cost reduction and profit improvement opportunities to be executed over the remainder of the fiscal year as part of an expanded Restructuring Plan. These opportunities include additional organizational efficiency initiatives in European operations and a revised business model in an unprofitable international market.Including the new initiatives, the Company now expects total charges related to the Restructuring Plan in the range of $14 million to $16 million; annualized pretax benefits in the range of $19 million to $21 million; and fiscal 2017 pretax benefits in the range of $11 million to $12 million.Fiscal 2017 GuidanceThe Company is revising its guidance for full year fiscal 2017 as follows: Consolidated same store sales growth approximately flat to the prior year; and  Net new store openings growth of approximately 2.0% The Company is reiterating its guidance for full year fiscal 2017 as follows: Full year consolidated gross margin expansion in a range of 20 to 30 basis points;  Including benefits from the Restructuring Plan and other cost reduction initiatives, adjusted SG&A in a range of 34.1% to 34.4% of sales;  Adjusted operating income growth in the low-to-mid single digits; and  Capital expenditures in a range of $115 million to $120 million Fiscal 2017 Second Quarter Segment ResultsSally Beauty Supply (“Sally”) Sales were $576.0 million in the second quarter, down 2.9% the prior year. Unfavorable foreign currency translation reduced Sally’s reported revenue growth by 180 basis points. Same store sales declined 2.4% in the quarter. The net impact of the Leap Year and Easter calendar issues noted above negatively impacted Sally’s same store sales in the quarter by approximately 40 basis points.  Net store count at quarter end increased by 106, to 3,838, from the prior year’s second quarter.  Gross margin was 56.3% in the second quarter, a 100 basis point increase from the prior year. Gross margin benefitted from strategic pricing initiatives and decreased promotional activity in the U.S.  Operating earnings were $96.8 million in the second quarter, down 5.4% from the prior year, driven by the sales decline, labor inflation and new store opening costs, partially offset by the strong gross margin expansion. Beauty Systems Group (“BSG”) Sales were $390.5 million in the second quarter, up 0.9% the prior year, driven by modest growth in full service sales and incremental sales from acquisitions, partially offset by a 1.2% decline in same store sales. The net impact of the Leap Year and Easter calendar issues noted above negatively impacted BSG’s same store sales in the quarter by approximately 100 basis points. Foreign currency exchange rates did not have a material impact on BSG’s reported revenue growth.  Net store count at quarter end increased by 34, to 1,346, from the prior year’s second quarter.  Gross margin in the second quarter increased 60 basis points, to 41.9%, due primarily to increased vendor allowances.  Operating earnings were $62.7 million in the second quarter, up 2.9% from the prior year, driven by modest revenue growth and higher gross margin, partially offset by higher SG&A costs (labor inflation and costs associated with the new store openings).  Total distributor sales consultants at quarter end were 849 vs. 923 at the end of the prior year’s second quarter. This decrease is primarily due to a decline in the number of distributor sales consultants employed by the franchise business. Management ChangesOn May 1, 2017, Sharon Leite, President of Sally Beauty U.S. and Canada, notified the Company that she was resigning from her position effective immediately.Chris Brickman, the President and Chief Executive Officer of Sally Beauty Holdings, Inc., will serve as the interim President of Sally Beauty U.S. and Canada until the Company appoints Ms. Leite’s successor. An external firm has been retained to assist with the search process.“I would like to thank Sharon for her contributions,” said Chris Brickman. “I will immediately assume responsibility for all operations of the Sally Beauty U.S. and Canada business. More importantly, I am excited to work directly with the team to execute on the plans that they have developed, and I feel more confident than ever that we have defined the right strategy for Sally going forward.”Conference Call and Where You Can Find Additional InformationAs previously announced, at approximately 7:30 a.m. (Central) today the Company will hold a conference call and audio webcast to discuss its financial results and its business.

We have provided definitions below for these non-GAAP financial measures and have provided tables in the schedules hereto to reconcile these non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP financial measures.Adjusted EBITDA - We define the measure Adjusted EBITDA as GAAP net earnings before depreciation and amortization, interest expense, income taxes, share-based compensation, costs related to the Company’s previously announced Restructuring Plan, previously disclosed data security incidents, management transition plan and asset impairment charges for the relevant time periods as indicated in the accompanying non-GAAP reconciliations to the comparable GAAP financial measures.Adjusted Operating Earnings and Operating Margin – Adjusted operating earnings are GAAP operating earnings that excludes costs related to the Company’s previously announced Restructuring Plan, previously disclosed management transition plan, data security incidents and asset impairment charges for the relevant time periods as indicated in the accompanying non-GAAP reconciliations to the comparable GAAP financial measures. Adjusted Operating Margin is Adjusted Operating Earnings as a percentage of net sales.Adjusted Diluted Net Earnings Per Share – Adjusted diluted net earnings per share is GAAP diluted earnings per share that exclude costs related to the Company’s previously announced Restructuring Plan, previously disclosed management transition plan, data security incidents and asset impairment charges as indicated in the accompanying non-GAAP reconciliations to the comparable GAAP financial measures.Operating Free Cash Flow – We define the measure Operating Free Cash Flow as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. We believe Operating Free Cash Flow is an important liquidity measure that provides useful information to investors about the amount of cash generated from operations after taking into account capital expenditures.We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide valuable information regarding our earnings and business trends by excluding specific items that we believe are not indicative of the ongoing operating results of our businesses; providing a useful way for investors to make a comparison of our performance over time and against other companies in our industry.We have provided these non-GAAP financial measures as supplemental information to our GAAP financial measures and believe these non-GAAP measures provide investors with additional meaningful financial information regarding our operating performance and cash flows. Our management and Board of Directors also use these non-GAAP measures as supplemental measures to evaluate our businesses and the performance of management, including the determination of performance-based compensation, to make operating and strategic decisions, and to allocate financial resources. We believe that these non-GAAP measures also provide meaningful information for investors and securities analysts to evaluate our historical and prospective financial performance. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered a substitute for or superior to GAAP results. Furthermore, the non-GAAP measures presented by us may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.        Supplemental Schedules     Segment Information       1     Non-GAAP Financial Measures Reconciliations (Adjusted EBITDA)     2     Non-GAAP Financial Measures Reconciliations (Continued)     3-4     Store Count and Same Store Sales     5                                                                                                              SALLY BEAUTY HOLDINGS, INC.
