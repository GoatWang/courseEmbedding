if you were blocked because it was detected that you are a fake Google crawler, then disable the rule that blocks fake google crawlers. Or if you were blocked because you 
were accessing your site too quickly, then increase the number of accesses allowed per minute.

If you're still having trouble, then simply disable the Wordfence advanced blocking and you will 
still benefit from the other security features that Wordfence provides.

						    New School of Business Building to be Named Snead Hall

Thomas G. Snead, Jr. and Vickie M. Snead
When the Virginia Commonwealth University School of Business
opens its doors on January 14 for the spring semester 2008, students will enter
Snead Hall, a new building on the Monroe Park Campus Addition. 
The university's Board of Visitors has approved naming the
new School of Business
building in honor of Thomas G. Snead, Jr. and Vickie M. Snead, 1976 graduates
of the VCU School of Business and long-time supporters of Virginia
 Commonwealth University.
"The Sneads have been extraordinarily generous to VCU and
have provided leadership not only in helping the School of Business to advance,
but also in contributing their resources and time to enhance the future of the
entire university," said VCU President Eugene P. Trani.
Tom Snead is the former president and CEO of the Southeast
Region for WellPoint, Inc. He also serves on VCU's Board of Visitors, the VCU
Health System Board and is chair of the finance committee of the School
 of Business Foundation. Vickie
Snead is a former vice president of Merchandise Planning and Control at Miller
& Rhoads Department Store. She is a member of VCU's Alumni board and the
VCU Massey Cancer Center Advisory Board. 

"The Snead name on the new building embodies the spirit of
the VCU School of Business, which is personal and business success," said
Michael Sesnowitz, dean of the Business
 School. "The Sneads stand for
everything to which students should aspire."
Snead Hall is part of a business and engineering complex
that includes the new School of Business
and an expansion of the School of Engineering.
The idea to collocate the schools came from local business leaders who believed
business and engineering students should be connected, just as they are in the
workplace.
"This amazing new facility is the result of a lot of generous
and hard-working people, and so it is extremely humbling to be singled out for
the honor of having the building named after the Snead family," said Tom Snead,
speaking on behalf of the couple. "As proud alumni of the VCU School of
Business, we know the teaching, learning and creativity that happen in this
building will have a significant impact on our students and we are excited for
their future."
Along with traditional classroom and faculty offices, the 145,000
square-foot, four-story contemporary facility includes a fully functioning capital
markets and trading room, collaborative learning rooms, central atrium with a
student commons and cafe, career services center, center for corporate
education, auditorium, tiered case study classrooms and team-building breakout
rooms.
Snead Hall is part of the $228 million Monroe Park Campus
Addition, the largest construction project in VCU's history. The residential
campus is an 11-acre tract that in addition to Snead Hall, includes an
expansion of the VCU School of Engineering, renovation of the historic Central
 Belting Building
for the VCU Adcenter, the first of two residential colleges and a parking
garage. The new facilities will allow the schools of business and engineering
to expand enrollment by 2,000 students. 
The VCU School of Business, now 70 years old, enrolls about
3,700 undergraduate and graduate students from throughout Virginia,
the United States
and the world.
