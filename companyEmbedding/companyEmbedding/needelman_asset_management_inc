Solving the practical challenge of organizing, sourcing, and sharing product content.









Giving brands and retailers access to a whole new level of detailed ecommerce data and analytics

Our Story
 
The idea for Plytix evolved from our time at Google, when we were working with some of the biggest companies in the e-commerce space. At the time, technology allowed tracking user behaviour on individual websites, but we wanted to give brands and retailers access to a whole new level of detailed data, bringing them a better understanding of their products through 3rd party product analytics. 
 
Since then Plytix has evolved into an end-to-end product management eco-system where brands and retailers can organize, analyze, and share product content and performance in a user-friendly and efficient way without breaking the bank. 
 




























Our Team
 
We're a diverse, international team passionate about creating extraordinary client experiences and serious about revolutionizing e-commerce. We are growing rapidly and we're always on the look out for smart, driven people to join our team.

Your Financial Advocate
		

Needelman Asset Management, Inc. is strictly a fee-only Investment advisory and portfolio management firm. We are independent and keep our focus exclusively on the client. We do not sell annuities, insurance, stocks, bonds, mutual funds, limited partnerships, or other commissioned products. The firm is not affiliated with entities that sell financial products or securities, nor do we accept commissions in any form.

We Individualize Portfolios
		

Not everyone has the same needs or goals for their money, and that is why we tailor each client's portfolio. We work directly with our clients in order to have a better understanding of their needs. The objectives for each client are documented and used to create an investment plan that guides the management of each individual portfolio.
		

Contact Us


Read More











Disciplined Approach
		

We believe value investing is transferable to every asset class. After all, at its core, investing is simply committing capital to some sort of claim on future cash flows regardless of the type of investment.  Whether it is a publicly traded stock, a corporate bond, or some type of non-standard asset, the price one pays is paramount to returns.

Equities

It is about the bottom line. A company worth investing in should have strong financial characteristics, have a solid economic foundation, and be reasonably priced. There should also be a catalyst for creating shareholder wealth reflected in its stock price. We want our clients to get the most out of their investments.
.






Fixed Income

Our clients deserve to earn from their investments, even if they are living off a fixed income. We provide options for those seeking more stability in their financial matters. The method we use involves a bottom up credit analysis to find the fixed income securities that balance portfolios, earn income or potentially offer capital gain.






Alternative Investments

Solid investments like stocks and bonds are not the only options available. Many investors broaden their portfolios with private debt, real estate, private equity, and managed futures. The purpose of these options is to protect investments from volatile markets. We select and invest in a variety of instruments that offer steady passive returns.







Our Commitment to You




Our team is committed to meeting your needs and devoted to creating an investment solution that addresses them. Whether you’re looking ahead to provide a future for the next generation of your family, a retiree who desires monthly income, or a business owner setting aside money for your employees, we will prioritize your goals and design a plan tailored to your needs.
Together with our deep relationships, we’ll provide you with an investment portfolio that puts your money to work for you. Here are three things you can expect from us:

Personal ongoing guidance
Investment portfolio with access to a broad range of asset classes
Reliable client service

Our Investments

Our equity portfolios are suited to the conservative investor who seeks capital appreciation for the long term through value investing.

Our stock selection process is based on our philosophy that we can achieve consistent, superior long-term results by building portfolios of high quality, undervalued companies possessing exceptional management and financial characteristics. To be considered for purchase, a company must also possess a catalyst, which improves the potential for increased shareholder wealth. Our process emphasizes in-house fundamental research and the experience of our investment professionals in identifying these opportunities.
Equity Portfolio Philosophy
• We focus on the company as equity stakeholders, not just its stock
• The company’s management: capable, focused on the shareholder
• The company’s balance sheet: strong, with good cash flow, appropriate leverage
• The company’s profits: reinvested productively
• The company’s business: large, stable, yet still growing
We seek companies with strong balance sheets and with comparatively low price/earnings, price/cash flow, and price/book valuation ratios. Stocks are purchased if they are trading significantly below our estimate of fair value. This conservative approach seeks to provide investors with both a margin of safety and significant long-term appreciation potential.
Equity Selection Process
Needelman Asset Management specializes in the management of large capitalization value oriented portfolios.
Step 1: Screen for Value

Low P/E, low Price/Book (relative basis)
Emphasis on sustainable, growing, dividend payments
Capitalization of at least $5 billion

Step 2: Apply Fundamental Analysis

Analyze the quality of the company’s management, its balance sheet, the business itself and the strategic business plan
Determine a catalyst, existing or potential, such as: dividend increases, stock repurchases, corporate restructurings, mergers and acquisitions, changes in business strategy

Step 3: Construct the Portfolio

25-35 equity issues
No more than 5% in any one issue at time of purchase
No more than 20% in any one industry at time of purchase
Broad diversification by industry and sector
Accommodate client specific guidelines and restrictions

Step 4: Sell to Take Profits, Protect Principal

Stocks are monitored, reviewed and sold:
When the stock’s upside price objective is reached
In order to make room for new opportunities
When fundamental and/or technical factors deteriorate from original expectations
When continuing analysis suggests a shift out of a particular sector or industry

Investment management is the discretionary authority given to an Advisor in order to create a portfolio of assets that achieve the specific goals of the investor.  Selecting the right Advisor is one of the most important decisions you can make regarding your financial life, yet selecting an Advisor can be confusing.
Professionals that manage investments and wealth can hold a variety of titles, including Financial Advisor, Wealth Manager, Financial Planner among others.
Should you choose an Independent Registered Investment Advisor or a Financial Advisor? Do you know the difference between them? Let’s look at some of the key differences between Registered Investment Advisors and Financial Advisors to help you decide what is right for you.
Some Financial Advisors work to sell you their products and services. We are different because our bottom line is you. Since we are independent and don’t make profits off selling, we can focus on our clients. We will work directly with you to help you every step of the way.
There are many benefits to working with an Indpendent Registered Investment Advisor (RIA) rather than a traditional Financial Advisor. RIAs are legally required by  federal law to uphold fiduciary standards, and are legally required to go by the written code of ethics. These regulations and rules help ensure you have a financial advocate at your side.
RIAs make it easy for clients to pay them for their services. Independent RIAs often charge a fee based on assets under management or a simple flat fee for their services.  There are no commissions or conflicts of interest.
There are Advisors of any title that can help you meet your future financial goals. However, Registered Investment Advisors have taken additional steps to ensure your confidence in them by undergoing examination and providing proof that they have the experience to provide you with the best investment solutions.
They are committed to staying on top of their field by continuing their education and take on a fiduciary duty.  While working with an RIA, your needs are always at the forefront in their decisions, aligning your goals when it comes to your financial future.

We take the time to get to know you and identify your personal objectives. Through meaningful dialogue, we listen to your answers to key questions that are crucial when considering a unique investment solution. We work together to tailor an investment framework that defines your particular risk tolerance, time horizon, tax sensitivity and liquidity needs.
Once an investment policy and appropriate asset allocation are agreed upon, we put your capital to work. Our mandate is to provide custom portfolios that deliver competitive, risk-appropriate returns over all market cycles. We believe a Graham and Dodd Value Investing approach, across all asset classes, allows steady and consistent performance over time.
Our goal is to build and preserve your wealth. Using our pool of resources, we identify and employ an array of investible assets in order to optimize risk-adjusted returns. In general, portfolios are made up of individual equities, fixed income securities, and alternative investment opportunities. The use of ETFs, specialty Mutual funds, or Reg D offerings may also be appropriate to address client-specific needs.
As Registered Investment Advisors, we strive to manage your portfolio as cost-effectively, transparently and hassle-free as possible. Because we are unbiased financial advocates, we are independent and free of any conflicts of interest. We are a fee-only investment advisor. No commissions are made and compensation is not tied to the selection of any specific investment.
Your assets are custodied with a third-party brokerage firm selected by you. While we have discretionary authority to trade on your behalf, we never have direct access to any funds. In addition, we work in concert with your tax and legal professionals, seamlessly carrying out your estate planning directives and tax related tasks.
Our approach is simple. You’re in control – we do the work.

A smart product management hub for retailthat streamlines digital content and data sharing






 





















Our mission
 
We have made it our mission to provide brands and retailers simple and affordable tools that tackle many challenges in digital product management and distribution by:













Solving the practical challenge of organizing, sourcing, and sharing product content.









Giving brands and retailers access to a whole new level of detailed ecommerce data and analytics
















Take control of your products with Plytix
 









Our Story
 
The idea for Plytix evolved from our time at Google, when we were working with some of the biggest companies in the e-commerce space. At the time, technology allowed tracking user behaviour on individual websites, but we wanted to give brands and retailers access to a whole new level of detailed data, bringing them a better understanding of their products through 3rd party product analytics. 
 
Since then Plytix has evolved into an end-to-end product management eco-system where brands and retailers can organize, analyze, and share product content and performance in a user-friendly and efficient way without breaking the bank. 
 




























Our Team
 
We're a diverse, international team passionate about creating extraordinary client experiences and serious about revolutionizing e-commerce. We are growing rapidly and we're always on the look out for smart, driven people to join our team. 
 
Get a closer look on  LinkedIn and Instagram.

Home - Needelman Asset Management





















































































 








Your Financial Advocate
		

Needelman Asset Management, Inc. is strictly a fee-only Investment advisory and portfolio management firm. We are independent and keep our focus exclusively on the client. We do not sell annuities, insurance, stocks, bonds, mutual funds, limited partnerships, or other commissioned products. The firm is not affiliated with entities that sell financial products or securities, nor do we accept commissions in any form.
		

Contact Us


Read More











We Individualize Portfolios
		

Not everyone has the same needs or goals for their money, and that is why we tailor each client's portfolio. We work directly with our clients in order to have a better understanding of their needs. The objectives for each client are documented and used to create an investment plan that guides the management of each individual portfolio.
		

Contact Us


Read More











Disciplined Approach
		

We believe value investing is transferable to every asset class. After all, at its core, investing is simply committing capital to some sort of claim on future cash flows regardless of the type of investment.  Whether it is a publicly traded stock, a corporate bond, or some type of non-standard asset, the price one pays is paramount to returns.
		

Contact Us


Read More














Equities

It is about the bottom line. A company worth investing in should have strong financial characteristics, have a solid economic foundation, and be reasonably priced. There should also be a catalyst for creating shareholder wealth reflected in its stock price. We want our clients to get the most out of their investments.
.






Fixed Income

Our clients deserve to earn from their investments, even if they are living off a fixed income. We provide options for those seeking more stability in their financial matters. The method we use involves a bottom up credit analysis to find the fixed income securities that balance portfolios, earn income or potentially offer capital gain.






Alternative Investments

Solid investments like stocks and bonds are not the only options available. Many investors broaden their portfolios with private debt, real estate, private equity, and managed futures. The purpose of these options is to protect investments from volatile markets. We select and invest in a variety of instruments that offer steady passive returns.







Our Commitment to You




Our team is committed to meeting your needs and devoted to creating an investment solution that addresses them. Whether you’re looking ahead to provide a future for the next generation of your family, a retiree who desires monthly income, or a business owner setting aside money for your employees, we will prioritize your goals and design a plan tailored to your needs.
Together with our deep relationships, we’ll provide you with an investment portfolio that puts your money to work for you. Here are three things you can expect from us:

Personal ongoing guidance
Investment portfolio with access to a broad range of asset classes
Reliable client service
