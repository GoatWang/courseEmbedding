Terms Of Use






Last Updated: February 13, 2015

These Terms of Use (the “TOU” or “Agreement”) constitute a legal agreement between you (“you,” “your”) and TradeBlock (“TradeBlock,” “TB,” “we,” or “us”) governing your individual usage of the The TradeBlock website located at https://tradeblock.com (together with all other websites operated by or on behalf of us, the “Site”), as well as any related mobile applications, products, software, programs, tools, internet-based services, components, and any updates thereto provided by us (collectively, the “Services”). The Site and Services shall be hereinafter referred to collectively as the “Site”. Please read this Agreement carefully as it contains important legal terms, including provisions that limit our liability to you and require individual arbitration for any potential legal dispute. BY ACCESSING THE SITE AND/OR  REGISTERING WITH US, YOU SIGNIFY THAT YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTOOD AND AGREE TO BE  BOUND BY THESE  TERMS OF SERVICE INCLUDING OUR PRIVACY POLICY AND DATA SERVICES AGREEMENT,  WHICH ARE INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.

1. Agreement
By using the Site, you agree to be bound by our TOU. If you do not agree to the terms and conditions contained in the TOU and TradeBlock's Privacy Policy, please do not access or otherwise use the Site or any information contained herein.

You affirm that you are over the age of 18, as the Site is not intended for children under 18. If it comes to TradeBlock's attention through reliable means that a registered user is a child under 18 years of age, TradeBlock will cancel that user's account.
2. Changes to the TOU
We reserve the right at any time to:

- Change the terms and conditions of the TOU; 
- Change the Site, including eliminating or discontinuing any Content or feature of the Site; or 
- Impose fees, charges or other conditions for use of the Site or parts thereof (with reasonable notice). 

TradeBlock may modify the Site at any time without prior notice, and you accept those modifications if you continue to use the Site. You should check the Site frequently to see recent changes.
3. Important Securities Disclaimer
You understand that no Content published on the Site constitutes a recommendation that any particular security, portfolio of securities, transaction or investment strategy is suitable for any specific person. You further understand that none of the writers, information providers, App providers, or their affiliates are advising you personally concerning the nature, potential, value or suitability of any particular security, portfolio of securities, transaction, investment strategy or other matter. To the extent that any of the Content published on the Site may be deemed to be investment advice or recommendations in connection with a particular security, such information is impersonal and not tailored to the investment needs of any specific person. You understand that an investment in any security or digital currency asset is subject to a number of risks, and that discussions of any security published on the Site will not contain a list or description of relevant risk factors. In addition, please note that some of the assets about which Content is published on the Site have a low market capitalization and/or insufficient public float. Such assets are subject to more risk than stocks of larger companies, including greater volatility, lower liquidity and less publicly available information. Postings or Content on the Site which may or may not be deemed by you to be recommendations may have an effect on asset prices.

You understand that the Site may contain opinions from time to time with regard to securities or currencies mentioned in other TradeBlock products, and that opinions in one publication or product may be different from those in another blog or product. You understand and agree that, Content contributors or their affiliates may write about assets in which they or their firms have a position, and that they may trade for their own account, and that they may or may not be subject to a disclosure policy. In cases where TradeBlock becomes aware that one of its employees has violated his or her disclosure obligation, TradeBlock will take appropriate action. In addition, outside bloggers or Content contributors may be subject to certain restrictions on trading for their own account. However, you understand and agree that at the time of any transaction that you make, one or more Content contributors or their affiliates may have a position in the securities or digital currency assets written about.

You understand that performance data is supplied by sources believed to be reliable, that the calculations herein are made using such data, and that such calculations are not guaranteed by these sources, the information providers, or any other person or entity, and may not be complete.
           From time to time, reference may be made on our Site to prior articles and opinions we have published. These references may be selective, may reference only a portion of an article or opinion, and are likely not to be current. As markets change continuously, previously published information and data may not be current and should not be relied upon.

All Content on the Site is presented only as of the date published or indicated, and may be superseded by subsequent market events or for other reasons. In addition, you are responsible for setting the cache settings on your browser to ensure you are receiving the most recent data.
No Investment Recommendations or  Professional Advice
The Site is not intended to provide tax, legal, insurance or investment advice, and nothing on the Site should be construed as an offer to sell, a solicitation of an offer to buy, or a recommendation for any security or digital currency by TradeBlock or any third party. You alone are solely responsible for determining whether any investment, security or strategy, or any other product or service, is appropriate or suitable for you based on your investment objectives and personal and financial situation. You should consult an attorney or tax professional regarding your specific legal or tax situation.

8. Overview of Posting Content;  Monitoring Content
The Site permits the submission of Content by users of the Site (a “User Submission”), including without limitation comments, articles, links, private messages sent to other registered users through the Site's comment system. TradeBlock has the right in its sole discretion and without further notice to you, to monitor, censor, edit, move, delete, and/or remove any and all Content posted on its Site or any Content transmitted by direct messaging or by any other method to or from your TB user account at any time and for any reason. Without limiting the foregoing, TB has the right to delete any comment or Content that it believes, in its sole discretion, does or may violate the TOU of the Site by you.

TB reserves the right to remove Content that violates one of the following principles, as determined by TB, at our discretion:

- No incitement to hatred. Material that promotes hatred toward groups based on race or ethnic origin, religion, disability, gender, age, veteran status, or sexual orientation/gender identity will be removed. 
- No pornography or pedophilia 
- No direct or veiled threats against any person or group of people. 
- No copyright infringement

- No personal attacks. 
- No profanity or vulgarity. 
- No business solicitations or advertising. 
- No inappropriate, unethical or misleading behavior. 
9. User Submissions; Online Rules of  Conduct
When you post any User Submission on the Site or give TradeBlock permission to post your Content, you agree to:

- Post comments in both tone and Content that contribute in a positive and high quality manner to the substantive exchange of information and the subject matter of the Site. 
- Automatically grant TradeBlock a royalty-free, perpetual, worldwide, irrevocable, non-exclusive and fully transferable and sublicensable right and license to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, create derivative works from, distribute, perform and display any User Submission (in whole or in part) and/or to incorporate any of your User Submission in other works now or in the future and in any media formats and through any media channels, and you confirm and warrant to TradeBlock that you own the copyright in each of your User Submissions and have all the rights, power and authority necessary to grant the above license and rights. 

TB will use commercially reasonable efforts to attribute material User Submissions to the author.

When you post any User Submission on the Site, you also agree to abide by the following disclosure rules:
- To disclose the existence at the time of writing of a long or short position (including digital currencies, stocks, options or other instruments) in any asset mentioned in any User Submission (except for “Comments”). 
- You may not write about an asset with the intention to boost or reduce the asset's price and sell (or buy) the asset into the resulting strength or weakness. 
- If you intend at the time or writing to sell or buy an asset within three days of publication of a User Submission that discusses that stock, you must disclose this. 
- Abide by the following conflict of interest rule: You will disclose any material relationships with companies you write about in a User Submission or parties that stand to gain in any way from the viewpoint you are outlining. Examples: You must disclose if you are employed by a company who you are writing about; perform consulting for a company you write about; receive paid advertising revenue or any other form of sponsorship fee from a company you write about. This applies to narrow asset classes as well. For example, if you are paid to promote a digital currency exchange, that must be disclosed in any User Submission about that exchange. 
- If you choose an alias, be responsible for all statements made and acts or omissions that occur by use of your alias. 
- Waive any and all rights against TradeBlock and hold TB harmless in connection with any claims relating to any action taken by TB as part of its investigation of a suspected violation or result of its conclusion that a violation of these TOU has occurred, including but not limited to the removal of User Submission from the Site or a suspension or termination of your access to the Site. 
- Maintain and promptly update your registration data to keep it true, accurate, current and complete. 

You agree not to:

- Choose an alias that is threatening, abusive, offensive, harassing, derisive, defamatory, vulgar, obscene, libelous, hatefully, racially, ethnically or otherwise or objectionable. 
- Post or transmit any Content that you either know or should know is false, deceptive or misleading, or misrepresent or deceive others as to the source, accuracy, integrity or completeness of any comment you post. 
- Post or transmit any Content that is unlawful, harmful or injurious to others, contains software viruses, or other harmful computer code, files or programs, threatening, abusive, offensive, harassing, derisive, defamatory, vulgar, obscene, libelous, hatefully, racially, ethnically or otherwise tortious or objectionable. 
- Post or transmit any Content that does or may invade the privacy or violate or infringe on any rights of others, including, without limitation, copyrights and other intellectual property rights. 
- By use of your alias or in any comment, impersonate any person or entity, falsely or deceptively state, infer or otherwise misrepresent your affiliation with or connection to any person or entity. 
- Post or transmit any Content which, either the act of posting or the comment itself, you do not have a right to do under any law, regulation or order of any court, or as a result of an employment, contractual, fiduciary or other legal obligation or relationship. 
- Post or transmit any advertising, promotional materials, so called “chain letters,” “pyramid” or other schemes or invitations to participate in these or any other form of solicitation or promotion. 
- Post or transmit any non-public or otherwise restricted, confidential or proprietary information without authorization. 
- Violate any local, state, national or international law, regulation or order of any court, including but not limited to regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission or any rules of any exchanges. 
a. Responsibility for User Submission
Each individual who submits a User Submission, whether published on the Site or not, is solely responsible for her or his own acts, including the content, context or information in the User Submission he or she submits. This means that each individual, and not TB, is entirely responsible for anything and everything she or he posts on the Site. TB does not, and does not intend to, pre-screen any comments posted on its Site, and TB cannot and does not guarantee the accuracy, integrity or quality of anything that may appear on its Site.
b. Caveats
While we believe that the Site can and should be a positive environment for the exchange of information, you understand that the Site is open for posting to all users. Some individuals may post comments that may be offensive, indecent, objectionable, false, misleading or simply inappropriate.

TB encourages civil, thought-provoking debate and idea-sharing among investors and digital currency market followers. In order to maintain a level of discourse appropriate to our user base, we are strongly opposed to trolling, uncivilized discussion, mudslinging, inappropriate language, and blanket dismissal of others' ideas. We reserve the right, but have no obligation, to delete comments and block/delete accounts of users we believe, in our sole discretion, lower the level of discourse and courtesy we strive to engender.

Moderating decisions are subjective, and we strive to make them carefully and consistently. Due to the volume of content, we cannot review moderation decisions with users and cannot reverse decisions.

The Content available on the Site is intended to serve as a discussion center for thoughtful users who make their own investment decisions, with or without the help of a broker. The Site is not the place for alternative currency touters, cheerleaders or hypesters. We require all participants to disclose any positions they have in assets being discussed.

Without derogating from the above, TB editors, at their discretion, may refrain from posting or remove User Submissions that violate these standards or which are otherwise inappropriate. These standards are designed to promote credible, responsible, intelligent and informative dialogue. We cannot guarantee the credibility or honestly of users, and we cannot and will not monitor the veracity of names and positions or the Content of any posts. However, by setting out the above guidelines, we hope to raise the credibility of the discussion and foster a spirit of open, honest exchanges of information.

If an author has a business relationship with a company named in an article that he or she has authored, that relationship must be fully and accurately disclosed.

If you have any comments on our policies, or complaints or concerns of any kind about any posts, please contact us at support@tradeblock.com. We will do our best to review all of the information that you communicate to us, but we may not be able to take action or respond directly to each email.
c. Disclosure
We reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any User Submissions (whether published or not) or any other information we believe is reasonably necessary to (a) comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process, subpoena or governmental or regulatory request, (b) enforce these TOU, including investigation of potential violations of it, (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, (d) respond to user support requests, or (e) protect the rights, property or safety of TB, its users, yourself or the public. 
10. Disputes; Arbitration
If a Dispute (as defined below) of any kind arises, we want to understand and address your concerns quickly and to your satisfaction. Please contact us in the event of any Dispute. If we cannot resolve your concerns, we agree to an informal and inexpensive dispute resolution process requiring individual arbitration. For the purpose of this Agreement “Disputes” include any claim, controversy, or dispute (whether involving contract, tort, equitable, statutory, or any other legal theory) between you and TB including but not limited to any claims relating in any way to this Agreement (including its breach, termination, or interpretation), any other aspect of our relationship and any use of TB Content, software or services. “Disputes” also include any claims that arose before this Agreement and that may arise after termination of this Agreement.

You and TB agree to arbitrate all Disputes. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court and seeks to resolve disputes more quickly. Instead of a judge or a jury, the case will be decided by a neutral arbitrator who has the power to award the same damages and relief that a court can. ANY ARBITRATION UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL BE ONLY BE ON A INDIVIDUAL BASIS; CLASS ARBITRATIONS, CLASS ACTIONS, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTIONS, AND CONSOLIDATION WITH OTHER ARBITRATIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED, AND YOU ARE WAIVING YOUR RIGHTS TO HAVE YOUR CASE DECIDED BY A JURY AND TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION AGAINST TB. If any provision of this arbitration agreement is found unenforceable, the unenforceable provision shall be severed, and the remaining arbitration terms shall be enforced (but in no case shall there be a class arbitration). All Disputes shall be resolved finally and exclusively by binding individual arbitration with a single arbitrator administered by the American Arbitration Association (www.adr.org) or JAMS (www.jamsadr.org) according to this provision and the applicable arbitration rules for that forum. The Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16, fully applies. Unless otherwise required by law, any arbitration hearing will occur in New York, New York. The arbitrator’s award shall be binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. For any Dispute, TB will pay all the arbitration fees. If you prevail on any claim for which you are legally entitled to attorney’s fees, you may recover those fees from the arbitrator. For any claim where you are seeking relief, TB will not seek to have you pay its attorney’s fees, even if fees might otherwise be awarded, unless the arbitrator determines that your claim was frivolous.

George Washington law professor and economist praises Democrats for coming up with a message that preserves the partyâs commitment to social justice issues, rather than attempting to woo Trump voters by appealing to what Trump appealed to.

Announcing ECX: TradeBlock’s Ethereum Classic Index

Posted on
Jan 31, 2017

TradeBlock is pleased to announce the launch of the ECX Index, an institutional-quality reference rate for the USD-denominated price of Ethereum Classic.
TradeBlock’s ECX index is designed to provide a robust reference for Ethereum Classic by applying many methodologies similar to TradeBlock’s XBX Index, which has been widely adopted by institutional bitcoin markets.
The ECX index is based on trading activity observed on the leading Ethereum Classic exchanges to provide a real-time rate. The ECX index maximizes the replicability of its value in the live spot markets by weighting exchange data based on the venue’s liquidity and automatically de-weighting anomalistic trading in real time.
As is the case with the XBX index, TradeBlock uses the framework defined by IOSCO’s Principles for Financial Benchmarks for the calculation methodology and governance protocols of its ECX index. The ECX index includes markets that are liquid in both the ETC/USD & ETC/XBT crosses, incorporating the XBX index rate to offer a consolidated ETC/USD reference rate.
After experiencing substantial growth with their Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC), Grayscale Investments filed with the SEC on Jan 20, 2017 to list it on the New York Stock Exchange, formally positioning their product as an ETF that will track bitcoin’s price and will use XBX index as its reference rate. Grayscale Investments has also recently announced the launch of their next digital currency investment product, the Ethereum (ETC) Investment Trust (EIT), which will use TradeBlock’s ECX as the reference rate to determine Net Asset Value.

Over the coming weeks, tools to track ECX performance and related information will be made available on the public sections of TradeBlock’s website. Please reach out with any comments or suggestions.

                    involve substantial risk and are not suitable for all investors. Please read
                    Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options
                    prior to investing. Please read
                    Risk Disclosure for Security Futures Contracts
                    prior to investing in Single Stock Futures. Market volatility, volume and system
                    availability may delay account access and trade execution. Day trading is a high
                    risk, speculative trading strategy and is not suitable for all investors. For more
                    information on risks associated with day trading please read

                    ** TradingBlock Subaccounts allow a client to set up one or more subaccounts which
                    aggregate up to one account which is reported on that client's monthly account statement. The
                    Firm does NOT allow a "Master/Sub-Account" relationship whereby an owner of an account sets
                    up subaccounts for different owners. The firm requires one owner to set up subaccounts
                    within their account and we are required to verify the identity of that account owner.
