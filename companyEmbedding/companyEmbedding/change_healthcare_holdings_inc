We’re a dynamic organization that helps healthcare entities connect, transact and communicate. Our Intelligent Healthcare NetworkTM connects payers, providers, pharmacies and patients so they can more effectively and efficiently interact with each other. A lot of this is centered on helping providers and pharmacies get paid by payers and patients quickly and completely. On the flip side, for payers and patients, we help deliver their payments while helping them reduce their risk of overpaying.

In addition to helping all of the stakeholders in the care continuum move data from point A to point B, we also translate, edit and analyze that data when needed, and then help mine that wealth of information to improve healthcare through insights. We do all of this using a combination of technology and services.

If that sounds impressive, it should. If you are searching for a career where you can make a lasting impact on the lives, well-being and health of all Americans, Change Healthcare is the place for you. We invite you to take a look at all of our open positions to learn more about the skills we need.


In addition to what we do, it’s also important to talk about how we choose to do all of that. Cultivating a culture that is guided by our core values is also a top priority and these values are woven into the fabric of every aspect of our company.

Pharmacies
The healthcare industry is experiencing an unprecedented period of change driven by growth in specialty pharmacy, the shrinking of payer networks, migration of clinical services,  the shift to value based healthcare, the digitization of health information and an increasingly complex regulatory environment.  To capitalize on the opportunities created by these and other marketplace changes, pharmacies need new and strengthened capabilities that simplify the complex process to get paid, streamline eligibility verification, optimize claims and denials processes, identify underpayments, and support expansion of medical services in the pharmacy. Pharmacies therefore need a partner, now more than ever, who embraces these changes and can help them drive a successful business. 
Solutions Overview
Change Healthcare provides innovative tools to help improve patient care and drive efficiency.

Improve Operational Efficiency- Our high speed intelligent network provides the platform to automate claims and prescription processes that can streamline workflow and improve efficiency. Solutions are built to operate within existing pharmacy workflow and to be seamlessly available across the network. Flexible, on-demand tools offer ability to research, monitor, track and troubleshoot the process for maximum efficiency and productivity.
Optimize Reimbursement- Our real-time edit engine is designed to improve profitability by reducing submission errors and optimizing third-party reimbursements. Our industry-leading, real-time eligibility service can help save valuable personnel time and reduce claim denials. In addition, the ability to identify and resubmit claims that were paid based on outdated average wholesale pricing (AWP) can drive additional revenue.
Build Pharmacy Profitability and Customer Loyalty- We work together with you to deliver real-time, point-of-sale messaging and electronic voucher co-pay offset programs from pharmaceutical firms. These innovative programs can not only help drive revenue, but also improve customer satisfaction and loyalty.

Change Healthcare Launches Personalized Communications to Improve Consumer Payment Solutions
Feb 20 17
Change Healthcare has debuted Personalized Communications to expand the capabilities of its Receivables Advisor suite of SmartPay solutions. This new, expanded solution gives providers the ability to increase and accelerate patient collections with modern data science. Personalized Communications, a data-driven solution, identifies patients' preferred communications media to make it easier and more convenient for them to receive billing communications and make medical bill payments when, where and how they want ultimately leading to faster payments and, thus, increased collection rates for healthcare organizations. Rising patient financial responsibility and the increased prevalence of internet-enabled devices are driving providers to offer their patients a more familiar retail-like experience in patient communications and payment tools. In order to drive increased revenue cycle performance, providers need comprehensive, multi-channel communications solutions spanning diverse communication modes—including print, email, online, and mobile. With Personalized Communications, providers can orchestrate multiple communications options and outreach to patients in their preferred channel.


Change Healthcare Holdings, Inc. Announces Delivery of Conditional Notices of Redemption for All of its Outstanding 11.00% Senior Notes Due 2019, 11.25% Senior Notes Due 2020 and 6.00% Senior Notes Due 2021

McKesson and Change Healthcare Announce New Company Will Be Named Change Healthcare
January 05, 2017






SAN FRANCISCO & NASHVILLE, January 5, 2017 – McKesson Corporation, a leading global healthcare services and information technology company, and Change Healthcare Holdings, Inc., a leading provider of software and analytics, network solutions and technology-enabled services, today announced their planned name and brand decision with regard to the previously announced creation of a new healthcare information technology company. 
After a thorough strategic and creative review process, the companies have decided the name of the new company will be Change Healthcare. The company’s logo, brand positioning and visual identity will be completely new, reflecting the unification of the two organizations and the launch of a new company. The new brand will be unveiled in its entirety upon the close of the transaction, with a migration process to occur over the following 12 months. The entity will combine substantially all of Change Healthcare’s business and the majority of McKesson Technology Solutions.
“From day one, our intent has been to create a new company uniquely equipped to drive collaborative and positive change across the healthcare industry,” said John Hammergren, chairman and chief executive officer, McKesson Corporation, and previously announced chairman of the new company’s board. “After a thorough evaluation of potential names as well as customer and legal input, we came to the conclusion that ‘Change Healthcare’ best articulates the new company’s mission. It speaks directly to our clients who share our vision for a better healthcare system, and it reinforces the ambitions and spirit of our new company, our great potential and our transformative role in healthcare.”
Upon close, the new company will provide software and analytics, network solutions and technology-enabled services that will help customers obtain actionable insights, exchange mission-critical information, control costs, optimize revenue opportunities, increase cash flow and effectively navigate the shift to value-based healthcare. The new company will be well positioned to enable improved efficiencies and insights before, during and after patient encounters for all major stakeholders across the healthcare system, including commercial and governmental payers, employers, hospitals, physician practices and other providers, laboratories and consumers. 
“Today’s healthcare environment is constantly evolving,” said Neil de Crescenzo, president and chief executive officer, Change Healthcare, and previously announced CEO of the new company. “Our customers are seeking proactive ways to provide measurable impact as they navigate through those changes. The Change Healthcare name stood out from a myriad of choices to best communicate our ability to help customers and partners move forward in this ever-evolving landscape — and it captures the commitment of our team members to create a healthier future for our clients and consumers. I believe the opportunity to create an energizing new brand around a clear and distinct name will serve us well as we come together to bring to life the expansive and complementary capabilities of both companies.” 
The transaction remains subject to customary closing conditions and is expected to close in the first half of calendar year 2017.
