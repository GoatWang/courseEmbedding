			Frank L. Jaksch Jr.: Regaining trust in supplements		

Share this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window)Click to print (Opens in new window)By Frank L. Jaksch Jr. | February 19, 2015 at 2:18 amWhen New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman accused major retailers of selling fraudulent herbal supplements, consumers nationwide were thrown for a loop. Indeed, there have been questionable dietary supplements on the market in the past, but by such large and trusted brands? Many consumers find themselves wondering if the attorney general was accurate in his allegations, raising the question of whether they can continue to blindly trust these major retailers.
There has been a great deal of criticism about the testing method — DNA barcoding — used by the attorney general in his investigation. And in fact, this was a poor choice. DNA barcoding in and of itself is not flawed, but the method of testing needs to be appropriate for what is being tested. Would a physician perform a colonoscopy in order to diagnose arthritis?  
Botanicals in dietary supplements tend to exist in two forms: raw herbs or extracted botanicals. In order for DNA barcoding to work accurately, the DNA would need to be intact, as would be the case for raw herbs. However, with botanical powders, the DNA is more than likely compromised or even destroyed. How can DNA be tested if it is not present? In the case of botanical powders, DNA barcoding would be ineffective.
At least some of the products in the investigation were likely made from extracts. As such, the attorney general’s DNA assessment is partially correct, but not entirely, calling for microscopic analysis and validated chemical testing to achieve complete accuracy.
Much of the debate in the media seems to have taken the form of either black or white — either the attorney general was completely right or completely wrong. However, this is not the case. There is a great deal of gray here — while the method of testing did not identify ingredients that may have been present, this does not address the fact that certain substances found were not included on the labels. 
Thus, the fierce debate shouldn’t be over who is right and who is wrong. While accurately testing the products is ultimately important, as far as the consumer’s trust is concerned does it matter if the attorney general was 85 percent accurate or just 10 percent? The bottom line is that this investigation ultimately raised serious questions about the quality of dietary supplements. In order to regain consumer trust and provide top quality products as promised, the industry must use an attack such as the attorney general’s as a catalyst for change. The debate should lie in how.
What should that change be? Consumers should demand higher standards and the industry should deliver. To ensure high quality products and to ensure that the FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) are met, audits and inspections should be performed. Laboratory testing of ingredients and finished products should be implemented to confirm that they meet minimum testing requirements. The reality is that if a finished consumer product, even a well-tested one, was manufactured in a facility that is not FDA cGMP compliant, the product is adulterated. These are just some of the ways the industry can hold itself to higher standards for the sake of consumers.
The involvement of major retailers has the power to finally prompt the dietary supplement industry to take the needed steps to earn the lasting trust of consumers. As the investigation invades headlines across the nation, rather than firing back, the industry should use this opportunity to improve.
Frank L. Jaksch Jr. is the CEO of ChromaDex and is a member of the board of directors and chairman of the supply council for the Natural Products Association. He wrote this article for this newspaper.

Frank L. Jaksch Jr.: Regaining trust in supplements

When New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman accused major retailers of selling fraudulent herbal supplements, consumers nationwide were thrown for a loop. Indeed, there have been questionable dietary supplements on the market in the past, but by such large and trusted brands? Many consumers find themselves wondering if the attorney general was accurate in his allegations, raising the question of whether they can continue to blindly trust these major retailers.



There has been a great deal of criticism about the testing method -- DNA barcoding -- used by the attorney general in his investigation. And in fact, this was a poor choice. DNA barcoding in and of itself is not flawed, but the method of testing needs to be appropriate for what is being tested. Would a physician perform a colonoscopy in order to diagnose arthritis? 



Botanicals in dietary supplements tend to exist in two forms: raw herbs or extracted botanicals. In order for DNA barcoding to work accurately, the DNA would need to be intact, as would be the case for raw herbs. However, with botanical powders, the DNA is more than likely compromised or even destroyed. How can DNA be tested if it is not present? In the case of botanical powders, DNA barcoding would be ineffective.



At least some of the products in the investigation were likely made from extracts. As such, the attorney general's DNA assessment is partially correct, but not entirely, calling for microscopic analysis and validated chemical testing to achieve complete accuracy.

Much of the debate in the media seems to have taken the form of either black or white - either the attorney general was completely right or completely wrong. However, this is not the case. There is a great deal of gray here - while the method of testing did not identify ingredients that may have been present, this does not address the fact that certain substances found were not included on the labels. 



Thus, the fierce debate shouldn't be over who is right and who is wrong. While accurately testing the products is ultimately important, as far as the consumer's trust is concerned does it matter if the attorney general was 85 percent accurate or just 10 percent? The bottom line is that this investigation ultimately raised serious questions about the quality of dietary supplements. In order to regain consumer trust and provide top quality products as promised, the industry must use an attack such as the attorney general's as a catalyst for change. The debate should lie in how.



What should that change be? Consumers should demand higher standards and the industry should deliver. To ensure high quality products and to ensure that the FDA's current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) are met, audits and inspections should be performed. Laboratory testing of ingredients and finished products should be implemented to confirm that they meet minimum testing requirements. The reality is that if a finished consumer product, even a well-tested one, was manufactured in a facility that is not FDA cGMP compliant, the product is adulterated. These are just some of the ways the industry can hold itself to higher standards for the sake of consumers.



The involvement of major retailers has the power to finally prompt the dietary supplement industry to take the needed steps to earn the lasting trust of consumers. As the investigation invades headlines across the nation, rather than firing back, the industry should use this opportunity to improve.
