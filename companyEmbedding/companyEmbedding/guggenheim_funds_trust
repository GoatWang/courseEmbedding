NEW YORK, July  03, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Guggenheim Investments, the investment management division of Guggenheim Partners, today announced the distribution declarations for CurrencyShares® Australian Dollar Trust (NYSE:FXA). NYSE TickerFund NameDeclaration Date Ex-dividend DateRecord DatePayable Date/Share   Distribution FXA CurrencyShares Australian Dollar Trust 6.30.2017 7.3.2017 7.6.2017 7.11.2017 $0.05529          Distributions are made to shareholders on a pro-rata basis (in accordance with the number of shares that are owned) only in the event that the interest earned by the Trust exceeds the sum of the sponsor’s fee for the prior month plus other Trust expenses, if any. There is no guarantee that distributions will be made on a monthly basis. CurrencyShares® offer investors and institutions a convenient and cost-effective method of gaining investment benefits similar to that of holding foreign currencies, including potential diversification and hedging benefits. More details about the products are available at www.currencyshares.com. About Guggenheim Investments Guggenheim Investments is the global asset management and investment advisory division of Guggenheim Partners, with $217 billion1 in total assets across fixed income, equity, and alternative strategies. We focus on the return and risk needs of insurance companies, corporate and public pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, endowments and foundations, consultants, wealth managers, and high-net-worth investors. Our 275+ investment professionals perform rigorous research to understand market trends and identify undervalued opportunities in areas that are often complex and underfollowed. This approach to investment management has enabled us to deliver innovative strategies providing diversification opportunities and attractive long-term results. Diversification neither assures a profit nor eliminates the risk of experiencing investment losses. CurrencyShares are subject to risks similar to those of stocks and may not be suitable for all investors. The value of the shares of each CurrencyShares Trust relates directly to the value of the foreign currency held by the particular Trust. This creates a concentration risk associated with fluctuations in the price of the applicable foreign currency. Accordingly, a decline in the price of that currency will have an adverse effect on the value of the shares of the particular CurrencyShares Trust. Factors that may have the effect of causing a decline in the price of a foreign currency include national debt levels and trade deficits, domestic and foreign interest rates, investment and trading activities of institutions and global or regional political, economic or financial events and situations. Investors should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of these products carefully before investing. The prospectus pertaining to each product contains this and other information about the product. Please read the applicable prospectus, including the Risk Factors section, carefully before you invest. Shares can be bought and sold through a broker and the purchasers or sellers may have to pay brokerage commissions in connection with the transaction. Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate so that shares may be worth more or less than original cost. Shares may only be redeemed directly from the Trust by Authorized Participants via baskets (as defined in the prospectus). There can be no assurance that an active trading market for the shares will develop or be maintained. The CurrencyShares Trusts are not investment companies registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940. As a result the Trust(s) are not subject to the regulatory requirements of investment companies. The CurrencyShares® Australian Dollar Trust, CurrencyShares® British Pound Sterling Trust, CurrencyShares® Canadian Dollar Trust, CurrencyShares® Chinese Renminbi Trust, CurrencyShares® Euro Trust, CurrencyShares® Japanese Yen Trust, CurrencyShares® Singapore Dollar Trust,  CurrencyShares® Swiss Franc Trust and CurrencyShares® Swedish Krona Trust (each a “Trust” and collectively, the “Trusts”) has filed a registration statement (including a prospectus) with the SEC for the offerings to which this communication relates. Before you invest in the shares of a Trust, you should read the prospectus in the registration statement and other documents the Trust has filed with the SEC for more complete information about the Trust and its offering. You may get these documents for free by visiting EDGAR on the SEC web site at www.sec.gov. Alternatively, you may click the links above or the Trust will arrange to send you its prospectus if you request it by calling toll-free 800.820.0888. The CurrencyShares Trusts are distributed by Guggenheim Funds Distributors, LLC. Guggenheim Investments represents the investment management businesses of Guggenheim Partners, LLC (“Guggenheim”), which includes Security Investors, LLC (“SI”). Guggenheim Specialized Products, LLC (“GSP”), the Sponsor for the CurrencyShares Trusts, is a wholly owned subsidiary of SI.

Performance displayed represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results.  Investment return and principal value will fluctuate so that when shares of the CurrencyShares Trusts are redeemed, they may be worth more or less than original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted. Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. Performance results are short-term and may not provide an adequate basis for evaluating the performance potential of the product over varying market conditions or economic cycles. Prices shown are in U.S. Dollars unless otherwise noted. 



The Current Interest Rate accrues daily and pays out monthly for the respective currency's interest bearing account. The Current Interest Rate, set by the Depository, can fluctuate as frequently as daily to reflect the local overnight rate, market conditions and the Depository's liquidity needs. The 40 bps management fee charged by the sponsor will be paid out of interest earned and has not been accounted for in the Current Interest Rate stated above.
Interest earned by the trust, if any, will accrue daily and will be used to pay trust expenses. Any excess interest will be distributed to shareholders monthly. There is no assurance any interest will be paid, and if paid, may not be the best available.   If the trust’s expenses exceed interest earned, the trustee will withdraw the respective currency from the Trust to pay the excess, thereby reducing the amount of the currency represented by each share on an ongoing basis and may result in adverse tax consequences for shareholders.
 

Each of the CurrencyShares® Australian Dollar (FXA) Trust, CurrencyShares® British Pound Sterling (FXB) Trust, CurrencyShares® Canadian Dollar (FXC) Trust, CurrencyShares® Chinese Renminbi (FXCH) Trust, CurrencyShares® Euro (FXE) Trust, CurrencyShares® Japanese Yen (FXY) Trust, CurrencyShares® Singapore Dollar (FXSG) Trust, CurrencyShares® Swedish Krona (FXS) Trust and CurrencyShares® Swiss Franc (FXF) Trust (each a “Trust” and collectively, the “Trusts”) has filed a registration statement (including a prospectus) with the SEC for the offerings to which this communication relates. Before you invest in the shares of a Trust, you should read the prospectus in the registration statement and other documents the Trust has filed with the SEC for more complete information about the Trust and its offering. You may get these documents for free by visiting EDGAR on the SEC web site at www.sec.gov. Alternatively, you may click the links above or the Trust will arrange to send you its prospectus if you request it by calling toll-free 800.820.0888.

The CurrencyShares Trusts are not registered as investment companies under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and shareholders do not have the same regulatory protections afforded to investors in registered investment companies.

The value of the shares of each CurrencyShares Trust relates directly to the value of the foreign currency held by the particular Trust.  This creates a concentration risk associated with fluctuations in the price of the applicable foreign currency.  Accordingly, a decline in the price of that currency will have an adverse effect on the value of the shares of the particular CurrencyShares Trust.  Factors that may have the effect  of causing a decline in the price of a foreign currency include national  debt levels and trade deficits, domestic and foreign inflation rates, investment and trading activities  of institutions and global or regional political, economic or financial events and situations. Shares of each CurrencyShares Trust are also subject to risks similar to those of stocks and may not be suitable for all investors. 

This website is directed to and intended for use by citizens or residents of the United States of America only. The material provided on this website is not intended as a recommendation or as investment advice of any kind, including in connection with rollovers, transfers, and distributions. Such material is not provided in a fiduciary capacity, may not be relied upon for or in connection with the making of investment decisions, and does not constitute a solicitation of an offer to buy or sell securities. All content has been provided for informational or educational purposes only and is not intended to be and should not be construed as legal or tax advice and/or a legal opinion. Always consult a financial, tax and/or legal professional regarding your specific situation. Investing involves risk, including the possible loss of principal.

The information on this web site is for informational purposes only and is not, and is not intended to be, a complete discussion of all material information you should know about the CurrencyShares Trusts. 


CurrencyShares® are subject to risks similar to those of stocks and may not be suitable for all investors. The value of the shares of each CurrencyShares Trust relates directly to the value of the foreign currency held by the particular Trust. This creates a concentration risk associated with fluctuations in the price of the applicable foreign currency. Accordingly, a decline in the price of that currency will have an adverse effect on the value of the shares of the particular CurrencyShares Trust. Factors that may have the effect of causing a decline in the price of a foreign currency include national debt levels and trade deficits, domestic and foreign interest rates, investment and trading activities of institutions and global or regional political, economic or financial events and situations. Investors should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of these products carefully before investing. The prospectus pertaining to each product contains this and other information about the product. Please read the applicable prospectus, including the Risk Factors section, carefully before you invest. Shares can be bought and sold through a broker and the purchasers or sellers may have to pay brokerage commissions in connection with the transaction. Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate so that shares may be worth more or less than original cost. Shares may only be redeemed directly from the Trust by Authorized Participants via baskets (as defined in the prospectus). There can be no assurance that an active trading market for the shares will develop or be maintained. 


Shares of each CurrencyShares Trust can be bought and sold through a broker; as such, investors may be required to pay brokerage commissions in connection with a purchase or sale. There can be no assurance that an active trading market for the shares of any CurrencyShares Trust will develop or be maintained. The risks associated with each of the CurrencyShares Trusts are not identical because of differences in the economies underlying each CurrencyShares Trust, as well as other considerations. For a more complete discussion of risk factors applicable to each CurrencyShares Trust, carefully read the particular Trust's prospectus.
      
        Interest earned on the deposited currency, if any, will be used to pay the Trust's expenses. Any excess interest will be distributed to Shareholders monthly. Such interest is not expected to form a significant part of the Shareholders' investment return. If the Trust's expenses exceed interest earned, the Trustee will withdraw respective currency held by the Trust to pay the excess, thereby reducing the number of currency per Share. This may result in adverse tax consequences for shareholders.  

        The NAV and Market Close performance may differ. A major reason for the difference is that timing discrepancies can exist between the NAV, which is calculated using WM/Reuters Closing Spot Rate and Market Close, which is calculated using Closing Price (last trade). WM/Reuters Closing Spot Rate is the exchange rate of the U.S. Dollar and the applicable foreign currency as determined by WM/Reuters as of 4:00 PM London time.   

        NAV is calculated using WM/Reuters Closing Spot Rate. WM/Reuters Closing Spot Rate is the exchange rate of the U.S. Dollar and the applicable foreign currency as determined by WM/Reuters as of 4:00 PM London time. Prior to 11/13/2008, NAVs for each CurrencyShares Trust, except the CurrencyShares Russian Ruble Trust and the CurrencyShares Chinese Renminbi Trusts, were calculated using the Noon Buying Rate, as determined by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. For more information, please read the prospectus.  

      The WM/Reuters Closing Spot rates are provided by WM/Reuters and are used for certain currencies (the “Rates”) displayed herein. WM/Reuters shall not be liable for any errors in or delays in providing or making available the WM/Reuters Closing Spot rates, nor for any actions taken in reliance on the same. This information cannot be used, reproduced, distributed, redistributed, licensed or disclosed in any way without a written agreement with WM/Reuters. 

      Spot Prices provided by FactSet. No warranty is given for the accuracy of these prices and no liability is accepted for reliance thereon. Prices are provided on a reasonable efforts basis and delays may occur both because of the delay in third parties communicating the information to the site and because of delays inherent in posting information over the Internet. Prices shown are indicative only and do not represent actionable quotations on prices of actual trades.

1 The "offer" price represents the net asset value of one unit of a trust plus a transactional sales charge, if applicable.
2 The "bid" price represents the net asset value of one unit of a trust excluding deferred sales charge, if applicable.
3 The "liquidation" price represents the net asset value of one unit of a trust and includes any front-end and deferred sales charges, if applicable, accounted for if investors liquidate units.
4 Estimated Annual Income per Unit is computed by dividing the estimated annual income of the underlying bonds by the number of units outstanding. The amount may be lower or greater than the above-stated amount due to certain factors that may include, but are not limited to, the selling of bonds to pay for the deferred sales charge, a change in Trust expenses or the sale or maturity of securities in the portfolio. Fees and expenses of the Trust may vary as a result of a variety of factors including the Trust's size, redemption activity, brokerage and other transaction costs and extraordinary expenses.
5 ECR is computed by dividing the estimated net annual interest income per unit by the public offering price. ELTR is calculated using a formula that (i) takes into consideration, and determines and factors in the relative weightings of, the market values, yields (taking into account the amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts) and estimated retirements of all the bonds in the trust and (ii) takes into account the expenses and sales charge associated with each unit of the trust. Therefore, there is no assurance that the ECR and ELTR will be realized in the future.
6 The Historical Annual Dividend Distribution is as of date of deposit. The amount of distributions of the Trust may be lower or greater than the above-stated amount due to certain factors that may include, but are not limited to, a change in the dividends paid by issuers, a change in Trust expenses or the sale or maturity of securities in the portfolio. Fees and expenses of the Trust may vary as a result of a variety of factors including the Trust's size, redemption activity, brokerage and other transaction costs and extraordinary expenses.
† Anticipated date of deposit. Information contained herein and in the preliminary prospectus is subject to completion or amendment. A registration statement relating to these securities has been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, but has not yet become effective. These securities may not be sold nor may offers to buy be accepted prior to the time the registration statement becomes effective. This communication shall not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of any offer to buy; nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any state in which such offer, solicitation, or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state.
Past performance does not guarantee future results. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate with changes in market conditions. Investors units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.

Guggenheim Investments ETFs may not be suitable for all investors. • Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate so that when shares are redeemed, they may be worth more or less than original cost. Most investors will also incur customary brokerage commissions when buying or selling shares of an ETF. • Investments in securities and derivatives, in general, are subject to market risks that may cause their prices to fluctuate over time. • ETF Shares may trade below their net asset value ("NAV"). The NAV of shares will fluctuate with changes in the market value of an ETF's holdings. In addition, there can be no assurance that an active trading market for shares will develop or be maintained. • Please review a prospectus carefully for more information of the risks associated with each ETF.

Index Methodology

For example, the index includes companies engaged in the production of forest products, paper products and paper packaging products.

Forest Products (GICS® Code - 15105010)
Paper Products (GICS® Code - 15105020)

 Risks and Other Considerations


Performance displayed represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate so that when shares are redeemed, they may be worth more or less than original cost. Total returns reflect the reinvestment of all dividends. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted. For up-to-date fund performance, including performance current to the most recent month-end, please visit the ETF performance page.  ETFs are subject to third party transaction fees/commissions. Net asset value (NAV) is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from total assets, then dividing by the number of shares outstanding. Market close is the last price at which shares are traded. Fund shares may trade at, above or below NAV. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus.
Performance results for periods under one year are short - term and may not provide an adequate basis for evaluating the performance potential of the fund over varying market conditions or economic cycles.
Risk Considerations Investors should consider the following risk factors and special considerations associated with investing in the fund, which may cause you to lose money, including the entire principal amount that you invest. Equity Risk: The value of the equity securities held by the fund will fall due to general market and economic conditions, perceptions regarding the industries in which the issuers of securities held by the fund participate, or factors relating to specific companies in which the fund invests. Global Timber Industry Risk: As the Index is comprised of issuers in the global timber industry, the fund is therefore focused in that industry. Accordingly, the fund may be subject to more risks than if it were broadly diversified over numerous industries and sectors of the economy. The market value of securities of global timber companies may be affected by numerous factors, including events occurring in nature and international politics. The volume and value of timber that can be harvested from timberlands may be limited by natural disasters and other events. In periods of poor logging conditions, global timber companies may harvest less timber than expected. Global timber companies involved in the forest, paper and packaging products industries are highly competitive globally, and no single company is dominant. These industries have suffered, and continue to suffer, from excess capacity. Global timber companies are subject to many federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. Foreign Investment Risk: The fund’s investments in non-U.S. issuers, although generally limited to ADRs, may involve unique risks compared to investing in securities of U.S. issuers, including less market liquidity, generally greater market volatility than U.S. securities, and less complete financial information than for U.S. issuers. Small- and Medium-Sized Company Risk: Investing in securities of small- and medium-sized companies involves greater risk than is customarily associated with investing in larger, more established companies. In addition, the funds are subject to: Non-correlation risk, Replication Management Risk, Issuer-Specific Changes and Non-Diversified Fund Risk. Please read the prospectus for more detailed Information regarding these and other risks.
Fund data is subject to change on a daily basis.
Composition is subject to change. Information provided is for illustration purposes only and may not reflect current investments by the fund. Referenced companies are not affiliated with Guggenheim Investments and Guggenheim Investments does not sponsor, endorse, sell or promote the referenced companies.

*The Morningstar Rating for funds, or “star rating”, is calculated for managed products with at least a three-year history and does not include the effect of sales charges. Exchange-traded funds and open-end mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics.

Index Methodology


                            The Index selection methodology is designed to provide exposure to high yielding Canadian securities in the energy sector that meet size and liquidity requirements. Securities must be part of the S&P/TSX Composite Index (the “Composite”), which is designed to provide a broad market measure of the Canadian equity markets. The Composite includes common stocks and income trust units listed on the TSX and are companies that are Canadian incorporated (established in the case of income trusts, or formed in the case of limited partnerships) under Canadian federal, provincial or territorial jurisdictions. Liquidity is measured by float turnover (total number of shares traded in Canadian markets in the previous 12 months divided by float eligible shares outstanding at the end of the period). Securities that are ineligible for inclusion in the Composite include securities issued by mutual funds, preferred shares, exchangeable shares, warrants, installment receipts and “paper-clipped” or “stapled” securities.
                        





Index Construction


Sustainable Canadian Energy Income Index

Canadian Energy Exposure. Securities must be classified as part of the GICS Energy Sector.
Market Capitalization. Securities must have float adjusted market capitalization of $150 million (Canadian dollars) and above as of the reference date.
Liquidity. Securities must have three-month average daily value traded of $1 million (Canadian dollars) or higher as of the reference date.
Dividend Yield. At each rebalance, the indicated annual 12-month dividend yield of each security is computed. Securities which meet the prior criteria and have yields higher than 2% form the Index. Current constituents will not be dropped from the Index unless the indicated dividend yield drops below 1.5%.
Target Weights. The Index is weighted by float adjusted market capitalization subject to a maximum of weight of 5% for each stock. The caps are established at the quarterly rebalancing and are not revised until the next quarterly rebalancing.
Rebalancing. Additions are done at each quarterly rebalancing, consistent with the rebalancing of the Composite. Securities are deleted either at the quarterly rebalancing or if a stock is removed from the Composite between rebalancings, it is removed from the Index at the same time. The Index is rebalanced on a quarterly basis. Changes are effective after the close of the third Friday following applicable reference date. The reference dates are the last trading day of March, June, September and December. All index adjustments and corporate action treatments correspond to actions taken regarding the applicable securities in the Composite.







 Risks and Other Considerations


Performance displayed represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate so that when shares are redeemed, they may be worth more or less than original cost. Total returns reflect the reinvestment of all dividends. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted. For up-to-date fund performance, including performance current to the most recent month-end, please visit the ETF performance page.  ETFs are subject to third party transaction fees/commissions. Net asset value (NAV) is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from total assets, then dividing by the number of shares outstanding. Market close is the last price at which shares are traded. Fund shares may trade at, above or below NAV. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus.
Performance results for periods under one year are short - term and may not provide an adequate basis for evaluating the performance potential of the fund over varying market conditions or economic cycles.
Risk Considerations Investors should consider the following risk factors and special considerations associated with investing in the fund, which may cause you to lose money, including the entire principal amount that you invest. Equity Risk: The value of the equity securities held by the fund will fall due to general market and economic conditions, perceptions regarding the industries in which the issuers of securities held by the Fund participate, or factors relating to specific companies in which the Fund invests. For example, an adverse event, such as an unfavorable earnings report, may depress the value of equity securities of an issuer held by the Fund; the price of common stock of an issuer may be particularly sensitive to general movements in the stock market; or a drop in the stock market may depress the price of most or all of the common stocks and other equity securities held by the Fund. In addition, common stock of an issuer in the Fund’s portfolio may decline in price if the issuer fails to make anticipated dividend payments because the issuer of the security experiences a decline in its financial condition. Common stock is subordinated to preferred stocks, bonds and other debt instruments in a company’s capital structure, in terms of priority to corporate income, and therefore will be subject to greater dividend risk than preferred stocks or debt instruments of such issuers. In addition, while broad market measures of common stocks have historically generated higher average returns than fixed income securities, common stocks have also experienced significantly more volatility in those returns. Energy Sector Risk: The profitability of companies in the energy sector is related to worldwide energy prices, exploration, and production spending. Such companies also are subject to risks of changes in exchange rates, government regulation, world events, depletion of resources and economic conditions, as well as market, economic and political risks of the countries where energy companies are located or do business. Oil and gas exploration and production can be significantly affected by natural disasters. Oil exploration and production companies may be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates, interest rates, government regulation, world events, and economic conditions. Oil exploration and production companies may be at risk for environmental damage claims. Foreign Investment Risk: The Fund’s investments in non-U.S. issuers may involve unique risks compared to investing in securities of U.S. issuers, including less market liquidity, generally greater market volatility than U.S. securities and less complete financial information than for U.S. issuers. In addition, adverse political, economic, or social developments could undermine the value of the Fund’s investments or prevent the Fund from realizing the full value of its investments. Financial reporting standards for companies based in foreign markets differ from those in the United States. Finally, the value of the currency of the country in which the Fund has invested could decline relative to the value of the U.S. dollar, which may affect the value of the investment to U.S. investors. The Fund will not enter into transactions to hedge against declines in the value of the Fund’s assets that are denominated in a foreign currency. Canadian Risk: As the Fund invests in Canadian royalty trusts and stocks listed on the TSX, the Fund is subject to the following risks: Commodity Exposure Risk. The Canadian economy is very dependent on the demand for, and supply and price of, natural resources. The Canadian market is relatively concentrated in issuers involved in the production and distribution of natural resources. There is a risk that any changes in these sectors could have an adverse impact on the Canadian economy. Reliance on Exports Risk. The Canadian economy is dependent on the economies of the United States as a key trading partner. Reduction in spending on Canadian products and services or changes in the U.S. economy may cause an impact in the Canadian economy. Canadian Royalty Trust Risk: Investing in Canadian royalty trusts is subject to the following risks: Lack of Diversification. The royalty trusts in which the fund invests are heavily invested in oil and gas. Potential Sacrifice of Growth. Potential growth may be sacrificed because revenue is passed on to a royalty trust’s unit holders (such as the fund), rather than reinvested in the business. No Guarantees. Royalty trusts generally do not guarantee minimum distributions or even return of capital. If the assets underlying a royalty trust do not perform as expected, the royalty trust may reduce or even eliminate distributions. The declaration of such distributions generally depends upon various factors, including the operating performance and financial condition of the royalty trust and general economic conditions. Potential for Tax Re-characterization or Changes. Under amendments to the Income Tax Act (Canada) passed in 2007 (the “SIFT Rules”), certain trusts (defined as “SIFT trusts”) are taxable on certain income and gains on a basis similar to that which applies to a corporation, with the result that tax efficiencies formerly available in respect of an investment in the trust may cease to be available. A royalty trust may be a SIFT trust. In addition, as a result of the SIFT Rules, some trusts may undertake reorganization transactions, the costs of which may affect the return earned on an investment in the trust. After any such conversion, tax efficiencies that were formerly available in respect of an investment in the trust may cease to be available. Accordingly, the SIFT Rules have had and may continue to have an effect on the trading price of investments in royalty trusts, and consequently could Impact the value of shares of the fund. U.S. Economic Risk: The Canadian economy may be significantly affected by the U.S. economy, given that the United States is Canada’s largest trading partner and foreign investor. Since the implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in 1994, total two-way merchandise trade between the United States and Canada has more than doubled. To further this relationship, all three NAFTA countries entered into the Security and Prosperity Partnership of North America in March 2005, which addressed economic and security related issues. The new agreement may further affect Canada’s dependency on the U.S. economy. Structural Risk (Political Risk): In addition, past periodic demands by the Province of Quebec for sovereignty have significantly affected equity valuations and foreign currency movements in the Canadian market. In addition the funds are subject to: Small and Medium-Sized Company Risk, Non-correlation risk, Passive Management Risk, Issuer-Specific Changes and Non-Diversified Fund Risk. Please read the prospectus for more detailed regarding these and other risks.

MUFG Investor Services has agreed to acquire Rydex Fund Services, a mutual fund administration business, from Guggenheim Investments. No financial terms were disclosed for a deal that’s expected to close in the fourth quarter of this year.
PRESS RELEASE
New York, 28 July – MUFG Investor Services, the global asset servicing group of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, and Guggenheim Investments, the global asset management and investment advisory business of Guggenheim Partners, today announced that they have entered into an agreement in which MUFG Investor Services will acquire Guggenheim’s 1940-Act mutual fund administration business, Rydex Fund Services. The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2016, subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions.
When consummated the deal will complete MUFG Investor Services’ full service offering for investment managers, adding regulated 1940 Act mutual fund and exchange traded fund services expertise to a comprehensive service proposition, which spans single manager, fund of hedge fund, private equity and real estate funds, pension funds and traditional asset managers.

This deal will add capabilities which will allow us to respond more dynamically to our clients’ changing needs, enabling them to fully realize new market opportunities and support their growth ambitions.”
John Sergides, Managing Director, Global Head, Business Development and Marketing, MUFG Investor Services, said: “Demand for liquid alternative strategies has risen significantly in recent years as retail investors recognize the return potential and diversification benefits relative to traditional asset classes. Alternative fund managers are increasingly establishing ‘40-Act fund structures to access this growing market. We recognize the challenging environment our clients face and continue to enhance our offering to support the strategies that managers must deliver, both now and in the future. Our complete offering will allow us to become the partner of choice for alternative fund managers of all sizes, strategies and structures.”
