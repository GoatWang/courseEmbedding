To some extent it builds up in the hair but since it is still not particularly long lasting and brushes out, daily use is required for consistent coverage.  You may also find that some experimentation is needed for effective application.  These are two methods that I find work best:1.) Use upward sweeps with short and long strokes starting near the roots.2.) Apply fully retracted tapping on one particular spot for coverage, then use applicator (still retracted) in a brushing motion with short strokes.With practice, I have been able to minimize the amount of powder that gets on the face and scalp.Added Remarks:I noticed that other reviews indicated that Jonathan Product Root Touch-Up is more adhesive than has been my experience.  I'm thinking the difference in outcome depends upon hair texture.Read more0Comment|

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsgreat product!ByJenHon April 17, 2013Verified PurchaseI was pleasantly surprised at how well this product covers my gray roots. I figured a powder would not stick very well, but it does. Of course it looks a bit chalky and it doesn't replace dyeing by any means, but in a pinch it can help carry you through until you can get a real touch-up. I think the dispenser (the powder shakes out through the bristles) is very easy to use with no mess.Read more0Comment|

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse2.0 out of 5 starsUh, lets be real -- you get the ILLUSION of a touch-up by coloring the SCALP, not the hair. Messy, migrating powder formulaBynycgirlTOP 500 REVIEWERon April 23, 2014Dry powder, by nature, does not stick well to dry hair. Instead, it sticks to the moist/oily scalp underneath, so that large surface area appears dark. Therefore any white/grey roots against the dark base, will reflect less light and look darker by mere refraction theory.  Look closely and the roots are still there, just sheerly veiled by the matching scalp color.In so, this powder color is not superior to a cream-based emulsion (i.e. hair mascara). A hair mascara would cover up the actual roots and set to a transfer-resistant finish. Loose powder, on the other hand, is not bound by anything to hold it together. The bristles splay loose powder everywhere and it got on my face, dresser, and clothes. Why buy a product that you have to do prep over the sink? Because the color is so pigmented, it is difficult to remove from the aforementioned surfaces. Later on in the day, i pushed my sunglasses over my head, only to discover it picked up the powder -- when i put back on the sunglasses, i had "dark circles", literally around each eye! And if you're wearing a white tee---forget it.A hair mascara that is cream-based is a better option to this messy, migrating loose powder. Save your money and dry-cleaning bill.Read more11 comment|

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsAmazing product for thinning hair!ByBobbi Bonneron October 26, 2016Excellent product!  I have had thin hair my whole life. I am 54 years old and have always seen my scalp through my hair. You have to practice with this to learn how to apply it but once you get it down it works great!  I didn't realize until a couple of weeks after I had it that the middle of the tube slides up to close over the brush and allow for you to put the cap on. This does make your hair feel dirty if you try to run your fingers through your hair but it also makes you feel like you have more hair. I used to have to wash my hair every day but now I wash it every other day and could possibly go longer. This product has changed my life. I'm no longer self conscious if I am under a light or if the wind is blowing. I will never be without it if I can help itRead more0Comment|

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse2.0 out of 5 starsyou end up pulling off the cap at the bottom and shooting brown powder all over your bathroom like a cannonByM. Leeon May 24, 2017Verified PurchaseTwo things they really need to improve. Stiffer bristles so that you have control over brushing your hairline...otherwise you are basically covering your forehead with brown powder. And two, the packaging is awful. You have to slide the plastic tube up around the brush in order to put the cap back on. This makes sense EXCEPT for the fact that the bottom of the tube comes off...so when you are holding on to the base, and pulling up, you end up pulling off the cap at the bottom and shooting brown powder all over your bathroom like a cannon. It's hard to explain but believe me, you do not want to clean this up. Once you get the product on, it basically does the trick. Although I wish it was a slightly darker brown. For my hair, not the bathroom wall...Read more0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsI will never not own this!ByKate Good-Smithon April 5, 2013Verified PurchaseI have always had fine hair and now it is thinning too!  It is dark and so the contrast between hair and scalp is pretty obvious.  This stuff does the trick perfectly.  It also thickens the hair just a bit.  It takes some practice but well worth it.  I can see that it would work as a root cover up as well.Read more11 comment|

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse4.0 out of 5 starsGood enough product to justify the priceByAlabama Teacheron April 28, 2015Verified PurchaseThis product was okay. I must fully disclose that I have chestnut dyed hair, but my roots are practically silver. Having said that, it doesn't darken as much as I'd hoped, but then again, maybe nothing short of road tar will darken my gray! Also, be aware before buying that it leaves a slightly sticky feeling on your roots. It's not uncomfortable and only noticeable when you actually run your fingers through it (meaning you can't feel it on your scalp), and that you'll have to wash it out to get rid of it. The color lasted between washes, so it's really on there!Read more0Comment|

                    FDACS/UF-IFAS Florida Farm to School Partnership | Watson, Jonathan A | Horticultural Sciences |  Treadwell, Danielle | Nutrition Professionals and Paraprofessionals | Small Farms  A Farm to School Procurement Calculator for Specialty Crop Producers and School Food Service Staff1Jonathan A. Watson, Danielle Treadwell, Anna Prizzia, and Kelli Brew2Introduction
Florida Farm to School programs are designed to connect producers with schools (K–12). Schools purchase farm-fresh foods, particularly fresh fruits and vegetables, and incorporate those items in their menus. The objectives of Farm to School programs are to serve healthy meals in school cafeterias; improve student nutrition; provide agriculture, health, and nutrition education; and support Florida producers. Undoubtedly, Farm to School programs will vary by state, region, or even county due to an area’s size, production capabilities, seasonality, and volume requirements. As a result, distribution models may vary in order to successfully connect local farms with schools. However, regardless of these differences, local farms and schools must be able to easily and effectively communicate their production capabilities and serving requirements in terms of volume and price.Producers and school food service staff need tools that will help them through the Farm to School procurement process. Decisions about quantity and price in regards to production volume and school food servings are of particular interest to participants in the Farm to School distribution model. However, producers and school food service staff do not sell or buy products in the same units. When school food service staff make their purchasing decisions, they speak in terms of servings whereas producers pack their products by weight in a wide variety of container sizes, depending on the commodity or the needs of their customers. Producers typically pack their products in the fields or in packing sheds located near their point of production. While there are general calculators and guides designed for national Farm to School programs, there are few resources designed specifically for Florida’s diverse production of fresh fruits and vegetables. This publication serves as a procurement calculator and guide for producers and schools that participate in Florida Farm to School programs. To download the calculator please click the following link: F2S Procurement Calculator.Literature Review
Farm to School Programs have existed for a relatively short period of time. In 1996 and 1997, the first Farm to School pilot programs were established in California (Santa Monica-Malibu USD and The Edible Schoolyard, Berkeley) and Florida (New North Florida Marketing Cooperative). In 2004, the National Farm to School Program was authorized in-statute although it has yet to receive federal funding. As of 2008, Farm Bill legislation successfully passed, allowing food service directors to preference local products (Farm to School Chronology 2013).As previously stated, there are general guides and calculators to help producers and schools effectively communicate their production capabilities and serving requirements. Researchers at Oklahoma State University developed a produce calculator template for determining the pounds of produce needed for a 1/4 or 3/8 cup servings (Holcomb and Vo 2013). While this tool provides the user with a general framework for purchasing typical commodities found in schools nationally, it does not consider products specific to the state of Florida. The tool is also limited in the information it provides the user. While it does give the user weight requirements in terms pounds needed for a given amount of servings, it does not provide the user with specific information such as field pack unit size, gross package weight, and unit and total cost.Methodology
This calculator is designed to aid producers and school food staff in the procurement process of fresh fruits and vegetables for Farm to School programs. Produce purchased in bulk directly from farms typically is packed in a variety of wholesale formats and with minimal processing, depending on the customer's needs and the desired commodity. School food staff are concerned with feeding children and per-meal cash reimbursements provided by the USDA, both of which depend on the number of servings. This calculator is intended to provide producers and school food staff with a variety of information required when making food purchases for Farm to School Programs. Users can quickly calculate useful information such as net weight of as purchased product and its edible portions. The user can also identify the number of servings per unit (1/4, 1/2, and 1 cup servings), AP servings, price per serving and per pound, the cost per commodity, and total cost.Definitions
Commodity—A raw material or primary agricultural product that can be bought and sold.Unit—A quantity chosen as a standard in terms of which other quantities may be expressed.Serving—A quantity of food suitable for or served to one person.As Purchased (AP)—Used to cost an ingredient at the purchase price before any trim or waste is taken into account.Edible Portion (EP)—Used to cost an ingredient after trimming and removing waste so that only the usable portion of the item is reflected.Net Weight—Refers to the weight of the product alone, discounting the weight of its container or packaging.Gross Weight—Refers to the total weight of a product and its packaging.Percentage Trim—Ratio of inedible portions to commodity as purchased.How To Use
It is the hope of the authors that users will find this calculator intuitive to use. The following steps show how to use the calculator:Step 1: Enter the quantity of units as purchased in the Number of Units AP column (Column C).Step 2: Enter the current wholesale market price for a given Unit Cost (Column D).Step 3: Review the information.Once Steps 1 and 2 have been completed, the calculator will automatically update the spreadsheet and provide the user with information such as servings per unit, servings as purchased, cost per serving, cost per pound, commodity cost, and the total commodity cost. The conversion factor values for this calculator were found in the USDA’s Food Buying Guide for Child Nutrition Programs. This value converts the amount of product in pounds as purchased (AP) to the amount of edible portions (EP) in pounds. A list of the commodities and their conversion factors as well as additional information such as the net weight of edible portions, percentage trim, number of units per hundredweight and servings per pound EP is provided in Table 1.Equations
The equations below explain how the various calculations were performed in the spreadsheet and for the additional descriptive information for each of the commodities. Number of Units per Hundredweight = 100 / (Net Weight AP)  Servings per Unit = Net Weight AP * Servings per Pound EPServings AP = Number of Units AP * Servings per UnitNet Weight EP = Estimated Net Weight AP * AP – to – EP Conversion FactorCost per Pound = (Total Cost) / (Number of Units AP * Estimated Net Weight AP)Cost per Serving =  (Unit Cost) / (Servings per Unit)Percentage Trim = 1 – Conversion FactorReferences

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
