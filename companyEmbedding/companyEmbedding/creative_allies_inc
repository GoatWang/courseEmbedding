The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

"Creative Allies is amazing. They give you the opportunity to create artwork for huge bands and shows. As a freelance or independent designer, it's a dream come true, nothing is stopping you from getting your work out there and
                            getting noticed."
- Sean McCauley (Winner of the MacGyver T-shirt Design Contest)




"Thanks again to Creative Allies for giving designers like me the chance to work with our favorite bands and brands. I'm very appreciative and if there's anything else I can do to help spread the Creative Allies message, please
                            let me know. I really believe in what you guys do!"
- Daniel Sulzberg (Winner of the Dirty Heads contest)




"I think CreativeAllies is a cool thing! They offer a great opportunity for "to be" artists and designers as well as established professionals to show their skills, create unique artworks for their favourite bands, increase awareness
                            and popularity of their work and eventually gain a profit from one of the various interesting contests held. Browsing through the entries to the contests of CreativeAllies is also a nice source of inspiration."
