Background

This educational symposium will examine the global environment from the Special Operations Forces perspective. Special Operations Forces (SOF) have not seen a more complex, rapidly evolving, and fractured international system since the end of the Cold War. Transregional issues that continue to unfold in the developing world are further exacerbated by political tensions between developed nations in an increasingly multipolar international system.

 

In the coming decade, SOF must develop the strategies and capabilities needed to maintain a decisive advantage against threats that employ conventional military aggression, irregular warfare, and criminal enterprise elements to achieve their self-stated goals and objectives. This Symposium will explore SOF’s efforts to suppress violent non-state actors, as well as address the growing political tensions that have emerged as countries become more aggressive in asserting their influence. This year’s event will also reflect on lessons learned in the Middle East, providing a specific focus on identifying new ways to counter dynamic and resilient threats in complex operating environments.

Operating Guidance for Government Attendees

DSI’s Symposium directly supports DoD, Military Services, and federal priorities by providing a conduit for officials to efficiently reach audiences outside of their respective offices that directly impact their department's mission success, at no charge to the government, and in an efficient expenditure of time.

 

DSI’s Symposium will provide a forum to address and improve internal and external initiatives, meet with and hear from partner organizations, disseminate vital capability requirements to industry, increase visibility within the larger community, and generally support their mission.

 

The Symposium is open and complimentary to all DoD and Federal employees and is considered an educational and training forum.
(Industry and academia members are charged a fee for admission)
