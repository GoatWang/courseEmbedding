P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades. Our calculations are based on comprehensive, delayed quotes.      Stock Money Flow    Uptick/Downtick Trade Ratio  0 2    0.92      Net Money Flow ($)  -16,543    Money flow gives a snapshot of relative buying and selling pressure in a stock.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The three scores are based on the trading styles of Growth, Value, and Momentum.


Growth Score
A


Value Score
A


Momentum Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B.

The selling stockholder is selling all of the shares of our common stock being
sold in this offering, including any shares that may be sold in connection with
the exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares. 
Accordingly, we will not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares of our
common stock in this offering. We will bear all costs, fees and expenses in
connection with this offering, which are estimated to be $6.1 million.


The women’s apparel industry is highly competitive. We compete with local,
national and international retail chains and department stores, specialty and
discount stores, catalogs and internet businesses offering similar categories of
merchandise. We compete primarily on the basis of design, service, quality and
value. We believe our distinct combination of design, service, quality and value
allows us to compete effectively and we believe we differentiate ourselves from
competitors based on the strength of our brand, our industry-leading
omni-channel platform, our strong data capabilities, our loyal customer base,
our customer-focused product assortment and our highly experienced leadership
team. Our competitors range from smaller, growing companies to considerably
larger players with substantially greater financial, marketing and other
resources.


Company Description
J.Jill is a nationally recognized women’s apparel brand focused on a loyal,
engaged and affluent customer in the attractive 40-65 age segment. The J.Jill
brand represents an easy, relaxed and inspired style that reflects the
confidence and comfort of a woman with a rich, full life. We operate a


 highly
profitable omni-channel platform that is well diversified across our direct (42%
of net sales for the twelve months ended October 29, 2016) and retail (58% of
net sales for the twelve months ended October 29, 2016) channels. We began as a
catalog company and have been a pioneer of the omni-channel model with a
compelling presence across stores, website and catalog since 1999. We have
developed an industry-leading customer database that allows us to match
approximately 97% of transactions to an identifiable customer. We take a
data-centric approach, in which we leverage our database and apply our insights
to manage our business as well as to acquire and engage customers to drive
optimum value and productivity. Our goals are to Create a great brand, to Build
a successful business and to Make J.Jill a great place to work. To achieve this,
we have aligned our strategy and team around four guiding pillars – Brand,
Customer, Product and Channel.

Brand and Customer. Our brand promise to the J.Jill woman is to delight her with
great wear-now product, to inspire her confidence through J.Jill’s approach to
dressing and to provide her with friendly, guiding service wherever and whenever
she chooses to shop. While we find that women of all ages are attracted to our
brand, our typical customer is 40-65 years old, is college educated and has an
annual household income that exceeds $150,000. She leads a busy, yet balanced
life, as she works outside the home, is involved in her community and has a
family with children. She engages across both our direct and retail channels and
is highly loyal, as evidenced by the fact that approximately 70% of our gross
sales in pro forma fiscal year 2015 came from customers that have been shopping
with J.Jill for at least five years.

Product. Our customers strongly associate our products with a modern balance of
style, quality, comfort and ease suitable for a broad range of occasions at
accessible prices. Our product assortment is marketed under the J.Jill brand
name, sold exclusively through our direct and retail channels, and includes knit
and woven tops, bottoms and dresses as well as sweaters, outerwear and
accessories across a full range of sizes, including Misses, Petites, Women’s and
Tall. We also offer most of these products across our two sub-brands, Pure Jill
and Wearever. We design and merchandise our products in-house around clear
product stories, grounded with essential yet versatile styles and fabrications
updated each month with fresh colors, layering options, novelty and fashion.
Each of our monthly merchandised collections includes approximately 40% new
styles, which provides a consistent flow of fresh product.

Channel. We operate an omni-channel platform that delivers a seamless experience
to our customer wherever and whenever she chooses to shop across our website,
retail stores and catalog. Driven by our direct-to-consumer heritage, we have a
highly profitable omni-channel platform that is well-diversified across our
direct and retail channels. As of January 28, 2017, our retail store portfolio
consists of 275 stores in 43 states. Of these stores, 273 are full-price
locations averaging approximately 3,750 square feet, with approximately half of
our stores located in lifestyle centers and approximately half in premium malls.
Our stores have produced strong and consistent performance, with 98% of our
full-price locations generating positive 4-wall contribution in pro forma fiscal
year 2015. Our new store openings have produced an average payback of
approximately two years. We introduced a new store design in 2013 that showcases
our brand concept and elevates, yet simplifies the J.Jill shopping experience.
Within our direct channel, E-commerce represented 88% of net sales for the
twelve months ended October 29, 2016 and catalog orders represented 12% of net
sales for the twelve months ended October 29, 2016. Our website provides
customers with continuous access to the entire J.Jill product offering and
features rich content, including updates on new collections and guidance on how
to wear and wardrobe our styles, as well as the ability to chat live with a
customer service representative. We produce 25 annual editions of our catalog
and circulated 57 million copies in 2015. Our catalog, combined with an
increased investment in online marketing, drives customer acquisition and
engagement across all of our channels. Our omni-channel approach allows us to
drive customer response and purchasing behavior in all channels.
---

We were originally organized as Jill Intermediate LLC, a Delaware limited
liability company, in February 2011. On February 24, 2017, we completed
transactions pursuant to which we converted into a Delaware corporation and
changed our name to J.Jill, Inc. Our principal executive office is located at 4
Batterymarch Park, Quincy, MA 02169, and our telephone number is (617) 376-4300.
Our website address is www.jjill.com.
