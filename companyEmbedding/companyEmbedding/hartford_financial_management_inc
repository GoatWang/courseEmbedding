About UsOur Investment PhilosophyKey ConceptsPrice Matters




Our Investment Philosophy
At HFM Wealth Management we pursue a wholistic, comprehensive and disciplined team-based approach to investment management. Each client has different needs so we take the time to understand your situation and address any and all concerns that you may have including risk factors, taxes, need for current income, and growth for future generations. It's a question of ongoing fit.
We subscribe to an approach that emphasizes the key portfolio concepts of quality, diversification, objectivity and flexibility.
We believe:

That a commitment to wealth preservation and enhancement should be the cornerstone of an investment program designed to meet your unique needs.
The distribution of assets within the portfolios should be based on meeting your needs with as much certainty as possible.
That the ultimate success of your program is dependent on long-term commitment to quality investment selection.
That people often need more than just investments from their advisers.

About UsOur Investment Philosophy




About Us
We believe that managing people’s money is a very significant responsibility; doing it right is a complex process requiring integration of client needs, market dynamics, and the power of a committed and talented team. We believe that success is achieved by delivering on our promises. The aim has always been for our work to be the bridge that connects clients from where they are today to where they want to be tomorrow.
I founded Hartford Financial Management, Inc. in 1989 to offer a client-focused alternative to the common financial services model of investment management. I believe that our firm has a duty to our clients to always place their interests ahead of our own. This is one reason I structured the firm as an independent registered investment adviser; I wanted to be free of the influence that large firms often place on their own proprietary products.
"I believe that our firm has a duty to our clients to always place their interests ahead of our own."
This meant giving up many of the quick commissions and fees that the traditional financial services industry was built upon, in order for us to obtain the objectivity that is inherent in our core beliefs. It also meant laying the groundwork for long-term relationships and gaining opportunity to see wealth applied: to future generations, to achieving one’s personal and family goals, to new businesses and to community activity.
R. Dario Quiros

Under the provisions of FATCA, insurers may need to obtain withholding certificates (IRS Forms W-8 or W-9) from their business partners. Typically, a W-8 is provided by non-U.S. entities and a W-9 is provided by U.S. entities. Business partners conducting business with The Hartford may request copies of these completed forms from taxcompliance2@thehartford.com.

	Great rates and rewards on car insurance from The Hartford.
Switch your car insurance to the AARP® Auto Insurance Program from The Hartford1 and save. Enjoy great rates that recognize your experience and the extra benefits you deserve as an AARP member. You may even be eligible for additional savings. To learn more about the added automobile insurance savings and benefits for which you are eligible, get a quote. It’s easy!
 

Lifetime Renewability
Once you have an auto insurance policy with The Hartford, your coverage will be renewed for as long as you’re able to drive. Just meet a few simple requirements such as maintaining a valid driver's license and paying your premiums.†
 



12-Month Rate Protection
You can relax knowing your low auto insurance premium is locked-in for a full year. This sets us apart from other insurers who may change rates every six months or even sooner.
 

RecoverCare – Assistance After an Accident
The Hartford is here for you if you're injured in an automobile accident. This coverage provides reimbursement for essential home services you cannot perform yourself, such as house cleaning, lawn maintenance, and even dog walking. This coverage applies when injuries are not already covered by Medicare or health insurance.§
 

New Car Replacement Coverage
If you total your new car within the first 15 months or 15,000 miles after you buy it (whichever comes first), we’ll pay to replace it with a new vehicle of the same make, model and equipment – with no deduction for depreciation.§§
 

Lifetime Car Repair Assurance
Use one of the 1,600+ authorized repair shops in our approved network, and we’ll stand behind the workmanship of covered repairs for as long as you own or lease your vehicle. With this great coverage, you won’t have to go through the hassle of finding a trusted repair service after an accident.
 

24/7 Claims Hotline
Accidents can happen any time of day or night and you deserve an automobile insurance company that can respond immediately no matter what time you call. You can reach our claims reporting service 24/7, and we’ll walk you through the car insurance claims process. Our 6-Point Claim Commitment is your assurance of getting prompt, caring service from the start of your claim to the end.
 

Enjoy even more car insurance protection.


ADVANTAGE PLUS Program‡
In addition to the features and benefits mentioned above, the Advantage PLUS package includes:
 

First Accident Forgiveness 
Everyone makes mistakes once in a while. Once you qualify, if you’re involved in an accident, that first accident will be forgiven and your premium won’t increase as a result. To qualify, all drivers on the policy must have a clean driving record for five consecutive years.
 

Disappearing Deductible
We believe in rewarding great drivers. With our disappearing deductible, your collision deductible on your car insurance policy will go down each year – all the way to $0 – as long as you maintain a clean driving record.‡
 

One Deductible
If you file a claim for a loss involving two of your vehicles that are covered by a car insurance policy with The Hartford, you'll pay only one deductible – whichever is higher – for the covered losses to the vehicles. This benefit also applies if your car and home are involved in the same covered loss and you carry homeowners insurance with The Hartford. You'll pay only the highest deductible.‡
 

Waiver of Deductible for a Not-At-Fault Accident
In most cases, if you are not at fault in an accident, The Hartford will waive your deductible.
 

$100 Deductible Reduction
Typically, even if you’re not at fault, you may have to pay out of pocket for repair costs that fall below the deductible amount of your car insurance policy. With The Hartford, you can have your car repaired at any shop you choose. However, when you elect to use a Hartford-authorized shop for vehicle repair, we’ll reduce your collision deductible by $100. Not available in all states.
 
 
† If you are age 50 or older, once you're insured through this Program for at least 60 days, you cannot be refused renewal as long as applicable premiums are paid when due. Also, you and other customary drivers of your vehicles must retain valid licenses, remain physically and mentally capable of operating an automobile, have no convictions for driving while intoxicated and must not have obtained your policy through material misrepresentation. Benefit currently not available in HI, MI, NH and NC.
 

§ Availability of RecoverCare benefit and benefit levels vary by state. The Hartford RecoverCare Advantage® is a registered mark of The Hartford.
 
§§ Limitations apply.
 
‡ Some benefits, including First Accident Forgiveness and the Disappearing Deductible, are only available with the Advantage Plus package. A policy without these benefits is also available. [Call for details.] To qualify for the Accident Forgiveness benefit in most states, all drivers on the policy must have a clean driving record (no accidents or violations) for five consecutive years. First Accident Forgiveness is not available to CA policyholders. To qualify for the Disappearing Collision Deductible benefit in most states, all drivers on the policy must have a clean driving record for three consecutive years. NY drivers are not eligible for the complete disappearance of the deductible, although it will be reduced to a minimum of $100. The Advantage Plus package option, the Disappearing Deductible benefit and the Accident Forgiveness benefit are not available in all states.

	Tailor your car insurance at a rate you can afford.

With the AARP® Auto Insurance Program from The Hartford, you don’t have to sacrifice to save. You can tailor your car insurance coverage to suit your needs at a rate you can afford.
 
A cracked windshield. A dented fender. Injuries that require medical care. Accidents can be costly. Feel confident behind the wheel knowing you have the car insurance coverage you need. Here’s how our coverages help protect you:
 

Collision Coverage
Helps pay for damage done to your car in the event of a collision – whether it’s with another vehicle or an object. For example, if you back into a tree and damage your car, this coverage could help pay the repair fees.
 
Learn About Collision
 

Non-Collision Damage
Also known as “comprehensive,” this car insurance coverage helps pay for “non-collision” damage to your car resulting from things like natural disasters, theft and vandalism. For example, if you park your car under a tree during a snowstorm and heavy snow takes down a branch and breaks your windshield, non-collision damage insurance could help pay the cost to repair the damage to your car.

 
Learn About Non-Collision
 


Car Insurance Medical Payments
Helps cover medical care, recovery, rehab, and remedial care for you and your family after an auto accident.

 
Learn About Medical Payments
 


Auto Policy Bodily Injury Liability
This coverage can protect you against financial loss and helps pay the legal costs in the event you cause an auto accident injuring another person. For example, if you accidentally run a red light, or spin out in the snow and end up injuring another person, this coverage could help cover the costs of those injuries.

 
Learn About Bodily Injury
 


Property Damage Liability
Pays for damage your vehicle causes to other people's property (e.g. fences, mailboxes, other vehicles). For example, if your car slides out in the rain and you take out a neighbor’s mailbox or damage their landscaping, this insurance could help pay for the damages.

 
Learn About Property Damage
 


Uninsured-Underinsured Motorist Bodily Injury
Pays bodily injury and death expenses for you and your passengers if you're hit by an uninsured or underinsured driver.

 
Learn About Uninsured Bodily Injury
 


Uninsured-Underinsured Motorist Property Damage
Helps pay for damage to your vehicle if your vehicle is struck by an uninsured driver, a hit-and-run driver, or an insured driver whose property damage liability limit is too low to cover the losses, this coverage helps pay for the damage.

 
Learn About Uninsured Property Damage
 


Personal Injury Protection a.k.a. “No-Fault Insurance”
Pays for losses tied only to injuries – regardless of who caused the accident. This can be especially helpful after an accident that involves multiple cars. Not available in all states.

 
Learn About No-Fault Insurance
 


Glass Coverage
Full glass coverage pays the amount of a covered glass loss with no deductible. For example, let’s say your car gets broken into overnight and a window is smashed. The estimate to repair it comes in at $600. If you have comprehensive automobile insurance but not auto glass coverage, you will have to pay your deductible before insurance begins to cover the cost to repair the windshield.
 
If you have full glass coverage, the expense of repairing the window is covered in full with no out-of-pocket costs to you. This coverage is optional on your auto insurance policy and can be purchased for an additional premium. Not available in all states.

 
Learn About Glass
 


Towing Coverage
This coverage helps pay towing and labor charges associated with getting your vehicle running again in the event of a break down. For example, if your car battery dies on the interstate, this coverage could help pay for the costs of having your vehicle jumped started.

 
Learn About Towing
 


Rental Car Expense
Transportation Expense coverage helps to pay for a rental car in the event of a covered comprehensive or collision loss. For example, you slide off a wet road crashing into a tree, this coverage could help pay for the charges to rent a replacement vehicle while yours is in the shop for repairs.

 
Learn About Rental Expense
 


Personal Umbrella Insurance
Umbrella coverage goes beyond accidents and damages and helps when a covered loss exceeds the liability coverage limits of your home or auto policies. For example, if you are sued and the legal costs exceed the limits of your primary coverage, umbrella coverage can help cover the excess costs.
