NPS 100C







Home » Wind Power » NPS 100C

Introducing the NPS 100C
The next generation of our industry leading permanent magnet/direct drive distributed wind turbines are now available.
At 100 kilowatts of rated power, with a 21- or 24-meter rotor, the newly launched NPS 100C offers best in class annual energy production, safety and reliability for farms, businesses, schools and hospitals.
A new 24 meter rotor features state-of-the-art hub and blade technology with superior aerodynamics providing a larger swept area. This increases the annual energy production (AEP) of the NPS 100C-24 by 15% over the previous models.
The turbine is a complete redesign of NPS’ distributed wind platform that has been deployed around the world since 2008. The nacelle is now 30% smaller with a completely new tower configuration. This results in lower weight and load characteristics reducing foundation and installation costs.
Further improvements include a new best in class brake system, a new industry leading yaw configuration, an enhanced electrical layout, more efficient generator cooling, and an ultrasonic wind vane and anemometer.
Originally developed with NASA and designed for remote and isolated sites, the NPS 100 has an innovative gearless direct drive, permanent magnet generator, best-in-class reliability, and pleasing aesthetics. We optimized performance for low wind speeds. Our turbines begin making power at wind speeds as low as 3 meters per second (6 mph) and can provide clear economic benefits in all kinds of wind regimes.
The NPS 100 has a flawless track record of surviving extreme winds, from the bitter colds of Alaska to the tropical cyclones of the Caribbean. Its advanced technology and over 5 million hours of cumulative run time makes them the most reliable and proven turbines in their class.

Optimized for the highest annual energy production

The NPS 100C-24 (Class III/A) is available in several tower configurations on a steel mono-pole tower. The new model produces 15% more power than the previous 100-24 model in low wind conditions.
The NPS 100C-21 (Class II/A) is designed for high wind sites and can handle wind gusts up to 59.5 m/s


Simple and precise Our PMDD technology maximizes energy capture, outperforms conventional gearbox designs, and reduces maintenance costs
Plug and play Our state-of-the-art full power converter design provides smooth, clean power to local grids, simplifying grid interconnect and adding to grid stability to make the NPS 100 the best choice for a variety of applications.
Reliability and peace of mind Our robust, reliable gearless design coupled with our factory warranty, 24×7 system monitoring and local service assure continued performance and reduced maintenance costs.
Arctic model Capable of operating in the harshest of cold weather conditions in temperatures as low as -40C.

The NPS 100C is being installed globally at university campuses, businesses, resorts, and farms. Our turbines produce local power at the source of the need without having a negative impact on the environment or the community setting in which they stand.

Frequently Asked Questions







Home » Frequently Asked Questions

Northern Power Systems is now offering a solution for US Farmers, Commercial- and Manufacturing Businesses: Wind Power Ownership


Five frequently asked questions about Wind Power Ownership

How much can I save? 

If you’re currently paying high electricity rates and can harness good wind speeds you can benefit from our Wind Onwership Program. In order to provide more accuracy and create a tailored offering, we need to analyze your current electricity consumption, electricity cost and your wind resource.

What does “100% financing” mean?

Our lease program offer a complete financing solution. We tailor a plan to your needs and circumstances that provides set monthly payments, spread over 7 years. With 100% financing,  there will be no increase of payments during the lease period.

What if the wind doesn’t blow?

Your property will always remain connected to the grid, therefore you will not experience any interruptions. We measure our wind turbines’ output on an average wind speed – “no wind” days are compensated by “high wind” days.

How easy is it to install a wind turbine?

Planning and permitting is relatively straight forward in the US. In most cases Landowners need to obtain planning consent from the local authorities, after which we can proceed with the Turbine install. NPS takes care of the installation. Your turbine’s service and maintenance is also covered during the lease period.

How much energy will the turbine produce?

Our machines produce between 200 and 400 MWh a year – plenty of energy to power your needs.

FlexPhase Technology: Future Proof Checklist 

What battery technology will you use for your project today – and will you refit projects or change technology tomorrow based on available technology and cost?

FlexPhase platform matches any battery chemistry due to super-wide VDC range.

What circuit protection requirements do you have today – and will they change tomorrow?

FlexPhase platform can come with minimum protection (internal fuses) to full protection (with automated switches) on DC side.

What battery speed (C-Rate) will you need now – and what will be required by your grid operator tomorrow?

FlexPhase platform can be ordered as e.g. 1 MW version today – and refitted to 2 MW for higher C-rate with more advanced battery.

How much space will you have for your projects and applications – and could it change over time?

FlexPhase platform matches nearly any space with its extreme compactness: Unparalleled power density (indoor 1 MW and 2 MW unit WxHxD excluding cooling = 2.6 x 2.2 x 0.9 m).

Do you have an outdoor or indoor environment – if indoor: Where to place the cooling?

FlexPhase platform comes outdoor or indoor configuration. For indoor use, the cooling unit is separate, optional and can be set up within the battery container, in any other room or outdoor.

Do you have cooling available elsewhere and can you use it for the power converter too?

If you have a chilled-water cooling system available already, it can also be used with the FlexPhase platform to save cost.

How many DC sources (batteries, PV, others) if any, do you plan on adding to your storage system to hybrid tomorrow?

FlexPhase platform can be ordered with multiple DC ports for maximum flexibility independent of EMS today.

How do you want to monitor your system today and tomorrow?

FlexPhase platform comes with an all-industry standard communication protocols and interfaces, from MODBUS to CAN and Ethernet to RS485.

We estimate that the net proceeds from the sale of common shares in this
offering will be approximately $    , based on an assumed offering price of
$     per share, and after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and
commissions and estimated offering expenses. If the underwriters’ option to
purchase additional shares from us is exercised in full, we estimate that we
will receive additional net proceeds of $    .

The principal purposes of this offering are to raise additional capital, to
create a U.S. public market for our common shares and to facilitate our future
access to the U.S. public equity markets.

We currently intend to use the net proceeds from the securities sold by us in
the offering to advance the commercialization of our sales of utility-class wind
turbines into underserved smaller scale wind farms, including potential minority
investment into the development of a limited number of wind farms where we
expect to deploy our utility class turbines, as well as for general corporate
purposes, including working capital.

The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures may vary significantly from
our expectations depending upon numerous factors, including the progress of our
sales efforts, our operating costs and capital expenditures and other factors. 
Accordingly, we will retain broad discretion to allocate the net proceeds of 
this offering among the identified uses described above, and we reserve the 
right to change the use of the net proceeds or the allocation of the net 
proceeds among the uses described above. Pending application of the net 
proceeds, the net proceeds of this offering will be deposited in interest 
bearing accounts or invested in certificates of deposit, U.S. government 
obligations or other short-term debt instruments selected at our discretion.


In domestic and international markets for renewable energy sources served by
wind energy, we face competition from companies offering various types of wind
turbines.

Our primary competitor in the distributed wind market is Endurance Wind Power.
We also compete with several smaller providers of distributed-class wind
products. We may face increased competition in the future, including from large,
multinational companies with significant resources.

Companies selling direct-drive turbines include Enercon GmbH, Siemens Wind
Power, and Xinjiang Goldwind Science & Technology Co., Ltd. While we do not
currently compete directly with these companies, we may face indirect
competition through our strategic partners who market and sell utility-class
direct-drive turbines for large-scale wind farm installations. Once we begin
selling directly into this market, we expect to compete against suppliers such
as Gamesa Corporación Tecnológica S.A., Suzlon Group, and Nordex, Inc., none of
which currently offer direct-drive technology.

Our primary competitors in developing strategic partnerships are companies that
regularly seek to license utility-class wind turbine technology, including
American Superconductor Corporation, Vensys, a division of Xinjiang Goldwind
Science & Technology Co., Ltd., and aerodyn Energiesysteme GmbH.

Although the power conversion market is still developing, we may face future
competition from specialty suppliers or large suppliers, such as Siemens Energy,
GE Power Systems, and ABB.

We also face competition from other sources of renewable energy, such as solar,
hydro, biomass, wave and geothermal, and from conventional energy sources,
including coal, natural gas, oil, and nuclear.


Company Description
We are a growing provider of advanced renewable power creation and power
conversion technology for the energy sector. We design, manufacture and service
next-generation Permanent Magnet Direct-Drive, or PMDD, wind turbines for the
distributed wind market, and we currently license our utility-class


 wind turbine
platform, which uses the same PMDD technology as our distributed turbines, to
large manufacturers on a global basis. We also provide technology development
services for a wide variety of energy applications. With our predecessor
companies dating back to 1974 and our new turbine development since 1977, we
have decades of experience in developing advanced, innovative wind turbines, as
well as technology for power conversion and integration with other energy
applications. Since 2008, we have invested more than $130 million in developing
and commercializing our wind turbine platforms.

Our PMDD wind turbine technology is based on a simplified architecture that
utilizes a unique combination of a permanent magnet generator and direct-drive
design. The permanent magnet generator provides higher efficiency and higher
energy capture than units that utilize a traditional gearbox design.
Importantly, the direct-drive design of our turbine utilizes significantly fewer
moving parts than traditional geared turbines, which increases reliability due
to reduced maintenance and downtime costs.

The substantial majority of our current sales are in the small wind subset of
the distributed wind market, which commonly consists of turbines with rated
capacities of 500 kW output or smaller. Based on the number of turbines that we
have sold and installed to date, we consider ourselves a leader in the U.S.,
U.K. and Italy in the larger energy output sub-segment of this market, which
comprises turbines ranging in size from 50 kW to 100 kW. Since the introduction
of our second generation 60 kW and 100 kW PMDD wind turbines in late 2008, we
have shipped over 400 of these turbines and as of September 30, 2014, we have
orders approximating $33 million in backlog for our second and third generation
turbines. To date, these shipped units have run for over six million hours in
the aggregate. Our distributed wind customers include financial investors and
project developers which deploy our turbines to provide power for farms, remote
villages, schools, small businesses, and U.S. military installations.

We are advancing our efforts to sell our utility-class wind turbines. We have
developed a 2 MW turbine platform with three wind-speed regime variants based
upon our PMDD technology, of which the 2.3 MW variant is certified to
International Electrotechnical Commission standard 61400-1 by Det Norske
Veritas, a globally recognized certification firm. In 2013, we launched a
strategy of partnering with large-scale manufacturers in developing regions,
starting with a multi-billion dollar (in revenue) industrial equipment
manufacturer based in Brazil (WEG Equipamentos Elétricos S.A., or WEG). We have
licensed our technology to WEG exclusively for Brazil, but retain our right to
sell Northern Power-branded utility-class turbines produced by WEG on a
rest-of-world basis. WEG has executed a backlog of orders comprising over 300 MW
of turbine installations for the sale of turbines built using our design, eleven
of which have been installed to date in Brazil. We are also seeking a limited
number of similar partnership structures in other regional geographies, through
which we intend that other large-scale manufacturers will produce and sell
turbines for their domestic market and make available to us the supply of 
turbines to expand our regional ability to sell such turbines. We believe this 
approach will allow us to participate in the utility-class wind turbine market 
without a significant investment in capital equipment that would otherwise be 
required.

Our direct sales strategy for utility-class wind turbines is directed primarily
towards North America and focuses on underserved, smaller scale wind projects
such as those generating 50 MW or less. As part of our market entry plan, we
intend to be a minority investor in the development of a limited number of these
wind power projects to ensure initial sales of our utility-class turbines. After
a number of these installations, we plan to participate in the same utility wind
marketplace solely by selling the turbines without providing any investment. We
also intend to expand our sales and marketing capabilities to execute this
strategy.

In addition to wind turbine development, we provide technology development
services to customers to develop products and technology for a variety of
complex energy applications, including energy storage, microgrids, and grid
stabilization. While the customer owns the developed technology for a limited
field of use, we typically maintain a license for all other applications and all
other markets. While we do not expect material revenue from our development
services, these services fund the expansion of our intellectual property
portfolio. Through providing certain of such services, we have identified a
series of non-wind market applications for our FlexPhase power converters. As a
result, we intend to invest in expanding our sales of this product offering.

We were originally incorporated in Delaware on August 12, 2008 as Wind Power
Holdings, Inc., or WPHI.

On August 15, 2008, WPHI’s wholly-owned subsidiary CB Wind Acquisition, Inc., or
CBWA, acquired the wind turbine business of Distributed Energy Systems Corp.,
which was operating under the name Northern Power Systems. Northern Power
Systems had commenced business in 1974 as North Wind Power Company in Warren,
Vermont, but entered into bankruptcy proceedings along with its parent company
Distributed Energy Systems in 2008. Following the acquisition, CBWA changed its
name to Northern Power Systems, Inc. Northern Power Systems, Inc. also has two
wholly-owned subsidiaries, Northern Power Systems AG, a Switzerland corporation,
and Northern Power Systems S.r.l., an Italy limited liability company.

Our principal executive office is located at 29 Pitman Road, Barre, Vermont,
05641. Our telephone number at our principal executive office is (802) 461-2955.
Our website address is www.northernpower.com.
