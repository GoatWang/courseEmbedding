 Topaz Agro Capital L.P.
A Hawaii Limited Partnership
Topaz   Agro Capital LP is an investor partnership created for the purpose of   investing in medical marijuana license applicants in the state of   Hawaii, pursuant to the passage of Act 421 which creates a system of   medical marijuana dispensaries in the State, beginning in 2016. The   partnership itself is NOT applying for one of the 8 licenses provided   for by the Act, and will not be a principal or operator of any entities   granted a license under the Act.
Topaz   Agro Capital, or TAC, plans to be a minority investor in one or more   successful medical marijuana license applicants.  To this extent, the   Partnership has been meeting with, and analyzing the business plans of   many of the teams that intend to submit a license application in January   2016.
TAC   plans to invest up to 100% of the post-license capital requirements for   applying companies. However, we believe that TAC offers far more to   applicants than merely a ready source of capital. In particular:


TAC   is local capital. Act 421 requires that at least 51% of the ownership   of any successful applicant remains in the hands of Hawaii residents.   TAC is managed and entirely controlled by 3 long-time Hawaii residents   (see Management team below), and approximately 80% of TACs limited   partner investors are Hawaii residents.


TAC   is broad-based. The Partnership is comprised of 50+ individual   investors, who make up a broad swath of local business people, lawyers,   physicians, and other prominent local citizens. We believe that the   composition of TAC reflects a very desirable profile from the   perspective of the architects of Act 421.


TAC   is smart money. The TAC management team brings a vast network of   professional contacts and expertise to the applicants it supports. The   managers themselves have many decades of experience working with   startups, and helping them structure financially successful operations   and outcomes.


Management Team
The Partnership will be managed by Topaz Agro Management LLC, as General   Partner, and which will oversee all investment decisions for the   Partnership and provide administrative services to the Partnership.   Topaz Agro Management will is comprised of its members, Steven K. Baker,   Robert J. Robinson and David F. E. Banks, who will manage many   important aspects of the Partnership’s activities, including sourcing,   researching, analyzing, structuring and negotiating prospective   investments; monitoring the performance of investments; and determining   disposition opportunities. The work of the Managers will be conducted   principally out of the offices of Topaz Management in Honolulu, Hawaii.
STEVEN K. BAKER
Steven K. Baker is 66 years old and has been a resident of Honolulu, Hawaii since 1999.
Baker   was a senior executive with Citibank for 22 years, including being the   Division Executive of North Asia and of Worldwide Securities Services.   He then founded Lanka Bell (Pvt) Limited, a major telephone operator   with a 25-year nationwide license in Sri Lanka.  Currently residing in   Honolulu, Baker is the Vice Chairman of the Board of Trustees of Hawaii   Pacific University. He has developed several properties in Asia and the   United States, and is the co-Managing Member of both the Partnership   Fund and Palm   Cove Capital, boutique investment firms operating in Hawaii. A graduate   of the Business School of the University of Denver in 1972, Baker   completed the Executive Program at the Colgate Darden Graduate School of   Business at the University of Virginia. He also became a Fellow of the   Telecommunications Executive Management Institute of Canada in 1998.
Baker   started in Citibank in the U.S. real estate industries division, and   became head of Corporate Real Estate department. In 1980, he relocated   to Jakarta as second in charge of Indonesia, and in 1983, became   Citicorp's only Managing Director in Australia, where he formally   launched the first foreign-owned nationwide bank with the assistance of   Australian Treasurer Paul Keating. Baker was then based in Hong Kong for   eight years and was Citibank's Division Executive for North Asia   countries, Hong Kong's Country Corporate Officer, and developer with   Great Eagle, of Citibank Plaza’s twin 50-story towers. He was a member   of the Group of 55, Citicorp's senior strategy body, and was also   designated a Senior Credit Officer for the bank. He led one of the   well-publicized global Task Forces, established by the Chairman of   Citibank for the purpose of reviving the bank’s business. In 1993, he   became the Division Executive in charge of the Worldwide Securities   Services division with staff in fifty-one countries and a US$600 million   dollar revenue base.
In   Hong Kong, Baker served on the Hong Kong Port Development Board, as   appointed by the Governor, the Community Chest, the American Chamber of   Commerce, the Hong Kong Centre for Economic Research, and as an Advisor   to the Student Associations of the top two universities. In New York,   Baker was a board member of the National Securities Clearing Corporation   and was also a participating member of   the Zurich-based International Society of Securities Administrators.   Baker has lobbied with success in Washington D.C. on four Asian issues,   including leading an effort which resulted in an unprecedented law on   U.S. Immigration for the benefit of Hong Kong university-educated   citizens, and signed by President Bush in 1990. He has also contributed   chapters and articles to several publications.
After   leaving Citibank in 1994, Baker was based in Singapore as the Managing   Director of Transmarco Limited, a computer distribution and telecom   service company listed on the Stock Exchange of Singapore, which was   controlled by the Sampoerna Group, a billion dollar tobacco group based   in Indonesia. During this period, he was also appointed to the Board of   Directors of McLaren Cars N.V., based in the U.K.
In   1996, Baker co-founded Lanka Bell (Pvt) Limited. The company currently   has about 650 employees, services over one million customers, and   generates several million dollars of net profit each year. He remained   the Chairman and largest individual owner of Lanka Bell until September   2005, when Stassen group, the largest business group in Sri Lanka,   acquired virtually all of the shares of Lanka Bell.
Baker   was also Advisory Board member of Round Hill Capital Partners, a   Singapore and Tokyo based opportunity fund. His other current   appointments include being a member of the Board of Directors of the   University of Hawaii's Pacific Asia Center for Entrepreneurship and Vice   Chairman of the Board of Trustees of Hawaii Pacific University, the   largest independent university in Hawaii. He is also the Chairman of   HPU’s the Endowment Sub-Committee. He is a member of the Hawaii Angels,   Blue Startups, and Enterprise Foundation of Hawaii.
Mr.   Baker is the founder and President of Micronesia Registration Advisors,   Inc., which has a 40-year contract to promote in Japan the corporate   registry and captive insurance regime of the Federated States of   Micronesia. Mr. Baker will continue to devote sufficient time and   attention to company matters to fulfill his duties as an officer and a   director of MRA. Virtually of all that time will be spent outside of the   United States, mostly in the FSM and Japan.

What is Form D? What It Is Used For
Form D disclosures could be used to track and understand better your competitors. The information in Form D is usually highly confidential for ventures and startups and they don’t like revealing it. This is because it reveals amount raised or planned to be raised as well as reasons for the financing. This could help competitors. Entrepreneurs usually want to keep their financing a ‘secret’ so they can stay in stealth mode for longer.
Why Fundraising Reporting Is Good For Topaz Agro Capital Also
The Form D signed by David FE Banks might help Topaz Agro Capital L.P.’s sector. First, it helps potential customers feel more safe to deal with a firm that is well financed. The odds are higher that it will stay in the business. Second, this could attract other investors such as venture-capital firms, funds and angels. Third, positive PR effects could even bring leasing firms and venture lenders.
