Thompson Creek Metals Company Inc. is a full cycle mining company with acquisition, exploration, development, and operation in North America.[1] The corporate office is located in Denver, Colorado. The company primarily produces copper, gold, and molybdenum.[1] In the past several years, the Company has evolved from being a major primary molybdenum producer to becoming a copper and gold mining company with the construction and development of the Mount Milligan (open-pit copper-gold) mine and concentrator in British Columbia, Canada.[2] Mount Milligan is Thompson Creek Metals principal operation and the company owns 100% of this property.[2] The company also owns 100% of its Thompson Creek Mine (open-pit molybdenum and concentrator) in Idaho. Thompson Creek Metals owns 75% joint venture interest in two other properties, including its Endako Mine (open-pit molybdenum, concentrator and roaster) in British Columbia, and its Langeloth Metallurgical Facility (roaster) in Pennsylvania.[2] Thompson Creek Metals has additional development projects, including the Berg property in British Columbia (exploration of copper, molybdenum, and silver).[1] [2]

History[edit]
In 2006, the privately held Thompson Creek Metals Company (USA) was acquired by Canadian-based, publicly traded mining company Blue Pearl Mining Ltd for US$575 million, in addition to other payments worth as much as US$125 million depending on the price of molybdenum.[3][4] The name Blue Pearl Mining Ltd was changed to Thompson Creek Metals Company Inc. in May 2007.[5] From October 2006 through August 2013, Thompson Creek Metals was solely a molybdenum producer.[1]
Pursuant to the acquisition of Terrane Metals Corp. in October 2010 for about US$700 million in a combination of cash and common stock, the company diversified its assets by adding significant reserves of copper and gold.[6] Concurrent with the acquisition of Terrane, the Company entered into a Gold Stream Arrangement with Royal Gold Inc. as a financing mechanism for the purchase of Terrane.[6] The Gold Stream Agreement was amended twice for a total payment by Royal Gold of approximately US$781 million for the right to purchase 52.25% of the gold from Mount Milligan Mine for US$435 per ounce for the life of the mine.[6]
Operating Mines[edit]
Mount Milligan — Mount Milligan Mine (open-pit copper and gold mine) is a located 90 miles northwest of Prince George in Central British Columbia, Canada.[7] Mount Milligan Mine has a concentrator with a 60,000 tpd design capacity copper flotation processing plant.[1] The estimated life of Mount Milligan Mine is approximately 24 years (which is based on spot metal prices copper and gold). Over the life of the mine, it is estimated that it will produce an average annual of 85 million pounds of copper and 186,700 ounces of gold in 155,000 tonnes of concentrate.[1] In 2015 through 2019, the average annual production is projected to increase at approximately 94 million pounds of copper and 285,800 ounces of gold in 165,000 tonnes of concentrate. Thompson Creek Metals Company filed an updated NI 43-101 Technical Report for Mount Milligan Mine on January 21, 2015 that confirms these projections.[8]
In October 2010, through the Terrane acquisition, Thompson Creek Metals obtained the Mount Milligan development project and initiated construction soon after.[1] On August 15, 2013, the initial feed to the concentrator started the operation of the mine.[1] By September 2013, the mine had its first production, a copper-gold concentrate.[1] Mount Milligan Mine reached commercial production as of February 18, 2014, which means that the mill operated at 60% planned capacity throughput for 30 days.[1] Industrious activities were sustained through 2014 and are consistent today.[1] The Company predicts that it will reach 60,000 tpd on a steady basis once it installs a secondary crushing circuit.[1] Thompson Creek Metals expects to reach approximately 60,000 tpd by the end of 2015 by utilizing temporary crushing.[1]
Thompson Creek Mine (near Challis, Idaho) — The Thompson Creek Mine is a primary molybdenum mine located approximately 35 miles southwest of Challis in Idaho's Custer County, a historic mining area. Known as the Thompson Creek deposit, it was discovered in 1968 by Cyprus Minerals Corporation. The mine has been in operation since 1983 and uses conventional open-pit mining methods. The mine was sold in 1993 to Thompson Creek Metals Company (USA), which began mining at the site in April 1994. The company has claims on over 22,000 acres of land (includes waste dumps). It operates as an open pit mine,[5] and includes Bruno Creek Tailings Impoundment, the second tallest center-line tailings dam in the world.[9] The capacity of the mill to process is approximately 30,000 tons of ore per day to produce molybdenum sulfide concentrate. It is then roasted at the Company’s Langeloth Metallurgical Facility into molybdenum trioxide, ferromolybdenum products, and other specialty products. Due to low molybdenum prices, this mine is under maintenance and care currently.[2]
Endako Mine — 3 pit, open pit mine in central British Columbia (other 2 projects Berg and Davidson are west of it). Subsidiary Thompson Creek Holding owns 75% of the mine while Japanese company Sojitz Corporation has the other 25%. The operation also involves processing the molybdenum ore into a disulfide and then molybdenum trioxide through roasting.[10] Expansion projects, which began in 2008 increased capacity by 77.4% (though expansions which include new mills will cut the mine life by 38.5% to 16 years).[11][12]
Langeloth Metallurgical Facility — The Langeloth Metallurgical Facility, located 25 miles west of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, is a world-class facility with a long history of producing high-quality metallurgical products used mainly in the steel and chemical industries. The facility has roasting capacity of 35 million pounds of molybdenum per year. Four multiple-hearth furnaces are used for the conversion (roasting) of molybdenum disulfide concentrates into technical grade molybdenum oxide (tech oxide), which is sold in powder form or briquettes or converted into pure molybdenum oxide or ferromolybdenum. Two other furnaces process spent catalyst material containing other metals.[13]
Projects[edit]
As part of the Terrane acquisition, Thompson Creek also acquired a copper, molybdenum and silver exploration property located in British Columbia, Canada (the Berg Property).[1] [14]
Berg Property — Located about 50 miles southwest of Houston, BC and 15 miles northwest of Huckleberry Mine, this project is continuously assessed to determine if the deposit of copper, molybdenum, and silver is commercially ready for production. The Berg property is 100% owned by the company.[1] Royal Gold has 1% net smelter return royalty held on eight of the mineral claims and one mining lease, including those which host the deposit on the Berg property.[1] All mineral claims and the mining lease are in good standing and good to dates ranging from August 2015 to November 2021.[1] Mineral claims are subject to exploration expenditure obligations, or they may choose to pay annual fees to the province in lieu of exploration expenditures. Thompson Creek expects to renew such mineral claims and mining lease in the ordinary course.[14]

Projects[edit]
As part of the Terrane acquisition, Thompson Creek also acquired a copper, molybdenum and silver exploration property located in British Columbia, Canada (the Berg Property).[1] [14]
Berg Property — Located about 50 miles southwest of Houston, BC and 15 miles northwest of Huckleberry Mine, this project is continuously assessed to determine if the deposit of copper, molybdenum, and silver is commercially ready for production. The Berg property is 100% owned by the company.[1] Royal Gold has 1% net smelter return royalty held on eight of the mineral claims and one mining lease, including those which host the deposit on the Berg property.[1] All mineral claims and the mining lease are in good standing and good to dates ranging from August 2015 to November 2021.[1] Mineral claims are subject to exploration expenditure obligations, or they may choose to pay annual fees to the province in lieu of exploration expenditures. Thompson Creek expects to renew such mineral claims and mining lease in the ordinary course.[14]

Thompson Creek Metals Company Inc. is a full cycle mining company with acquisition, exploration, development, and operation in North America.[1] The corporate office is located in Denver, Colorado. The company primarily produces copper, gold, and molybdenum.[1] In the past several years, the Company has evolved from being a major primary molybdenum producer to becoming a copper and gold mining company with the construction and development of the Mount Milligan (open-pit copper-gold) mine and concentrator in British Columbia, Canada.[2] Mount Milligan is Thompson Creek Metals principal operation and the company owns 100% of this property.[2] The company also owns 100% of its Thompson Creek Mine (open-pit molybdenum and concentrator) in Idaho. Thompson Creek Metals owns 75% joint venture interest in two other properties, including its Endako Mine (open-pit molybdenum, concentrator and roaster) in British Columbia, and its Langeloth Metallurgical Facility (roaster) in Pennsylvania.[2] Thompson Creek Metals has additional development projects, including the Berg property in British Columbia (exploration of copper, molybdenum, and silver).[1] [2]

History[edit]
In 2006, the privately held Thompson Creek Metals Company (USA) was acquired by Canadian-based, publicly traded mining company Blue Pearl Mining Ltd for US$575 million, in addition to other payments worth as much as US$125 million depending on the price of molybdenum.[3][4] The name Blue Pearl Mining Ltd was changed to Thompson Creek Metals Company Inc. in May 2007.[5] From October 2006 through August 2013, Thompson Creek Metals was solely a molybdenum producer.[1]
Pursuant to the acquisition of Terrane Metals Corp. in October 2010 for about US$700 million in a combination of cash and common stock, the company diversified its assets by adding significant reserves of copper and gold.[6] Concurrent with the acquisition of Terrane, the Company entered into a Gold Stream Arrangement with Royal Gold Inc. as a financing mechanism for the purchase of Terrane.[6] The Gold Stream Agreement was amended twice for a total payment by Royal Gold of approximately US$781 million for the right to purchase 52.25% of the gold from Mount Milligan Mine for US$435 per ounce for the life of the mine.[6]
Operating Mines[edit]
Mount Milligan — Mount Milligan Mine (open-pit copper and gold mine) is a located 90 miles northwest of Prince George in Central British Columbia, Canada.[7] Mount Milligan Mine has a concentrator with a 60,000 tpd design capacity copper flotation processing plant.[1] The estimated life of Mount Milligan Mine is approximately 24 years (which is based on spot metal prices copper and gold). Over the life of the mine, it is estimated that it will produce an average annual of 85 million pounds of copper and 186,700 ounces of gold in 155,000 tonnes of concentrate.[1] In 2015 through 2019, the average annual production is projected to increase at approximately 94 million pounds of copper and 285,800 ounces of gold in 165,000 tonnes of concentrate. Thompson Creek Metals Company filed an updated NI 43-101 Technical Report for Mount Milligan Mine on January 21, 2015 that confirms these projections.[8]
In October 2010, through the Terrane acquisition, Thompson Creek Metals obtained the Mount Milligan development project and initiated construction soon after.[1] On August 15, 2013, the initial feed to the concentrator started the operation of the mine.[1] By September 2013, the mine had its first production, a copper-gold concentrate.[1] Mount Milligan Mine reached commercial production as of February 18, 2014, which means that the mill operated at 60% planned capacity throughput for 30 days.[1] Industrious activities were sustained through 2014 and are consistent today.[1] The Company predicts that it will reach 60,000 tpd on a steady basis once it installs a secondary crushing circuit.[1] Thompson Creek Metals expects to reach approximately 60,000 tpd by the end of 2015 by utilizing temporary crushing.[1]
Thompson Creek Mine (near Challis, Idaho) — The Thompson Creek Mine is a primary molybdenum mine located approximately 35 miles southwest of Challis in Idaho's Custer County, a historic mining area. Known as the Thompson Creek deposit, it was discovered in 1968 by Cyprus Minerals Corporation. The mine has been in operation since 1983 and uses conventional open-pit mining methods. The mine was sold in 1993 to Thompson Creek Metals Company (USA), which began mining at the site in April 1994. The company has claims on over 22,000 acres of land (includes waste dumps). It operates as an open pit mine,[5] and includes Bruno Creek Tailings Impoundment, the second tallest center-line tailings dam in the world.[9] The capacity of the mill to process is approximately 30,000 tons of ore per day to produce molybdenum sulfide concentrate. It is then roasted at the Company’s Langeloth Metallurgical Facility into molybdenum trioxide, ferromolybdenum products, and other specialty products. Due to low molybdenum prices, this mine is under maintenance and care currently.[2]
Endako Mine — 3 pit, open pit mine in central British Columbia (other 2 projects Berg and Davidson are west of it). Subsidiary Thompson Creek Holding owns 75% of the mine while Japanese company Sojitz Corporation has the other 25%. The operation also involves processing the molybdenum ore into a disulfide and then molybdenum trioxide through roasting.[10] Expansion projects, which began in 2008 increased capacity by 77.4% (though expansions which include new mills will cut the mine life by 38.5% to 16 years).[11][12]
Langeloth Metallurgical Facility — The Langeloth Metallurgical Facility, located 25 miles west of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, is a world-class facility with a long history of producing high-quality metallurgical products used mainly in the steel and chemical industries. The facility has roasting capacity of 35 million pounds of molybdenum per year. Four multiple-hearth furnaces are used for the conversion (roasting) of molybdenum disulfide concentrates into technical grade molybdenum oxide (tech oxide), which is sold in powder form or briquettes or converted into pure molybdenum oxide or ferromolybdenum. Two other furnaces process spent catalyst material containing other metals.[13]
Projects[edit]
As part of the Terrane acquisition, Thompson Creek also acquired a copper, molybdenum and silver exploration property located in British Columbia, Canada (the Berg Property).[1] [14]
Berg Property — Located about 50 miles southwest of Houston, BC and 15 miles northwest of Huckleberry Mine, this project is continuously assessed to determine if the deposit of copper, molybdenum, and silver is commercially ready for production. The Berg property is 100% owned by the company.[1] Royal Gold has 1% net smelter return royalty held on eight of the mineral claims and one mining lease, including those which host the deposit on the Berg property.[1] All mineral claims and the mining lease are in good standing and good to dates ranging from August 2015 to November 2021.[1] Mineral claims are subject to exploration expenditure obligations, or they may choose to pay annual fees to the province in lieu of exploration expenditures. Thompson Creek expects to renew such mineral claims and mining lease in the ordinary course.[14]

Leadership

You may have heard it said that mangers do things right, and leaders do the right things. (Drucker)
The engine room at Thompson Creek Mine is run by managers and leaders who keep a steady hand on the helm supported by four pillars of corporate responsibility that includes:

          — economic achievement
          — employee safety and development
          — environmental stewardship
          — community engagement
        






Bert Doughty has fought long and passionately on behalf of the environment.
For 10 years, Bert Doughty designed and supervised air monitor programs, helped design and implement groundwater monitoring programs and was instrumental in developing a dust abatement program for a 1000-acre tailings facility for the Atlantic Richfield Company.
Since 1986, Doughty has led Thompson Creek in all aspects of environmental compliance. He stakes and patents all mining claims, develops and presents environmental awareness programs, and maintains daily interfaces with state and federal oversight agencies.

Bruce Parker’s mining roots run deep.
After graduating with honors from Montana State University in civil engineering, Parker spent the past 20 years honing his skills in mine management, progressing from environmental manager to mine superintendent, general manager and corporate manager of operations. In his tenure with various mines, Parker’s roles have covered a myriad of responsibilities from environmental permitting and engineering; safety, coaching and training; to, regulatory liaisons and relocating a major national highway in Africa. With Thompson Creek Mine, Parker has directed the start-up of a copper/gold mine in northern British Columbia. He also develops policies and procedures, oversees hiring, and implements maintenance programs that satisfy financial and contractual requirements.

Don Rowles took the roundabout tour of the west before boomeranging back to his native Idaho in 1996.
A graduate of the University of Utah in accounting and a member of the US Ski team in 1970, Rowles’ accounting career took him from Yerington, Nevada to Flagstaff, Orange County, Palm Springs, Napa and, alas, Challis.
He has owned his own accounting firms, worked as CFO for a public company, and has served as a software consultant in accounting. He joined Thompson Creek in 2005, returning to within earshot of the site where his great grandfather settled in 1879. Many historic buildings in Custer County were built by his family.

After 11 years as Thompson Creek’s Senior Environmental Engineer, Eric Tilman was named in 2010 to oversee all site safety management systems for the firm; and, in 2013 Tilman added human resources to his repertoire.
Needs such as grievances; labor relations; and, arbitrations have become as much a part of his day as implementing processes for Behavioral Based Safety and Safety Leadership. It’s a perfect match... as human resources and safety go hand in hand at Thompson Creek.
Other safety hats that Tilman wears includes developing comprehensive safety and business plans, accident investigation and analysis, contractor safety control systems, site safety manual, and elevated work policy. His personal long-term goal is to help Thompson Creek Mine become mining’s preeminent example of worksite safety.

If it ever came down to one person at Thompson Creek who would take the torch on behalf of safety, it might well be Greg Hurless.
Challis is home. It’s where he grew up, went to school, played sports, enjoyed the outdoors and — since 1983 — where he chose to work at the mine. That means he’s got friends at all points of the compass at the mine and taking care of everyone is his top priority. That’s why he’s developing a behavior based safety program at Thompson Creek. A member of the company’s senior management team, Greg’s also responsible for managing operations, supervising superintendents and senior engineers, and overseeing engineering and construction of numerous projects to improve plant performance.

Watson’s mining career began in the summer of ‘75 with an internship in Craig, Colorado.
He later graduated as a civil engineer and has served on numerous cross functional teams, including HR best practices, asset maximization, and best practices in employee development and maintenance.
He came to Thompson Creek Mine in 1997 as vice president/general manager and also serves on the Board of the Idaho Mining Association.

Like so many at Thompson Creek Mine, Wayne Simpson – after furthering his skills in engineering, environmental sciences and management with other mining operations – has found life in Challis much to his liking.
Simpson has been Maintenance Manager since 1998 and is now elevating his skills as newly appointed Special Project Manager, where he is establishing a world-class maintenance program for the company, with an emphasis on safety. Considerng Simpson’s passion to tackle challenges and his background of environmental stewardship and human resources — it's easy to see why Thompson Creek and Wayne Simpson work well together.

Moly – short for Molybdenum – is a one-of-a-kind robot.
If you’ll notice, she’s drawn of various parts that you see and use every day that are made using molybdenum including her reinforced steel exterior. Our mascot Moly is tough and resistant to injury or harm on the outside. In fact, she is almost indestructible and wants us to be, too.
But inside, she’s gentle and kind. Our mascot Moly oversees safety at the mine and makes it fun for everyone. She is programmed to generate safety tips throughout the day and it is her job to share them with us and remind us that we owe it to ourselves, our loved ones, and to the community to be safe and live safe.

Moly The Robot
Official Mascot of Thompson Creek Mine





 






We dig the earth in more ways than one: we process 28,000 tons per day. But without a doubt, every person at Thompson Creek digs our clear skies, majestic mountains and abundant streams. That’s why, in addition to being a world leader in the production of pure
Moly, we’re also among the nation’s leaders in:

• Economic Achievement   >>
• Safety and Development   >>
• Environmental Stewardship   >>
• Community Engagement   >>




 




People

In the same way that molybdenum strengthens steel, our people fortify the mine and the community of Challis, Idaho. You can’t go far without running into someone who works at Thompson Creek or knows someone close to them that works the mine.
Father. Brother. Grandmother. Husband. We’d like to introduce you to just a few of the 250 people who run the mine and call Thompson Creek their home away from home.
Stories run deep at Thompson Creek Mine. Read more about the jobs that people do. And, why they love working and living here.

Jeremy Wall [ Father of Peyton, husband to Nichoelle, friend of Mother Nature ] Chief Environmental Engineer Jeremy Wall has a hard time separating his work from his play. Both involve a deep love for the great outdoors, regardless of whether he's casting a fly rod or wielding a transit level.

The Bruno Brothers [ Dads, cowboys, superintendents of s’mores ] Supervisors: Mill Operations and Mill Maintenance They’ve got cowboy in their veins, outdoors on their minds and family in their hearts. They’ve also amassed an impressive collection of bumps, bruises and broken bones.

Leonard Fisher [ Tinkerer, mechanic, sixth man VIP ]  Retired 
Leonard Fisher's local roots run deep. He was born in Clayton, went to school in Clayton and now, after stints in Alaska, Utah and 26 years at Thompson Creek Mine, has settled into the five acres of his dreams just 15 minutes from Clayton.

Roxanna McDonald [ Camper, grandma, queen of turnips and tomatoes ] Mill Operator
She grows veggies, chases grandkids, hikes mountains, fishes here, camps there and runs a half marathon of stairs every day between her office and the pit. So it’s only fair that Roxi be allowed a wicker chair, a cup ‘o jo and a sunny porch with Rover.

Frank Foster [ Full time joker, part time troubadour ] Pit Supervisor, recently retired.
When the Saturday sun is on the far side of Blue Mountain and the day’s giving way to the stars, Frank Foster — with fingers hungry for six strings and a well-worn pick — gets a little antsy. [ more ] Photographed at Bux's Place on Main Street, Challis.






 






Who or what is Moly? She is a metal on the periodic chart with the symbol Mo and the atomic number 42. In our world, we call her Moly for short. In the science world, she’s called Molybdenum (pronounced “mol-lib-di-num”).
More about Moly (the Metal and the Robot) >>



How We Mine Moly
A Quick Overview of the Process >>





 





Our Operations

The world has an insatiable appetite for Moly.
          And for that, we put plans in place, people to work,
          and machinery in motion. We drill…

          …we blast…
          …we haul away ores that are then crushed…
          …ground…
          …floated…
          …and separated.
        
Operating the mine is a 24/7 job. Our people are seven days on and seven days off. Moly is always there. And is expected to be mined here until 2026.






In certain places across the globe, the earth is uncommonly generous, dishing up gems and minerals in abundance. And it doesn’t take long for people to find them. In central Idaho those kinds of people — miners — arrived in the 1860s in search of the mother of all precious metals — gold.
A century later, in that place that eventually came to be known as Custer County, miners of another era arrived. This time, with modern machinery in pursuit of another kind of ore — an ore liberally laced with an element that would eventually make this area — and the Thompson Creek Metals Company — one of the world’s top producers of molybdenum.
Those places Thompson Creek Mine calls home are at elevations reaching upwards of 8500-feet. Thirty miles away is Challis – the town that many of Thompson Creek’s employees call home.





It can be quiet up here. Maybe a noisy blue jay now and then… or the wind… or a bull elk two ridges away. It can be about as quiet as quiet can get.
But it hasn’t always been that way. [ + ]





Thompson Creek Mine staked its first mineral claims here in 1967, when explorations revealed deposits projected to contain more than 235 million tons of molybdenum-laced ore.
Getting to that ore, however, would take another sixteen years. The company engaged in thorough environmental impact assessments – an ongoing practice it continues to place tremendous focus on in all it does every single day. And, after $325 million worth of studies and preparation, the mine finally began operation in 1983.






The Thompson Creek molybdenum deposit occurs in a complex environment near a break between two geologic provinces, which is to say that essentially, fault lines within the earth here conspired to stir up conditions that made for the perfect recipe of an ore that would eventually become molybdenum.
          [ + ]






Thompson Creek Mining Company (a subsidiary of Thompson Creek Metals Company Inc.) presently controls a block of mineral claims comprising about 25 square miles of land or about 16,000 acres. And while digging for ore is our primary goal, we’ve also unearthed our fair share of environmental awards.
From the first shovel of rock, Thompson Creek was developed within a comprehensive framework of state and federal regulations. The mine pioneered the Interagency Task Force, a successful model for cooperative oversight by state and federal regulatory agencies.






Our Plan of Operation covers ongoing mining, waste rock disposal, ore processing, tailings disposal, and eventually closure of the facility and final reclamations, projected for 2030.

Today, Thompson Creek has an enviable record of excellence in the areas of reclamation, environmental protection and stewardship, and has been recognized by the many organizations.
          [ + ]






That’s why our process water treatment plants are nothing short of state-of-the-art.
There’s nothing very subtle about mining, never has been. But our love for the streams we fish, for the hills we hike and for the air we breathe – for those things that we hand down to our kids and grandkids – dictates why our environmental stewardship and innovative reclamation practices are the envy of the industry.






With all the commotion that takes place, we manage to maintain a tremendous safety record — in fact, when it comes to safety, we are a bit extreme. At the same time, we strive to minimize our imprint on the worldaround us.
          [ + ]






Yes, it can be busy up here.
But never much more than a cup of coffee away in any direction is one of those places that can be as quiet as quiet can be. As quiet as it’s always been up here in this land of uncommon abundance.
          :: end ::






 






Technically, Thompson Creek is a mine, a company, a major producer of molybdenum. But enough of technicalities, because Thompson Creek is more than that. At our heart, we’re a community – one that’s built on rock solid leadership and down-to-earth people. Challis, Idaho is our home and the world around us contains an abundance of all we live for and work for. That means taking care of our streams, our air and our neighbors and digging deeper in all we do to make ours a community to be proud of.



          . . . where natural resources are
          equal parts human nature
          and Mother Nature.

(TCM.TO) (TCPTF) (the "Company" or "Thompson Creek"), a  North American mining company, announced today financial results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 , prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles ("US GAAP"). All dollar amounts are in United States ("US") dollars unless otherwise indicated.Jacques Perron , President and Chief Executive Officer of Thompson Creek, said, "During the second quarter of 2016, we continued to achieve solid performance with our company-wide safety program.  We reduced unit cash costs on a by-product basis by 23% compared to the second quarter of 2015, generated net cash flows from our molybdenum business of approximately $3 million and ended the quarter with working capital of approximately $130 million , including approximately $120 million of cash.""We had a challenging quarter at Mount Milligan Mine with decreased copper and gold payable production quarter over quarter as a result of lower recoveries resulting mainly from lower ore grades, together with operational inefficiencies in the mill from higher throughput. The performance for the quarter was also impacted by lower mill availability due to a scheduled relining of the SAG mill and the planned relocation of the reclaim barge.  Additionally, the operation incurred some unscheduled downtime associated with a tear to the main conveyor belt feeding the mill and electrical issues with one ball mill.  Based on our forecast for the balance of the year, we expect annual production to be in line with our 2016 guidance of 55 to 65 million pounds of copper and 240 to 270 thousand ounces of gold, with payable copper production near the high end of the range and payable gold production at the low end of the range.  For the remainder of 2016, our primary operational focus is to continue to optimize the mine and mill with the expectation to gradually increase recoveries," said Mr. Perron.As previously announced, on July 5, 2016 Thompson Creek entered into an Arrangement Agreement with Centerra Gold Inc. ("Centerra"), pursuant to which Centerra will acquire all of the outstanding common shares of Thompson Creek pursuant to a statutory plan of arrangement under the Business Corporations Act ( British Columbia ).  The closing of the Arrangement is subject to satisfaction of certain conditions, including, among others, approval of the Arrangement by Thompson Creek's shareholders, approval by the Supreme Court of British Columbia and receipt of any regulatory or stock exchange approvals, including approval of the Toronto Stock Exchange, and other customary closing conditions.  We anticipate that the Arrangement will be consummated in the second half of 2016.Highlights for the Second Quarter of 2016 Total cash and cash equivalents at June 30, 2016 were $119.7 million , compared to $176.8 million at December 31, 2015. Total debt, including capital lease obligations and excluding unamortized debt issuance costs and debt discounts, was $873.2 million at June 30, 2016, compared to $885.9 million at December 31, 2015. Working capital at June 30, 2016 was $129.5 million , compared to $174.7 million at December 31, 2015.Cash generated by operating activities was $6.3 million in the second quarter of 2016, compared to $23.9 million in the second quarter of 2015.Consolidated revenues for the second quarter of 2016 were $128.7 million , compared to $134.1 million in the second quarter of 2015. Copper and gold sales contributed $102.2 million in revenue in the second quarter of 2016, compared to $105.6 million in the second quarter of 2015. Molybdenum sales were $22.3 million for the second quarter of 2016, compared to $20.9 million in the second quarter of 2015. During the second quarter of 2016, we completed four shipments of copper-gold concentrate and recorded four sales, compared to three shipments and four sales in the second quarter of 2015.Sales volumes and average realized sales prices for copper and gold for the second quarter of 2016 were 20.3 million pounds of copper at an average realized price of $2.15 per pound and 62,314 ounces of gold at an average realized price of $1,041 per ounce, compared to 21.2 million pounds of copper at an average realized price of $2.63 per pound and 57,920 ounces of gold at an average realized price of $975 per ounce for the second quarter of 2015. In the second quarter of 2016, we sold 3.0 million pounds of molybdenum, which consisted of roasted molybdenum concentrate sourced from third parties, at an average realized price of $7.38 per pound. In the second quarter of 2015, we sold 2.3 million pounds of molybdenum, which consisted of inventory produced at our mines in 2014 in addition to third-party sourced product, at an average realized price of $9.23 per pound.Consolidated operating loss for the second quarter of 2016 was $3.8 million , compared to $12.1 million of operating income for the second quarter of 2015.Net loss for the second quarter of 2016 was $27.9 million , or $0.13 per diluted share, compared to net income of $0.3 million , or nil per diluted share, for the second quarter of 2015. The net loss for the second quarter of 2016 and net income for the second quarter of 2015 included primarily unrealized non-cash foreign exchange loss of $1.4 million and unrealized non-cash foreign exchange gain of $16.9 million , respectively, primarily on intercompany notes.Non-GAAP adjusted net loss for the second quarter of 2016 was $26.9 million , or $0.13 per diluted share, compared to non-GAAP adjusted net loss for the second quarter of 2015 of $13.5 million , or $0.06 per diluted share. Non-GAAP adjusted net loss excludes foreign exchange gains and losses, net of related income tax effects. See "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" for the definition and reconciliation of non-GAAP adjusted net (loss) income.Payable production at Mount Milligan Mine for the second quarter of 2016 was 14.7 million pounds of copper and 46,383 ounces of gold, compared to payable production of 20.2 million pounds of copper and 59,917 ounces of gold for the second quarter of 2015.Non-GAAP unit cash cost per pound of copper produced for the second quarter of 2016, on a by-product basis, net of gold credits, was $0.37 per pound and, on a co-product basis, $1.84 per pound of copper and $728 per ounce of gold. Non-GAAP unit cash cost in the second quarter of 2015 was, on a by-product basis, $0.48 per pound of copper and on a co-product basis, $1.55 per pound of copper and $434 per ounce of gold. See "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" for the definition and reconciliation of non-GAAP cash costs.Capital expenditures for the second quarter of 2016 were $15.9 million , composed of $15.8 million primarily related to the construction of the permanent secondary crushing circuit at Mount Milligan Mine and $0.1 million for TC Mine, compared to $9.7 million for the second quarter of 2015. Selected Condensed Consolidated Financial and Operational Information(US$ in millions, except per share, per pound and per ounce amounts)      Three Months Ended June 30,      Six Months Ended June 30,         2016       2015       2016       2015          (unaudited)      (unaudited)       Financial Information                   Revenues                    Copper sales      $     37.6      $     49.3      $     65.7      $     81.5        Gold sales       64.6       56.3       109.9       92.3        Molybdenum sales       22.3       20.9       41.9       63.7        Tolling, calcining and other       4.2       7.6       8.6       19.6         Total revenues       128.7       134.1       226.1       257.1       Costs and expenses                    Cost of sales                     Operating expenses       86.4       75.3       143.9       158.3         Depreciation, depletion and amortization       29.1       26.8       48.9       46.8        Total cost of sales       115.5       102.1       192.8       205.1        Total costs and expenses       132.5       122.0       222.5       239.8       Operating (loss) income       (3.8)       12.1       3.6       17.3       Other expense (income)       23.5       6.7       (11.7)       115.8       (Loss) income before income and mining taxes       (27.3)       5.4       15.3       (98.5)       Income and mining tax expense (benefit)       0.6       5.1       8.1       (11.6)       Net (loss) income      $     (27.9)      $     0.3      $     7.2      $     (86.9)       Net (loss) income per share                   Basic      $     (0.13)      $     0.00      $     0.03      $     (0.40)        Diluted      $     (0.13)      $     0.00      $     0.03      $     (0.40)       Cash generated by (used in) operating activities      $     6.3      $     23.9      $     (9.4)      $     18.6       Adjusted Non-GAAP Measures: (1)                   Adjusted net (loss) income (1)      $     (26.9)      $     (13.5)      $     (46.2)      $     (27.7)       Adjusted net (loss) income per share—basic (1)      $     (0.13)      $     (0.06)      $     (0.21)      $     (0.13)       Adjusted net (loss) income per share—diluted (1)      $     (0.13)      $     (0.06)      $     (0.21)      $     (0.13)     _______________________________________________________________________________   (1)         See "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" for the definition and reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures.             Three Months Ended      Six Months Ended          June 30, 2016      June 30, 2015      June 30, 2016      June 30, 2015         (unaudited)      (unaudited)       Operational Statistics                   Copper                    Payable production (000's lb) (2)       14,687       20,159       33,749       35,564        Cash cost ($/payable lb produced) - By-Product (1)      $     0.37      $     0.48      $     0.60      $     0.75        Cash cost ($/payable lb produced) - Co-Product (1)      $     1.84      $     1.55      $     1.59      $     1.59        Copper sold (000's lb)       20,309       21,195       35,271       35,986        Average realized sales price ($/lb) (2)      $     2.15      $     2.63      $     2.16      $     2.56       Gold                Payable production (oz)       46,383       59,917       99,712       106,036        Cash cost ($/payable oz produced) - Co-Product (1)      $     728      $     434      $     618      $     462        Gold sold (oz)       62,314       57,920       106,705       94,670        Average realized sales price ($/oz) (1)      $     1,041      $     975      $     1,035      $     979        Molybdenum sold (000's lb):                     TC Mine and Endako Mine product      $     —      $     576      $     —      $     3,128         Purchased and processed product       3,014       1,679       6,050       3,412          3,014       2,255       6,050       6,540       Average realized sales price ($/lb)      $     7.38      $     9.23      $     6.92      $     9.73   _______________________________________________________________________________   (1)          See "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" for the definition and reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures.

See Item 1A of our 2015 Form 10-K for a discussion of risk factors relating to our production and cost guidance.    Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresIn addition to the condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with US GAAP, management uses certain non-GAAP financial measures to assess the Company's operating performance for the reasons described further below. These measures do not have standard meanings prescribed by US GAAP and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. The presentation of these measures is not intended to be considered in isolation from, as a substitute for, or as superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with US GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with the results of operations as determined in accordance with US GAAP.Read MoreAdjusted Net (Loss) Income, Adjusted Net (Loss) Income Per Share—Basic and DilutedManagement of the Company uses adjusted net (loss) income and adjusted net (loss) income per share, basic and diluted, to evaluate the Company's operating performance and for planning and forecasting future business operations. The Company believes the use of these measures allows investors and analysts to compare results of the continuing operations of the Company to similar operating results of other mining companies, by excluding unusual or infrequent items that are considered non-core to its business.Adjusted net (loss) income represents the (loss) income prepared in accordance with US GAAP, adjusted for significant non-cash items.For the first three and six months of 2016 and 2015 and for the five quarters ended June 30, 2016 , the significant items were the net gains and losses related to the impact of foreign exchange due primarily to intercompany notes and related tax effects. Additionally, for the fourth quarter of 2015, in connection with a change in its legal structure the Company also had a significant non-cash release of tax valuation allowances which were generated in prior years primarily as a result of asset impairments.In connection with management's strategy to manage cash balances, fund its operations and provide future tax benefits, the Company may enter into intercompany loan arrangements. At times, the loans are denominated in currencies other than the measurement currency of one of the parties. US GAAP requires that notes that are intended to be repaid should not be considered a capital contribution, and, therefore, the foreign exchange fluctuations related to these loans impact net (loss) income each period. At each period end, management compares the exchange rate between the Canadian and US dollars to the exchange rate at the end of the prior reporting period. The difference between those rates is recorded as an unrealized gain or loss on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive (Loss) Income at each period end. Settlement of these intercompany loans results in realized foreign exchange gains or losses recorded on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss). The loans between the parent company and its subsidiaries are the primary driver of our foreign exchange gains and losses, as discussed above, management does not consider gains or losses on foreign exchange in its evaluation of our financial performance. Management believes that presentation of our non-GAAP measures excluding these gains or losses provides useful information to the Company's investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations.Adjusted net (loss) income per share (basic and diluted) is calculated using adjusted net (loss) income, as defined above, divided by the weighted-average basic and weighted-average diluted shares outstanding during the period as determined in accordance with US GAAP. If the adjustments to net loss on a US GAAP basis result in non-GAAP adjusted net income, management calculates weighted-average diluted shares outstanding in accordance with US GAAP and uses that to calculate adjusted net income per diluted share. If the adjustments to net income on a US GAAP basis result in non-GAAP adjusted net loss, management utilizes weighted-average basic shares outstanding to calculate adjusted net income per diluted share in accordance with US GAAP.The following tables reconciles net (loss) income presented in accordance with US GAAP to the non-GAAP financial measures of adjusted net (loss) income and adjusted net (loss) income per share, basic and diluted, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 and for the previous four quarters. All figures within the tables are unaudited and are presented in US$ in millions, except shares and per share amounts.Non-GAAP Reconciliation    Three Months Ended June 30,      Six Months Ended June 30,        2016      2015      2016      2015       Net (loss) income     $     (27.9)      $     0.3      $     7.2      $     (86.9)       Add (Deduct):                   Loss (gain) on foreign exchange (1)      1.4       (17.2)       (59.2)       72.6        Tax (benefit) expense on foreign exchange (gain) loss      (0.4)       3.4       5.8       (13.4)       Non-GAAP adjusted net loss     $     (26.9)      $     (13.5)      $     (46.2)      $     (27.7)                     Net (loss) income per share                   Basic     $     (0.13)      $     0.00      $     0.03      $     (0.40)        Diluted     $     (0.13)      $     0.00      $     0.03      $     (0.40)       Adjusted net (loss) income per share               Basic     $     (0.13)      $     (0.06)      $     (0.21)      $     (0.13)        Diluted     $     (0.13)      $     (0.06)      $     (0.21)      $     (0.13)       Weighted-average shares                   Basic      221.7       218.0       222.4       216.2        Diluted      221.7       218.0       222.4       216.2   _______________________________________________________________________________   (1)      Included a foreign exchange gain of nil and $1.2 million presented in income and mining tax expense (benefit) on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, respectively.

Although, unit cash cost on a by-product and co-product basis are not measures of financial performance, do not have standardized meaning prescribed by US GAAP and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies, management believes these non-GAAP measures provide useful supplemental information to investors.Unit cash cost on a by-product and co-product basis represent the mining, milling, on-site general and administration, truck and rail transportation, warehousing, refining and treatment, and ocean freight and insurance costs; and exclude the effects of changes in inventory, other non-cash employee benefits, such as stock-based compensation, depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion.On a by-product basis, sales of by-product metals are deducted when computing cash costs in accordance with the cash cost standard endorsed by the World Gold Council and, previously, the Gold Institute.On a co-product basis, cash costs are allocated between copper and gold based on production. Copper production is stated in thousands of pounds. Gold production has been converted to thousands of copper equivalent (Cu eq.) pounds using the gold production for the periods presented, as well as the most recent quarterly average prices for copper and gold. The price used for copper is the most recent quarterly average of the Metals Bulletin Daily published price for LME settlement per tonne. The price used for gold is a weighted average of the most recent quarterly average of the Metals Bulletin Daily published prices for daily average London price per ounce adjusted for the fixed price established under the Gold Stream Arrangement ( $435 per oz).The following tables provide a reconciliation of cash costs, unit cash costs, and operating expenses for Copper-Gold operations included in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive (Loss) Income in the determination of net (loss) income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 and the five quarters  ended June 30, 2016 .      Three Months Ended      Six Months Ended       Reconciliation to amounts reported below (US$ in millions)      Jun 30 2016      Jun 30 2015      Jun 30 2016      Jun 30 2015       Copper-Gold segment US GAAP operating expenses      $     61.9      $     49.6      $     97.9      $     83.4        Adjustments:                     Direct costs      $     8.6      $     8.4      $     15.0      $     14.9         Changes in inventory       (11.8)       (1.8)       (0.3)       5.2         Silver by-product credits (2)       1.7       1.2       2.7       2.4         Non cash costs and other       0.4       (0.2)       0.2       (0.4)       Non-GAAP cash costs      $     60.8      $     57.2      $     115.5      $     105.5               Three Months Ended      Six Months Ended       Non-GAAP cash costs (US$ in millions)      Jun 30 2016      Jun 30 2015      Jun 30 2016      Jun 30 2015        Direct mining costs (1)      $     48.1      $     45.0      $     92.9      $     82.4        Truck and rail transportation and warehousing costs       4.1       3.8       7.6       8.2       Costs reflected in inventory and operations costs      $     52.2      $     48.8      $     100.5      $     90.6        Refining and treatment costs       6.4       6.6       11.0       11.1        Ocean freight and insurance costs       2.2       1.8       4.0       3.8       Direct costs reflected in revenue and selling and marketing costs      $     8.6      $     8.4      $     15.0      $     14.9       Non-GAAP cash costs      $     60.8      $     57.2      $     115.5      $     105.5   _______________________________________________________________________________   (1)     Mining, milling and on-site general and administration costs.

from 2015. The decrease resulted from a downward revision of $27/oz. to the rate at which the deferred revenue liability resulting from the Gold Stream Arrangement was amortized. This rate is calculated based on the remaining deferred revenue liability and total ounces of refined gold owed to Royal Gold.    Conference Call and WebcastThompson Creek will hold a conference call for analysts and investors to discuss its second quarter 2016 financial results on Tuesday, August 9, 2016 , at 11:00 am Eastern Time .To participate in the call, please dial 1 (647) 427-7450 or 1 (888) 231-8191.
