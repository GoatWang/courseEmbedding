Specialties & ExpertiseDr. Chirag Patel has the following 7 areas of expertise,  1 specialty and 1 board certification.                     Internal Medicine
    An internist is a physician who focuses on the diagnosis and treatment of conditions that affect the adult population—both acute and chronic.


    These doctors are often who adults see as their primary physicians because they treat a broad range of illnesses that do not require surgical or specialist interventions. They also work to help a patient maintain optimal health in order to prevent the onset of disease.


    In addition to treating the common cold and flu, internists also treat chronic diseases like diabetes and heart disease.
