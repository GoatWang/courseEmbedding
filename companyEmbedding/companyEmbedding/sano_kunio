The first contactor has a large number of contact projections on the lower surface thereof and a large number of contact electrodes on the entire upper surface thereof. The contact projections are brought into simultaneous contact with the inspecting electrodes. The contact electrodes are electrically connected to the contact projections, respectively. The second contactor has a number of contact elements, such as pogo-pins, which are brought into contact with the contact electrodes of the first contactor.

Probe device



Patent number:  6072325
                                            

Abstract:  A probe device for testing a wafer divided into IC chips has a vessel that accommodates a wafer mounting stand and a flexible probe card having contactor bumps. The vessel is configured in a separatable manner of a grounded aluminum cover portion to which the probe card is integrally fixed and a base portion fixed to the wafer mounting stand. The interior of the vessel is sealed with the wafer and the probe card facing each other therein. A space above the probe card forms a damper chamber into which a fluid is introduced in such a manner that the pressure thereof presses the bumps on the probe card against the wafer. Bumps in a peripheral edge portion of the probe card are placed into contact with electrodes in a peripheral edge portion of the vessel, and thence to a test head. The above configuration can prevent the effects of external electrical noise and thus enable stable electrical measurements unaffected by changes in ambient temperature.

Probing method and device with contact film wiper feature



Patent number:  5982183
                                            

Abstract:  A probing device for inspecting semiconductor devices such as IC chips comprises a mounting section for supporting a silicon substrate wafer (i.e., an object to be inspected), a moving section for moving a probe card in such a way that contacts formed on a surface of the probe card can be pushed against electrode pads formed on the wafer, and a measuring section. The probe card is formed by joining a silicon nitride (Si.sub.3 N.sub.4) thin film (whose thermal expansion coefficient is roughly equal to that of the silicon wafer) to a lower surface of a wiring substrate. The wiring substrate is composed of a polyamide thin film (as an insulating layer) and conductive layers (as conductive signal line paths) formed in and on both the surfaces of the polyamide this film. Further, bumps (contacts) are arranged on the lower surface of the silicon nitride thin film.

Abstract:  First and second bumps electrically connected at first and second positions along a conductive run borne by a flexible substrate are respectively oriented for contact with a pad of a die under test and a pad of a tester. A probe frame is bonded to the substrate between connector frames bonded at opposite ends of the substrate. Alternatively, a pair of bumps exposed on the same surface of a flexible substrate are electrically connected at different positions along a conductive run. One of the bumps is oriented for contact with a pad of a die under test, and the other is in contact with a pad on a surface of a printed circuit board directed away from the die. The pad of the printed circuit board is provided for electrical connection to a tester.

Probing method and device



Patent number:  5559446
                                            

Abstract:  A probing device for inspecting semiconductor devices such as IC chips includes a mounting section for supporting a silicon substrate wafer (i.e., an object to be inspected), a moving section for moving a probe card in such a way that contacts formed on a surface of the probe card can be pushed against electrode pads formed on the wafer, and a measuring section. The probe card is formed by joining a silicon nitride (Si.sub.3 N.sub.4) thin film (whose thermal expansion coefficient is roughly equal to that of the silicon wafer) to a lower surface of a wiring substrate. The wiring substrate is composed of a polyamide thin film (as an insulating layer) and conductive layers (as conductive signal line paths) formed in and on both the surfaces of the polyamide thin film. Further, bumps (contacts) are arranged on the lower surface of the silicon nitride thin film.

Probe device



Patent number:  5550482
                                            

Abstract:  A probe device for testing a wafer divided into IC chips has a vessel that accommodates a wafer mounting stand and a flexible probe card having contactor bumps. The vessel is configured in a separatable manner of a grounded aluminum cover portion to which the probe card is integrally fixed and a base portion fixed to the wafer mounting stand. The interior of the vessel is sealed with the wafer and the probe card facing each other therein. A space above the probe card forms a damper chamber into which a fluid is introduced in such a manner that the pressure thereof presses the bumps on the probe card against the wafer. Bumps in a peripheral edge portion of the probe card are placed into contact with electrodes in a peripheral edge portion of the vessel, and thence to a test head. The above configuration can prevent the effects of external electrical noise and thus enable stable electrical measurements unaffected by changes in ambient temperature.
