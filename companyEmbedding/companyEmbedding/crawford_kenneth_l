 Educational Background



Graduate 


University of Michigan - School of Law

                  The University of Michigan, founded in 1817, celebrates a long and distinguished history. It was in 1787 that the Northwest Territorial Ordinance provided public land for this and other Midwestern universities and established a tradition of respect for excellence in higher education. Three Native American nations—the Ojibwa (Chippewa), Odawa (Ottawa), and Bodewadini (Potawatomi)—subsequently granted certain lands for use of the University of Michigan and by the end of the 19th century, Michigan was the largest and most generously supported public university in America and already a leader in graduate education.

The University of Michigan Law School, one of the oldest law schools in the nation, was founded in 1859. But unlike other highly selective law schools established in that era, admission was never restricted to the privileged. When Gabriel Hargo graduated from the Law School in 1870, Michigan—then the largest law school in the country—became the second American university to confer a law degree on an African American. That same year, Michigan was the first major law school to admit a woman, and in 1871, graduate Sarah Killgore became the first woman with a law degree in the nation to be admitted to the bar; by 1890, Michigan had graduated more women than any other law school. That commitment to access and diversity joined an equally powerful commitment to excellence, which continues to this day.

The earlier reviewer described the procedure accurately.  I'm scheduled for four more this week.  I have experienced a remarkable change in my knee as well as in my ability to walk without any pain much of the time.  Dr. Ellis stated on my last visit that such a quick improvement was not usual, but he was pleased I was feeling so much better.  While I'm not yet 100%, I would easily be able to live with what I now have, if this is as good as it gets.  And if improvement continues to happen, I will be very satisfied.  I read all the comments about the legal situation he's had in the past--this was after my first round of treatments--and it did give me pause before I returned.  But so far things are going very well.  I'll continue with treatment to completion, if I need it.  He had indicated that, should I feel the knee was up to the level of comfort I needed before finishing the 28 treatments, I could choose to stop with no penalty and without having to pay for treatments not received.  Dr. Ellis now uses a payment program called Care Credit, which is interest-free for up to 18 months. (After that, interest goes up to over 20%, so it's best to pay it off as quickly as possible!)Wright Michael Drariusangel ratedI had my spine fused by anothe...I had my spine fused by another surgeon in 2004 due to a very severe scoliosis curve.  I currently have hardware from right below my neck, all the way to my waist.  2 years ago Dr. Wright took x-rays & an MRI & discovered that I had a broken Herrington rod.  Unfortunately I was the primary breadwinner at that time & didn't have the ability to have anything done about it.  I called their office last Monday for an appointment, now that I'm ready & able to have surgery.  I was super suprised when they offered me an appointment for this morning!  (Saturday appointments are kind of rare with ortho's)  We looked over the imaging again & discussed the game plan & I should be having the surgery at the end of August/early September.  Needless to say, I'll be posting a review after I have recovered from everything.  He may come off as arrogant, or cocky to some, but it's mainly because he is very experienced & knowledgeable & knows what he is doing.  He talked to my husband & I for 30-45 min. & we never felt rushed at all.  Maybe appointments during the week are different, but we really did have a positive experience!Fong, Winston MDMichael M. ratedI have been cared for by Dr. Fong for 2 years and found him to be very knowledgeable and understanding. I have chronic neck pain due to a car accident over 13 years ago. I saw Dr. Fong after many years of pain and worsened shoulder pain and numbness in my fingers on the left hand. I had an MRI and Xrays that revealed multiple levels of disc damage and mild compression of the spinal cord at C5,C6. Dr Fong was conservative in his recommendation and I received tx at pain management x2 years with good management of my symptoms with steroid injections. Just recently my symptoms have worsened and an updated MRI was performed with Xrays too. Dr. Fong reviewed the findings and after a through physical exam and long discussion in his office we have decided to proceed with a 3 level fusion in the c-spine using my own bone for the procedure. I feel confident that Dr Fong did not rush into cutting me open and only advised it now because we have exhausted all conservative treatments.Abbas Toughanipour MDYancy B. ratedAt 43 I had a stroke, four years later I had a heart attack. I had Marfan Syndrome. Dr. Toughanipour had to perform the Bentall procedure which is a replacement of the aortic valve, aortic root and ascending aorta, with re-implantation of the coronary arteries into the graft. This operation is used to treat combined aortic valve and ascending aorta disease, including lesions associated with Marfan syndrome. On top of that he also had to perform a quadruple CABG (bypass). This was two surgeries in one that took 12 hours. He then sat be me for 3.5 hours because I wouldn't stop bleeding. This was a surgery that my surviving wasn't expected. I was off the ventilator within 24 hours and up walking within 48 hours and returned to work in six weeks. It's been 13 months since my surgery and I owe my life to Dr. Toughanipour. I feel great and have not had any complications. Dr. Toughanipour has to be one of the top cardiac surgeons in the nation!!Matthews, Rex R, MDmostlyharmless22 ratedTook Wonderful Care of My TwoHe took care of my daughter, who is now 25 years old, from the time she was 2.  She adored him and called him Dr. Pawpaw.  My son never warmed up to him quite like that but he did okay.  Dr. Matthews had some rude staff back then and probably still does but the doctor himself was exceptional.  If you took the time to research whatever problem your child was having, he would listen and respect you for it.  That is very hard to find.  I can't imagine that being aged out of him but it has been a number of years since we've seen him.  My first grandchild was born this last Friday and I will recommend Dr. Matthews, in spite of his age now, as a starting point.  I don't know what problems the other reviewer had with &amp;quot;office policies&amp;quot; being ridiculous but you can't judge a doctor based on your inability to follow whatever silly rules are laid out.Wright Michael DrAisha R. ratedExceptionalCan't stop smilingI have been a patient under Dr. Wright for several years. I have to say the man is truly GIFTED!!!!Dr. Wright put in an amazingly beautiful bridge. I was preparing for my wedding. As such, I was very nervous about the procedure, and how it would turn out (after all they were going to remove my six top front teeth to put in the bridge). He took the time to explain every procedure and was very supportive, they look so natural and I cannot stop smiling. I get complements regularly from strangers on how beautiful my smile is. Dr. Wright is truly a perfectionist, to my benefit, and won’t stop until he has achieved it. I have benefitted from his extraordinary talents, professionalism and humanity. His staff is outstanding, and supper supportive. I cannot recommend him and his staff more highly. Thank You Dr. Wright  Wright Michael Drrebecca.summers.359 ratedDr.. Wright got my husband out...Dr.. Wright got my husband out of his wheelchair.  The original Neurosurgeon had performed a lumbar fusion which led to a bone infection.  The infection deteriorated his entire lumbar region and required a Hickman Port for the antibiotics.  The port caused several blood clots to form and that delayed the repairative surgery for 6 months.  During that time, his spine collapsed and he was confined to a wheel chair.  The original surgeon told us that it was too risky and basically "over his head".  He referred  us to another Orthopedic surgeon who took one  look at the MRI and sent us straight to Dr. Wright.  After an 11 1/2 hour surgery, my husband was able to stand up for the first time in over a year. That was 7 years ago. I would highly recommend him to anyone and everyone!!!Pic Med Of Ok-Okclisapa1973 ratedOf of all of the places that m...Of of all of the places that my friends have been to over the years this was the best place we have found for weight loss and laser hair removal. 4 friends have gone and have the same opinion. I paid $150 to see a physician, lab work , get work out advice and an appetite script.  They don't sugar coat it and tell you want you want to hear.  They cheerlead sometimes but have gotten on to me as well.   Unlike others places that try to kill you with their prices, they are upfront about prices and very resonable.(why i picked them to begin with)  I used to pay 35 dollars a shot for my b12 at my doctors office and here its only $10. Another laser place was going to charge me 5 times as much to do my laser my underarms as well.  PicMeds medical staff is awesome.  Love those girls.  Center for Women's HealthKatelyn R. ratedWonderful!Want the best doctor? Come here! I promise you that they give the best care! Dr. Melendez was my Doctor, I saw a few of his colleagues over the years, when he was out of town and they are all amazing! Dr. Melendez is the only doctor I have ever fully trusted. He is the best doctor a scared first time mom could ask for. He put me completely at ease. I knew when I had an emergency C-section that i was in great hands! The incision is very low and you can't see it unless I show you or I'm  naked. It's the smallest C-section scar I have ever seen! They all are fun doctors with the biggest hearts! I will never go anywhere else as long as I live! The Broadway ClinicCheryl P. ratedI am shocked to read these reviews!  I had a WONDERFUL experience here with Dr. Brown.  he was EXCELLENT!  He was VERY skilled and my back was MUCH better after my treatments there.  He was EXTREMELY kind and spent ALL the time explaining things to me that I needed.  I felt like I was the only patient he had!  Dr Brown went out of his way to be helpful with me as did ALL the therapists.  My wait to see the doctor was not any longer than any other doctor.  In fact, the wait time was SHORTER than most doctor's offices.  I wish I could go there ALL the time.  LOVE LOVE LOVE Dr Brown and Broadway Clinic!!  Highly recommend them!Did You Know?Physicians and surgeons help to keep people - from infants to the elderly - as healthy as possible. These individuals provide diagnoses and treatments for a wide variety of ailments, and preventative care and early detection for more serious illnesses. Whether you love or hate going to the doctor, the fact is your physician is there to listen to your health concerns, take preventative measures against diseases and advise you on your options for staying in tip-top shape.In 2013, there were more than 1 million doctors of medicine in the U.S., over 854,000 of which were active. Additionally, in 2012, there were about 18,000 active general surgeons in the country. It's important to know which type of physician or surgeon you need, how to choose the best one, and account for other considerations in order to stay healthy.Different Types of PhysiciansPatients can choose from a wide variety of physicians depending on doctor specialty and what problems they are experiencing. Here are a few of the most common types of physicians that you may see in your lifetime:General Practitioner
Your GP is the doctor that you go to for regular checkups, vaccines and to identify health issues. GPs can treat many different illnesses and injuries, from the common cold to a broken arm. If your health requires a second opinion or expert care, the GP will refer you to a specialist who has the skills to focus in on the issue.Cardiologist
Heart attacks and heart disease are some of the most common afflictions seen across the country, making cardiologists important to your long-term health. These physicians specialize in studying and treating the heart and related diseases.Dentist
Other than a GP, the dentist is likely the most common physician you'll ever see. These professionals work with the human mouth, ensuring that your teeth and gum health are up to par. Patients typically go to the dentist twice a year.Dermatologist
Dermatologists are focused on skin-related issues and diseases, from skin cancers, to acute acne, eczema, psoriasis, and general cosmetic concerns like aging and scars. Most will also perform annual or semi-annual mole checks to screen for any signs of melanoma, the most serious form of skin cancer.ENT
If you have a number of sinus infections or have had your tonsils taken out, you've likely seen an ENT specialist. ENTs handle ailments related to the ear, nose and throat, often related to taking out tonsils and treating hearing issues.OB/GYN
For many women, their gynecologist and obstetrician are the same person. These professionals work with the female reproductive system to focus on reproductive health, fertility issues, prenatal care, options for new and expectant mothers, neonatal care and childbirth. OB/GYNs can also help in the early detection of breast or cervical cancer.Choosing a PhysicianThere are obviously a number of physicians that you can choose from, but how do you know if they're the best choice for you? Here are a few considerations to help you pick a physician:Look at Your Insurance
Before you get down to the details, you need to verify which doctors are covered by your insurance and whether they are in or out of your carrier's network. Rates may be cheaper if the doc is in network – a doctor can be covered by your insurance but not necessarily in network. Out of network is typically more expensive. Doctors often add and drop plans, so it's important to ensure that your options are compatible with your insurance plan. Doing your homework will help you avoid unexpected expenses. Check for Board Certification
Your physician should be certified through the American Board of Medical Specialties. Doctors must earn a medical degree from a qualified school, complete three to seven years of residency training, be licensed by a state medical board and pass one or more ABMS exams to be certified.Examine the Reviews
Reviews of a doctor can reveal a lot about what your experience may be like. People may grade on staff friendliness, availability and effectiveness of treatment. Looking at these evaluations and getting recommendations from family and friends can direct you toward a physician for your needs.Choosing a SurgeonSurgeons can literally hold your life in their hands, and it's important to find the best one that can put you at ease and treat you effectivelyCompatibility Factor
You need to feel comfortable with your surgeon. It's important to communicate your concerns and that your surgeon can respond adequately. Surgeons should be willing to go over the details of your procedure and answer any questions that you may have. They must take the time to discuss and address your worries.Expertise Level
If you're going in for surgery, you want someone that knows what they're doing and has a high success rate. Ask how often the surgeon performs this surgery and try to find one that regularly does it. This will give you peace of mind that you're in capable hands.Understanding Your InsuranceYour decision on a physician or surgeon can be majorly affected by the insurance plan you have. You may have insurance through employment, your spouse, your parents if you're under 26, or the marketplace if the previous options don't apply to you. It's important to understand how your insurance works to have the full picture of what you'll need to pay for.Your insurance will have a deductible, which is the amount that you're responsible to pay for covered medical expenses. Some plans have coinsurances, where you must pay a certain percentage of the bill, and insurance will cover the rest. Co-pays state a flat rate for certain services, like paying $20 when you visit your GP or a $100 co-pay for an emergency room visit. Once you reach your out-of-pocket maximum, which will differ if you're an individual or within a family plan, your insurance may pay for 100 percent of covered medical expenses for the rest of the plan year.If you plan to go to the doctor, need medication or have been recommended for surgery, call your insurance provider or go online to see what your plan covers. You can choose the best doctor for your needs, understand your options and prevent yourself from being blindsided by medical expenses.Setting Your AppointmentMost doctors require a phone call for an appointment, although some may provide online scheduling as well. Be sure to have your insurance card with you when you set an appointment, and to bring it with you to the actual appointment. They need the ID numbers to verify your coverage, and will usually make a copy of the card for their files so you don't have to show it again unless your insurance changes.When you call, let them know if you're a new patient, as this will require you to complete some paperwork for your first visit. Tell them the reason for your visit, such as your symptoms if you're feeling sick. It's also important to inform them if you have Medicaid and to find out if you need to bring anything to the visit, like current medications or medical records.From here, the receptionist will likely ask what dates and times work best for you. During your call, it's important to be honest about your symptoms and the reason for your visit. This information will help the doctor treat you and give him or her an idea of what to expect. Your appointment may progress faster as a result, and the doctor can come prepared with a list of options to better care for you.RisksDoctors see a number of patients in a day, sometimes in 15-minute increments in areas where the physicians are in high demand. This can leave little time for doctors to perform thorough examinations, and they can end up missing certain problem indicators. While some problems, like a cold or flu, can be diagnosed in this time, more complex ailments require attention, which takes up time. Reviews can illuminate which doctors actively spend the necessary time with their patients and which ones are pressed against the clock to meet demand.Surgery has some more dire risks attached to it, so be sure to talk to your surgeon about the potential issues that can come up as a result of your procedure. If a patient has a reaction to anesthesia, it can cause very serious complications, but this is an uncommon occurrence. Blood clots can be a significant problem after surgery, often caused by inactivity during recovery. Infections, numbness, scarring, swelling and death are all possible, but the likelihood of these issues will vary depending on the type of surgery you're undergoing. Talk to your doctor about your concerns and your risk potential.AftercareSurgery affects people in different ways, but as you begin to emerge from anesthesia, you'll want to alert your nurse to any issues you may have. The nurse will tell you how the procedure went, what effect it will have on your condition, what to expect when you get home and how long it will take to get back to normal. If you start feeling pain, the nurse may give you medication to stop it from getting worse. When possible, it's also advised to move around to avoid blood clots from developing in your legs. This can be as simple as occasionally flexing your knee or rotating your foot. Some surgeries are outpatient procedures, where people are released the same day. For major surgeries, patients may stay at the hospital for a few days to be monitored and address any concerns before being sent home. Discuss with your surgeon the projected length of the hospital stay and what you need to bring.Recovery and Follow-upYour recovery time and follow-up expectations will vary depending on your procedure. For example, you can be expected to be on your feet within a few days of having your wisdom teeth taken out, but it may be weeks before you have fully recovered from a broken foot or heart-valve surgery. Your surgeon will give you a list of things that you'll need to do during this time, including what medications to take and when you'll be able to get back to work and other activities.Every surgery will have a follow-up call or appointment to discuss your recovery and allow you to ask any questions about unusual symptoms or changes in your overall health. If you have a major operation, like heart surgery, it's important to make regular checkups with your doctor or a specialist to ensure that everything is normal. Visiting a doctor will help deter infection and verify that everything is healing as expected. These appointments will give you peace of mind about your state of health and ensure that any issues are caught early on.
