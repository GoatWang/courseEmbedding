Emergent BioSolutions Secures Exclusive Worldwide Rights to Valneva's Zika Vaccine Technology



Parties to collaborate through Phase 1 clinical development 
Phase 1 trial expected to commence in late 2017 or early 2018

GAITHERSBURG, Md., July  26, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Emergent BioSolutions Inc. (NYSE:EBS) today announced a licensing agreement with Valneva SE for global exclusive rights to Valneva's Zika vaccine technology, ZIKV. Emergent and Valneva will co-develop ZIKV-VLA1601, a highly purified inactivated vaccine candidate against the Zika virus, from preclinical development through completion of a Phase 1 safety and immunogenicity clinical trial. ZIKV-VLA1601, which has shown to elicit functional antibody responses, is based on Valneva's established inactivated, whole virus manufacturing platform on which its licensed Japanese Encephalitis vaccine was developed and produced.
"Emergent is focused on providing preparedness solutions to public health threats and emerging infectious diseases," said Adam Havey, executive vice president business operations of Emergent BioSolutions. "This commitment extends beyond acquiring revenue-generating products and advancing our own products to aligning with partners such as Valneva to develop innovative products that could potentially serve the needs of both government customers and the commercial market."
Under the terms of the agreement, Emergent will pay Valneva €1 million upfront and will get exclusive rights to use Valneva's intellectual property and know-how related to Zika product development. The companies are expected to enter into a technology transfer agreement at a later time to enable transfer of Valneva's technology to Emergent's Bayview manufacturing facility in Baltimore, Maryland.
The companies plan to initiate the Phase 1 trial in late 2017 or early 2018 and will share all costs until the availability of Phase 1 data, which is anticipated within six months from trial initiation. Emergent will have the option to continue the development arrangement with Valneva for a milestone payment of €5 million, upon availability of Phase 1 data. The agreement also provides Valneva potential additional milestone payments of up to €44 million related to product development, approval, commercialization, and product sales, and future royalties on annual net sales.
Emergent has product candidates in various stages of development that target emerging infectious diseases such as Zika, Ebola, dengue, and influenza, including a Zika hyperimmune therapeutic being developed on the company's hyperimmune platform.

BioThrax[edit]
Further information: Anthrax vaccine




Anthrax Vaccine Adsorbed



According to the U.S. National Library of Medicine, BioThrax was first made available in 1970.[16] BioThrax (Anthrax Vaccine Adsorbed), a vaccine licensed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.[17] Following a study by scientists from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,[18] on December 19, 2008, Emergent received final FDA licensing for use of BioThrax five doses for intramuscular injection.[19] Later in 2009, Emergent received approval from the FDA to extend the shelf life of its anthrax vaccine from three to four years. BioThrax was approved for distribution in the United States.[20][not in citation given] BioThrax has received marketing approval in India, Singapore, and Germany.[21][22][23]
The FDA gave BioThrax an "orphan drug" designation in April 2014.[24] The FDA gives that status to drugs that are used to treat rare diseases.[24] BioThrax is the only anthrax vaccine licensed by the FDA.[24]
As of April 2014, Emergent has sold over 66 million doses of BioThrax to the U.S. government.[25] Three million U.S. military personnel have received the BioThrax vaccine.[25]
The main buyer of BioThrax is the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).[26] The CDC buys BioThrax for the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS).[26] The government uses the SNS to protect the public in the event of a national emergency like a terrorist attack.[26] As of December 2016, Emergent has a $911 million contract with the CDC for BioThrax. The BioThrax vaccines will go to the SNS. The contract will supply around 29.4 million doses of the vaccine. Additionally, the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) released a notice of intent to purchase around $100 million of BioThrax for the SNS in 2017.[27]
Emergent submitted an application to the FDA for use of a large facility in Lansing, Michigan to produce BioThrax. On June 21, 2016, Emergent announced that it had moved a step forward in the process: the FDA completed the pre-approval phase of its inspection.[28]

Emergent BioSolutions was founded on September 5, 1998, under the name BioPort, and renamed Emergent BioSolutions in 2004.[40] At the time, the Michigan Department of Public Health, though its Michigan Biologics Products Institute, owned an anthrax vaccine manufacturing facility in Lansing, Michigan. BioPort purchased the facility and the rights to manufacture the vaccine for the U.S. military.[41][42]
After the 2001 anthrax attacks following the terrorist attacks on September 11, BioPort worked with the U.S. government to supply anthrax countermeasures.[43]
Emergent became a publicly traded company in 2006, with its stock trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol EBS.[43]
In June 2012, Emergent, along with Novartis and the Texas A&M University System was selected by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services as one of the three Centers for Innovation in Advanced Development and Manufacturing. The public-private partnership granted Emergent $163 million over eight years to assist in the development of countermeasures for health, nuclear and radiological epidemics.[44] The purpose is to produce medical countermeasures in the event of a national pandemic.[45] Emergent's facility is located in Maryland and the company expects the site to be operational by the year 2020.[45]
On June 27, 2016, the US Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority contracted with Emergent Biosolutions to develop a vaccine for the Zika virus. The contract is spread out over 30 months and is worth around $22 million.[46][47] The vaccine could reach stage-one clinical trials by early 2017.[48] As of the end of June 2016, 60 countries and territories had reported transmission of the Zika virus from mosquitoes.[47] Emergent could become the first company to develop a vaccine for the virus.[46]
In December 2016, Health Canada approved the purchase of Emergent's new botulism antitoxin called Botulism Antitoxin Heptavalent (BAT). The CDC and Public Health Agency of Canada both identified botulism, a type of food poisoning, as a likely biological threat. Emergent already has a ten-year contract with the Canadian military and national health service to supply BAT that began in 2012. Emergent also provides BAT to the U.S. Strategic National Stockpile.[49] BAT was first licensed in the U.S. in 2013 and is the only botulism antitoxin available in the U.S. for naturally-occurring cases of non-infant botulism.[50]
On March 31, 2017, Emergent said it signed a modification to its contract with BARDA to "manufacture and store bulk drug substance for its botulism antitoxin, BAT."[51] The contract is valued at approximately $53 million for five years. The contract modification was technical in nature; it allows Emergent to file and deliver the final drug product to the Strategic National Stockpile in the future.[51]
Soligenix Inc. and Emergent agreed to establish a “commercially viable production technology” for the development of RiVax, a potential vaccine aimed to protect against ricin exposure. Currently, there are no treatments for ricin poisoning that have been proven effective. Soligenix is a late-stage biopharmaceutical company that specializes in the development of treatments for rare diseases. A product of castor oil production, the ricin toxin can be a useful biological weapon due to its extreme potency, stability, and accessibility. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases funded the development of RiVax costing an estimated $24.7 million. The organization also financially backed the contract between Emergent and Soligenix. Most of the work will be conducted in Baltimore, Maryland, at Emergent’s manufacturing facility.[52]
Emergent is a member of the Alliance for Biosecurity, a group of companies and organizations that work towards improving the ability to respond to biological threats with vaccines and other countermeasures.[53][54]
Leadership[edit]
The current president and CEO of Emergent Biosolutions is Daniel J. Abdun-Nabi. He has held the position since April 1, 2012.[55] Prior to that, he was the president and chief operating officer. He holds an M.L.T. from Georgetown University, J.D. from the University of San Diego, and B.A. from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst.[56]
In addition to running Emergent, Abdun-Nabi speaks publicly on matters related to national security. For example, on April 1, 2015, he spoke as a panelist before the Hudson Institute think tank about how to prepare and respond to threats from biological and chemical weapons. The event was part of the Blue Ribbon Study Panel on Biodefense, a group of experts that analyzed the United States' defense capabilities against biological threats.[57] In 2015, Abdun-Nabi organized a visit by former Florida Governor Jeb Bush to Emergent's Lansing facility to speak to employees about ways the government and companies such as Emergent could work with each other to help defend the U.S. against terrorist attacks.[58] Abdun-Nabi sits on the board of directors at BioHealth Innovation, a public-private partnership that helps bring bio-health products to the marketplace.[59]
Financial information[edit]
Forbes recognized Emergent as the top performing company in the state of Maryland for the 2015-2016 fiscal year. Forbes tracked the return of every public company between from June 8, 2015 to June 8, 2016. Emergent had a total return during that time period of 38.2 percent. In 2015, Emergent had revenue of $522 million.[60]
2014-2015 activity and financial figures[edit]
According to ZACKs, Emergent's acquisition of Cangene made both of Emergent's divisions (Biosciences and Biodefense) stronger. In addition to the Cangene acquisition, Emergent and the German human antibody developer MorphySys AG in 2014 began collaborating on a prostate cancer drug called ES414. As of January 2015, the drug is in the pre-clinical stage.[61]
In early January 2015, Emergent publicly released its preliminary financial totals for the 2014 year. The company saw an increase in revenue, GAAP net income,[a] and adjusted net income. Revenue amounted to between $445–$450 million, which is 43% higher than revenue earned in 2013. GAAP net income was between $36 and $38 million (a 19% increase). Adjusted net income increased by 49 percent to between $53 and $55 million.[62]
Also in January, the company gave what is known as "guidance" (an accounting term meaning a company tells the public what it expects to earn in the future[63]) for 2015. Emergent expects $90–105 million in sales in the first three months of 2015; and between $510–540 million for the full year.[61] Emergent sold more BioThrax in 2014 than in the previous year (BioThrax sales amounted to approximately $246 million). According to company statements, Emergent believes that the growth in BioThrax sales along with stronger sales of other products from its Biodefense division will drive growth in 2015.[62] The Motley Fool, an investment information company characterized in its Yahoo! Finance profile as "the king of personal investing tips",[64] believes that Emergent's drug to treat hemophilia B, called Ixinity, will also drive growth in 2015. As of January 21, 2015, the FDA was reviewing Emergent's application for Ixinity approval.[65]

R&D and manufacturing operations[edit]
Main article: Anthrax Vaccine Adsorbed
In addition to the anthrax vaccine, Emergent BioSolutions develops and manufactures vaccines and therapeutics for the prevention or treatment of several diseases.[67] One of Emergent's medical countermeasure products is RSDL, a lotion that clears and neutralizes chemical warfare agents. The product is used in over 20 countries around the world.[68] RSDL is made of the chemicals Dekon 139 2,3 butanedione monoxime (DAM). According to the Chemical Hazards Emergency Medical Management office within the United States Department of Health and Human Services, "RSDL is used as a medical device for the decontamination of skin exposed to chemical warfare agents such as sulfur mustard, VX, VR and certain biological toxins."[69]
As of 2017, Emergent manufactures the following products:[70]

BioThrax (Anthrax Vaccine Adsorbed)

Public affairs[edit]
Emergent Biosolutions was among many companies giving financial support to delegations at both major party political conventions in the summer of 2016. The conventions used the contributions for receptions, food and transportation, but by law could not use contributions to fund campaigns. For example, Emergent hosted a breakfast reception at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia. The company sent representatives to both conventions with the aim of specifically meeting with Maryland delegates to educate the delegates about medical countermeasures.[72]
Emergent runs a charitable giving program called Give Corporate Social Responsibility. The company has given money to the Lansing, Michigan school district. Prominent donations and scholarships include; $15,000 to Lansing J. W. Sexton High School for the purchase of equipment for the AP Biology program,[73] $25,000 to Sexton High School for engineering equipment,[74] and $25,000 to the Lansing Promise scholarship fund[74]
Emergent is also a donor to the "Relentless Tour", an anti-bullying program that tries to raise awareness of autism and the problem of autistic children being bullied.[75]

BioThrax[edit]
Further information: Anthrax vaccine




Anthrax Vaccine Adsorbed



According to the U.S. National Library of Medicine, BioThrax was first made available in 1970.[16] BioThrax (Anthrax Vaccine Adsorbed), a vaccine licensed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.[17] Following a study by scientists from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,[18] on December 19, 2008, Emergent received final FDA licensing for use of BioThrax five doses for intramuscular injection.[19] Later in 2009, Emergent received approval from the FDA to extend the shelf life of its anthrax vaccine from three to four years. BioThrax was approved for distribution in the United States.[20][not in citation given] BioThrax has received marketing approval in India, Singapore, and Germany.[21][22][23]
The FDA gave BioThrax an "orphan drug" designation in April 2014.[24] The FDA gives that status to drugs that are used to treat rare diseases.[24] BioThrax is the only anthrax vaccine licensed by the FDA.[24]
As of April 2014, Emergent has sold over 66 million doses of BioThrax to the U.S. government.[25] Three million U.S. military personnel have received the BioThrax vaccine.[25]
The main buyer of BioThrax is the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).[26] The CDC buys BioThrax for the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS).[26] The government uses the SNS to protect the public in the event of a national emergency like a terrorist attack.[26] As of December 2016, Emergent has a $911 million contract with the CDC for BioThrax. The BioThrax vaccines will go to the SNS. The contract will supply around 29.4 million doses of the vaccine. Additionally, the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) released a notice of intent to purchase around $100 million of BioThrax for the SNS in 2017.[27]
Emergent submitted an application to the FDA for use of a large facility in Lansing, Michigan to produce BioThrax. On June 21, 2016, Emergent announced that it had moved a step forward in the process: the FDA completed the pre-approval phase of its inspection.[28]

Emergent BioSolutions was founded on September 5, 1998, under the name BioPort, and renamed Emergent BioSolutions in 2004.[40] At the time, the Michigan Department of Public Health, though its Michigan Biologics Products Institute, owned an anthrax vaccine manufacturing facility in Lansing, Michigan. BioPort purchased the facility and the rights to manufacture the vaccine for the U.S. military.[41][42]
After the 2001 anthrax attacks following the terrorist attacks on September 11, BioPort worked with the U.S. government to supply anthrax countermeasures.[43]
Emergent became a publicly traded company in 2006, with its stock trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol EBS.[43]
In June 2012, Emergent, along with Novartis and the Texas A&M University System was selected by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services as one of the three Centers for Innovation in Advanced Development and Manufacturing. The public-private partnership granted Emergent $163 million over eight years to assist in the development of countermeasures for health, nuclear and radiological epidemics.[44] The purpose is to produce medical countermeasures in the event of a national pandemic.[45] Emergent's facility is located in Maryland and the company expects the site to be operational by the year 2020.[45]
On June 27, 2016, the US Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority contracted with Emergent Biosolutions to develop a vaccine for the Zika virus. The contract is spread out over 30 months and is worth around $22 million.[46][47] The vaccine could reach stage-one clinical trials by early 2017.[48] As of the end of June 2016, 60 countries and territories had reported transmission of the Zika virus from mosquitoes.[47] Emergent could become the first company to develop a vaccine for the virus.[46]
In December 2016, Health Canada approved the purchase of Emergent's new botulism antitoxin called Botulism Antitoxin Heptavalent (BAT). The CDC and Public Health Agency of Canada both identified botulism, a type of food poisoning, as a likely biological threat. Emergent already has a ten-year contract with the Canadian military and national health service to supply BAT that began in 2012. Emergent also provides BAT to the U.S. Strategic National Stockpile.[49] BAT was first licensed in the U.S. in 2013 and is the only botulism antitoxin available in the U.S. for naturally-occurring cases of non-infant botulism.[50]
On March 31, 2017, Emergent said it signed a modification to its contract with BARDA to "manufacture and store bulk drug substance for its botulism antitoxin, BAT."[51] The contract is valued at approximately $53 million for five years. The contract modification was technical in nature; it allows Emergent to file and deliver the final drug product to the Strategic National Stockpile in the future.[51]
Soligenix Inc. and Emergent agreed to establish a “commercially viable production technology” for the development of RiVax, a potential vaccine aimed to protect against ricin exposure. Currently, there are no treatments for ricin poisoning that have been proven effective. Soligenix is a late-stage biopharmaceutical company that specializes in the development of treatments for rare diseases. A product of castor oil production, the ricin toxin can be a useful biological weapon due to its extreme potency, stability, and accessibility. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases funded the development of RiVax costing an estimated $24.7 million. The organization also financially backed the contract between Emergent and Soligenix. Most of the work will be conducted in Baltimore, Maryland, at Emergent’s manufacturing facility.[52]
Emergent is a member of the Alliance for Biosecurity, a group of companies and organizations that work towards improving the ability to respond to biological threats with vaccines and other countermeasures.[53][54]
Leadership[edit]
The current president and CEO of Emergent Biosolutions is Daniel J. Abdun-Nabi. He has held the position since April 1, 2012.[55] Prior to that, he was the president and chief operating officer. He holds an M.L.T. from Georgetown University, J.D. from the University of San Diego, and B.A. from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst.[56]
In addition to running Emergent, Abdun-Nabi speaks publicly on matters related to national security. For example, on April 1, 2015, he spoke as a panelist before the Hudson Institute think tank about how to prepare and respond to threats from biological and chemical weapons. The event was part of the Blue Ribbon Study Panel on Biodefense, a group of experts that analyzed the United States' defense capabilities against biological threats.[57] In 2015, Abdun-Nabi organized a visit by former Florida Governor Jeb Bush to Emergent's Lansing facility to speak to employees about ways the government and companies such as Emergent could work with each other to help defend the U.S. against terrorist attacks.[58] Abdun-Nabi sits on the board of directors at BioHealth Innovation, a public-private partnership that helps bring bio-health products to the marketplace.[59]
Financial information[edit]
Forbes recognized Emergent as the top performing company in the state of Maryland for the 2015-2016 fiscal year. Forbes tracked the return of every public company between from June 8, 2015 to June 8, 2016. Emergent had a total return during that time period of 38.2 percent. In 2015, Emergent had revenue of $522 million.[60]
2014-2015 activity and financial figures[edit]
According to ZACKs, Emergent's acquisition of Cangene made both of Emergent's divisions (Biosciences and Biodefense) stronger. In addition to the Cangene acquisition, Emergent and the German human antibody developer MorphySys AG in 2014 began collaborating on a prostate cancer drug called ES414. As of January 2015, the drug is in the pre-clinical stage.[61]
In early January 2015, Emergent publicly released its preliminary financial totals for the 2014 year. The company saw an increase in revenue, GAAP net income,[a] and adjusted net income. Revenue amounted to between $445–$450 million, which is 43% higher than revenue earned in 2013. GAAP net income was between $36 and $38 million (a 19% increase). Adjusted net income increased by 49 percent to between $53 and $55 million.[62]
Also in January, the company gave what is known as "guidance" (an accounting term meaning a company tells the public what it expects to earn in the future[63]) for 2015. Emergent expects $90–105 million in sales in the first three months of 2015; and between $510–540 million for the full year.[61] Emergent sold more BioThrax in 2014 than in the previous year (BioThrax sales amounted to approximately $246 million). According to company statements, Emergent believes that the growth in BioThrax sales along with stronger sales of other products from its Biodefense division will drive growth in 2015.[62] The Motley Fool, an investment information company characterized in its Yahoo! Finance profile as "the king of personal investing tips",[64] believes that Emergent's drug to treat hemophilia B, called Ixinity, will also drive growth in 2015. As of January 21, 2015, the FDA was reviewing Emergent's application for Ixinity approval.[65]

R&D and manufacturing operations[edit]
Main article: Anthrax Vaccine Adsorbed
In addition to the anthrax vaccine, Emergent BioSolutions develops and manufactures vaccines and therapeutics for the prevention or treatment of several diseases.[67] One of Emergent's medical countermeasure products is RSDL, a lotion that clears and neutralizes chemical warfare agents. The product is used in over 20 countries around the world.[68] RSDL is made of the chemicals Dekon 139 2,3 butanedione monoxime (DAM). According to the Chemical Hazards Emergency Medical Management office within the United States Department of Health and Human Services, "RSDL is used as a medical device for the decontamination of skin exposed to chemical warfare agents such as sulfur mustard, VX, VR and certain biological toxins."[69]
As of 2017, Emergent manufactures the following products:[70]

BioThrax (Anthrax Vaccine Adsorbed)
Anthrasil (Anthrax Immune Globulin Intravenous)
BAT (Botulism Antitoxin Heptavalent)
VIGIV (CNJ-016) (Vaccinia Immune Globulin Intravenous)
RSDL (Reactive Skin Decontamination Lotion)

Products in development include:[71]

NuThrax (Anthrax Vaccine)

In phase II clinical trials, expected to enroll patients in phase III studies in 2018.


FLU-IGIV (Seasonal Influenza Therapeutic)

In phase II clinical trials


UV-4B (Dengue Therapeutic)
ZIKV-IG (Zika Therapeutic)
GC-072 (Burkholderia Therapeutic)
FILOV (Pan-filovirus Therapeutic (Ebola, Marburg, Sudan virus))

Public affairs[edit]
Emergent Biosolutions was among many companies giving financial support to delegations at both major party political conventions in the summer of 2016. The conventions used the contributions for receptions, food and transportation, but by law could not use contributions to fund campaigns. For example, Emergent hosted a breakfast reception at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia. The company sent representatives to both conventions with the aim of specifically meeting with Maryland delegates to educate the delegates about medical countermeasures.[72]
Emergent runs a charitable giving program called Give Corporate Social Responsibility. The company has given money to the Lansing, Michigan school district. Prominent donations and scholarships include; $15,000 to Lansing J. W. Sexton High School for the purchase of equipment for the AP Biology program,[73] $25,000 to Sexton High School for engineering equipment,[74] and $25,000 to the Lansing Promise scholarship fund[74]
Emergent is also a donor to the "Relentless Tour", an anti-bullying program that tries to raise awareness of autism and the problem of autistic children being bullied.[75]

BioThrax[edit]
Further information: Anthrax vaccine




Anthrax Vaccine Adsorbed



According to the U.S. National Library of Medicine, BioThrax was first made available in 1970.[16] BioThrax (Anthrax Vaccine Adsorbed), a vaccine licensed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.[17] Following a study by scientists from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,[18] on December 19, 2008, Emergent received final FDA licensing for use of BioThrax five doses for intramuscular injection.[19] Later in 2009, Emergent received approval from the FDA to extend the shelf life of its anthrax vaccine from three to four years. BioThrax was approved for distribution in the United States.[20][not in citation given] BioThrax has received marketing approval in India, Singapore, and Germany.[21][22][23]
The FDA gave BioThrax an "orphan drug" designation in April 2014.[24] The FDA gives that status to drugs that are used to treat rare diseases.[24] BioThrax is the only anthrax vaccine licensed by the FDA.[24]
As of April 2014, Emergent has sold over 66 million doses of BioThrax to the U.S. government.[25] Three million U.S. military personnel have received the BioThrax vaccine.[25]
The main buyer of BioThrax is the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).[26] The CDC buys BioThrax for the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS).[26] The government uses the SNS to protect the public in the event of a national emergency like a terrorist attack.[26] As of December 2016, Emergent has a $911 million contract with the CDC for BioThrax. The BioThrax vaccines will go to the SNS. The contract will supply around 29.4 million doses of the vaccine. Additionally, the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) released a notice of intent to purchase around $100 million of BioThrax for the SNS in 2017.[27]
Emergent submitted an application to the FDA for use of a large facility in Lansing, Michigan to produce BioThrax. On June 21, 2016, Emergent announced that it had moved a step forward in the process: the FDA completed the pre-approval phase of its inspection.[28]

Emergent BioSolutions was founded on September 5, 1998, under the name BioPort, and renamed Emergent BioSolutions in 2004.[40] At the time, the Michigan Department of Public Health, though its Michigan Biologics Products Institute, owned an anthrax vaccine manufacturing facility in Lansing, Michigan. BioPort purchased the facility and the rights to manufacture the vaccine for the U.S. military.[41][42]
After the 2001 anthrax attacks following the terrorist attacks on September 11, BioPort worked with the U.S. government to supply anthrax countermeasures.[43]
Emergent became a publicly traded company in 2006, with its stock trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol EBS.[43]
In June 2012, Emergent, along with Novartis and the Texas A&M University System was selected by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services as one of the three Centers for Innovation in Advanced Development and Manufacturing. The public-private partnership granted Emergent $163 million over eight years to assist in the development of countermeasures for health, nuclear and radiological epidemics.[44] The purpose is to produce medical countermeasures in the event of a national pandemic.[45] Emergent's facility is located in Maryland and the company expects the site to be operational by the year 2020.[45]
On June 27, 2016, the US Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority contracted with Emergent Biosolutions to develop a vaccine for the Zika virus. The contract is spread out over 30 months and is worth around $22 million.[46][47] The vaccine could reach stage-one clinical trials by early 2017.[48] As of the end of June 2016, 60 countries and territories had reported transmission of the Zika virus from mosquitoes.[47] Emergent could become the first company to develop a vaccine for the virus.[46]
In December 2016, Health Canada approved the purchase of Emergent's new botulism antitoxin called Botulism Antitoxin Heptavalent (BAT). The CDC and Public Health Agency of Canada both identified botulism, a type of food poisoning, as a likely biological threat. Emergent already has a ten-year contract with the Canadian military and national health service to supply BAT that began in 2012. Emergent also provides BAT to the U.S. Strategic National Stockpile.[49] BAT was first licensed in the U.S. in 2013 and is the only botulism antitoxin available in the U.S. for naturally-occurring cases of non-infant botulism.[50]
On March 31, 2017, Emergent said it signed a modification to its contract with BARDA to "manufacture and store bulk drug substance for its botulism antitoxin, BAT."[51] The contract is valued at approximately $53 million for five years. The contract modification was technical in nature; it allows Emergent to file and deliver the final drug product to the Strategic National Stockpile in the future.[51]
Soligenix Inc. and Emergent agreed to establish a “commercially viable production technology” for the development of RiVax, a potential vaccine aimed to protect against ricin exposure. Currently, there are no treatments for ricin poisoning that have been proven effective. Soligenix is a late-stage biopharmaceutical company that specializes in the development of treatments for rare diseases. A product of castor oil production, the ricin toxin can be a useful biological weapon due to its extreme potency, stability, and accessibility. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases funded the development of RiVax costing an estimated $24.7 million. The organization also financially backed the contract between Emergent and Soligenix. Most of the work will be conducted in Baltimore, Maryland, at Emergent’s manufacturing facility.[52]
Emergent is a member of the Alliance for Biosecurity, a group of companies and organizations that work towards improving the ability to respond to biological threats with vaccines and other countermeasures.[53][54]
Leadership[edit]
The current president and CEO of Emergent Biosolutions is Daniel J. Abdun-Nabi. He has held the position since April 1, 2012.[55] Prior to that, he was the president and chief operating officer. He holds an M.L.T. from Georgetown University, J.D. from the University of San Diego, and B.A. from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst.[56]
In addition to running Emergent, Abdun-Nabi speaks publicly on matters related to national security. For example, on April 1, 2015, he spoke as a panelist before the Hudson Institute think tank about how to prepare and respond to threats from biological and chemical weapons. The event was part of the Blue Ribbon Study Panel on Biodefense, a group of experts that analyzed the United States' defense capabilities against biological threats.[57] In 2015, Abdun-Nabi organized a visit by former Florida Governor Jeb Bush to Emergent's Lansing facility to speak to employees about ways the government and companies such as Emergent could work with each other to help defend the U.S. against terrorist attacks.[58] Abdun-Nabi sits on the board of directors at BioHealth Innovation, a public-private partnership that helps bring bio-health products to the marketplace.[59]
Financial information[edit]
Forbes recognized Emergent as the top performing company in the state of Maryland for the 2015-2016 fiscal year. Forbes tracked the return of every public company between from June 8, 2015 to June 8, 2016. Emergent had a total return during that time period of 38.2 percent. In 2015, Emergent had revenue of $522 million.[60]
2014-2015 activity and financial figures[edit]
According to ZACKs, Emergent's acquisition of Cangene made both of Emergent's divisions (Biosciences and Biodefense) stronger. In addition to the Cangene acquisition, Emergent and the German human antibody developer MorphySys AG in 2014 began collaborating on a prostate cancer drug called ES414. As of January 2015, the drug is in the pre-clinical stage.[61]
In early January 2015, Emergent publicly released its preliminary financial totals for the 2014 year. The company saw an increase in revenue, GAAP net income,[a] and adjusted net income. Revenue amounted to between $445–$450 million, which is 43% higher than revenue earned in 2013. GAAP net income was between $36 and $38 million (a 19% increase). Adjusted net income increased by 49 percent to between $53 and $55 million.[62]
Also in January, the company gave what is known as "guidance" (an accounting term meaning a company tells the public what it expects to earn in the future[63]) for 2015. Emergent expects $90–105 million in sales in the first three months of 2015; and between $510–540 million for the full year.[61] Emergent sold more BioThrax in 2014 than in the previous year (BioThrax sales amounted to approximately $246 million). According to company statements, Emergent believes that the growth in BioThrax sales along with stronger sales of other products from its Biodefense division will drive growth in 2015.[62] The Motley Fool, an investment information company characterized in its Yahoo! Finance profile as "the king of personal investing tips",[64] believes that Emergent's drug to treat hemophilia B, called Ixinity, will also drive growth in 2015. As of January 21, 2015, the FDA was reviewing Emergent's application for Ixinity approval.[65]

R&D and manufacturing operations[edit]
Main article: Anthrax Vaccine Adsorbed
In addition to the anthrax vaccine, Emergent BioSolutions develops and manufactures vaccines and therapeutics for the prevention or treatment of several diseases.[67] One of Emergent's medical countermeasure products is RSDL, a lotion that clears and neutralizes chemical warfare agents. The product is used in over 20 countries around the world.[68] RSDL is made of the chemicals Dekon 139 2,3 butanedione monoxime (DAM). According to the Chemical Hazards Emergency Medical Management office within the United States Department of Health and Human Services, "RSDL is used as a medical device for the decontamination of skin exposed to chemical warfare agents such as sulfur mustard, VX, VR and certain biological toxins."[69]
As of 2017, Emergent manufactures the following products:[70]

BioThrax (Anthrax Vaccine Adsorbed)
Anthrasil (Anthrax Immune Globulin Intravenous)
BAT (Botulism Antitoxin Heptavalent)
VIGIV (CNJ-016) (Vaccinia Immune Globulin Intravenous)
RSDL (Reactive Skin Decontamination Lotion)

Products in development include:[71]

NuThrax (Anthrax Vaccine)

In phase II clinical trials, expected to enroll patients in phase III studies in 2018.


FLU-IGIV (Seasonal Influenza Therapeutic)

In phase II clinical trials


UV-4B (Dengue Therapeutic)
ZIKV-IG (Zika Therapeutic)
GC-072 (Burkholderia Therapeutic)
FILOV (Pan-filovirus Therapeutic (Ebola, Marburg, Sudan virus))

Public affairs[edit]
Emergent Biosolutions was among many companies giving financial support to delegations at both major party political conventions in the summer of 2016. The conventions used the contributions for receptions, food and transportation, but by law could not use contributions to fund campaigns. For example, Emergent hosted a breakfast reception at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia. The company sent representatives to both conventions with the aim of specifically meeting with Maryland delegates to educate the delegates about medical countermeasures.[72]
Emergent runs a charitable giving program called Give Corporate Social Responsibility. The company has given money to the Lansing, Michigan school district. Prominent donations and scholarships include; $15,000 to Lansing J. W. Sexton High School for the purchase of equipment for the AP Biology program,[73] $25,000 to Sexton High School for engineering equipment,[74] and $25,000 to the Lansing Promise scholarship fund[74]
Emergent is also a donor to the "Relentless Tour", an anti-bullying program that tries to raise awareness of autism and the problem of autistic children being bullied.[75]

BioThrax[edit]
Further information: Anthrax vaccine




Anthrax Vaccine Adsorbed



According to the U.S. National Library of Medicine, BioThrax was first made available in 1970.[16] BioThrax (Anthrax Vaccine Adsorbed), a vaccine licensed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.[17] Following a study by scientists from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,[18] on December 19, 2008, Emergent received final FDA licensing for use of BioThrax five doses for intramuscular injection.[19] Later in 2009, Emergent received approval from the FDA to extend the shelf life of its anthrax vaccine from three to four years. BioThrax was approved for distribution in the United States.[20][not in citation given] BioThrax has received marketing approval in India, Singapore, and Germany.[21][22][23]
The FDA gave BioThrax an "orphan drug" designation in April 2014.[24] The FDA gives that status to drugs that are used to treat rare diseases.[24] BioThrax is the only anthrax vaccine licensed by the FDA.[24]
As of April 2014, Emergent has sold over 66 million doses of BioThrax to the U.S. government.[25] Three million U.S. military personnel have received the BioThrax vaccine.[25]
The main buyer of BioThrax is the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).[26] The CDC buys BioThrax for the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS).[26] The government uses the SNS to protect the public in the event of a national emergency like a terrorist attack.[26] As of December 2016, Emergent has a $911 million contract with the CDC for BioThrax. The BioThrax vaccines will go to the SNS. The contract will supply around 29.4 million doses of the vaccine. Additionally, the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) released a notice of intent to purchase around $100 million of BioThrax for the SNS in 2017.[27]
Emergent submitted an application to the FDA for use of a large facility in Lansing, Michigan to produce BioThrax. On June 21, 2016, Emergent announced that it had moved a step forward in the process: the FDA completed the pre-approval phase of its inspection.[28]

Emergent BioSolutions was founded on September 5, 1998, under the name BioPort, and renamed Emergent BioSolutions in 2004.[40] At the time, the Michigan Department of Public Health, though its Michigan Biologics Products Institute, owned an anthrax vaccine manufacturing facility in Lansing, Michigan. BioPort purchased the facility and the rights to manufacture the vaccine for the U.S. military.[41][42]
After the 2001 anthrax attacks following the terrorist attacks on September 11, BioPort worked with the U.S. government to supply anthrax countermeasures.[43]
Emergent became a publicly traded company in 2006, with its stock trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol EBS.[43]
In June 2012, Emergent, along with Novartis and the Texas A&M University System was selected by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services as one of the three Centers for Innovation in Advanced Development and Manufacturing. The public-private partnership granted Emergent $163 million over eight years to assist in the development of countermeasures for health, nuclear and radiological epidemics.[44] The purpose is to produce medical countermeasures in the event of a national pandemic.[45] Emergent's facility is located in Maryland and the company expects the site to be operational by the year 2020.[45]
On June 27, 2016, the US Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority contracted with Emergent Biosolutions to develop a vaccine for the Zika virus. The contract is spread out over 30 months and is worth around $22 million.[46][47] The vaccine could reach stage-one clinical trials by early 2017.[48] As of the end of June 2016, 60 countries and territories had reported transmission of the Zika virus from mosquitoes.[47] Emergent could become the first company to develop a vaccine for the virus.[46]
In December 2016, Health Canada approved the purchase of Emergent's new botulism antitoxin called Botulism Antitoxin Heptavalent (BAT). The CDC and Public Health Agency of Canada both identified botulism, a type of food poisoning, as a likely biological threat. Emergent already has a ten-year contract with the Canadian military and national health service to supply BAT that began in 2012. Emergent also provides BAT to the U.S. Strategic National Stockpile.[49] BAT was first licensed in the U.S. in 2013 and is the only botulism antitoxin available in the U.S. for naturally-occurring cases of non-infant botulism.[50]
On March 31, 2017, Emergent said it signed a modification to its contract with BARDA to "manufacture and store bulk drug substance for its botulism antitoxin, BAT."[51] The contract is valued at approximately $53 million for five years. The contract modification was technical in nature; it allows Emergent to file and deliver the final drug product to the Strategic National Stockpile in the future.[51]
Soligenix Inc. and Emergent agreed to establish a “commercially viable production technology” for the development of RiVax, a potential vaccine aimed to protect against ricin exposure. Currently, there are no treatments for ricin poisoning that have been proven effective. Soligenix is a late-stage biopharmaceutical company that specializes in the development of treatments for rare diseases. A product of castor oil production, the ricin toxin can be a useful biological weapon due to its extreme potency, stability, and accessibility. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases funded the development of RiVax costing an estimated $24.7 million. The organization also financially backed the contract between Emergent and Soligenix. Most of the work will be conducted in Baltimore, Maryland, at Emergent’s manufacturing facility.[52]
Emergent is a member of the Alliance for Biosecurity, a group of companies and organizations that work towards improving the ability to respond to biological threats with vaccines and other countermeasures.[53][54]
Leadership[edit]
The current president and CEO of Emergent Biosolutions is Daniel J. Abdun-Nabi. He has held the position since April 1, 2012.[55] Prior to that, he was the president and chief operating officer. He holds an M.L.T. from Georgetown University, J.D. from the University of San Diego, and B.A. from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst.[56]
In addition to running Emergent, Abdun-Nabi speaks publicly on matters related to national security. For example, on April 1, 2015, he spoke as a panelist before the Hudson Institute think tank about how to prepare and respond to threats from biological and chemical weapons. The event was part of the Blue Ribbon Study Panel on Biodefense, a group of experts that analyzed the United States' defense capabilities against biological threats.[57] In 2015, Abdun-Nabi organized a visit by former Florida Governor Jeb Bush to Emergent's Lansing facility to speak to employees about ways the government and companies such as Emergent could work with each other to help defend the U.S. against terrorist attacks.[58] Abdun-Nabi sits on the board of directors at BioHealth Innovation, a public-private partnership that helps bring bio-health products to the marketplace.[59]
Financial information[edit]
Forbes recognized Emergent as the top performing company in the state of Maryland for the 2015-2016 fiscal year. Forbes tracked the return of every public company between from June 8, 2015 to June 8, 2016. Emergent had a total return during that time period of 38.2 percent. In 2015, Emergent had revenue of $522 million.[60]
2014-2015 activity and financial figures[edit]
According to ZACKs, Emergent's acquisition of Cangene made both of Emergent's divisions (Biosciences and Biodefense) stronger. In addition to the Cangene acquisition, Emergent and the German human antibody developer MorphySys AG in 2014 began collaborating on a prostate cancer drug called ES414. As of January 2015, the drug is in the pre-clinical stage.[61]
In early January 2015, Emergent publicly released its preliminary financial totals for the 2014 year. The company saw an increase in revenue, GAAP net income,[a] and adjusted net income. Revenue amounted to between $445–$450 million, which is 43% higher than revenue earned in 2013. GAAP net income was between $36 and $38 million (a 19% increase). Adjusted net income increased by 49 percent to between $53 and $55 million.[62]
Also in January, the company gave what is known as "guidance" (an accounting term meaning a company tells the public what it expects to earn in the future[63]) for 2015. Emergent expects $90–105 million in sales in the first three months of 2015; and between $510–540 million for the full year.[61] Emergent sold more BioThrax in 2014 than in the previous year (BioThrax sales amounted to approximately $246 million). According to company statements, Emergent believes that the growth in BioThrax sales along with stronger sales of other products from its Biodefense division will drive growth in 2015.[62] The Motley Fool, an investment information company characterized in its Yahoo! Finance profile as "the king of personal investing tips",[64] believes that Emergent's drug to treat hemophilia B, called Ixinity, will also drive growth in 2015. As of January 21, 2015, the FDA was reviewing Emergent's application for Ixinity approval.[65]

R&D and manufacturing operations[edit]
Main article: Anthrax Vaccine Adsorbed
In addition to the anthrax vaccine, Emergent BioSolutions develops and manufactures vaccines and therapeutics for the prevention or treatment of several diseases.[67] One of Emergent's medical countermeasure products is RSDL, a lotion that clears and neutralizes chemical warfare agents. The product is used in over 20 countries around the world.[68] RSDL is made of the chemicals Dekon 139 2,3 butanedione monoxime (DAM). According to the Chemical Hazards Emergency Medical Management office within the United States Department of Health and Human Services, "RSDL is used as a medical device for the decontamination of skin exposed to chemical warfare agents such as sulfur mustard, VX, VR and certain biological toxins."[69]
As of 2017, Emergent manufactures the following products:[70]

BioThrax (Anthrax Vaccine Adsorbed)
Anthrasil (Anthrax Immune Globulin Intravenous)
BAT (Botulism Antitoxin Heptavalent)
VIGIV (CNJ-016) (Vaccinia Immune Globulin Intravenous)
RSDL (Reactive Skin Decontamination Lotion)

Products in development include:[71]

NuThrax (Anthrax Vaccine)

In phase II clinical trials, expected to enroll patients in phase III studies in 2018.


FLU-IGIV (Seasonal Influenza Therapeutic)

In phase II clinical trials


UV-4B (Dengue Therapeutic)
ZIKV-IG (Zika Therapeutic)
GC-072 (Burkholderia Therapeutic)
FILOV (Pan-filovirus Therapeutic (Ebola, Marburg, Sudan virus))

Public affairs[edit]
Emergent Biosolutions was among many companies giving financial support to delegations at both major party political conventions in the summer of 2016. The conventions used the contributions for receptions, food and transportation, but by law could not use contributions to fund campaigns. For example, Emergent hosted a breakfast reception at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia. The company sent representatives to both conventions with the aim of specifically meeting with Maryland delegates to educate the delegates about medical countermeasures.[72]
Emergent runs a charitable giving program called Give Corporate Social Responsibility. The company has given money to the Lansing, Michigan school district. Prominent donations and scholarships include; $15,000 to Lansing J. W. Sexton High School for the purchase of equipment for the AP Biology program,[73] $25,000 to Sexton High School for engineering equipment,[74] and $25,000 to the Lansing Promise scholarship fund[74]
Emergent is also a donor to the "Relentless Tour", an anti-bullying program that tries to raise awareness of autism and the problem of autistic children being bullied.[75]

BioThrax[edit]
Further information: Anthrax vaccine




Anthrax Vaccine Adsorbed



According to the U.S. National Library of Medicine, BioThrax was first made available in 1970.[16] BioThrax (Anthrax Vaccine Adsorbed), a vaccine licensed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.[17] Following a study by scientists from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,[18] on December 19, 2008, Emergent received final FDA licensing for use of BioThrax five doses for intramuscular injection.[19] Later in 2009, Emergent received approval from the FDA to extend the shelf life of its anthrax vaccine from three to four years. BioThrax was approved for distribution in the United States.[20][not in citation given] BioThrax has received marketing approval in India, Singapore, and Germany.[21][22][23]
The FDA gave BioThrax an "orphan drug" designation in April 2014.[24] The FDA gives that status to drugs that are used to treat rare diseases.[24] BioThrax is the only anthrax vaccine licensed by the FDA.[24]
As of April 2014, Emergent has sold over 66 million doses of BioThrax to the U.S. government.[25] Three million U.S. military personnel have received the BioThrax vaccine.[25]
The main buyer of BioThrax is the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).[26] The CDC buys BioThrax for the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS).[26] The government uses the SNS to protect the public in the event of a national emergency like a terrorist attack.[26] As of December 2016, Emergent has a $911 million contract with the CDC for BioThrax. The BioThrax vaccines will go to the SNS. The contract will supply around 29.4 million doses of the vaccine. Additionally, the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) released a notice of intent to purchase around $100 million of BioThrax for the SNS in 2017.[27]
Emergent submitted an application to the FDA for use of a large facility in Lansing, Michigan to produce BioThrax. On June 21, 2016, Emergent announced that it had moved a step forward in the process: the FDA completed the pre-approval phase of its inspection.[28]

Emergent BioSolutions was founded on September 5, 1998, under the name BioPort, and renamed Emergent BioSolutions in 2004.[40] At the time, the Michigan Department of Public Health, though its Michigan Biologics Products Institute, owned an anthrax vaccine manufacturing facility in Lansing, Michigan. BioPort purchased the facility and the rights to manufacture the vaccine for the U.S. military.[41][42]
After the 2001 anthrax attacks following the terrorist attacks on September 11, BioPort worked with the U.S. government to supply anthrax countermeasures.[43]
Emergent became a publicly traded company in 2006, with its stock trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol EBS.[43]
In June 2012, Emergent, along with Novartis and the Texas A&M University System was selected by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services as one of the three Centers for Innovation in Advanced Development and Manufacturing. The public-private partnership granted Emergent $163 million over eight years to assist in the development of countermeasures for health, nuclear and radiological epidemics.[44] The purpose is to produce medical countermeasures in the event of a national pandemic.[45] Emergent's facility is located in Maryland and the company expects the site to be operational by the year 2020.[45]
On June 27, 2016, the US Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority contracted with Emergent Biosolutions to develop a vaccine for the Zika virus. The contract is spread out over 30 months and is worth around $22 million.[46][47] The vaccine could reach stage-one clinical trials by early 2017.[48] As of the end of June 2016, 60 countries and territories had reported transmission of the Zika virus from mosquitoes.[47] Emergent could become the first company to develop a vaccine for the virus.[46]
In December 2016, Health Canada approved the purchase of Emergent's new botulism antitoxin called Botulism Antitoxin Heptavalent (BAT). The CDC and Public Health Agency of Canada both identified botulism, a type of food poisoning, as a likely biological threat. Emergent already has a ten-year contract with the Canadian military and national health service to supply BAT that began in 2012. Emergent also provides BAT to the U.S. Strategic National Stockpile.[49] BAT was first licensed in the U.S. in 2013 and is the only botulism antitoxin available in the U.S. for naturally-occurring cases of non-infant botulism.[50]
On March 31, 2017, Emergent said it signed a modification to its contract with BARDA to "manufacture and store bulk drug substance for its botulism antitoxin, BAT."[51] The contract is valued at approximately $53 million for five years. The contract modification was technical in nature; it allows Emergent to file and deliver the final drug product to the Strategic National Stockpile in the future.[51]
Soligenix Inc. and Emergent agreed to establish a “commercially viable production technology” for the development of RiVax, a potential vaccine aimed to protect against ricin exposure. Currently, there are no treatments for ricin poisoning that have been proven effective. Soligenix is a late-stage biopharmaceutical company that specializes in the development of treatments for rare diseases. A product of castor oil production, the ricin toxin can be a useful biological weapon due to its extreme potency, stability, and accessibility. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases funded the development of RiVax costing an estimated $24.7 million. The organization also financially backed the contract between Emergent and Soligenix. Most of the work will be conducted in Baltimore, Maryland, at Emergent’s manufacturing facility.[52]
Emergent is a member of the Alliance for Biosecurity, a group of companies and organizations that work towards improving the ability to respond to biological threats with vaccines and other countermeasures.[53][54]
Leadership[edit]
The current president and CEO of Emergent Biosolutions is Daniel J. Abdun-Nabi. He has held the position since April 1, 2012.[55] Prior to that, he was the president and chief operating officer. He holds an M.L.T. from Georgetown University, J.D. from the University of San Diego, and B.A. from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst.[56]
In addition to running Emergent, Abdun-Nabi speaks publicly on matters related to national security. For example, on April 1, 2015, he spoke as a panelist before the Hudson Institute think tank about how to prepare and respond to threats from biological and chemical weapons. The event was part of the Blue Ribbon Study Panel on Biodefense, a group of experts that analyzed the United States' defense capabilities against biological threats.[57] In 2015, Abdun-Nabi organized a visit by former Florida Governor Jeb Bush to Emergent's Lansing facility to speak to employees about ways the government and companies such as Emergent could work with each other to help defend the U.S. against terrorist attacks.[58] Abdun-Nabi sits on the board of directors at BioHealth Innovation, a public-private partnership that helps bring bio-health products to the marketplace.[59]
Financial information[edit]
Forbes recognized Emergent as the top performing company in the state of Maryland for the 2015-2016 fiscal year. Forbes tracked the return of every public company between from June 8, 2015 to June 8, 2016. Emergent had a total return during that time period of 38.2 percent. In 2015, Emergent had revenue of $522 million.[60]
2014-2015 activity and financial figures[edit]
According to ZACKs, Emergent's acquisition of Cangene made both of Emergent's divisions (Biosciences and Biodefense) stronger. In addition to the Cangene acquisition, Emergent and the German human antibody developer MorphySys AG in 2014 began collaborating on a prostate cancer drug called ES414. As of January 2015, the drug is in the pre-clinical stage.[61]
In early January 2015, Emergent publicly released its preliminary financial totals for the 2014 year. The company saw an increase in revenue, GAAP net income,[a] and adjusted net income. Revenue amounted to between $445–$450 million, which is 43% higher than revenue earned in 2013. GAAP net income was between $36 and $38 million (a 19% increase). Adjusted net income increased by 49 percent to between $53 and $55 million.[62]
Also in January, the company gave what is known as "guidance" (an accounting term meaning a company tells the public what it expects to earn in the future[63]) for 2015. Emergent expects $90–105 million in sales in the first three months of 2015; and between $510–540 million for the full year.[61] Emergent sold more BioThrax in 2014 than in the previous year (BioThrax sales amounted to approximately $246 million). According to company statements, Emergent believes that the growth in BioThrax sales along with stronger sales of other products from its Biodefense division will drive growth in 2015.[62] The Motley Fool, an investment information company characterized in its Yahoo! Finance profile as "the king of personal investing tips",[64] believes that Emergent's drug to treat hemophilia B, called Ixinity, will also drive growth in 2015. As of January 21, 2015, the FDA was reviewing Emergent's application for Ixinity approval.[65]

R&D and manufacturing operations[edit]
Main article: Anthrax Vaccine Adsorbed
In addition to the anthrax vaccine, Emergent BioSolutions develops and manufactures vaccines and therapeutics for the prevention or treatment of several diseases.[67] One of Emergent's medical countermeasure products is RSDL, a lotion that clears and neutralizes chemical warfare agents. The product is used in over 20 countries around the world.[68] RSDL is made of the chemicals Dekon 139 2,3 butanedione monoxime (DAM). According to the Chemical Hazards Emergency Medical Management office within the United States Department of Health and Human Services, "RSDL is used as a medical device for the decontamination of skin exposed to chemical warfare agents such as sulfur mustard, VX, VR and certain biological toxins."[69]
As of 2017, Emergent manufactures the following products:[70]

BioThrax (Anthrax Vaccine Adsorbed)
Anthrasil (Anthrax Immune Globulin Intravenous)
BAT (Botulism Antitoxin Heptavalent)

ZIKV-IG (Zika Therapeutic)
GC-072 (Burkholderia Therapeutic)
FILOV (Pan-filovirus Therapeutic (Ebola, Marburg, Sudan virus))

Public affairs[edit]
Emergent Biosolutions was among many companies giving financial support to delegations at both major party political conventions in the summer of 2016. The conventions used the contributions for receptions, food and transportation, but by law could not use contributions to fund campaigns. For example, Emergent hosted a breakfast reception at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia. The company sent representatives to both conventions with the aim of specifically meeting with Maryland delegates to educate the delegates about medical countermeasures.[72]
Emergent runs a charitable giving program called Give Corporate Social Responsibility. The company has given money to the Lansing, Michigan school district. Prominent donations and scholarships include; $15,000 to Lansing J. W. Sexton High School for the purchase of equipment for the AP Biology program,[73] $25,000 to Sexton High School for engineering equipment,[74] and $25,000 to the Lansing Promise scholarship fund[74]
Emergent is also a donor to the "Relentless Tour", an anti-bullying program that tries to raise awareness of autism and the problem of autistic children being bullied.[75]

BioThrax[edit]
Further information: Anthrax vaccine




Anthrax Vaccine Adsorbed



According to the U.S. National Library of Medicine, BioThrax was first made available in 1970.[16] BioThrax (Anthrax Vaccine Adsorbed), a vaccine licensed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.[17] Following a study by scientists from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,[18] on December 19, 2008, Emergent received final FDA licensing for use of BioThrax five doses for intramuscular injection.[19] Later in 2009, Emergent received approval from the FDA to extend the shelf life of its anthrax vaccine from three to four years. BioThrax was approved for distribution in the United States.[20][not in citation given] BioThrax has received marketing approval in India, Singapore, and Germany.[21][22][23]
The FDA gave BioThrax an "orphan drug" designation in April 2014.[24] The FDA gives that status to drugs that are used to treat rare diseases.[24] BioThrax is the only anthrax vaccine licensed by the FDA.[24]
As of April 2014, Emergent has sold over 66 million doses of BioThrax to the U.S. government.[25] Three million U.S. military personnel have received the BioThrax vaccine.[25]
The main buyer of BioThrax is the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).[26] The CDC buys BioThrax for the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS).[26] The government uses the SNS to protect the public in the event of a national emergency like a terrorist attack.[26] As of December 2016, Emergent has a $911 million contract with the CDC for BioThrax. The BioThrax vaccines will go to the SNS. The contract will supply around 29.4 million doses of the vaccine. Additionally, the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) released a notice of intent to purchase around $100 million of BioThrax for the SNS in 2017.[27]
Emergent submitted an application to the FDA for use of a large facility in Lansing, Michigan to produce BioThrax. On June 21, 2016, Emergent announced that it had moved a step forward in the process: the FDA completed the pre-approval phase of its inspection.[28]

Emergent BioSolutions was founded on September 5, 1998, under the name BioPort, and renamed Emergent BioSolutions in 2004.[40] At the time, the Michigan Department of Public Health, though its Michigan Biologics Products Institute, owned an anthrax vaccine manufacturing facility in Lansing, Michigan. BioPort purchased the facility and the rights to manufacture the vaccine for the U.S. military.[41][42]
After the 2001 anthrax attacks following the terrorist attacks on September 11, BioPort worked with the U.S. government to supply anthrax countermeasures.[43]
Emergent became a publicly traded company in 2006, with its stock trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol EBS.[43]
In June 2012, Emergent, along with Novartis and the Texas A&M University System was selected by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services as one of the three Centers for Innovation in Advanced Development and Manufacturing. The public-private partnership granted Emergent $163 million over eight years to assist in the development of countermeasures for health, nuclear and radiological epidemics.[44] The purpose is to produce medical countermeasures in the event of a national pandemic.[45] Emergent's facility is located in Maryland and the company expects the site to be operational by the year 2020.[45]
On June 27, 2016, the US Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority contracted with Emergent Biosolutions to develop a vaccine for the Zika virus. The contract is spread out over 30 months and is worth around $22 million.[46][47] The vaccine could reach stage-one clinical trials by early 2017.[48] As of the end of June 2016, 60 countries and territories had reported transmission of the Zika virus from mosquitoes.[47] Emergent could become the first company to develop a vaccine for the virus.[46]
In December 2016, Health Canada approved the purchase of Emergent's new botulism antitoxin called Botulism Antitoxin Heptavalent (BAT). The CDC and Public Health Agency of Canada both identified botulism, a type of food poisoning, as a likely biological threat. Emergent already has a ten-year contract with the Canadian military and national health service to supply BAT that began in 2012. Emergent also provides BAT to the U.S. Strategic National Stockpile.[49] BAT was first licensed in the U.S. in 2013 and is the only botulism antitoxin available in the U.S. for naturally-occurring cases of non-infant botulism.[50]
On March 31, 2017, Emergent said it signed a modification to its contract with BARDA to "manufacture and store bulk drug substance for its botulism antitoxin, BAT."[51] The contract is valued at approximately $53 million for five years. The contract modification was technical in nature; it allows Emergent to file and deliver the final drug product to the Strategic National Stockpile in the future.[51]
Soligenix Inc. and Emergent agreed to establish a “commercially viable production technology” for the development of RiVax, a potential vaccine aimed to protect against ricin exposure. Currently, there are no treatments for ricin poisoning that have been proven effective. Soligenix is a late-stage biopharmaceutical company that specializes in the development of treatments for rare diseases. A product of castor oil production, the ricin toxin can be a useful biological weapon due to its extreme potency, stability, and accessibility. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases funded the development of RiVax costing an estimated $24.7 million. The organization also financially backed the contract between Emergent and Soligenix. Most of the work will be conducted in Baltimore, Maryland, at Emergent’s manufacturing facility.[52]
Emergent is a member of the Alliance for Biosecurity, a group of companies and organizations that work towards improving the ability to respond to biological threats with vaccines and other countermeasures.[53][54]
Leadership[edit]
The current president and CEO of Emergent Biosolutions is Daniel J. Abdun-Nabi. He has held the position since April 1, 2012.[55] Prior to that, he was the president and chief operating officer. He holds an M.L.T. from Georgetown University, J.D. from the University of San Diego, and B.A. from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst.[56]
In addition to running Emergent, Abdun-Nabi speaks publicly on matters related to national security. For example, on April 1, 2015, he spoke as a panelist before the Hudson Institute think tank about how to prepare and respond to threats from biological and chemical weapons. The event was part of the Blue Ribbon Study Panel on Biodefense, a group of experts that analyzed the United States' defense capabilities against biological threats.[57] In 2015, Abdun-Nabi organized a visit by former Florida Governor Jeb Bush to Emergent's Lansing facility to speak to employees about ways the government and companies such as Emergent could work with each other to help defend the U.S. against terrorist attacks.[58] Abdun-Nabi sits on the board of directors at BioHealth Innovation, a public-private partnership that helps bring bio-health products to the marketplace.[59]
Financial information[edit]
Forbes recognized Emergent as the top performing company in the state of Maryland for the 2015-2016 fiscal year. Forbes tracked the return of every public company between from June 8, 2015 to June 8, 2016. Emergent had a total return during that time period of 38.2 percent. In 2015, Emergent had revenue of $522 million.[60]
2014-2015 activity and financial figures[edit]
According to ZACKs, Emergent's acquisition of Cangene made both of Emergent's divisions (Biosciences and Biodefense) stronger. In addition to the Cangene acquisition, Emergent and the German human antibody developer MorphySys AG in 2014 began collaborating on a prostate cancer drug called ES414. As of January 2015, the drug is in the pre-clinical stage.[61]
In early January 2015, Emergent publicly released its preliminary financial totals for the 2014 year. The company saw an increase in revenue, GAAP net income,[a] and adjusted net income. Revenue amounted to between $445–$450 million, which is 43% higher than revenue earned in 2013. GAAP net income was between $36 and $38 million (a 19% increase). Adjusted net income increased by 49 percent to between $53 and $55 million.[62]
Also in January, the company gave what is known as "guidance" (an accounting term meaning a company tells the public what it expects to earn in the future[63]) for 2015. Emergent expects $90–105 million in sales in the first three months of 2015; and between $510–540 million for the full year.[61] Emergent sold more BioThrax in 2014 than in the previous year (BioThrax sales amounted to approximately $246 million). According to company statements, Emergent believes that the growth in BioThrax sales along with stronger sales of other products from its Biodefense division will drive growth in 2015.[62] The Motley Fool, an investment information company characterized in its Yahoo! Finance profile as "the king of personal investing tips",[64] believes that Emergent's drug to treat hemophilia B, called Ixinity, will also drive growth in 2015. As of January 21, 2015, the FDA was reviewing Emergent's application for Ixinity approval.[65]

R&D and manufacturing operations[edit]
Main article: Anthrax Vaccine Adsorbed
In addition to the anthrax vaccine, Emergent BioSolutions develops and manufactures vaccines and therapeutics for the prevention or treatment of several diseases.[67] One of Emergent's medical countermeasure products is RSDL, a lotion that clears and neutralizes chemical warfare agents. The product is used in over 20 countries around the world.[68] RSDL is made of the chemicals Dekon 139 2,3 butanedione monoxime (DAM). According to the Chemical Hazards Emergency Medical Management office within the United States Department of Health and Human Services, "RSDL is used as a medical device for the decontamination of skin exposed to chemical warfare agents such as sulfur mustard, VX, VR and certain biological toxins."[69]
As of 2017, Emergent manufactures the following products:[70]

BioThrax (Anthrax Vaccine Adsorbed)

FILOV (Pan-filovirus Therapeutic (Ebola, Marburg, Sudan virus))

Public affairs[edit]
Emergent Biosolutions was among many companies giving financial support to delegations at both major party political conventions in the summer of 2016. The conventions used the contributions for receptions, food and transportation, but by law could not use contributions to fund campaigns. For example, Emergent hosted a breakfast reception at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia. The company sent representatives to both conventions with the aim of specifically meeting with Maryland delegates to educate the delegates about medical countermeasures.[72]
Emergent runs a charitable giving program called Give Corporate Social Responsibility. The company has given money to the Lansing, Michigan school district. Prominent donations and scholarships include; $15,000 to Lansing J. W. Sexton High School for the purchase of equipment for the AP Biology program,[73] $25,000 to Sexton High School for engineering equipment,[74] and $25,000 to the Lansing Promise scholarship fund[74]
Emergent is also a donor to the "Relentless Tour", an anti-bullying program that tries to raise awareness of autism and the problem of autistic children being bullied.[75]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

 EMERGENT BIOSOLUTIONS INC. (NYSE:EBS) Files An 8-K Entry into a Material Definitive AgreementItem 1.01Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On July 19, 2017, Emergent BioSolutions Inc. entered into an asset purchase agreement with Human Genome Sciences, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("HGS"), GlaxoSmithKline LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("GSK" and collectively with HGS, the "Seller"), to which Emergent will acquire certain assets and liabilities of Seller relating to Seller's raxibacumab product for an upfront payment of $76 million and milestone payments of up to $20 million in the aggregate, tied to the achievement of certain product sale and manufacturing-related milestones. Raxibacumab is a monoclonal antibody approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with inhalational anthrax in combination with appropriate antibacterial drugs and for prophylaxis of inhalational anthrax when alternative therapies are not available or not appropriate. The product has also been granted orphan drug market exclusivity in the United States until December 2019.
Under the agreement, upon the closing of the transaction, Emergent will (1) acquire, among other assets, raxibacumab, including corresponding product rights, regulatory approvals and intellectual property rights and (2) plan to assume an existing multi-year contract with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority ("BARDA") for the purchase and delivery of raxibacumab to the Strategic National Stockpile.
The completion of the transaction is subject to certain closing conditions, including (1) expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, (2) receipt of consents under certain material contracts and (3) certain other customary conditions. There is no financing condition to the closing of the transaction.
In connection with the closing of the transaction, Emergent will enter into various agreements with Seller or its affiliates, including (1) a pre-novation agreement to which Seller will subcontract to Emergent the rights and obligations of Seller under the BARDA contract until novation of the contract is effective to Emergent following the closing of the transaction, (2) a technical transfer agreement for up to a four-year term under which Seller will transfer the manufacturing process (bulk and fill/finish) related to raxibacumab to Emergent's facilities in Baltimore, Maryland, (3) a supply agreement under which Seller will manufacture and deliver raxibacumab to BARDA on behalf of Emergent for the duration of certain orders under the BARDA contract, and (4) a transitional services agreement to which Seller will perform certain services for Emergent for a limited period of time following the closing of the transaction.
The agreement also contains certain termination rights for Emergent and Seller. Upon any termination of the agreement, the agreement will become void and have no effect, except that certain specified obligations of Emergent and Seller shall survive, including their respective obligations concerning confidentiality and public announcements.
The foregoing description of the terms and conditions of the agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the agreement filed herewith as Exhibit 2 and incorporated herein by reference.
A copy of the agreement is attached as an exhibit hereto. It is not intended to provide any other factual information about Emergent or Seller. In particular, the assertions embodied in the representations and warranties contained in the agreement are qualified by information in the disclosure schedules provided by Seller to Emergent in connection with the signing of the agreement or in filings of the parties with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These confidential disclosure schedules contain information that modifies, qualifies and creates exceptions to the representations and warranties and certain covenants set forth in the agreement. Moreover, certain representations, warranties and covenants in the agreement were used for the purposes of allocating risk between Emergent and the Seller rather than establishing matters of fact or reflecting what investors may view as material. Accordingly, the representations and warranties and covenants in the agreement or any descriptions thereof should not be relied on as a characterization of the actual state of facts about Emergent or Seller or their respective subsidiaries or affiliates. Additionally, the representations, warranties, covenants, conditions and other terms of the agreement may be subject to subsequent waiver or modification. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the representations and warranties and covenants in the agreement may change after the date of the agreement, which subsequent information may or may not be fully reflected in Emergent's or the Seller's public disclosures.
Item 7.01Regulation FD Disclosure.
On July 19, 2017, Emergent issued a press release announcing entry into the Asset Purchase Agreement with the Seller, which is filed as Exhibit 99 hereto.

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

BioThrax[edit]
Further information: Anthrax vaccine




Anthrax Vaccine Adsorbed



According to the U.S. National Library of Medicine, BioThrax was first made available in 1970.[16] BioThrax (Anthrax Vaccine Adsorbed), a vaccine licensed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.[17] Following a study by scientists from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,[18] on December 19, 2008, Emergent received final FDA licensing for use of BioThrax five doses for intramuscular injection.[19] Later in 2009, Emergent received approval from the FDA to extend the shelf life of its anthrax vaccine from three to four years. BioThrax was approved for distribution in the United States.[20][not in citation given] BioThrax has received marketing approval in India, Singapore, and Germany.[21][22][23]
The FDA gave BioThrax an "orphan drug" designation in April 2014.[24] The FDA gives that status to drugs that are used to treat rare diseases.[24] BioThrax is the only anthrax vaccine licensed by the FDA.[24]
As of April 2014, Emergent has sold over 66 million doses of BioThrax to the U.S. government.[25] Three million U.S. military personnel have received the BioThrax vaccine.[25]
The main buyer of BioThrax is the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).[26] The CDC buys BioThrax for the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS).[26] The government uses the SNS to protect the public in the event of a national emergency like a terrorist attack.[26] As of December 2016, Emergent has a $911 million contract with the CDC for BioThrax. The BioThrax vaccines will go to the SNS. The contract will supply around 29.4 million doses of the vaccine. Additionally, the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) released a notice of intent to purchase around $100 million of BioThrax for the SNS in 2017.[27]
Emergent submitted an application to the FDA for use of a large facility in Lansing, Michigan to produce BioThrax. On June 21, 2016, Emergent announced that it had moved a step forward in the process: the FDA completed the pre-approval phase of its inspection.[28]

Emergent BioSolutions was founded on September 5, 1998, under the name BioPort, and renamed Emergent BioSolutions in 2004.[40] At the time, the Michigan Department of Public Health, though its Michigan Biologics Products Institute, owned an anthrax vaccine manufacturing facility in Lansing, Michigan. BioPort purchased the facility and the rights to manufacture the vaccine for the U.S. military.[41][42]
After the 2001 anthrax attacks following the terrorist attacks on September 11, BioPort worked with the U.S. government to supply anthrax countermeasures.[43]
Emergent became a publicly traded company in 2006, with its stock trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol EBS.[43]
In June 2012, Emergent, along with Novartis and the Texas A&M University System was selected by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services as one of the three Centers for Innovation in Advanced Development and Manufacturing. The public-private partnership granted Emergent $163 million over eight years to assist in the development of countermeasures for health, nuclear and radiological epidemics.[44] The purpose is to produce medical countermeasures in the event of a national pandemic.[45] Emergent's facility is located in Maryland and the company expects the site to be operational by the year 2020.[45]
On June 27, 2016, the US Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority contracted with Emergent Biosolutions to develop a vaccine for the Zika virus. The contract is spread out over 30 months and is worth around $22 million.[46][47] The vaccine could reach stage-one clinical trials by early 2017.[48] As of the end of June 2016, 60 countries and territories had reported transmission of the Zika virus from mosquitoes.[47] Emergent could become the first company to develop a vaccine for the virus.[46]
In December 2016, Health Canada approved the purchase of Emergent's new botulism antitoxin called Botulism Antitoxin Heptavalent (BAT). The CDC and Public Health Agency of Canada both identified botulism, a type of food poisoning, as a likely biological threat. Emergent already has a ten-year contract with the Canadian military and national health service to supply BAT that began in 2012. Emergent also provides BAT to the U.S. Strategic National Stockpile.[49] BAT was first licensed in the U.S. in 2013 and is the only botulism antitoxin available in the U.S. for naturally-occurring cases of non-infant botulism.[50]
On March 31, 2017, Emergent said it signed a modification to its contract with BARDA to "manufacture and store bulk drug substance for its botulism antitoxin, BAT."[51] The contract is valued at approximately $53 million for five years. The contract modification was technical in nature; it allows Emergent to file and deliver the final drug product to the Strategic National Stockpile in the future.[51]
Soligenix Inc. and Emergent agreed to establish a “commercially viable production technology” for the development of RiVax, a potential vaccine aimed to protect against ricin exposure. Currently, there are no treatments for ricin poisoning that have been proven effective. Soligenix is a late-stage biopharmaceutical company that specializes in the development of treatments for rare diseases. A product of castor oil production, the ricin toxin can be a useful biological weapon due to its extreme potency, stability, and accessibility. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases funded the development of RiVax costing an estimated $24.7 million. The organization also financially backed the contract between Emergent and Soligenix. Most of the work will be conducted in Baltimore, Maryland, at Emergent’s manufacturing facility.[52]
Emergent is a member of the Alliance for Biosecurity, a group of companies and organizations that work towards improving the ability to respond to biological threats with vaccines and other countermeasures.[53][54]
Leadership[edit]
The current president and CEO of Emergent Biosolutions is Daniel J. Abdun-Nabi. He has held the position since April 1, 2012.[55] Prior to that, he was the president and chief operating officer. He holds an M.L.T. from Georgetown University, J.D. from the University of San Diego, and B.A. from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst.[56]
In addition to running Emergent, Abdun-Nabi speaks publicly on matters related to national security. For example, on April 1, 2015, he spoke as a panelist before the Hudson Institute think tank about how to prepare and respond to threats from biological and chemical weapons. The event was part of the Blue Ribbon Study Panel on Biodefense, a group of experts that analyzed the United States' defense capabilities against biological threats.[57] In 2015, Abdun-Nabi organized a visit by former Florida Governor Jeb Bush to Emergent's Lansing facility to speak to employees about ways the government and companies such as Emergent could work with each other to help defend the U.S. against terrorist attacks.[58] Abdun-Nabi sits on the board of directors at BioHealth Innovation, a public-private partnership that helps bring bio-health products to the marketplace.[59]
Financial information[edit]
Forbes recognized Emergent as the top performing company in the state of Maryland for the 2015-2016 fiscal year. Forbes tracked the return of every public company between from June 8, 2015 to June 8, 2016. Emergent had a total return during that time period of 38.2 percent. In 2015, Emergent had revenue of $522 million.[60]
2014-2015 activity and financial figures[edit]
According to ZACKs, Emergent's acquisition of Cangene made both of Emergent's divisions (Biosciences and Biodefense) stronger. In addition to the Cangene acquisition, Emergent and the German human antibody developer MorphySys AG in 2014 began collaborating on a prostate cancer drug called ES414. As of January 2015, the drug is in the pre-clinical stage.[61]
In early January 2015, Emergent publicly released its preliminary financial totals for the 2014 year. The company saw an increase in revenue, GAAP net income,[a] and adjusted net income. Revenue amounted to between $445–$450 million, which is 43% higher than revenue earned in 2013. GAAP net income was between $36 and $38 million (a 19% increase). Adjusted net income increased by 49 percent to between $53 and $55 million.[62]
Also in January, the company gave what is known as "guidance" (an accounting term meaning a company tells the public what it expects to earn in the future[63]) for 2015. Emergent expects $90–105 million in sales in the first three months of 2015; and between $510–540 million for the full year.[61] Emergent sold more BioThrax in 2014 than in the previous year (BioThrax sales amounted to approximately $246 million). According to company statements, Emergent believes that the growth in BioThrax sales along with stronger sales of other products from its Biodefense division will drive growth in 2015.[62] The Motley Fool, an investment information company characterized in its Yahoo! Finance profile as "the king of personal investing tips",[64] believes that Emergent's drug to treat hemophilia B, called Ixinity, will also drive growth in 2015. As of January 21, 2015, the FDA was reviewing Emergent's application for Ixinity approval.[65]

R&D and manufacturing operations[edit]
Main article: Anthrax Vaccine Adsorbed
In addition to the anthrax vaccine, Emergent BioSolutions develops and manufactures vaccines and therapeutics for the prevention or treatment of several diseases.[67] One of Emergent's medical countermeasure products is RSDL, a lotion that clears and neutralizes chemical warfare agents. The product is used in over 20 countries around the world.[68] RSDL is made of the chemicals Dekon 139 2,3 butanedione monoxime (DAM). According to the Chemical Hazards Emergency Medical Management office within the United States Department of Health and Human Services, "RSDL is used as a medical device for the decontamination of skin exposed to chemical warfare agents such as sulfur mustard, VX, VR and certain biological toxins."[69]
As of 2017, Emergent manufactures the following products:[70]

BioThrax (Anthrax Vaccine Adsorbed)
Anthrasil (Anthrax Immune Globulin Intravenous)
BAT (Botulism Antitoxin Heptavalent)
VIGIV (CNJ-016) (Vaccinia Immune Globulin Intravenous)
RSDL (Reactive Skin Decontamination Lotion)

Products in development include:[71]

NuThrax (Anthrax Vaccine)

In phase II clinical trials, expected to enroll patients in phase III studies in 2018.


FLU-IGIV (Seasonal Influenza Therapeutic)

In phase II clinical trials


UV-4B (Dengue Therapeutic)
ZIKV-IG (Zika Therapeutic)
GC-072 (Burkholderia Therapeutic)
FILOV (Pan-filovirus Therapeutic (Ebola, Marburg, Sudan virus))

Public affairs[edit]
Emergent Biosolutions was among many companies giving financial support to delegations at both major party political conventions in the summer of 2016. The conventions used the contributions for receptions, food and transportation, but by law could not use contributions to fund campaigns. For example, Emergent hosted a breakfast reception at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia. The company sent representatives to both conventions with the aim of specifically meeting with Maryland delegates to educate the delegates about medical countermeasures.[72]
Emergent runs a charitable giving program called Give Corporate Social Responsibility. The company has given money to the Lansing, Michigan school district. Prominent donations and scholarships include; $15,000 to Lansing J. W. Sexton High School for the purchase of equipment for the AP Biology program,[73] $25,000 to Sexton High School for engineering equipment,[74] and $25,000 to the Lansing Promise scholarship fund[74]
Emergent is also a donor to the "Relentless Tour", an anti-bullying program that tries to raise awareness of autism and the problem of autistic children being bullied.[75]

BioThrax[edit]
Further information: Anthrax vaccine




Anthrax Vaccine Adsorbed



According to the U.S. National Library of Medicine, BioThrax was first made available in 1970.[16] BioThrax (Anthrax Vaccine Adsorbed), a vaccine licensed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.[17] Following a study by scientists from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,[18] on December 19, 2008, Emergent received final FDA licensing for use of BioThrax five doses for intramuscular injection.[19] Later in 2009, Emergent received approval from the FDA to extend the shelf life of its anthrax vaccine from three to four years. BioThrax was approved for distribution in the United States.[20][not in citation given] BioThrax has received marketing approval in India, Singapore, and Germany.[21][22][23]
The FDA gave BioThrax an "orphan drug" designation in April 2014.[24] The FDA gives that status to drugs that are used to treat rare diseases.[24] BioThrax is the only anthrax vaccine licensed by the FDA.[24]
As of April 2014, Emergent has sold over 66 million doses of BioThrax to the U.S. government.[25] Three million U.S. military personnel have received the BioThrax vaccine.[25]
The main buyer of BioThrax is the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).[26] The CDC buys BioThrax for the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS).[26] The government uses the SNS to protect the public in the event of a national emergency like a terrorist attack.[26] As of December 2016, Emergent has a $911 million contract with the CDC for BioThrax. The BioThrax vaccines will go to the SNS. The contract will supply around 29.4 million doses of the vaccine. Additionally, the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) released a notice of intent to purchase around $100 million of BioThrax for the SNS in 2017.[27]
Emergent submitted an application to the FDA for use of a large facility in Lansing, Michigan to produce BioThrax. On June 21, 2016, Emergent announced that it had moved a step forward in the process: the FDA completed the pre-approval phase of its inspection.[28]

Emergent BioSolutions was founded on September 5, 1998, under the name BioPort, and renamed Emergent BioSolutions in 2004.[40] At the time, the Michigan Department of Public Health, though its Michigan Biologics Products Institute, owned an anthrax vaccine manufacturing facility in Lansing, Michigan. BioPort purchased the facility and the rights to manufacture the vaccine for the U.S. military.[41][42]
After the 2001 anthrax attacks following the terrorist attacks on September 11, BioPort worked with the U.S. government to supply anthrax countermeasures.[43]
Emergent became a publicly traded company in 2006, with its stock trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol EBS.[43]
In June 2012, Emergent, along with Novartis and the Texas A&M University System was selected by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services as one of the three Centers for Innovation in Advanced Development and Manufacturing. The public-private partnership granted Emergent $163 million over eight years to assist in the development of countermeasures for health, nuclear and radiological epidemics.[44] The purpose is to produce medical countermeasures in the event of a national pandemic.[45] Emergent's facility is located in Maryland and the company expects the site to be operational by the year 2020.[45]
On June 27, 2016, the US Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority contracted with Emergent Biosolutions to develop a vaccine for the Zika virus. The contract is spread out over 30 months and is worth around $22 million.[46][47] The vaccine could reach stage-one clinical trials by early 2017.[48] As of the end of June 2016, 60 countries and territories had reported transmission of the Zika virus from mosquitoes.[47] Emergent could become the first company to develop a vaccine for the virus.[46]
In December 2016, Health Canada approved the purchase of Emergent's new botulism antitoxin called Botulism Antitoxin Heptavalent (BAT). The CDC and Public Health Agency of Canada both identified botulism, a type of food poisoning, as a likely biological threat. Emergent already has a ten-year contract with the Canadian military and national health service to supply BAT that began in 2012. Emergent also provides BAT to the U.S. Strategic National Stockpile.[49] BAT was first licensed in the U.S. in 2013 and is the only botulism antitoxin available in the U.S. for naturally-occurring cases of non-infant botulism.[50]
On March 31, 2017, Emergent said it signed a modification to its contract with BARDA to "manufacture and store bulk drug substance for its botulism antitoxin, BAT."[51] The contract is valued at approximately $53 million for five years. The contract modification was technical in nature; it allows Emergent to file and deliver the final drug product to the Strategic National Stockpile in the future.[51]
Soligenix Inc. and Emergent agreed to establish a “commercially viable production technology” for the development of RiVax, a potential vaccine aimed to protect against ricin exposure. Currently, there are no treatments for ricin poisoning that have been proven effective. Soligenix is a late-stage biopharmaceutical company that specializes in the development of treatments for rare diseases. A product of castor oil production, the ricin toxin can be a useful biological weapon due to its extreme potency, stability, and accessibility. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases funded the development of RiVax costing an estimated $24.7 million. The organization also financially backed the contract between Emergent and Soligenix. Most of the work will be conducted in Baltimore, Maryland, at Emergent’s manufacturing facility.[52]
Emergent is a member of the Alliance for Biosecurity, a group of companies and organizations that work towards improving the ability to respond to biological threats with vaccines and other countermeasures.[53][54]
Leadership[edit]
The current president and CEO of Emergent Biosolutions is Daniel J. Abdun-Nabi. He has held the position since April 1, 2012.[55] Prior to that, he was the president and chief operating officer. He holds an M.L.T. from Georgetown University, J.D. from the University of San Diego, and B.A. from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst.[56]
In addition to running Emergent, Abdun-Nabi speaks publicly on matters related to national security. For example, on April 1, 2015, he spoke as a panelist before the Hudson Institute think tank about how to prepare and respond to threats from biological and chemical weapons. The event was part of the Blue Ribbon Study Panel on Biodefense, a group of experts that analyzed the United States' defense capabilities against biological threats.[57] In 2015, Abdun-Nabi organized a visit by former Florida Governor Jeb Bush to Emergent's Lansing facility to speak to employees about ways the government and companies such as Emergent could work with each other to help defend the U.S. against terrorist attacks.[58] Abdun-Nabi sits on the board of directors at BioHealth Innovation, a public-private partnership that helps bring bio-health products to the marketplace.[59]
Financial information[edit]
Forbes recognized Emergent as the top performing company in the state of Maryland for the 2015-2016 fiscal year. Forbes tracked the return of every public company between from June 8, 2015 to June 8, 2016. Emergent had a total return during that time period of 38.2 percent. In 2015, Emergent had revenue of $522 million.[60]
2014-2015 activity and financial figures[edit]
According to ZACKs, Emergent's acquisition of Cangene made both of Emergent's divisions (Biosciences and Biodefense) stronger. In addition to the Cangene acquisition, Emergent and the German human antibody developer MorphySys AG in 2014 began collaborating on a prostate cancer drug called ES414. As of January 2015, the drug is in the pre-clinical stage.[61]
In early January 2015, Emergent publicly released its preliminary financial totals for the 2014 year. The company saw an increase in revenue, GAAP net income,[a] and adjusted net income. Revenue amounted to between $445–$450 million, which is 43% higher than revenue earned in 2013. GAAP net income was between $36 and $38 million (a 19% increase). Adjusted net income increased by 49 percent to between $53 and $55 million.[62]
Also in January, the company gave what is known as "guidance" (an accounting term meaning a company tells the public what it expects to earn in the future[63]) for 2015. Emergent expects $90–105 million in sales in the first three months of 2015; and between $510–540 million for the full year.[61] Emergent sold more BioThrax in 2014 than in the previous year (BioThrax sales amounted to approximately $246 million). According to company statements, Emergent believes that the growth in BioThrax sales along with stronger sales of other products from its Biodefense division will drive growth in 2015.[62] The Motley Fool, an investment information company characterized in its Yahoo! Finance profile as "the king of personal investing tips",[64] believes that Emergent's drug to treat hemophilia B, called Ixinity, will also drive growth in 2015. As of January 21, 2015, the FDA was reviewing Emergent's application for Ixinity approval.[65]

R&D and manufacturing operations[edit]
Main article: Anthrax Vaccine Adsorbed
In addition to the anthrax vaccine, Emergent BioSolutions develops and manufactures vaccines and therapeutics for the prevention or treatment of several diseases.[67] One of Emergent's medical countermeasure products is RSDL, a lotion that clears and neutralizes chemical warfare agents. The product is used in over 20 countries around the world.[68] RSDL is made of the chemicals Dekon 139 2,3 butanedione monoxime (DAM). According to the Chemical Hazards Emergency Medical Management office within the United States Department of Health and Human Services, "RSDL is used as a medical device for the decontamination of skin exposed to chemical warfare agents such as sulfur mustard, VX, VR and certain biological toxins."[69]
As of 2017, Emergent manufactures the following products:[70]

BioThrax (Anthrax Vaccine Adsorbed)
Anthrasil (Anthrax Immune Globulin Intravenous)
BAT (Botulism Antitoxin Heptavalent)
VIGIV (CNJ-016) (Vaccinia Immune Globulin Intravenous)
RSDL (Reactive Skin Decontamination Lotion)

Products in development include:[71]

NuThrax (Anthrax Vaccine)

In phase II clinical trials, expected to enroll patients in phase III studies in 2018.


FLU-IGIV (Seasonal Influenza Therapeutic)

In phase II clinical trials


UV-4B (Dengue Therapeutic)
ZIKV-IG (Zika Therapeutic)
GC-072 (Burkholderia Therapeutic)
FILOV (Pan-filovirus Therapeutic (Ebola, Marburg, Sudan virus))

Public affairs[edit]
Emergent Biosolutions was among many companies giving financial support to delegations at both major party political conventions in the summer of 2016. The conventions used the contributions for receptions, food and transportation, but by law could not use contributions to fund campaigns. For example, Emergent hosted a breakfast reception at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia. The company sent representatives to both conventions with the aim of specifically meeting with Maryland delegates to educate the delegates about medical countermeasures.[72]
Emergent runs a charitable giving program called Give Corporate Social Responsibility. The company has given money to the Lansing, Michigan school district. Prominent donations and scholarships include; $15,000 to Lansing J. W. Sexton High School for the purchase of equipment for the AP Biology program,[73] $25,000 to Sexton High School for engineering equipment,[74] and $25,000 to the Lansing Promise scholarship fund[74]
Emergent is also a donor to the "Relentless Tour", an anti-bullying program that tries to raise awareness of autism and the problem of autistic children being bullied.[75]

BioThrax[edit]
Further information: Anthrax vaccine




Anthrax Vaccine Adsorbed



According to the U.S. National Library of Medicine, BioThrax was first made available in 1970.[16] BioThrax (Anthrax Vaccine Adsorbed), a vaccine licensed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.[17] Following a study by scientists from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,[18] on December 19, 2008, Emergent received final FDA licensing for use of BioThrax five doses for intramuscular injection.[19] Later in 2009, Emergent received approval from the FDA to extend the shelf life of its anthrax vaccine from three to four years. BioThrax was approved for distribution in the United States.[20][not in citation given] BioThrax has received marketing approval in India, Singapore, and Germany.[21][22][23]
The FDA gave BioThrax an "orphan drug" designation in April 2014.[24] The FDA gives that status to drugs that are used to treat rare diseases.[24] BioThrax is the only anthrax vaccine licensed by the FDA.[24]
As of April 2014, Emergent has sold over 66 million doses of BioThrax to the U.S. government.[25] Three million U.S. military personnel have received the BioThrax vaccine.[25]
The main buyer of BioThrax is the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).[26] The CDC buys BioThrax for the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS).[26] The government uses the SNS to protect the public in the event of a national emergency like a terrorist attack.[26] As of December 2016, Emergent has a $911 million contract with the CDC for BioThrax. The BioThrax vaccines will go to the SNS. The contract will supply around 29.4 million doses of the vaccine. Additionally, the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) released a notice of intent to purchase around $100 million of BioThrax for the SNS in 2017.[27]
Emergent submitted an application to the FDA for use of a large facility in Lansing, Michigan to produce BioThrax. On June 21, 2016, Emergent announced that it had moved a step forward in the process: the FDA completed the pre-approval phase of its inspection.[28]

Emergent BioSolutions was founded on September 5, 1998, under the name BioPort, and renamed Emergent BioSolutions in 2004.[40] At the time, the Michigan Department of Public Health, though its Michigan Biologics Products Institute, owned an anthrax vaccine manufacturing facility in Lansing, Michigan. BioPort purchased the facility and the rights to manufacture the vaccine for the U.S. military.[41][42]
After the 2001 anthrax attacks following the terrorist attacks on September 11, BioPort worked with the U.S. government to supply anthrax countermeasures.[43]
Emergent became a publicly traded company in 2006, with its stock trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol EBS.[43]
In June 2012, Emergent, along with Novartis and the Texas A&M University System was selected by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services as one of the three Centers for Innovation in Advanced Development and Manufacturing. The public-private partnership granted Emergent $163 million over eight years to assist in the development of countermeasures for health, nuclear and radiological epidemics.[44] The purpose is to produce medical countermeasures in the event of a national pandemic.[45] Emergent's facility is located in Maryland and the company expects the site to be operational by the year 2020.[45]
On June 27, 2016, the US Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority contracted with Emergent Biosolutions to develop a vaccine for the Zika virus. The contract is spread out over 30 months and is worth around $22 million.[46][47] The vaccine could reach stage-one clinical trials by early 2017.[48] As of the end of June 2016, 60 countries and territories had reported transmission of the Zika virus from mosquitoes.[47] Emergent could become the first company to develop a vaccine for the virus.[46]
In December 2016, Health Canada approved the purchase of Emergent's new botulism antitoxin called Botulism Antitoxin Heptavalent (BAT). The CDC and Public Health Agency of Canada both identified botulism, a type of food poisoning, as a likely biological threat. Emergent already has a ten-year contract with the Canadian military and national health service to supply BAT that began in 2012. Emergent also provides BAT to the U.S. Strategic National Stockpile.[49] BAT was first licensed in the U.S. in 2013 and is the only botulism antitoxin available in the U.S. for naturally-occurring cases of non-infant botulism.[50]
On March 31, 2017, Emergent said it signed a modification to its contract with BARDA to "manufacture and store bulk drug substance for its botulism antitoxin, BAT."[51] The contract is valued at approximately $53 million for five years. The contract modification was technical in nature; it allows Emergent to file and deliver the final drug product to the Strategic National Stockpile in the future.[51]
Soligenix Inc. and Emergent agreed to establish a “commercially viable production technology” for the development of RiVax, a potential vaccine aimed to protect against ricin exposure. Currently, there are no treatments for ricin poisoning that have been proven effective. Soligenix is a late-stage biopharmaceutical company that specializes in the development of treatments for rare diseases. A product of castor oil production, the ricin toxin can be a useful biological weapon due to its extreme potency, stability, and accessibility. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases funded the development of RiVax costing an estimated $24.7 million. The organization also financially backed the contract between Emergent and Soligenix. Most of the work will be conducted in Baltimore, Maryland, at Emergent’s manufacturing facility.[52]
Emergent is a member of the Alliance for Biosecurity, a group of companies and organizations that work towards improving the ability to respond to biological threats with vaccines and other countermeasures.[53][54]
Leadership[edit]
The current president and CEO of Emergent Biosolutions is Daniel J. Abdun-Nabi. He has held the position since April 1, 2012.[55] Prior to that, he was the president and chief operating officer. He holds an M.L.T. from Georgetown University, J.D. from the University of San Diego, and B.A. from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst.[56]
In addition to running Emergent, Abdun-Nabi speaks publicly on matters related to national security. For example, on April 1, 2015, he spoke as a panelist before the Hudson Institute think tank about how to prepare and respond to threats from biological and chemical weapons. The event was part of the Blue Ribbon Study Panel on Biodefense, a group of experts that analyzed the United States' defense capabilities against biological threats.[57] In 2015, Abdun-Nabi organized a visit by former Florida Governor Jeb Bush to Emergent's Lansing facility to speak to employees about ways the government and companies such as Emergent could work with each other to help defend the U.S. against terrorist attacks.[58] Abdun-Nabi sits on the board of directors at BioHealth Innovation, a public-private partnership that helps bring bio-health products to the marketplace.[59]
Financial information[edit]
Forbes recognized Emergent as the top performing company in the state of Maryland for the 2015-2016 fiscal year. Forbes tracked the return of every public company between from June 8, 2015 to June 8, 2016. Emergent had a total return during that time period of 38.2 percent. In 2015, Emergent had revenue of $522 million.[60]
2014-2015 activity and financial figures[edit]
According to ZACKs, Emergent's acquisition of Cangene made both of Emergent's divisions (Biosciences and Biodefense) stronger. In addition to the Cangene acquisition, Emergent and the German human antibody developer MorphySys AG in 2014 began collaborating on a prostate cancer drug called ES414. As of January 2015, the drug is in the pre-clinical stage.[61]
In early January 2015, Emergent publicly released its preliminary financial totals for the 2014 year. The company saw an increase in revenue, GAAP net income,[a] and adjusted net income. Revenue amounted to between $445–$450 million, which is 43% higher than revenue earned in 2013. GAAP net income was between $36 and $38 million (a 19% increase). Adjusted net income increased by 49 percent to between $53 and $55 million.[62]
Also in January, the company gave what is known as "guidance" (an accounting term meaning a company tells the public what it expects to earn in the future[63]) for 2015. Emergent expects $90–105 million in sales in the first three months of 2015; and between $510–540 million for the full year.[61] Emergent sold more BioThrax in 2014 than in the previous year (BioThrax sales amounted to approximately $246 million). According to company statements, Emergent believes that the growth in BioThrax sales along with stronger sales of other products from its Biodefense division will drive growth in 2015.[62] The Motley Fool, an investment information company characterized in its Yahoo! Finance profile as "the king of personal investing tips",[64] believes that Emergent's drug to treat hemophilia B, called Ixinity, will also drive growth in 2015. As of January 21, 2015, the FDA was reviewing Emergent's application for Ixinity approval.[65]

R&D and manufacturing operations[edit]
Main article: Anthrax Vaccine Adsorbed
In addition to the anthrax vaccine, Emergent BioSolutions develops and manufactures vaccines and therapeutics for the prevention or treatment of several diseases.[67] One of Emergent's medical countermeasure products is RSDL, a lotion that clears and neutralizes chemical warfare agents. The product is used in over 20 countries around the world.[68] RSDL is made of the chemicals Dekon 139 2,3 butanedione monoxime (DAM). According to the Chemical Hazards Emergency Medical Management office within the United States Department of Health and Human Services, "RSDL is used as a medical device for the decontamination of skin exposed to chemical warfare agents such as sulfur mustard, VX, VR and certain biological toxins."[69]
As of 2017, Emergent manufactures the following products:[70]

BioThrax (Anthrax Vaccine Adsorbed)

Public affairs[edit]
Emergent Biosolutions was among many companies giving financial support to delegations at both major party political conventions in the summer of 2016. The conventions used the contributions for receptions, food and transportation, but by law could not use contributions to fund campaigns. For example, Emergent hosted a breakfast reception at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia. The company sent representatives to both conventions with the aim of specifically meeting with Maryland delegates to educate the delegates about medical countermeasures.[72]
Emergent runs a charitable giving program called Give Corporate Social Responsibility. The company has given money to the Lansing, Michigan school district. Prominent donations and scholarships include; $15,000 to Lansing J. W. Sexton High School for the purchase of equipment for the AP Biology program,[73] $25,000 to Sexton High School for engineering equipment,[74] and $25,000 to the Lansing Promise scholarship fund[74]
Emergent is also a donor to the "Relentless Tour", an anti-bullying program that tries to raise awareness of autism and the problem of autistic children being bullied.[75]

Emergent BioSolutions to Acquire ACAM2000® Business From Sanofi




















July 14, 2017 07:00 ET

 | Source: Emergent BioSolutions Inc.






Addition of ACAM2000®, the only FDA-licensed smallpox vaccine, expands and diversifies Emergent’s portfolio of medical countermeasures and is synergistic with company’s existing smallpox countermeasure offeringCompany to assume responsibility for existing CDC contract with a remaining value of up to approximately $160 million for deliveries of ACAM2000 to the Strategic National StockpileAll-cash consideration of $97.5 million upfront and up to $27.5 million in near-term contingent regulatory and manufacturing-related milestonesTransaction expected to be accretive beginning with anticipated product deliveries in 2018 following FDA licensure of U.S.-based manufacturing facility GAITHERSBURG, Md., July  14, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Emergent BioSolutions Inc. (NYSE:EBS) announced today that it has entered into an agreement to acquire the ACAM2000®, (Smallpox (Vaccinia) Vaccine, Live) business of Sanofi in an all-cash transaction with a total value of up to $125 million, consisting of $97.5 million upfront and up to $27.5 million in near-term contingent regulatory and manufacturing-related milestones.   Upon the closing of this transaction, Emergent will acquire: ACAM2000®, (Smallpox (Vaccinia) Vaccine, Live), the only vaccine licensed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for active immunization against smallpox disease for persons determined to be at high risk for smallpox infection;An existing 10-year contract originally valued at up to $425 million with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) with a remaining value of up to approximately $160 million for deliveries of ACAM2000 to the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS);A cGMP bulk manufacturing facility and a lease to a cGMP fill/finish facility, both U.S.-based, along with the existing staff of approximately 100 employees. Daniel J. Abdun-Nabi, president and chief executive officer of Emergent BioSolutions, stated, “This transaction diversifies our portfolio and broadens our countermeasure franchise with a vaccine that is being stockpiled both in the U.S. and internationally. We expect it to meaningfully contribute to revenue growth in 2018 and advance our efforts towards achieving our goal of $1 billion in total revenue by 2020. We further anticipate that ACAM2000 will help us achieve our goal of generating more than 10% of total revenue from international markets. This acquisition fits squarely within our core strategy and business focus, and we look forward to closing this transaction and to integrating this business into our operations.” Strategic RationaleThis transaction supports Emergent’s plan to grow through the acquisition of revenue-generating products and businesses, leverages its core competencies in manufacturing and government contracting, and reinforces the company’s strategic focus on providing preparedness solutions for public health threats. The addition of ACAM2000 expands the company’s portfolio of only-in-class products, diversifies its portfolio of medical countermeasures against Category A bioterrorism agents, and is synergistic with its existing smallpox countermeasure offering, specifically VIGIV [Vaccinia Immune Globulin Intravenous (Human)], the only FDA-licensed therapeutic for certain complications from smallpox vaccination. Upon the closing of the transaction, Emergent will assume responsibility for an existing 10-year CDC contract, which will expire and be up for renewal or extension in 2018. The original contract, valued at up to $425 million, called for the delivery of ACAM2000 to the SNS and establishing U.S.-based manufacturing of ACAM2000. This required the tech transfer of the upstream portion of the production process from Austria to a U.S.-based manufacturing facility. Sanofi is in the process of completing this tech transfer to the cGMP bulk manufacturing facility to be acquired in this transaction. Emergent anticipates that a supplemental Biologics License Application for licensure of this facility will be filed in the second half of 2017. Upon closing, Emergent will assume all responsibilities under the CDC contract, including completing the FDA licensure process and the fulfillment of all remaining product deliveries to the SNS valued at up to approximately $160 million, subject to the availability of government funding and the exercise of contract options. The company anticipates that product deliveries will resume in 2018, following expected FDA licensure of the U.S.-based manufacturing facility. The company expects that this transaction will be accretive beginning with product deliveries following FDA licensure of the facility. The company intends to negotiate a follow-on, multi-year contract with the U.S. government to ensure the continued supply of ACAM2000 to the SNS. Emergent expects that this transaction will enhance its contract manufacturing operations through the addition of live viral manufacturing and fill/finish capabilities and the execution of a contract manufacturing agreement to supply bulk drug substance for one of Sanofi’s commercial vaccines. This transaction, which is subject to customary closing conditions including antitrust regulatory approval, is expected to close in 2017. Cowen is acting as financial advisor to Emergent in this transaction. About ACAM2000ACAM2000 is the primary smallpox vaccine designated for use in a bioterrorism emergency, with more than 230 million doses having been supplied to the U.S. Strategic National Stockpile. ACAM2000 is also licensed in Australia and Singapore, and is currently stockpiled both in the U.S. and internationally. About SmallpoxSmallpox is a highly contagious disease caused by the variola virus, a member of the Orthopox virus family. According to the CDC, it is one of the most devastating diseases with a mortality rate as high as 30%. Smallpox is classified by the CDC as a Category A bioterrorism agent and the U.S. government continues to invest in countermeasures to protect the nation from this threat. Governments around the world are also taking precautionary measures to be ready to deal with a potential smallpox outbreak.

These forward-looking statements are based on our current intentions, beliefs and expectations regarding future events. We cannot guarantee that any forward-looking statement will be accurate.

Investors are, therefore, cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statement. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this press release, and, except as required by law, we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement to reflect new information, events or circumstances. There are a number of important factors that could cause the company’s actual results to differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements, including uncertainties as to the satisfaction of closing conditions with respect to the transaction, including the timing and receipt of third-party and regulatory approvals; our ability to successfully integrate the business and realize the benefits of the transaction; the timing of expected FDA approval of the U.S. manufacturing facility for ACAM2000; our ability to extend or to otherwise deliver under the ACAM2000 contract with the CDC upon its expiration in 2018; the timing and yearly volume of product deliveries to the CDC once such deliveries have resumed under the current contract; the availability of funding and the exercise of options under the current contract for ACAM2000; and our ability to secure a follow-on, multi-year contract with the CDC. The foregoing sets forth many, but not all, of the factors that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations in any forward-looking statement. Investors should consider this cautionary statement, as well as the risk factors identified in our periodic reports filed with the SEC, when evaluating our forward-looking statements.

        Upon the closing of the transaction, Emergent will:
      
      

          Acquire raxibacumab, including corresponding product rights, regulatory approvals and intellectual property rights; and

        Emergent expects to fulfill the deliveries of raxibacumab to the SNS by the end of 2019 under the current BARDA contract, subject to the availability of funding, and expects to negotiate a follow-on contract with the U.S. government to ensure the uninterrupted supply of this critical medical countermeasure to the SNS.
