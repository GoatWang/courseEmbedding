Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Chase (NYSEMKT:CCF) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: No ratings tracked in the last 12 months.Consensus Rating:N/A (Score: NaN)Consensus Price Target: N/A

Investors
Growth Investors
Seek long term capital appreciation by primarily investing in equity funds and individual securities of companies domiciled in the United States and abroad. Any income received from a Growth Portfolio is incidental. This portfolio is designed for investors with an investment horizon of ten years or more and who are willing to accept a greater degree of volatility and risk in order to achieve greater long term growth.
Moderate Growth & Income Investors
Seek long term capital appreciation with a secondary consideration of income. The portfolio will typically be dominated by equity funds and individual securities of established U.S. companies. In addition, a percentage of such portfolios would be committed to fixed-income securities. This portfolio is designed for investors with an investment horizon of five years or more and who do not wish to accept the inherent volatility assumed by Growth Investors.
Income & Conservative Investors
Seek current income with preservation of capital. This portfolio will typically be dominated by fixed-income securities (bonds). In addition, this portfolio usually contains minimal exposure to equities for the sole purpose of providing growth of principal and income. It is designed for investors who have a need for current income, preservation of capital and preservation of purchasing power over time.
We value the confidence each client has placed in us and recognize the importance of our role in providing for his or her financial security. Therefore, ongoing communication with our clients is crucial in establishing and executing a successful game plan. We place great importance on gathering information and in utilizing that information to develop the best portfolio to achieve your goals.

Welcome to Fagan Associates
As an Independent Financial Advisor for over 27 years, we take personal pride in handling the individual needs of all our clients: Investments, Wealth Management, Retirement Planning. Currently, we have just under $300 million under management. All portfolios are managed separately, and we are Fee-Based, eliminating the conflict of interest that comes with compensation based on commissions.
Our commitment is to you!




 



Investment Management
History has proven that smart, sound and disciplined investing is the #1 way to accumulate wealth and establish financial security. We develop customized portfolios for all our clients, which are separately managed at Charles Schwab and Co., Inc. Under this format, clients own the individual assets in their accounts. This allows us to provide personalized treatment and manage/minimize tax liability. Learn More



Financial Planning
Having a strategy in place for your money and assets is all-important. We evaluate your current financial situation and devise a comprehensive plan going forward – one that includes investing, budgeting, saving, as well as looking ahead to the future for milestone events, such as funding education, buying a home and planning for retirement.  Learn More





Retirement Planning
We all want to enter our retirement years on sound financial ground. For that to happen there are critical steps which need to be taken – now. We provide the guidance, tools and services to help clients reach their goal of a secure and comfortable retirement, including strategies on saving, investing, social security, pension management and rollovers. Learn More



Business/Corporate Services
At Fagan Associates we not only assist individual investors with their financial needs, but many of our clients are small business owners and corporations. We provide business owners with 401k management services for their employees, with the option of utilizing mutual funds, bonds and individual stocks.
