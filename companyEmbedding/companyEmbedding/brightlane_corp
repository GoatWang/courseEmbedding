Making Home ownership possible
 
LEARN MORE


 Brightlane Corp. is disrupting the traditional methods of obtaining home ownership. Brightlane Corp. provides an alternative pathway to home ownership that is currently not available to a large segment of the US population. 










Brightlane Management
 







Brightlane Management
 



Brightlane management strongly believes there is a market need in the US for lower-priced, single-family residential homes utilizing a “Lease/Purchase Option”. At present we are not aware of a, public company or REIT has entered the lower-priced, single-family residential home “Lease/Purchase Option” space on a national level. Brightlane has unique abilities, on a national scale, to execute the acquisition and effective management of lower-priced, single-family homes via its experienced management and strategic partners. Brightlane believes it possesses the elements necessary for success and can quickly become the national leader in this particular segment of single-family residential home rental space.
