Video About Security Federal Bank 
 Video Transcript: Security Federal Bank was founded in 1922 in picturesque Aiken, South Carolina. In 1987, we formed a holding company, Security Federal Corporation, which trades on the Over the Counter Bulletin Board under the symbol SFDL.OB. We have branches located throughout Aiken, Lexington and Richland Counties (Metro Columbia), South Carolina and a branch in Columbia County (Metro Augusta), Georgia. We have three branches that are Open 7 Days a Week.
Security Federal Bank is committed to providing the highest level of financial services in a trustworthy, courteous and professional manner, treating all of our customers equitably and fairly.  In fact, we have a long tradition of focusing on the customers we serve. Our central theme is “Do what’s in the best interest of the customer.” This slogan reverberates throughout the entire organization and is spoken frequently by our Chairman of the Board.

Banking Services
Security Federal offers a full line of personal and commercial products including online and mobile banking, online bill payment, and a broad array of commercial, consumer and mortgage loan products. We are also proud of our Looney Tunes Savings Club for youngsters and our Financial Counseling Department, both of which provide innovative products and approaches that enhance financial education and help people become good stewards of their fiscal resources.  We believe in investing in our community. That’s one reason the U.S. Treasury awarded us national recognition and certification as a Community Development Financial Institution (CDFI) in September 2010.

Trust and Investments*
We want to help our customers reach their financial goals.  That’s why we offer financial management services through two divisions: Security Federal Investments* and Security Federal Trust*.  Our Trust division provides services that assist you in managing personal investments, paying bills for loved ones, or carrying out an estate plan, while the Investment division offers a full menu of financial products including mutual funds, annuities, and various retirement accounts.

Insurance Products*
Security Federal Insurance offers an extensive line of insurance* products, including business, personal, auto and homeowners to protect your personal and business assets.

Please stop in at one of our convenient locations. We would love to get to know you, your family, and your business too,  and see if we can help you manage your financial resources and reach your personal goals.
