His vision for expansion began as far back as 1990 when he was hired as the bank’s chief financial officer. At the time, the bank had two locations and less than 25 employees. Today, Hamilton Bank operates eight Maryland locations from its headquarters in Towson, and its staff has more than tripled. DeAlmeida and his team have expanded the bank’s services to meet the complete banking needs of small businesses, retailers, consumers, and homeowners across Greater Baltimore. 
During his prior post as CFO of Hamilton Bank, DeAlmeida managed the accounting operations and investments for the bank, yet he quickly found himself entrenched in other aspects of the business. DeAlmeida handled negotiations and all related acquisition dealings, fueling growth for Hamilton Bank at a time when other banks were struggling. He became vice president and treasurer in 1990, and earned the position of bank president in July 2005. During DeAlmeida’s tenure, Hamilton Bank has proven its stability, its reputation, and its dedication to the customer. 
DeAlmeida is a past chairman and serves on the board of directors of the Maryland Bankers Association, the only professional association representing the banking industry in Maryland. He also serves on the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond’s Community Depository Institutions Advisory Council (CDIAC), a 12 member, hand-selected group of banking experts that shares insights on the economy, banking conditions, lending conditions, regulatory matters and other issues that affect the ability of community depository institutions to serve local markets.
