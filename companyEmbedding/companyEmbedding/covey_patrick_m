This report is not for commercial use. Thorough reviews have been conducted to assure this data accurately reflects disclosures. However for a complete and definitive understanding of the pay practices of any company, users should refer directly to the actual, complete proxy statement. 
Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement. You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code). You may also find the annual proxy statement by going directly to the company's website.
What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.

Industry News












KENT, Ohio – The Davey Tree Expert Company has announced the promotion of Patrick M. Covey to president and chief operating officer of U.S. Operations.

Additionally, Davey’s board of directors has nominated Covey to fill a three-year position on Davey’s board, subject to approval by the shareholders at the annual meeting in mid-May. 
    
Karl Warnke, Davey’s chairman, president and CEO, said that Covey has demonstrated key leadership qualities, sound judgment and a strong commitment to the company during his 20 years at Davey.

“Pat has been a respected leader during his tenure at Davey,” said Warnke. “He has been instrumental in the successful integration of some of the largest acquisitions in Davey history and has worked relentlessly to build collaboration between the operating segments.”

Over the years, Covey has served in various capacities with increasing responsibility in both the field operations and the operations support segments of the company. Covey joined Davey in 1991 as internal auditor. He transferred to eastern utility operations in 1993 and was promoted to administrative manager in 1996. He served as a team leader on the SAP implementation project and managed the systems and process group from 2000 to 2003, when he was promoted to vice president of southern utility operations. In 2005, he was promoted to vice president and general manager of the Davey Resource Group and in 2007, he was promoted to executive vice president, operations, a title he held until he became chief operating officer, U.S. operations, in 2012. 

“Throughout his tenure, Pat has gained valuable experience and a diverse understanding of how Davey and the Green Industry operates,” Warnke said. “This unique perspective and background provide him with the knowledge necessary to fulfill the expectations that have been set for him in his new role as president and COO of our U.S. operations.” 

Covey earned a degree in business from the University of Wisconsin and is a certified public accountant.  He is a past member of Davey’s President’s Council and serves on a number of boards of Davey subsidiaries.  He also serves on the board of directors for Junior Achievement of North Central Ohio and the Portage County Development Board.  

Reporting to Covey are Steve Marshall, executive vice president of U.S. utility operations, and Jim Stief, executive vice president of U.S. residential and commercial operations. Additionally, two service lines and the Davey Institute will report directly to Covey.
