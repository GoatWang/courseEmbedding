Spine Injury Solutions, Inc.,
Spine Injury Solutions, Inc. (OTC QB: SPIN) is a medical services and technology company that underwrites healthcare services related to liability spine injuries. The company has developed a fast-trax™ system, utilizing its patent pending video technology to expedite case management and claims settlement, while creating comprehensive transparency of forensic data to facilitate the insurance and legal process.
Company Information






  





What Is Spine Injury Solutions, Inc.,
Spine Injury Solutions, Inc. was incorporated under the laws of Delaware on March 4, 1998. We changed our name to Spine Injury Solutions Inc on September 1, 2015. We have two wholly-owned subsidiaries, Quad Video Halo, Inc. which holds certain assets associated with our Quad Video Halo (“QVH”) business, and Cleric Holdings, LLC which holds certain intangible assets.
SPIN is a technology, marketing, billing and collection company facilitating diagnostic services for patients who have sustained spine injuries. In addition, we are developing QVH programs to assist surgeons and other healthcare providers with treatment documentation in specialized areas, such as spine injuries and regenerative medicine. We deliver turnkey solutions to spine surgeons, orthopedic surgeons and other healthcare providers who treat spin injuries. Our goal is to become a leader in providing technology and monetizing services to spine and orthopedic surgeons and other healthcare providers. By monetizing the providers’ accounts receivables, patients are not unnecessarily delayed or prevented from obtaining needed treatment. After a patient is billed for the procedures preformed we oversee collections.
We currently are providing technology and or collection services to three spine injury diagnostic centers in the United States, which are located in Houston, Texas; Odessa, Texas; and Tyler, Texas. We are seeking additional funding for expansion by way of reasonable debt financing to accelerate future development. In connection with this strategy, we plan to offer our technology to additional diagnostic centers in new market areas that are attractive under our business model, assuming adequate funds are available.
We own a patented device and process by which a video recording system is attached to a fluoroscopic x-ray machine, the “four camera technology,” which we believe can attract additional physicians and patients, and provide us with additional revenue streams with our new programs designed to assist in treatment documentation. We have refined the technology, through research and development, resulting in a fully commercialized Quad Video Halo System 3.0. Using this technology, diagnostic and treatment procedures are recorded from four separate video feeds that capture views from both inside and outside the body, and a video is made which is given to the patient’s representative to verify the treatment received. Additionally, we anticipate independent medical representatives will sell Quad Video Halo units to additional hospitals and clinics.

											Spine Injury Solutions Reports Q1 2017 Financial Results And Updates And Reminds For Interactive Video Conference Call 4:20 ET Today										 

By Webmaster | News Releases | 
									No Comments

HOUSTON, May 15, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Spine Injury Solutions, Inc. (OTCQB:SPIN), a technology-driven, medical service, and healthcare solution and financing company servicing the multi-billion dollar spine injury sector, today announces Financial Results for Q1 2017. The company has also scheduled an interactive video Investor conference call for Today, Monday May 25, 2017 at 4:20 p.m. (EST) to discuss the Company’s financial results for Q1, 2017. We plan to discuss the new Nationwide Affiliate Expansion Roll-out for its core Personal Injury Case funding along with the current marketing status of its patented Quad Video HALO™ v.3.0, Shareholders Question & Answers will follow.
Dr. William Donovan, Chairman/CEO Commented; “Earlier this year, management made the decision to focus this year on expanding our  profitable core business model of funding Spinal Injury medical procedures through our  affiliates. This model that has generated over 8,500 procedures over seven years, a gross return of some $16.5 million cash collected while awaiting additional settlement, in total creating a favorable return of approximately 150%.  This strategy  requires a branded, standardized and scalable program for expansion. As reported on YE 16 call, such a major step was not going to happen overnight. Since that time, a lot has been accomplished, both from standardizing documentation to include compiling  Affiliate Operations Manual and legal affiliate agreements. Donovan went on to say, “Around the time of the last conference call, the Company announced the soon opening of a new Affiliate Center in Lubbock Texas at the suggestion of one of Texas’ largest personal injury law firms. Though the announcement was preliminary and had little detail, the local Lubbock newspaper picked up on the announcement attracting other Doctors and  local law firms who had heard of SPIN and its Quad Video HALO™ and already are referring patients. Though such a short time, more than a dozen Lubbock patients have already been referred. With response such as we have witnessed in Lubbock, the Company has set a target to add as many as ten to twelve Affiliates over the next 18 months. It is not unrealistic to assume that a goal of 25 Spinal Procedures a month after six to twelve months is achievable. Now with the groundwork laid for this expansion, we think  the time is right to consider adding a top level executive as Chief Operating Officer position to assist in development. I invite all interested parties to attend our Q1 2017 Interactive Video Conference Call or view its replay which will be out by tomorrow morning.”
Results of Operations
For the Quarter ended March 31, 2017.
Comparison of the three month period ended March 31, 2017 with the three month period ended March 31, 2016.
We recorded $831,320, in gross revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2017, offset by $330,157 of the expected settlement discount resulting in net revenue of $501,163.  For the same period in 2016, gross revenue was $1,162,621, offset by $495,357 of expected settlement discount, resulting in net revenue of $667,264.  Revenue was negatively affected by the closing of the San Antonio affiliate in 2016. For the three months ended March 31, 2017, we managed three spine injury diagnostic centers: Houston, Texas; Tyler, Texas and Odessa, Texas. Lubbock, Texas will become active in the second quarter of 2017. Service cost was $156,804 for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to $228,310 for the same period in 2016.
During the three months ended March 31, 2017, we incurred $382,028 of operating, general and administrative expenses compared to $366,513 for the same period in 2016.  Operating, general and administrative expenses were higher for the 2017 quarter compared to 2016 primarily because of an increase in consulting fees, payroll expenses, website planning fees, and traveling expenses totaling approximately $77,000, coupled with reductions in bad debt expense, legal fees, rent, and other expenses of $61,000. The higher consulting costs for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 were mostly incurred in connection with the expansion of our Affiliate Program and marketing of the QVH. There were no research and development costs during the quarter ended March 31, 2017 as compared to $6,149 in 2016.  We also experienced a decrease of $63,692 in non-cash operating charges from $110,519 for the three months ended March 31, 2016 to $46,827 for the three months ended March 31, 2017.
As a result of the foregoing, we had net loss of $49,389 or $.002 per share for the three months ended March 31, 2017, compared to $53,159, $.002 of net income for the three months ended March 31, 2016.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
For the three months ended March 31, 2017, cash used in operations was $93,553 which primarily included decreases in accounts receivable of $4,080 and increases in prepaid expenses of $27,750, related party payables of $44,066 and accounts payable of $23,255.  For the same period in 2016, cash used in operations was $26,595, which primarily included increases in accounts receivable of $154,533, inventories of $2,916, prepaid expenses of $27,750, and a decrease in accounts payable of $33,010, partially offset by net income of $53,159 and an increase of $27,936 in due to related party.  We used no cash in investing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016.
Cash used in financing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 consisted of repayments on our notes payable in the amount of $50,000 and $20,000, respectively. We collected $419,086 and $512,729 in settlements during the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

HOUSTON, March 28, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Spine Injury Solutions, Inc. (OTCQB:SPIN), a technology-driven, medical service, and healthcare solution and financing company servicing the multi-billion dollar spine injury sector, today announces financial results for year ending December 31, 2016 and that it has scheduled an interactive video investor conference call for today, Tuesday, March 28, 2017 at 4:20 p.m. (EDT) to discuss the company’s financial results for YE 2016, its new nationwide affiliate expansion roll-out for its case funding along with the current marketing status of its patented Quad Video HALO™ v.3.0, shareholders Question & Answers will follow.
2016 Highlights and Subsequent Events

New National Affiliate expansion program initiated targeting 6-8 affiliates over next 12-18 month
Affiliate added in Lubbock, TX
SVP of Sales & Marketing, Dr. Matthew DeGaetano appointed
Quad Video HALO™ V3.0 EU Patent Pending
$15 Million collections milestone passed, ending with $16.1 Million
Developed two new leasing programs for QVH 3rd Party Sales.
Ended 2016 with strong cash & available credit facilities
Increased operational efficiency of core business as seen by improved top and bottom line, lower SG&A and strong increase in Gross Margins.

2016 Financial Highlights

YoY Cash Provided from Operations provided to $202,616 as compared to $429,297
2016 Gross Margin Increased to Record 68% from 61% 2015
Full year net loss YoY decreased from 2015 of  $1,057,604  to  this  year of  $745,945
Full year YoY net loss per share decreased 42% from -$.054 to -$.038 PS
2016 Non-cash charges of $789,135 exceeded the 2016 $745,945 loss.

Dr. William Donovan, Chairman/CEO Commented; “While revenues were flat year over year mainly due to ending of a legacy affiliate relationship in San Antonio in 2016, overall results had several bright spots, despite the fact we are not happy with the financial results for 2016.  Our full year 2016 loss consisted  mainly of noncash charges.  Our loss per share   was reduced by some 40% in 2016. The reduction would have been greater had we not reserved an additional $500,000 in bad debt reserves to account for the decreased collections in Florida.  Cashflow had   $202,000 provided from operations compared to $429,000 use in 2015.  The best indicator for the future growth for SPIN is using  the QVH on cases and continuing as done in 2016 increasing in gross margin to 68% from 61%. The percentages of settlements we collected was higher than we originally booked which boosted our gross margin percentage.  Donovan went on to say, “While we spent a good part of last year investigating third party sales for the QVH, a near term costly endeavor, our increasing margins made us realize that our immediate plan should be to expand our case funding affiliate model. This model will be covered extensively on our conference call today.  While there is no limiting factor to affiliate growth other than cash available to fund cases, our hope for the next 12 to 18 months is to add 6 to 8 affiliates.
Results of Operations
For the year ended December 31, 2016 versus 2015:
We recorded $2,117,078 in net revenues with $689,101 in costs of services and gross profit of $1,427,977 for the year ended December 31, 2016.  For the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded $2,192,181 in net revenues with $849,756 in costs of services and gross profit of $1,342,425.  Revenue for 2016 was down due to our center in San Antonio electing not to continue the business relationship.
We recognize revenue by reference to “net revenue,” which is gross amounts billed using CPT codes less account discounts that are expected to result when individual cases are ultimately settled.  A discount rate of 48% based on settled patient cases, was used to determine net revenue during 2016 and 2015. Accordingly, we had gross revenues of $3,537,791 with net revenues of $2,117,078 for the year ended December 31, 2016, versus gross revenues of $4,384,362 with net revenues of $2,192,181 for the year ended December 31, 2015.  The Company realized better than expected collections during 2016 related to its outstanding accounts receivable.
Expenses
For the year ended December 31, 2016 versus 2015:
Operating, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $2,087,266 as compared to $2,085,986 for the year ended December 31, 2015.   Operating expenses were flat primarily the result of an increase to bad debt expense offset by a decrease in legal costs, consulting costs, and marketing costs.
Bad debt expense, included in operating, general and administrative expenses, totaled $683,338 and $467,600, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. The increase in bad debt expense is primarily attributable to our decision to discontinue doing business in Florida in 2014, which has resulted in limited personnel and affiliates in the region to assist in collection efforts. While we continue to pursue all amounts owed, we increased the allowance for bad debt related to Florida accounts to reflect collection trends in Florida.
Other income (expense) for the year ended December 31, 2016 was an expense of $50,995 as compared to expense of $52,267 for the year ended December 31, 2015. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, other income of $7,057 offset by expenses of $58,052.  For the year ended December 31, 2015, other income was $10,234 offset by expenses of $62,501. The small decrease in expense 2016 versus 2015 is primarily attributable to the restructuring of our debt from high interest notes to our line of credit with Wells Fargo which bears interest at the 30 day London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus 2%, resulting in an effective rate of 2.77% at December 31, 2016.
Net Income or Loss
For the year ended December 31, 2016 versus 2015:
Net loss for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $755,945 compared to net loss of $1,057,604 for the year ended December 31, 2015.  Lower operating expenses, coupled with reduced interest costs, and lower personnel costs to develop and market the Quad Video Halo, resulted in net loss decreasing in 2016 from 2015.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
For the year ended December 31, 2016 versus 2015:
During 2016, cash provided in operating activities was $202,616 as compared to $429,297 of cash used in 2015.  The increase in cash generated in operations was mainly due to an increase in collections from our spine injury diagnostic centers, especially Odessa, coupled with higher noncash charges. These provisions were offset by uses of cash for increased inventory of Quad Video Halo units.  Our settlement collections totaled $2,378,793 in 2016 compared to $2,193,094 in 2015.
During the year ended December 31, 2016, we did not purchase any Quad Video Halo equipment versus a purchase of similar equipment of $50,108 in 2015, resulting in cash used in investing activities.
Cash flows used in financing activities totaled $120,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016, consisting of a payment of current debt of $250,000, and $130,000 of draws on our line of credit. For the year ended December 31, 2015, cash flows provided from financing activities totaled $295,000, consisting of a payment of long-term debt of $350,000, draws of $645,000 on the line of credit.

											Spine Injury Solutions Inc. announces new Lubbock, TX affiliate location										 

By Webmaster | News Releases | 
									No Comments

Houston, March 20, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Spine Injury Solutions, Inc. announces Lubbock TX affiliate location under its new affiliate expansion program.
HOUSTON, March 20, 2017 — Spine Injury Solutions, Inc., Inc. (OTCQB:SPIN), a technology-driven, medical service, and healthcare solution company servicing the multi-billion dollar spine injury sector, today announced the addition of a new affiliate program to be located in Lubbock, TX.
Seven years ago, SPIN initiated its first affiliate program in Houston TX whereby SPIN would provide funding assistance to independent healthcare providers who provide diagnostic and treatment procedures for patients with spine injury accidents. In many cases the reimbursements for these medical treatments took several years, depending on the settlement timing of the case. For these reasons, SPIN developed programs to fund the affilates case billings after the procedure is completed at a discount and assume risk of future collection. During these seven years, while averaging three affiliates, over 8,300 procedures have been funded generating some $25 million in reported net revenues for SPIN. Actual cash collections to date from SPIN funded cases have exceeded $16 million.
Why SPIN Is Now Expanding Its Affiliate Program Nationally
In early 2014, SPIN began beta testing of a unique video transparency and documenting device called Quad Video HALO™ (QVH). In 2015 it received its US Patent on the QVH and began Medical Safety Certification Testing. In 2016, 3rd Party Testing was successfully completed and the QVH became certified for Medical use in both the US and EU. Since adding the QVH to its affiliate program, almost 2,500 cases have been funded. Included in the new affiliate Program is training based on SPIN’s business model. In many cases, there is minimal cash outlay to the independent healthcare providers other than a monthly cloud storage for all procedures involving the QVH. The independent healthcare provider may offer SPIN the option to fund all cases which used the QVH. SPIN has been advised by some attorneys that the use of the QVH helps expedite the settlement of the case.
William F. Donovan, M.D., Chairman CEO of Spine Injury Solutions, Inc., said, “Costs associated with accident victims total in the hundreds of millions of dollars annually. Much of this cost is attributable to delayed or improper early diagnosis of the injury causing unnecessary, long term problems and costs. With over 40 years’ experience as a Board Certified Orthopedic surgeon, I have evaluated many cases that would not have required unnecessary treatments if early diagnosis would have been made. I came to the conclusion that lack of proper ‘tools’ rather than medical incompetency was the cause in the delay for patients to receive appropriate, necessary, and reasonable treatment. This led to the development of the SPIN affiliate program with its appropriate protocols and most importantly, the QVH.”
.Having been one of the first surgeons in the country to use video in arthroscopic surgery, I felt there was a need to provide video documentation for accident victim procedures. For this reason, SPIN has invested some $2.5 million in developing and putting into service its proprietary QVH v.3. To date the QVH has been used on some 2,500 cases providing transparency for procedures performed.

In August of 1998, Larry started his own law firm on Galveston Island. While the office may be located on Galveston Island, he has been able to enjoy a statewide practice and handle cases in other states and participate in the handling of cases in other countries such as Mexico and Honduras.
The decision by SPIN to form the Advisory Board with Tylka as head was made by management based on Tylka’ strong passion for, and highly successful use of SPIN’s Quad Video HALO (QVH) over the past two years from the beginning of Beta testing. As a former Personal Injury defense attorney and subsequently multi-year member of the “Million Dollar Advocates Forum” representing injury victims, Tylka is a strong advocate willing to publically share his strong endorsement of QVH. He is openly willing to share that QVH is the tool that has significantly increased his victim’s settlements and considerably reduced time to resolution. But even more important, he feels that with the use of QVH, comfort is being provided victims that “Best Practices of Medicine” are being observed and documented though SPIN’s proprietary QVH Video protocol. To quote Tylka at a recent meeting; “Once made aware of it, I can’t see why any Personal Injury attorney would not want to use QVH.”
Dr. Donovan stated; “I have known and worked with Larry for many years. With his vast experience in personal injury law, from both initially as an Insurance Industry advocate and now an advocate for the victim, his advice, guidance and perspective contributed in the development of the QVH has been invaluable. Investors first heard from Larry as guest panelist on our Q1, 2016 Investors Conference Call heaping accolades on SPIN based on his own successful use of the QVH video in expediting case settlements at considerably higher levels than before. Since that time, his selfless willingness to help ‘spread the word’ of his success to the legal community has given us confidence that the time was now right to expand our very successful local ‘Affiliate’ program nationally. His willingness to ‘attach’ his name and reputation, directly to SPIN and QVH, by “chairing” our new Advisory Board, is solid testimony to the quality and potential of SPIN’s new Affiliate program as it rolls out.”

											Spine Injury Solutions Inc. unveils well received Affiliate Expansion Program at Personal injury Seminar in Atlanta										 

By Spine Injury Solutions Inc | News Releases | 
									No Comments

Houston, Feb. 17, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) —
Spine Injury Solutions, Inc. (SPIN) unveils well-received Affiliate Expansion Program at seminar in Atlanta.
After three years in development, SPIN’s patented Quad Video HALO™ (QVH) Video Medical Records Technology (VMRT), paired with its successful seven year history of injury case financing delivered through three contracted “Affiliates”, the stage has now been set for a nationwide expansion of its unique new Affiliate Program adding a high-tech advantage to injured accident victims. 
HOUSTON, Feb. 16, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Spine Injury Solutions, Inc. (OTCQB:SPIN), a technology-driven, medical service, finance,  and healthcare solution company servicing the multi-billion dollar spine injury sector, through its Chairman/CEO Dr. William Donovan, MD is pleased to report that the Company’s attendance and speaker participation at the pre-announced James J. Mathis “Personal Injury: Understanding Colossus Seminar” in Atlanta, GA, February 11, 2017 was a success in several aspects.
The Seminar attendees, primarily made up of healthcare providers and attorneys servicing the  Personal Injury (PI) industry were introduced (most for the first time), to SPIN’s proprietary, patented, Quad Video HALO™ v3.0 and its success in facilitating patient confidence, “Best Medical Practices” and higher case settlements in shorter time for cases involving diagnostic and treatment injections. The original beta QVH first began clinic testing and trials in 2014 in Houston TX with Northshore Orthopedics (NSO), SPIN’s first “Affiliate” owned by SPIN Founder/Chairman. NSO along with several satellite locations, using SPIN’s Medical Lien financing program since 2010, had, up until the first use of QVH in 2014, financed over 6,000 diagnostic injection procedures in the conventional non-technical way similar to what the rest of the country uses today. While under continuing testing and development, the QVH received its US Patent in 2015 and its successful completion of compliance testing of the Quad Video HALO System to meet EN 60601-1 safety standard for medical equipment along with its EU approval to carry the CE Mark, in 2016.
SPIN has internally invested approximately $2.5 million in developing the QVH which has now been used and proven successful in an additional 2,400 case procedures. Early on in the testing of the QVH, second and third SPIN Affiliates were added in Midland/Odessa and Tyler, TX who contributed to the latter 2,400 procedures.
Armed with data and both medical and attorney testimonials giving clear “Proof of Concept” to the conjoining of the QVH v3.0 with conventional spine injection procedures, SPIN management made the decision in late 2016, to develop a new  Nationwide all-encompassing affiliate program to be introduced for the first time at the Atlanta seminar. New SPIN affiliates once qualified and accepted, will be trained to provide best practices, be referred cases generated by SPIN paid-for marketing, and trained in the use of SPIN’s QVH, all provided at no additional cost to their existing practices.  Once the procedures are completed, SPIN will early monetize the affiliates case billing leaving no further collection risk.
The new affiliate program capitalizes on SPIN’s unique position in having exclusive access to its patented QVH. When the decision was made in December to expand its affiliate program, the targets were to add a minimum of four affiliates, with two in Atlanta and maximum of 10 affiliates over the following year.  The company is pleased to report significant interest in the program by over 20 attendees, mostly from Atlanta, but also from four additional States making the high end of the target range appear very achievable.
Additionally –though the QVH was originally developed for internal SPIN affiliate use, while under continuing development, it was  realized that a large additional market existed. A market for instantly transportable High Definition video providing transparency could be much broader.  For example, there is a need for  a Hybrid Video Integration Platform for general surgery, not only for QVH’s own four camera video showing internal x-ray real-time view along with three external cameras, but also to piggy-back additional video devices. QVH also has built-in capabilities to plug-in any digital or analog video medical device with “video out” capabilities. Devices used in robotic, arthroscopic, microscopic, etc. surgical procedures both for risk management, or use in hospitals and cadaver labs for global education can work with the QVH. Though direct sales were not the primary target at the Atlanta seminar, management also reports significant third party, non-PI interest, in the QVH such as described above from three attendees.
Dr. Donovan stated; “On behalf of the SPIN and QVH Management, Directors and Development team, I cannot overstate how pleased we were with the reception we received from not just the attendees, but even the Sponsors and other Presenters at Atlanta. We anticipate adding and announcing new team members shortly. “
Donovan added; “For those not familiar with SPIN’s history, it should be noted that since inception some seven years ago, SPIN’s business advances to include the QVH development have been financed through its own organic revenues, sporadic third party straight debt paid off on time and some early loans by me later exchanged for shares. SPIN has never asked for, or received any outside equity financing, public or private. While I am the largest shareholder of the Company, the vast majority of my shares were either purchased in the open market or early loans I made to the Company which I converted to restricted shares at market value. The majority by far of my share purchases and/or debt conversions were at prices higher than the current share price.”

											Spine Injury Solutions, Inc. Reports Q3 2016 Financial Results and Reminds for Conference Call at 4:20 EST Today										 

By Spine Injury Solutions Inc | News Releases | 
									No Comments


Q3 Loss of $178,401 decreased 19% from $219,674 in Q3 15 –fourth consecutive quarterly decrease in loss.
Q3 Collections of $575,000 are highest of the year, passing the $15 million milestone since inception.
Q3 Gross Margins of 68%, a new record level.
Nationwide Marketing Initiative for QVH launched in November.

HOUSTON, Nov. 14, 2016 — Spine Injury Solutions, Inc. (OTCQB:SPIN), a technology-driven, medical service, financing and healthcare solution company servicing the multi-billion dollar spine injury sector, reports Q3 2016 financial results and will hold an interactive video Investor conference call today Monday, November, 14, 2016, at 4:20 p.m. EST to discuss the Company’s financial results for third quarter 2016 and provide an update on its current and future business initiatives.
Dr. Donovan, Chairman CEO stated, “While I am somewhat disappointed that no QVH sales were completed in Q3, our marketing team has made strides in formulating a strategic marketing plan which vastly increases the scope and size of our QVH product line. During the quarter, the Company presented its QVH v.3 and QVH Rx at several trade shows and workshops attracting some qualified leads. The biggest takeaway was feedback confirming that our new unique video documentation transparency QVH Rx system, which had its first operating room tests done earlier in the year, is engendering interest from administrators at hospitals, teaching hospitals/cadaver labs and ambulatory surgical centers for both its risk management aspects as well as education. Because of what we have learned, we feel we now have evidence of need for the Company to leverage our marketing efforts through national and regional commission only medical product rep firms.”
Donovan went on to say, “While net revenues may have declined a bit in Q3, net loss has also declined to its lowest level of the year, and our gross margin has increased to 68%, its best level ever. Additionally, Q3 cash collections of $575,000 was the highest of the year, bringing total cash received from our legacy business to over $15 million from inception.”
Results of Operations
Comparison of the three month period ended September 30, 2016 with the three month period ended September 30, 2015.
We recorded $782,276 in gross revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2016, offset by $323,318 of the expected settlement discount resulting in net revenue of $458,958. For the same period in 2015, gross revenue was $1,110,533, offset by $597,770 of the expected settlement discount, resulting in net revenue of $512,763. We ceased providing collection services to the San Antonio diagnostic center during the first quarter of 2016, and accordingly had no revenue in San Antonio for the three months ended September 30, 2016 versus the same quarter in 2015. This is the primary reason for the above decline in gross revenue between those two periods. Net revenue as a percentage of gross revenue increased to 58.7% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from 46.2% for the three months ended September 30, 2015 due to a higher collection percentage in the 2016 quarter. We are currently providing technology and funding services to five spine injury diagnostic centers in the United States, which are located in Houston, Texas; Odessa, Texas; Tyler, Texas; El Paso, Texas; and Dallas, Texas.
Service cost was $146,314 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $221,557 for the same period in 2015. The decrease is due mainly to lower volume.
During the three months ended September 30, 2016, we incurred $459,126 of operating, general and administrative expenses compared with the $409,532 for the same period in 2015. The increase is attributable to increases in (i) travel costs of approximately $19,000, (ii) marketing costs of approximately $29,000, (iii) depreciation and amortization expense of approximately $3,000, (iv) payroll and benefit costs of approximately $10,000, (v) legal expenses of approximately $3,000 and (vi) office and operating expenses of $9,000, coupled with a decreases of (i) approximately $18,000 in consulting costs, and (ii) approximately $5,000 in subscriptions costs.
During the three months ended September 30, 2016, we incurred $18,862 of research and development expenses compared with $89,512 for the same period in 2015. The decrease is attributable to costs incurred during the three months ended September 30, 2015 for engineering and testing fees to verify the Quad Video Halo (“QVH”) meets certain standards. Our patented (Patent No. 9,084,577) technology meets UL compliance with specific immunity and emissions standards required by IEC 60601-1-2-2007.
As a result of the aforementioned, we had a net loss of $178,401 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to a net loss of $219,674 for the three months ended September 30, 2015.

Marketing Strategy









  





Spine Injury Solutions intends to continue to expand within its current regions as well as expand geographically, with the target of achieving an average of $200,000 in monthly gross revenue per center. To reach these goals, Spine Injury Solutions will from time to time seek additional “growth” working capital to strengthen its revenue base and achieve economies of scale resulting in efficient and reduced-cost production. In addition, in order to cost-effectively open clinics in new markets, Spine Injury Solutions has initiated a staged process. The Company strategically identifies a territory and credentials affiliates through an on-boarding process to ensure superior results and maximum market penetration. Once this clinic proves its viability,

The target of achieving an average of $200,000 in monthly gross revenue per center

it either becomes a preferred provider which can be a physician owned affiliate or corporate-owned clinic, depending upon the regulatory environment of the territory. Currently, Spine Injury Solutions has all doctor owned affiliates and no corporate-owned clinics. The Company intends to migrate a portion of affiliate clinics to company-owned over time when appropriate. Additionally, Spine Injury Solutions is interested in implementing a strategic marketing strategy for the patent-pending HALO Quad Video Tehcnology™ System that is synergistic to its core business and creates new business opportunities. Quad Video HALO Technology™ presents other potential avenues for growth and revenue.
Spine Injury Solutions is in a constant state of self-improvement and development in an effort to further advance its Fast-trax™ process and reduce time to settlement. Its objective is to create a cloud system that would improve the scalability and market penetration of Spine Injury Solutions services. Improved synergy and cooperation between all parties involved will achieve greater efficiency and result in an increasingly positive solution.

Company Information









  





Spine Injury Solutions’s first affiliated clinic (Houston) opened in September 2009 to address a dilemma in the spine injury sector, a market estimated at over $50 billion, annually. Market trends in the treatment of spine injury all point to increased costs to the American public, Government and the insurance carriers for the foreseeable future, while cash flow for doctors has been compromised by various Government programs and health care insurance companies. Ultimately, patient care is at risk, particularly as indemnity health insurance and other funding for services quickly run out during the first several months of treatment. Spine Injury Solutions enters the process at this stage of care, when patient funding is limited or unavailable.

Spine Injury Solutions addresses a dilemma in a market estimated at over $50 billion, annually.

Dr. William Donovan, through his 30+ years as an orthopedic surgeon and as a successful entrepreneur has developed a fast-trax™ system to assist accident victims in receiving appropriate, reasonable and necessary care for liability spine injuries. Since 2009, Spine Injury Solutions has successfully delivered a medium in which spine injury patients can obtain much needed healthcare, healthcare providers can receive timely payment and legal and insurance professionals can obtain accurate, detailed records of patients’ treatments that support and shorten time to settlement. Importantly, Spine Injury Solutions has developed various Risk Management techniques to further insure transparency, safety and accuracy of the diagnostic procedures performed by the affiliated doctors to facilitate accurate diagnosis. Through years of experience Dr. Donovan and his staff have interjected cost and time efficiency together with transparency for optimal results together with strong financial returns.
Currently Spine Injury Solutions funds healthcare services through facilities in Texas and Florida. The company owns no brick and mortar and assumes no medical liability. The company is expanding rapidly and reported profitable full year growth beginning in 2010. The company recently raised $1.5 million in two separate private placements in June and September 2012. This additional capital will be used to expand the Company’s footprint in Florida as well as begin expansion into additional states.

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

					Full Description



Spine Injury Solutions, Inc., formally Spine Pain Management, Inc., incorporated on March 4, 1998, is a technology, marketing, management, billing and collection company. The Company facilitates diagnostic services for patients who have sustained spine injuries resulting from traumatic accidents. The Company delivers turnkey solutions to spine surgeons, orthopedic surgeons and other healthcare providers for necessary and appropriate treatment of musculo-skeletal spine injuries resulting from automobile and work-related accidents. The Company assists the centers that provide the spine diagnostic injections and treatment, and pays the doctors fee for the medical procedures they performed. After a patient is billed for the procedures performed by the affiliated doctor, the Company takes control of the patients' unpaid bill and oversees collection.The Company owns a device and process by which a video recording system is attached to a fluoroscopic x-ray machine, the four camera technology. Using this technology, diagnostic procedures are recorded from approximately four separate video feeds that capture views from both inside and outside the body, and an audio/video is produced, which is given to the patient's representative to verify the treatment received. The Company works with independent medical contractors who perform the medical services for patients and bill a fixed fee for the services. The Company funds certain spine injury diagnostic centers where it engages healthcare providers as independent contractors to perform medical services for patients. The Company pays the healthcare providers for medical services performed. The patients are billed based on Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes for the medical procedure performed. CPT codes are numbers assigned to every task and service a medical practitioner may provide to a patient including medical, surgical and diagnostic services. CPT codes are developed, maintained and copyrighted by the American Medical Association.

Spinal Cord Innovation Center


In the Spinal Cord Innovation Center, patients are surrounded by leading physicians with expertise in the functional recovery from SCI. The Center is staffed with skilled nurses, never more than a few feet away, equipped to handle all levels, types and severity of SCI. Patient rooms are private and fully accessible, offering a healing environment.




The Best Care After a Spinal Cord Injury

Body
Today, after nearly 40 years of Model System Spinal Cord Injury work, we’re the leading center (and referral destination of choice) for innovative, integrated, interdisciplinary care for people with SCI. Key to these efforts is our research involving new methods of enhancing medical and functional outcomes.







Body
The rehabilitation course for patients with SCI requires precise medical and nursing expertise, respiratory and pulmonary care and sophisticated diagnostic and therapeutic equipment. For several years, we have dedicated investments in talent, space and equipment that attract a high volume of patients with challenging conditions. The high volume, diversity of condition and greater complexity enables us to continuously expand our experience and sharpen our skill in helping patients recover from SCI.







Body
Primary goals for patients in this Innovation Center include the emergence of meaningful motor function, sensation, coordination and endurance, resolution of respiratory and vascular instability, and overall continued medical recovery from the injury or disease.
In the Spinal Cord Innovation Center, patients are surrounded by the most talented physicians, clinicians and scientists with expertise in the complex human physiology of and functional recovery from SCI. The Center is staffed with our leaders in this field, and equipped to handle all levels, types and severity of SCI, including patients with complete paralysis and who require mechanical ventilation






How We Heal

  In the Spinal Cord Innovation Center, we continue conducting clinical trials and human-subject research to facilitate neurologic repair and recovery. Research includes pharmacotherapeutic interventions, application of biologic materials, and the use of embryonic stem-cell therapies.

Spine Injury Solutions, Inc.,
Spine Injury Solutions, Inc. (OTC QB: SPIN) is a medical services and technology company that underwrites healthcare services related to liability spine injuries. The company has developed a fast-trax™ system, utilizing its patent pending video technology to expedite case management and claims settlement, while creating comprehensive transparency of forensic data to facilitate the insurance and legal process.
Company Information






  





What Is Spine Injury Solutions, Inc.,
Spine Injury Solutions, Inc. was incorporated under the laws of Delaware on March 4, 1998. We changed our name to Spine Injury Solutions Inc on September 1, 2015. We have two wholly-owned subsidiaries, Quad Video Halo, Inc. which holds certain assets associated with our Quad Video Halo (“QVH”) business, and Cleric Holdings, LLC which holds certain intangible assets.
SPIN is a technology, marketing, billing and collection company facilitating diagnostic services for patients who have sustained spine injuries. In addition, we are developing QVH programs to assist surgeons and other healthcare providers with treatment documentation in specialized areas, such as spine injuries and regenerative medicine. We deliver turnkey solutions to spine surgeons, orthopedic surgeons and other healthcare providers who treat spin injuries. Our goal is to become a leader in providing technology and monetizing services to spine and orthopedic surgeons and other healthcare providers. By monetizing the providers’ accounts receivables, patients are not unnecessarily delayed or prevented from obtaining needed treatment. After a patient is billed for the procedures preformed we oversee collections.
We currently are providing technology and or collection services to three spine injury diagnostic centers in the United States, which are located in Houston, Texas; Odessa, Texas; and Tyler, Texas. We are seeking additional funding for expansion by way of reasonable debt financing to accelerate future development. In connection with this strategy, we plan to offer our technology to additional diagnostic centers in new market areas that are attractive under our business model, assuming adequate funds are available.
We own a patented device and process by which a video recording system is attached to a fluoroscopic x-ray machine, the “four camera technology,” which we believe can attract additional physicians and patients, and provide us with additional revenue streams with our new programs designed to assist in treatment documentation. We have refined the technology, through research and development, resulting in a fully commercialized Quad Video Halo System 3.0. Using this technology, diagnostic and treatment procedures are recorded from four separate video feeds that capture views from both inside and outside the body, and a video is made which is given to the patient’s representative to verify the treatment received. Additionally, we anticipate independent medical representatives will sell Quad Video Halo units to additional hospitals and clinics.
