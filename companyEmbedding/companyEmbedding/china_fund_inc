CXSE - WisdomTree China ex-State-Owned Enterprises Fund
































































                        As China grows and transforms, investors are demanding more ways to gain access to this unique country.
                        Recently, some investors have expressed concern over state-owned enterprises,
                        and they have sought tools to limit their exposure—after all, government ownership may influence corporate decisions that are not necessarily in the best
                        interests of investors. Now, for the first time in an exchange-traded fund (ETF), the WisdomTree China ex-State-Owned Enterprises Fund (CXSE) provides
                        investors with a way to capitalize on the opportunities of China with less exposure to state-owned enterprises.

                                    Investors should carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Fund before investing.
                                    To obtain a prospectus containing this and other important information, please call 866.909.WISE (9473) or visit wisdomtree.com.

                                    There are risks associated with investing, including possible loss of principal.
                                    Foreign investing involves special risks, such as risk of loss from currency fluctuation or
                                    political or economic uncertainty. The Fund focuses its investments in China, thereby increasing
                                    the impact of events and developments associated with the region which can adversely affect performance.
                                    Investments in emerging or offshore markets are generally less liquid and less efficient than investments
                                    in developed markets and are subject to additional risks, such as risks of adverse governmental regulation
                                    and intervention or political developments. The Fund’s exposure to certain sectors may increases its vulnerability
                                    to any single economic or regulatory development related to such sectors. As this Fund can have a high concentration
                                    in some issuers, the Fund can be adversely impacted by changes affecting those issuers. Please read the Fund’s prospectus
                                    for specific details regarding the Fund’s risk profile.

* The Net Expense Ratio includes management fees, other operating expenses and Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses. If Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses were excluded, the Net Expense Ratio would be 0.95% for CHAU and 0.80% for CHAD.

If these expenses were included, the expense ratio would be higher.
The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate.

Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. For the most recent month-end performance please visit the funds website at direxioninvestments.com.
Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus or summary prospectus. Index performance does not include any fees or expenses, are unmanaged and cannot be invested in directly.

China A Shares ETFs | Direxion



























 






























China A-shares, which trade on the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges, account for roughly two-thirds of the market capitalization of Chinese stocks. Since most foreign investors cannot purchase China A-shares, investors in most existing China ETFs lack exposure to the majority of Chinese companies.  Direxion Daily CSI 300 China A Share Bull 2x Shares and Bear 1x Shares offer liquid, transparent ways to trade A-shares in either direction.

Strategy & Benefits

Key Benefits
Single inverse ETFs are trading tools that allow investors to either seek profit or seek to apply a hedge for an existing portfolio position that they anticipate will experience negative returns, in the short term.

The fund allows investors a tactical trading alternative to selling out of an existing position and creating a taxable event.
Since it does not employ leverage, compounding is less magnified compared to leveraged inverse ETFs.

Inverse ETFs are designed to move in the opposite direction of their benchmarks on a daily basis, and should not be expected to track their underlying indexes over periods longer than one day. They are not suitable for all investors and should be utilized only by investors who understand the consequences of seeking daily inverse investment results and intend to actively manage their investments.







Target Index

The CSI 300 Index (CSIN0301) is a modified free-float market capitalization weighted index comprised of the largest and most liquid stocks in the Chinese A-share market. Index constituent stocks must have been listed for more than three months (unless the stock’s average daily A-share market capitalization since its initial listing ranks among the top 30 of all A-shares) and must not be experiencing obvious abnormal fluctuations or market manipulations. One cannot invest directly in an Index.

Important InformationAberdeen Asset Management Inc. has prepared this report based on information sources believed to be accurate and reliable.  However, the figures are unaudited and neither the Fund, Aberdeen Asset Management Asia Limited (the Investment Manager), nor any other person guarantees their accuracy.  Investors should seek their own professional advice and should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses before acting on this information. 
Aberdeen Asset Management Asia Limited (the "Investment Manager") and Aberdeen Asset Management Inc. (the "Administrator") are each a subsidiary of Aberdeen Asset Management PLC ("Aberdeen PLC").  On March 6, 2017, the Boards of Standard Life plc and Aberdeen PLC announced that they had reached an agreement on the terms of a merger ("Merger"). The Boards of each of Standard Life plc and Aberdeen PLC believe that the Merger has a compelling strategic and financial rationale through combining complementary strengths to create a world-class investment group. The Merger is expected to occur in the third quarter of 2017, subject to various conditions and terms, including regulatory approvals. The portfolio management team for the Fund is not expected to change as a result of the Merger.  In addition, the agreements that the Fund has with Aberdeen PLC's subsidiary companies, the services provided by such companies, and the fees charged for those services are not expected to change as a result of the Merger.
Closed-end funds are traded on the secondary market through one of the stock exchanges. The Fund's investment return and principal value will fluctuate so that an investor's shares may be worth more or less than the original cost. Shares of closed-end funds may trade above (a premium) or below (a discount) the net asset value (NAV) of the fund's portfolio. There is no assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objective. 
Total return figures with distributions reinvested at the dividend reinvestment price are stated net-of-fees and represents past performance.  Past performance is not indicative of future results, current performance may be higher or lower.  Holdings are subject to change and are provided for informational purposes only and should not be deemed as a recommendation to buy or sell the securities shown.  Inception date July 23, 1992.

CXSE - WisdomTree China ex-State-Owned Enterprises Fund
































































                        As China grows and transforms, investors are demanding more ways to gain access to this unique country.
                        Recently, some investors have expressed concern over state-owned enterprises,
                        and they have sought tools to limit their exposure—after all, government ownership may influence corporate decisions that are not necessarily in the best
                        interests of investors. Now, for the first time in an exchange-traded fund (ETF), the WisdomTree China ex-State-Owned Enterprises Fund (CXSE) provides
                        investors with a way to capitalize on the opportunities of China with less exposure to state-owned enterprises.

                                    Investors should carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Fund before investing.
                                    To obtain a prospectus containing this and other important information, please call 866.909.WISE (9473) or visit wisdomtree.com.
                                    Investors should read the prospectus carefully before investing.
                                    


                                    There are risks associated with investing, including possible loss of principal.
                                    Foreign investing involves special risks, such as risk of loss from currency fluctuation or
                                    political or economic uncertainty. The Fund focuses its investments in China, thereby increasing
                                    the impact of events and developments associated with the region which can adversely affect performance.
                                    Investments in emerging or offshore markets are generally less liquid and less efficient than investments
                                    in developed markets and are subject to additional risks, such as risks of adverse governmental regulation
                                    and intervention or political developments. The Fund’s exposure to certain sectors may increases its vulnerability
                                    to any single economic or regulatory development related to such sectors. As this Fund can have a high concentration
                                    in some issuers, the Fund can be adversely impacted by changes affecting those issuers. Please read the Fund’s prospectus
                                    for specific details regarding the Fund’s risk profile.

Strategy & Benefits

Key Benefits
Single inverse ETFs are trading tools that allow investors to either seek profit or seek to apply a hedge for an existing portfolio position that they anticipate will experience negative returns, in the short term.

The fund allows investors a tactical trading alternative to selling out of an existing position and creating a taxable event.
Since it does not employ leverage, compounding is less magnified compared to leveraged inverse ETFs.

Inverse ETFs are designed to move in the opposite direction of their benchmarks on a daily basis, and should not be expected to track their underlying indexes over periods longer than one day. They are not suitable for all investors and should be utilized only by investors who understand the consequences of seeking daily inverse investment results and intend to actively manage their investments.







Target Index

The CSI 300 Index (CSIN0301) is a modified free-float market capitalization weighted index comprised of the largest and most liquid stocks in the Chinese A-share market. Index constituent stocks must have been listed for more than three months (unless the stock’s average daily A-share market capitalization since its initial listing ranks among the top 30 of all A-shares) and must not be experiencing obvious abnormal fluctuations or market manipulations. One cannot invest directly in an Index.
