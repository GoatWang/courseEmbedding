I take special pleasure in making each shepherd sling because I know how much more the story of David and Goliath comes alive with an actual shepherd sling in hand.  I know how much I enjoy using mine, and I trust that you will enjoy using yours too (just don’t use it on any giants you may know...or anyone else for that matter!).
God Bless!!

The leather and woven pouch shepherd slings are what a lot people would call “authentic” shepherd slings. While they do look cooler to many, the split pouch shepherd slings work just as well and are just as authentic. In fact, experienced slingers are divided 50-50 as to whether they prefer the pouch versus the split pouch. I do not personally have a preference. The leather and woven pouch slings seem to be a little better for beginners because the stone stays in the pouch little better, but the split pouch works just as well once you get used to it.
David also makes shepherd slings from paracord.  These modern day shepherd slings have become very popular.  David the Shepherd in the Bible wouldn't have used a sling out of paracord of course because back in the Bible, they couldn't jump out of airplanes because they didn't exist!!

                This review was written for Shepherd's Notes: James.
            
 
            This series (Shepard Notes) could easily be called Bible 101 - easy to read, easily understood with all the references & explanations.

                This review was written for Shepherd's Notes: James.
            
 
            A great study guide! The study guide takes you through the book of James verse by verse. I have used it for my own personal Bible study and have found it so useful I am contemplating the purchase of another one from this series.

Product Description▼▲
Shepherd's Notes give easy access to the Bible - one book at a time. They are not meant to be a substitute for the biblical text; rather, they are study guides intended to help you explore the wisdom of Scriptures in personal or group study. Shepherd's Notes guide you through both the main themes of each book of the Bible and illuminate details through commentary and reference notes. Historical and cultural background information brings the Bible into sharper focus. Six different icons, used throughout the series, call your attention to historical-cultural information, Old and New Testament references, word pictures, unit summaries, and personal application for everyday life.

            I did not really know what to expect when I ordered this book. I was expecting more of a Bible study, this seemed more like a commentary. However, I will find it useful as I teach the book of Isaiah.

David Shepard – Presenting Magically
Price : $659
Just pay : $82
Sale Page : http://www.performancepartnership.com/Products/Presenting-Magically/
Why Presenting Magically?
No matter what you do in life the ability to present yourself powerfully and clearly will always be a benefit. Everyone, at some point in time, has seen a masterful presenter and thought, “I wish I could do that”. Well now you can! Presenting Magically will enable you to develop the charisma, poise, and grace of the very best presenters and trainers.
What will you learn from Presenting Magically?



How to banish stage fright and performance anxiety.
How to maintain an ideal “presenter state” – calm, balanced and centred.
How to quickly and easily build rapport with audiences of any size.
Feedback systems that really work.
Structuring your presentation so that it works best with everyone’s learning style.
How to use specific gestures and postures to increase your impact and flexibility.
How to change your audience’s state of mind moment by moment.
How to handle difficult audiences and hecklers.
How to entertain an audience and add fun to your presentations.
Using metaphors, anecdotes, and analogies to really put your message across.
How to maintain and manage the energy in the room.
Increasing your charisma and personal magnetism.


Presenting Magically is different from any other presentation skills programme. You will learn Neuro Linguistic Programming and how to use it in presentations and training. This will give you a structured model to achieve excellence as a presenter. The programme is a mixture of information and practical application. Throughout, you will get the closely held secrets of Master Presenters and Trainers.
Who is Presenting Magically designed for?


All Presenters and Trainers, regardless of their level of experience, will transform their abilities.
Anyone who wants to present and train and has not yet got started.
Everyone who wants to gain an insight into the application of NLP in presentations and training.


What if I do Presenting Magically?
Just suppose, for a moment, that you are doing the biggest and most important presentation of your life, you look out at the audience and sense that they are totally with you. You feel calm, balanced, centered, and completely in control. You have fun presenting your material and after receiving your well-deserved applause several people approach you and tell you it was the best presentation they have ever seen. Just a dream? No – that’s Presenting Magically!
