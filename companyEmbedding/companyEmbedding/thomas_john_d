St. Thomas-St. John Elections Board Chairman Arturo Watlingon Jr., left, looks on, as board members Alecia Wells and Carla Joseph sign documents certifying the April 8 election at the close of Monday’s meeting.


Daily News photo by BRIAN O’CONNOR




















































ST. THOMAS — After hours of testimony and months of legal wrangling, it took members of the St. Thomas-St. John District Board of Elections slightly longer than 10 minutes to certify the results of the April 8 election.Board members Lydia Hendricks and Alecia Wells voted in favor of a motion certifying the results. Board member Carla Joseph cast the lone dissent. Chairman Arturo Watlington Jr. and board member Ivy Moses abstained.Only Joseph elected to offer remarks at the meeting about her vote during the meeting. Her vote was about upholding voters’ rights, Joseph said.





“In my estimation, we have endeavored to be compliant with the laws as written,” she said. “Even though there are members who may have had information and withheld, I want to say that definitely we want to make sure that we go forward to ensure that our voters’ rights are not disenfranchised.”Voting to certify the election results from April 8 would have disenfranchised those who voted in the Nov. 8 elections, as well as those who voted in the Aug. 6 primary elections, according to Joseph.She said numerous voters had approached her with hard questions after the 32nd Legislature voted on June 28 to effectively overturn the results of the Nov. 8 General Election. Joseph said her vote was ultimately an act of conscience.By contrast, Hendricks and Wells were relatively short on words about their votes, which ultimately carried the day.“I just did what I had to do,” Wells said.Moses’ abstention meant Hendricks was the only member of the board to vote against a motion not to certify the April 8 election and in favor of Monday’s motion to certify the April 8 special election.Hendricks was reluctant to comment, but when Watlington suggested she may have just wanted to bring the lingering 2016 election matter to a close, Hendricks agreed.“Yes,” she said. “I’m tired.”Moses declined the opportunity for comment.





Watlington said his abstention could be counted as a disagreement, and disputed that a court could order an elected board — as opposed to an administrative entity, which are more frequently the subject of writs of mandamus — to vote one way or another.“The judge can’t tell anybody how to vote,” he said. “I don’t know if the judge can really order anybody what to do.”For example, neither Maurice Donovan Jr. nor Diane Magras-Urena was present, and Watlington questioned whether they could be held in contempt as a result of not showing up.The vote is another landmark on the road to filling the vacant St. Thomas Senate seat, left vacant since Jan. 9, when the V.I. Supreme Court reinstated a temporary injunction barring Kevin Rodriquez, who finished sixth in the Nov. 8 election.The next hurdle to filling the seat will be Wednesday, when District Court Judge Curtis Gomez hears arguments in a lawsuit claiming senators violated Rodriquez’s constitutional right to due process in a St. Thomas federal courtroom.As with other steps in the process, Sarauw was muted in her praise. She said if she was in Rodriquez’s shoes, she would have accepted the Legislature’s decision as final, as Rodriquez testified that he would on June 27.“At this point, we are exhausting our electorate, we’re exhausting government funds, and we’re making attorneys very rich,” Sarauw said.

St. Thomas-St. John Elections Board Chairman Arturo Watlingon Jr., left, looks on, as board members Alecia Wells and Carla Joseph sign documents certifying the April 8 election at the close of Monday’s meeting.


Daily News photo by BRIAN O’CONNOR




















































ST. THOMAS — After hours of testimony and months of legal wrangling, it took members of the St. Thomas-St. John District Board of Elections slightly longer than 10 minutes to certify the results of the April 8 election.Board members Lydia Hendricks and Alecia Wells voted in favor of a motion certifying the results. Board member Carla Joseph cast the lone dissent. Chairman Arturo Watlington Jr. and board member Ivy Moses abstained.Only Joseph elected to offer remarks at the meeting about her vote during the meeting. Her vote was about upholding voters’ rights, Joseph said.





“In my estimation, we have endeavored to be compliant with the laws as written,” she said. “Even though there are members who may have had information and withheld, I want to say that definitely we want to make sure that we go forward to ensure that our voters’ rights are not disenfranchised.”Voting to certify the election results from April 8 would have disenfranchised those who voted in the Nov. 8 elections, as well as those who voted in the Aug. 6 primary elections, according to Joseph.She said numerous voters had approached her with hard questions after the 32nd Legislature voted on June 28 to effectively overturn the results of the Nov. 8 General Election. Joseph said her vote was ultimately an act of conscience.By contrast, Hendricks and Wells were relatively short on words about their votes, which ultimately carried the day.“I just did what I had to do,” Wells said.Moses’ abstention meant Hendricks was the only member of the board to vote against a motion not to certify the April 8 election and in favor of Monday’s motion to certify the April 8 special election.Hendricks was reluctant to comment, but when Watlington suggested she may have just wanted to bring the lingering 2016 election matter to a close, Hendricks agreed.“Yes,” she said. “I’m tired.”Moses declined the opportunity for comment.





Watlington said his abstention could be counted as a disagreement, and disputed that a court could order an elected board — as opposed to an administrative entity, which are more frequently the subject of writs of mandamus — to vote one way or another.“The judge can’t tell anybody how to vote,” he said. “I don’t know if the judge can really order anybody what to do.”For example, neither Maurice Donovan Jr. nor Diane Magras-Urena was present, and Watlington questioned whether they could be held in contempt as a result of not showing up.The vote is another landmark on the road to filling the vacant St. Thomas Senate seat, left vacant since Jan. 9, when the V.I. Supreme Court reinstated a temporary injunction barring Kevin Rodriquez, who finished sixth in the Nov. 8 election.The next hurdle to filling the seat will be Wednesday, when District Court Judge Curtis Gomez hears arguments in a lawsuit claiming senators violated Rodriquez’s constitutional right to due process in a St. Thomas federal courtroom.As with other steps in the process, Sarauw was muted in her praise. She said if she was in Rodriquez’s shoes, she would have accepted the Legislature’s decision as final, as Rodriquez testified that he would on June 27.“At this point, we are exhausting our electorate, we’re exhausting government funds, and we’re making attorneys very rich,” Sarauw said.

Help address your complexion concerns with Peter Thomas Roth skin care products at QVC. Having struggled with his own skin challenges, Peter Thomas Roth knew how difficult it was to find effective treatments and developed an uncanny knack for sensing what kind of products consumers wanted. He used his experience as inspiration for his skin care brand, which he launched in 1993. Since then, Peter Thomas Roth has cemented a worldwide reputation as an innovator. All of his products, from moisturizers to acne treatments, reflect this philosophy: breakthrough formulas yield astonishing results. Because they fulfill that promise, Peter Thomas Roth has developed a cult following of beauty insiders, celebrities, and everyday consumers.

Peter Thomas Roth travels the globe in search of the best ingredients to deliver state-of-the-art quality. He uses them to create multiple lines of skin care products that serve different purposes. His Un-Wrinkle line helps address the appearance of wrinkles and expression lines. His Acne and Oil-Free collections are ideal for oily and acne-prone skin. His Neuroliquid formulas help improve the look of wrinkles for a younger-looking complexion. His FIRMx assortment helps skin look firmer, more youthful, and radiant. He also offers products for preventative care, like products with protection.

How do I choose a lawyer?Consider the following: 
Comfort Level - Are you comfortable telling the lawyer personal
information? Does the lawyer seem interested in solving your problem? 
Credentials - How long has the lawyer been in practice? Has
the lawyer worked on other cases similar to yours? 
Cost - How are the lawyer's fees structured - hourly or flat
fee? Can the lawyer estimate the cost of your case? 
City - Is the lawyer's office conveniently located?
Not sure what questions to ask a lawyer?Here are a few to get you started:

How long have you been in practice?
How many cases like mine have you handled?
How often do you settle cases out of court?
What are your fees and costs?
What are the next steps?
