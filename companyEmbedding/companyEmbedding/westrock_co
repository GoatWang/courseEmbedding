Paper
 Paper materials offer the widest range of performance features available in any wet friction material, and are ideal for applications where smooth, chatter-free performance is essential.

Elastomeric
 Developed in the mid-1970's, elastomeric wet friction materials provide high power absorption capability for high speed/high energy power shift applications. Their unique composition offers superior resiliency and excellent strength.


 
  
 
 



Graphitic
 Where operating temperatures are high due to high energy absorption or low cooling oil flow rates, graphitic materials are usually specified. Because graphitics are able to "store" engagement heat until the engagement is complete, they exhibit outstanding thermal stability and moderate to high friction levels.

Sintered Metal
Sintered metal materials are compacted mixtures of metallic powders and friction modifiers, which can withstand elevated operating temperatures without thermal decomposition.
