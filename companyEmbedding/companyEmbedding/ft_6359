Acquisition of iconic brand expands leadership position in the global
      fashion luxury segment and strengthens future growth opportunities


LONDON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jul. 25, 2017--
      Michael Kors Holdings Limited (NYSE:KORS), a global fashion luxury
      brand, today announced that it has reached an agreement to acquire Jimmy
      Choo PLC (LON:CHOO), a premier global luxury footwear and accessories
      brand. Under the terms of the transaction, Jimmy Choo shareholders will
      receive 230 pence per share, with an enterprise value of approximately
      USD $1.350 billion. The transaction has been approved by the Boards of
      Directors of both Michael Kors and Jimmy Choo.
    

John D. Idol, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Michael Kors,
      said, “We are pleased to announce the acquisition of Jimmy Choo, an
      iconic brand with a rich history as a leading global luxury house. Jimmy
      Choo is known worldwide for its glamorous and fashion-forward footwear.
      The company is a leader in setting fashion trends. Its innovative
      designs and exceptional craftsmanship resonate with trendsetters
      globally. We believe that Jimmy Choo is poised for meaningful growth in
      the future and our company is committed to supporting the strong brand
      equity that Jimmy Choo has built over the last 20 years.”
    

      Mr. Idol continued, “Pierre Denis will continue in his role as Chief
      Executive Officer of Jimmy Choo. He has led the company since 2012,
      during which time Jimmy Choo experienced compounded sales growth of 11%
      annually. Pierre brings more than 25 years of experience and a strong
      track record with global fashion luxury brands. Additionally, Creative
      Director Sandra Choi will continue to lead the creative and design teams
      at the company. Sandra has been with Jimmy Choo since its inception and
      has been the sole Creative Director since 2013. Her groundbreaking
      vision and fashion artistry have created a truly iconic and
      internationally recognized luxury brand. Mr. Denis, Ms. Choi and the
      rest of the highly-talented management team have done a tremendous job,
      and this continuity of leadership will ensure that the DNA of Jimmy Choo
      is maintained as we work together to continue to grow the brand
      globally.”
    

Michael Kors, Honorary Chairman and Chief Creative Officer of Michael
      Kors, said, “Jimmy Choo is a premier fashion luxury house that offers
      distinctive footwear, handbags and other accessories. We admire the
      glamorous style and trendsetting nature of Jimmy Choo designs. We look
      forward to welcoming Jimmy Choo to our luxury group.”
    

Pierre Denis, Chief Executive Officer of Jimmy Choo, said, “It is a
      privilege for our management team to lead Jimmy Choo and to preside over
      such an exciting period for our company. We are convinced that there is
      so much more that can be delivered in the years ahead. We look forward
      to working closely with the leadership and team at Michael Kors Holdings
      Limited to further develop our iconic brand. Our two companies share the
      same vision of style and trend leadership. Our luxury heritage is the
      foundation of Jimmy Choo and we will continue to bring our brand vision
      to consumers globally.”
    

Iconic and Powerful Luxury Brand


Jimmy Choo is a luxury accessories brand that offers an empowered sense
      of glamour and a playfully daring spirit. Since its inception in 1996,
      the company has offered distinctive, glamorous and fashion-forward
      products, with luxury footwear at the heart of its unique brand DNA. The
      brand began as a bespoke atelier that catered to the global luxury
      consumer, and continues to be popular with style icons around the globe,
      including celebrities, royalty, musicians and heads of state. Jimmy Choo
      offers exceptionally crafted products of the highest quality, with a
      design team that is at the forefront of interpreting fashion trends in
      footwear and accessories. The collections reflect a mix of iconic,
      timeless products that appeals to a broader audience, as well as
      innovative offerings that are targeted to fashion trendsetters globally.
    

      With approximately 150 company-operated retail stores, 560 multi-brand
      doors and more than 60 franchise stores in premier locations worldwide,
      Jimmy Choo has a successful, balanced distribution network. The company
      has a strong presence in Europe, the Middle East, the Americas and Asia.
      In addition, Jimmy Choo continues to invest significantly in its online
      platform, which has experienced strong revenue growth in recent years.
    

      The company also continues to build its presence in accessories and
      men’s footwear. The brand has a natural authority in men’s evening
      shoes, adding a twist to classic shapes, and has also seen strong growth
      in luxury active footwear. By integrating a dual gender product
      portfolio into its retail stores, Jimmy Choo expects to unlock
      additional value from this fast growing segment of the business.
    

Strategic Rationale


      The acquisition of Jimmy Choo is expected to deliver a number of
      benefits, including:
    


        The opportunity to grow Jimmy Choo sales to $1 billion

        A more balanced portfolio with greater product diversification
      

        An enhanced positioning in the attractive and growing luxury footwear
        segment
      

        The opportunity to grow in the men’s luxury footwear category
      

        Further expansion in the luxury accessories market
      

        Greater exposure to global markets, particularly the fast-growing
        market in Asia

        The potential to create long-term operational synergies
      


Transaction Details


      The transaction is not subject to a financing condition. Michael Kors
      has committed bridge financing from JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and
      Goldman Sachs Bank USA to satisfy the certain funds requirement of the
      U.K. Takeover Code to complete the transaction. The transaction is
      intended to be effected by a U.K. court-approved Scheme of Arrangement
      (the “Scheme”) and is expected to close in the fourth quarter of
      calendar 2017, subject to customary closing conditions, including the
      receipt of required regulatory approvals as well as the approval of the
      Scheme by Jimmy Choo shareholders, who together hold at least 75% of the
      issued share capital of Jimmy Choo and represent a majority of the
      shareholders voting at the meeting. Michael Kors has received
      irrevocable undertakings from JAB Luxury GmbH, Jimmy Choo directors and
      Sandra Choi, who collectively represent 69.21% of the issued and
      outstanding Jimmy Choo shares in support of the transaction.
    

Financial Considerations


Michael Kors Holdings Limited believes that the acquisition enhances the
      company’s economic value and will drive improved long-term shareholder
      value. The acquisition is expected to be accretive on a GAAP basis in
      fiscal 2020.
    

Conference Call and Additional Information


Michael Kors will host a conference call to discuss the transaction at
      8:00 a.m. ET today, July 25, 2017. A live webcast of the conference call
      will be available in the investor relations portion of the Company’s
      website, www.investors.michaelkors.com.

Forward-Looking Statements


      This press release contains statements which are, or may be deemed to
      be, “forward-looking statements”. Forward-looking statements are
      prospective in nature and are not based on historical facts, but rather
      on current expectations and projections of the management of Michael
      Kors and Jimmy Choo about future events, and are therefore subject to
      risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ
      materially from the future results expressed or implied by the
      forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements contained in
      this press release include statements relating to the expected effects
      of the acquisition on Michael Kors and Jimmy Choo, the expected timing
      and scope of the acquisition and other statements other than historical
      facts. All statements other than statements of historical facts included
      in this press release may be forward-looking statements. Without
      limitation, any statements preceded or followed by or that include the
      words “targets”, “plans”, “believes”, “expects”, “aims”, “intends”,
      “will”, “should”, “could”, “would”, “may”, “anticipates”, “estimates”,
      “synergy”, “cost-saving”, “projects”, “goal”, “strategy”, “budget”,
      “forecast” or “might” or, words or terms of similar substance or the
      negative thereof, are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking
      statements include statements relating to the following: (i) future
      capital expenditures, expenses, revenues, earnings, economic
      performance, indebtedness, financial condition, dividend policy, losses
      and future prospects; (ii) business and management strategies and the
      expansion and growth of Jimmy Choo’s and Michael Kors’ operations and
      benefits from the acquisition; and (iii) the effects of government
      regulation on Michael Kors’ or Jimmy Choo’s business. These
      forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future financial
      performance. Such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown
      risks and uncertainties that could significantly affect expected results
      and are based on certain key assumptions. Many risks, uncertainties and
      other factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those
      projected or implied in any forward-looking statements. These risks,
      uncertainties and other factors include the satisfaction of the
      conditions to consummating the acquisition, Michael Kors’ ability to
      integrate the businesses successfully and to achieve anticipated
      benefits of the acquisition; the risk of disruptions to Michael Kors’ or
      Jimmy Choo’s businesses; the negative effects of the announcement of the
      proposed acquisition or the consummation of the proposed acquisition on
      the market price of the Michael Kors’ ordinary shares and its operating
      results; significant transaction costs; unknown liabilities; the risk of
      litigation and/or regulatory actions related to the proposed
      acquisition; fluctuations in demand for Jimmy Choo’s and Michael Kors’
      products; changes in consumer traffic and retail trends; loss of market
      share and industry competition; fluctuations in the capital markets;
      fluctuations in interest and exchange rates; the occurrence of
      unforeseen disasters or catastrophes; political or economic instability
      in principal markets; adverse outcomes in litigation; and general, local
      and global economic, political, business and market conditions, as well
      as those risks set forth in the reports that Michael Kors files from
      time to time with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Other
      unknown or unpredictable factors could cause actual results to differ
      materially from those in the forward-looking statements. Such
      forward-looking statements should therefore be construed in the light of
      such factors. Unless otherwise required by applicable law, neither
      Michael Kors nor Jimmy Choo, nor any of their respective associates or
      directors, officers or advisers, provides any representation, assurance
      or guarantee that the occurrence of the events expressed or implied in
      any forward-looking statements in this press release will actually
      occur. Due to such uncertainties and risks, readers are cautioned not to
      place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. All subsequent
      oral or written forward-looking statements attributable to Michael Kors
      or Jimmy Choo or any of their respective members, directors, officers or
      employees or any persons acting on their behalf are expressly qualified
      in their entirety by the cautionary statement above. Michael Kors and
      Jimmy Choo disclaim any obligation to update or revise any
      forward-looking or other statementscontained herein other than
      in accordance with their legal and regulatory obligations.
    

Important information


      This press release is for information purposes only and is not intended
      to, and does not, constitute or form part of an offer to purchase or the
      solicitation of an offer to sell any securities or the solicitation of
      any vote or approval in any jurisdiction pursuant to the Scheme or
      otherwise. The proposed acquisition will be implemented solely pursuant
      to the terms of a Scheme Document, which will contain the full terms and
      conditions of the proposed acquisition. Any decision in respect of, or
      other response to, the proposed acquisition should be made only on the

      under English company law. The proposed acquisition will not be subject
      to the tender offer rules or the proxy solicitation rules under the U.S.
      Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “US Exchange Act”).
      Accordingly, the proposed acquisition will be subject to the disclosure
      requirements and practices applicable in the United Kingdom to schemes
      of arrangement, which differ from the disclosure requirements of U.S.
