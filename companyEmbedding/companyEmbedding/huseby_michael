Wall Street's 'fear gauge'--the VIX--just logged its second-lowest close in history
              
              One measure of fear on Wall Street on Friday booked its second-lowest finish ever, according to FactSet data. The CBOE Volatility Index, or VIX, wrapped up the session down 2.3% at 9.36, marking the lowest close since the so-called "fear gauge" ended at 9.31 in December 1993 at 9.31. The gauge flirted with the lowest reading in history at 9.30, before bucking up a touch. The VIX is based on options contracts on the S&P 500 30-days in the future. The metric's historical average is 20 and it has continued to mostly slump in 2017, with the majority of its readings below 10 being put in this year, as stocks have reached repeated records since President Donald Trump's Election Day victory in November. That dynamic, lower readings for VIX and elevated stock prices, have suggested to market participants that investors are becoming increasingly complacent. Friday's VIX slide came as many major equity benchmarks closed lower, but not far from records, including the Dow Jones Industrial Average , the S&P 500 index , and the Nasdaq Composite Index , which all finished less than 1% shy of all-time closing highs.

Newspaper publisher McClatchy Co. reports Q2 loss, but growth in digital business
              
              Newspaper publisher McClatchy Co.  reported second-quarter earnings before the market opened on Friday and said digital-only subscribers grew nearly 14% from the previous year's first quarter. The company reported a net loss of $37.4 million, or $4.91 per share for the second quarter, compared with a loss of $14.7 million, or $1.89 per share during the same quarter a year ago. The adjusted loss per share was 79 cents. McClatchy's revenue hit $225.1 million in the quarter, down 7% compared with the prior year. Total advertising revenue revenues were down 11% compared with the same quarter last year, while digital-only advertising revenue grew by 10%. The company said that the rate of decline in total advertising slowed in the quarter. "As I have mentioned before, achieving a normalized operating environment takes some time in digital transitions," McClatchy Chief Executive Craig Forman said in a statement. "While we continue to see strong headwinds in print advertising, we also are seeing our digital efforts in all aspects of the business moderate those headwinds." McClatchy's average total unique visitors to the company's online products grew close to 15% to 66 million in the quarter. Shares of McClatchy were inactive in morning trade on Friday, but have declined more than 34% in the year to date, while the S&P 500 index  have gained more than 10%.

Polaris beats profit and sales expectation as ORV and snowmobile growth helps boost results
              
              Polaris Industries Inc.  reported Thursday a second-quarter net profit that fell to $62.0 million, or 97 cents a share, from $71.2 million, or $1.09 a share, in the same period a year ago. The off-road vehicle maker said adjusted earnings per share came to $1.16, above the FactSet consensus of $1.08. Revenue rose to $1.36 billion from $1.13 billion, beating the FactSet consensus of $1.26 billion. Off-road and snowmobile sales rose to $845.5 million from $799.3 million, above the FactSet consensus of $761.7 million, while motorcycle sales fell 13% to $198 million but beat expectations of $192 million. The company raised its 2017 sales growth outlook to 12% to 14% from 10% to 13% and its adjusted EPS outlook to $4.35 to $4.50 from $4.25 to $4.50. "The powersports industry remained very competitive and headwinds persist, but we were encouraged by the return to growth in our Side-by-Side business and continued strength and aggressive share gains for Indian Motorcycles," said Chief Executive Scott Wine. On Wednesday, the company said it recalled 25,600 ATVs after reports of fuel leaks and fires. The stock, which wasn't active in premarket trade, has rallied 12.2% year to date, while the S&P 500  has gained 10.5%.

Tesla stock initiated as neutral/high risk at Citi with price target 10% above current price
              
              Citigroup initiated coverage of electric car maker Tesla Inc.  Thursday, with a neutral/high risk rating and $357 stock price target. That's equal to about 10% upside from its current level. "We're positive on Tesla's position as a Car of the Future leader and view the upside case to still be significant, however, we prefer to wait for a better entry point either through: (a) A stronger balance sheet, which in our view would more favorably tilt the 12-month risk/reward equation, all-else-equal; or (b) convincing signs of a smooth Model 3 ramp with limited Model S cannibalization," analyst Itay Michaeli wrote in a note. The analyst said he is "fundamentally bullish" on Tesla, but that both bull and bear cases for the stock have merit. On the bull side, the company has had initial product success, brand appeal, speed of innovation and tech/software leadership," he wrote. The next 12 months rely on Tesla achieving Model 3 conversions and meeting margin goals, while continuing to cement its leadership in self-driving. Tesla shares were slightly lower premarket, but have gained 52% in 2017, while the S&P 500  has gained 10.5%.

Quality Control and Quality Assurance






Huseby’s Production Department is dedicated to achieving the highest quality standards in the industry. Quality control activities are an important part of our business with significant resources dedicated to producing a world-class product.




Our Quality Management (QM) program is part of who we are. We have a culture that believes in quality and we empower our people to be their best every day. Huseby has a client-focused culture of continuous improvement.



Why do we care so much? Regardless of where your deposition takes place our product is consistent and to specification. It is just that simple.












Your unyielding commitment to servicing the courts has earned your company high marks for the professionalism of your staff. I always receive prompt and courteous customer service. I recommend your company to all my professional friends.
Clerk U.S. District Court




After using the service of your company for a large, multi-jurisdictional case, I must tell you how extremely pleased I am at the level of talent and technical expertise exhibited by your reporters and staff. I was able to monitor and participate in several out-of-state depositions through the internet while sitting at my desk. The setup worked seamlessly and was as effective as it would have been if I were at the deposition personally. Your transcription-to-video synchronization capabilities are outstanding, and your patience and professionalism are extraordinary. I have used your services for years and have always been more than satisfied. Thanks for your excellent technical support and customer service.
Partner, Intellectual Property Alston & Bird LLP




We wanted to provide our clients with an effective way to reduce their litigation costs, and being able to save the time and expense associated with traveling to and from out of town depositions. Huseby enables our attorneys to attend depositions remotely using HusebyConnect, which is an excellent way to accomplish this goal. Our attorneys were initially reluctant to use the service, fearing that they would not be as effective in taking or defending a deposition if they were not physically present. Huseby provided excellent training for our attorneys and they had one of their staff members present when needed to make sure everything went smoothly. The technology works extremely well, and Huseby’s customer service has been top notch. Huseby has been a great partner in helping our firm implement and use this new technology.
Managing Partner Hedrick Gardner Kincheloe & Garofalo LLP




Finding Huseby was such a relief. After contacting them and explaining our needs to use modern equipment at trial in an older courtroom, I was extremely pleased with their experience and delivery. Their knowledge of current digital technology and experience within the legal field enabled them to anticipate needs I didn’t realize would arise during trial. Using Huseby’s trial services allowed me the time and peace of mind I needed to concentrate on trial preparation. I really can’t express how happy I was to work with Huseby and how much of a weight was lifted off my shoulders.
Litigation Paralegal DurretteCrump, PLC




I have been a litigation paralegal for 21 years and during that time I have not experienced a more valuable support service than Huseby, Inc. Their state-of-the art technology, coupled with their professional and knowledgeable staff, is second to none. They understand the pressures and time demands we are always under in litigation, and have the innate ability to creatively tackle any project presented to them, whether it be months in advance or short notice. To say Huseby, Inc. is a crucial member of our litigation team would be an understatement.
Litigation Paralegal Harkey Lambeth & Gunter, LLP




We retained Huseby for consulting and technical support for trial. The staff at Huseby was accessible to answer any questions we had, and worked on short notice to provide any assistance we needed. In very little time, Huseby guided us through the basics of their trial presentation software, and put together an effective presentation. During trial, with the help of a Huseby consultant, we were able to present exhibits in an engaging manner that we would have been unable to do otherwise.
Litigation Attorney Morris & Morris, P.C.




Working with Huseby has been an outstanding experience. The staff is incredible and they go above and beyond in every situation to suit our needs. It is rare that you get to work with so many people on a single staff that are all extremely knowledgeable, timely, accommodating, and perfectly friendly. Huseby allows our firm to save time and money by doing everything from our desktop. From scheduling depositions online, to setting up our online video depositions, and then receiving the transcripts and exhibits directly into our personal online account, it could not be simpler. Huseby makes certain every experience is a smooth and satisfying one. Thank you all for taking such great care of us!

						Huseby Named CEO of Barnes & Noble
					
					
				



					Jan 08, 2014
				


    Barnes & Noble, Inc., which has been without a CEO since William Lynch resigned last July, has promoted Michael Huseby to the post. Huseby joined B&N in March 2012 as CFO and was named president of B&N and CEO of Nook Media following Lynch’s resignation. With his promotion, Huseby will oversee all of B&N’s operations. Mitch Klipper, CEO of the Retail Group, and Max Roberts, CEO of Barnes & Noble College, will report to Huseby, as will the Nook Media unit. In commenting on Huseby’s promotion, B&N chairman Len Riggio called him the right person to lead B&N forward. “Although a relative newcomer to the retail book business, he has quickly developed a comprehensive understanding of the unique opportunities and challenges the company faces, and he has a vision for the future in which I am in complete accord. Mike also has a passion for bookselling, which makes him a perfect fit for this job,”. Riggio says in a statement.    Huseby will report directly to the board of directors and has also been named to the board.    “The company is well positioned to maintain and grow its leadership position in the worlds of bookselling and the sale of digital media,” Huseby says.”My role, as I see it, is to enhance and unlock the value of these businesses for our shareholders. We are well-positioned in today’s dynamic reading and learning markets and confident in our ability to provide our customers with the best content offerings, digital media and educational products available in today’s marketplace.”    Immediately prior to joining B&N, Huseby was executive v-p  and CFO of Cablevision Systems Corp..
