 A Great Cookbook and A Tasty Cake!!!!!!
 I purchased this cookbook about one month ago, and was able to try one of her delicious recipes. I made the Ozark Pudding Cake, and my guests had it eaten in about 5 minutes!!!! I substituted apples/walnuts for the pears/almonds, and followed the easy recipe. I'm planning on making the "pink cake" recipe next. I've been baking for many years, and this cookbook brought back some memories of cakes from my childhood. You won't be sorry if you buy this lovely book. Thank you Julie, your book is a true labor of love!!!!

 Gorgeous and practical baking book.
 I am more of a savory than a sweet cook, but I was completely taken by this beautiful and useful book of vintage cakes. The author has a great tone and the recipes are well written and seem easy to follow. I think this will make an excellent gift for my baking friends...as well as have a new permanent home on my cook book shelf.

 I love this book!
 I've always struggled with cakes. Always. Last night I made the Kentucky Bourbon Cake from this wonderful cookbook and IT WORKED. Next up is the Texas Sheet Cake, because I love chocolate and need something that's simple and fast to cut up and store in the freezer for lunch. Right on, QVC. I love this book.

 No-Fail Best of DELICIOUS Vintage Baking
 I ordered 3 of these books (2 as gifts 'cus, like Richardson's recipes, they are no-fail) because I have used her Rustic Fruit Desserts book over the past couple of years and her easy to follow recipes and delicious results always make me look and feel like a baking rockstar! I love that this book includes go-to's like the Classic Cake which I expect to use often as well as new ideas like the unique Lemon "cup" cake. I predict we'll be seeing a lot of that one on Pinterest baking boards...but David's hilarious Happy Dance said it all! Plus, she was so nice on his show and knowing that normal home bakers tested her recipes makes me feel confident to take on a few thing normally outside of my repetoire. My husband's 50th is coming up and I think the Kentucky Bourbon cake will have to make an appearance!

 NO WHAT I HAD HOPE
 Just got this book on yesterday and will be returning not at all what I had hope for. Maybe this is too vintage for me sorry.
