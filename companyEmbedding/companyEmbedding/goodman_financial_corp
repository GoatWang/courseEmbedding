About Us
Founded in 1988, Goodman Financial Corporation is an
independent SEC registered investment advisor based in Houston, Texas.


Goodman Financial is not affiliated with any bank, insurance company, mutual fund family, or brokerage firm.
Our mission is to meet the sophisticated financial needs of clients through prudent and personalized money management and financial advisory services. We present advice and solutions tailored to the unique needs of each client. Those clients consist of individuals and institutions including trusts, foundations, endowments, non-profits, pension plans and corporations. 
Our investment management philosophy consists of actively managing assets in separate management portfolios. This approach allows for greater flexibility, more tax efficiency, and lower expenses. Additionally, investment assets are held through insured, third-party custodians.
Our professional staff consists of highly ethical and credentialed individuals with extensive experience and expertise. These high standards successfully serve our clients by providing the capability and depth necessary to ensure that the client's best interest is our top priority. We serve our clients not only by making prudent investment decisions but also by maintaining focus on the long-term objective by deciphering the noise sometimes created by the media.
