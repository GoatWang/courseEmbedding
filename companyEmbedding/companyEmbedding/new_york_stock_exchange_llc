ByRDs are a new listed equity options product with limited profit potential and defined risk for both buyers and sellers. NYSE Amex Options is the first exchange platform to offer ByRDs on equities and exchange traded products (ETPs) to retail investors. Trading on the NYSE Amex Options platform, ByRDs are based on an underlying equity security, such as a stock or an ETP. They offer a fixed return of $100.00 per contract, based on whether the volume-weighted average price of the underlying security is above or below a given level on a defined future date. They also provide a capped maximum risk to the seller of $100.00 per contract, less the premium received for selling the option. ByRDs are cash-settled and exercisable only at expiration, unlike standard listed equity options. ByRDs share some of the same features as standard listed options, such as standardized expiration dates and clearing, and settlement at the Options Clearing Corporation.

The California Public Employees' Retirement System


                                                                                     •  Sacramento, CA                                                                            

                                        The California Public Employees Retirement System (CalPERS) assets are managed by the CalPERS Board of Administration. CalPERS invests across a range of asset classes including real estate, infrastructure, forest land, commodities, inflation-linked bonds, fixed-income, private equity, global public equity and nominal government bonds and cash. Strategies are managed both internally and through external managers.^CalPERS' absolute return program utilizes absolute return funds to capitalize on investment opportunities not available using traditional approaches to investing in public markets. The program's objective is to enhance CalPERS' total fund return while diversifying total fund risk.^CalPERS' Global Equity Strategy is managed as an overall composite portfolio combining an index-oriented core with actively managed portfolios. Investments are managed from the view of relative return and risk as compared to the overall strategic benchmark. The strategy incorporates CalPERS' values in investing to influence ESG, as long as such influence is consistent with maximizing long-term, risk adjusted returns.^Their Dollar Denominated Fixed-Income Program seeks to exceed the return of the BCLL Index while maintaining a high level of diversification. CalPERS invests across bond market sectors where risks are understood and manageable. CalPERS' International Fixed Income Program seeks to exceed the return of the BCIFI Index. The strategy focuses on maximizing risk adjusted returns through the selection and allocation of permissible bond markets. Maturities, durations, credits, currencies and derivative instruments are carefully managed. CalPERS also invests in global debt issued by national governments. Their Dollar Denominated Short-Term Program seeks opportunities in the short end of the yield curve with manageable risks, while maintaining liquidity, credit quality, weighted average days to maturity and diversification. Their Dollar Denominated Fixed Income Limited Duration Program includes the High Quality LIBOR program and the Short Duration strategy. The High Quality LIBOR Program is a limited duration, highly liquid program that invests in limited duration assets that provide low volatility vs. a floating-rate based benchmark. The Short Duration Program seeks to earn a return premium vs. traditional limited duration assets through a modest increase in portfolio duration and by purchasing a broader universe of limited duration securities than is available to traditional money market portfolios.^CalPERS' TIPS Program seeks a duration that is similar to the duration of the Barclays Capital Global Real: US TIPS Index. Investments may include US TIPS, nominal US Treasury Securities and short term-investment funds (STIF).^CalPERS' Liquidity Programs are designed to provide liquid assets that can be converted to cash during market downturns, to provide a partial hedge to liabilities and to provide diversification. Their US Treasury 2-10 Year Program invests in US Treasury securities (including futures whose deliverable instrument is a US Treasury security) as well as STIFs from a custodial bank or internal CalPERS STIFs.

Start Preamble
        
        
        
        June 23, 2017.
        Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) [1] 
           of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Act”) [2] 
           and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,[3] 
           notice is hereby given that on June 16, 2017, New York Stock Exchange LLC (“NYSE” or the “Exchange”) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”) the proposed rule change as described in Items I and II below, which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.
I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of the Substance of the Proposed Rule Change
The Exchange proposes to (a) provide Users with access to two additional third party systems, connectivity to six additional third party data feeds, and connectivity to two additional third party testing feeds, and (b) remove a duplicative third party data feed. In addition, the Exchange proposes to change its Price List related to these co-location services. The proposed rule change is available on the Exchange's Web site at www.nyse.com, at the principal office of the Exchange, and at the Commission's Public Reference Room.
II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change
In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose of, and basis for, the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of those statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The Exchange has prepared summaries, set forth in sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant parts of such statements.
A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change
1. Purpose
The Exchange proposes to amend the co-location [4] 
           services offered by the Exchange to (a) provide Users [5] 
           with access to two additional third party systems, connectivity to six additional third party data feeds, and connectivity to two additional third party testing feeds, and (b) remove a duplicative third party data feed. In addition the Exchange proposes to make the corresponding changes to the Exchange's Price List related to these co-location services.
As set forth in the Price List, the Exchange charges fees for connectivity to the execution systems of third party markets and other content service providers (“Third Party Systems”), data feeds from third party markets and other content service providers (“Third Party Data Feeds”), and third party testing feeds.[6] 
           The lists of Third Party Systems and Third Party Data Feeds are set forth in the Price List.
The Exchange now proposes to make the following changes:

Add two content service providers to the list of Third Party Systems: Euronext Optiq Cash and Derivatives Unicast (EUA), and Euronext Optiq Cash and Derivatives Unicast (Production) (together, the “Additional Third Party Systems” or “ATPS”);
add six feeds to the list of Third Party Data Feeds:

○ Euronext Optiq Compressed Cash, Euronext Optiq Compressed Derivatives, Euronext Optiq Shaped Cash and Euronext Optiq Shaped Derivatives (together, the “Additional Euronext Third Party Data Feeds”); and
○ CME Group (“CME”) and International Securities Exchange (“ISE”) (together, with the Additional Euronext Third Party Data Feeds, the “Additional Third Party Data Feeds” or “ATPD”); and

add two new testing feeds, Euronext Optiq Cash EUA and the Euronext Optiq Derivatives EUA; and
remove the Euronext Third Party Data Feed (the “Current Euronext Feed”) from the list of Third Party Data Feeds, because the Current Euronext Start Printed Page 29616Feed is similar to the Euronext Optiq Compressed Derivatives feed that the Exchange now proposes to add as a Third Party Data Feed.[7] 


The proposed Additional Third Party Systems, Additional Euronext Third Party Data Feeds and new testing feeds are new services and products from the third party content service provider Euronext N.V. (collectively, the “Euronext Products”). Euronext N.V. (“Euronext”) is expected to make the Euronext Products available no later than September 30, 2017.
The Exchange would provide access to the Additional Third Party Systems (“Access”) and connectivity to the Additional Third Party Data Feeds and new testing feeds (“Connectivity”) as conveniences to Users. Use of Access or Connectivity would be completely voluntary. The Exchange is not aware of any impediment to third parties offering Access or Connectivity.
Because the Euronext Products are not yet available, the Exchange does not know whether third parties will offer Users access and connectivity options to connect to the Euronext Products. Similarly, the Exchange does not have visibility into whether third parties currently offer, or intend to offer, Users connectivity to the CME and ISE Additional Third Party Data Feeds, as such third parties are not required to make that information public. However, if one or more third parties opt to offer (or, in the case of the CME and ISE Additional Third Party Data Feeds, presently offer) such access and connectivity to Users, a User may opt to access or connect to such services and products through a connection to an Exchange access center outside the data center, through another User, a third party access center or a third party vendor. In such a case, depending on the service offered by the third party, the User would be able to make such connection through the Exchange's Secure Financial Transaction Infrastructure (“SFTI”) network, through a third party telecommunication provider, third party wireless network, or a combination thereof.
The proposed rule change relating to the CME and ISE Additional Third Party Data Feeds would become operative upon the effectiveness of the present rule filing. The proposed rule change relating to each Euronext Product would become operative when such Euronext Product became available from Euronext, which is expected to be no later than September 30, 2017, but may not be at the same time for each Euronext Product.[8] 
           The Exchange will announce the dates that each Euronext Product will be available through customer notices disseminated to all Users simultaneously.
Connectivity to Additional Third Party Systems
The Exchange proposes to revise the Price List to provide that Users may obtain connectivity to the two Additional Third Party Systems for a fee. As with the current Third Party Systems, Users would connect to the Additional Third Party Systems over the internet protocol (“IP”) network, a local area network available in the data center.[9] 

As with the current Third Party Systems, in order to obtain access to an Additional Third Party System, the User would enter into an agreement with the relevant third party content service provider, pursuant to which the third party content service provider would charge the User for access to the Additional Third Party System. The Exchange would then establish a unicast connection between the User and the relevant third party content service provider over the IP network.[10] 
           The Exchange would charge the User for the connectivity to the Additional Third Party System. A User would only receive, and only be charged for, access to Additional Third Party Systems for which it enters into agreements with the third party content service provider.
The Exchange has no ownership interest in the Additional Third Party Systems. Establishing a User's access to an Additional Third Party System would not give the Exchange any right to use the Additional Third Party Systems. Connectivity to an Additional Third Party System would not provide access or order entry to the Exchange's execution system, and a User's connection to an Additional Third Party System would not be through the Exchange's execution system.
The Exchange proposes to charge a monthly recurring fee for connectivity to an Additional Third Party System. Specifically, when a User requests access to an Additional Third Party System, it would identify the applicable content service provider and what bandwidth connection it required.
The Exchange proposes to modify its Price List to add the Additional Third Party Systems to its existing list of Third Party Systems. The revised table would be as follows:
Third Party SystemsAmericas Trading Group (ATG).BATS.Boston Options Exchange (BOX).Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE).Credit Suisse.Euronext Optiq Cash and Derivatives Unicast (EUA).Euronext Optiq Cash and Derivatives Unicast (Production).International Securities Exchange (ISE).Nasdaq.NYFIX Marketplace.
The Exchange does not propose to change the monthly recurring fee the Exchange charges Users for unicast connectivity to each Third Party System, including the Additional Third Party Systems.
Connectivity to Additional Third Party Data Feeds
The Exchange proposes to revise the Price List to provide that Users may obtain connectivity to each of the six Additional Third Party Data Feeds for a fee. The Exchange would receive the Additional Third Party Data Feeds from the content service provider, at its data center. It would then provide connectivity to that data to Users for a fee. Users would connect to the Additional Third Party Data Feeds over the IP network.[11] 

With respect to the Additional Euronext Third Party Data Feeds, the Exchange proposes to offer connectivity to both “compressed” and “shaped” data feeds. The Exchange expects that Euronext's shaped feeds will include more data than the compressed feeds.
In order to connect to an Additional Third Party Data Feed, a User would enter into a contract with the content service provider, pursuant to which the content service provider would charge the User for the Third Party Data Feed. The Exchange would receive the Third Party Data Feed over its fiber optic network and, after the content service Start Printed Page 29617provider and User entered into the contract and the Exchange received authorization from the content service provider, the Exchange would re-transmit the data to the User over the User's port. The Exchange would charge the User for the connectivity to the Additional Third Party Data Feed. A User would only receive, and would only be charged for, connectivity to the Additional Third Party Data Feeds for which it entered into contracts.
The Exchange has no affiliation with the sellers of the Additional Third Party Data Feeds. It would have no right to use the Additional Third Party Data Feeds other than as a redistributor of the data. The Additional Third Party Data Feeds would not provide access or order entry to the Exchange's execution system. The Additional Third Party Data Feeds would not provide access or order entry to the execution systems of the third parties generating the feed. The Exchange would receive the Additional Third Party Data Feeds via arms-length agreements and it would have no inherent advantage over any other distributor of such data.
As it does with the existing Third Party Data Feeds, the Exchange proposes to charge a monthly recurring fee for connectivity to each Additional Third Party Data Feed. The monthly recurring fee would be per Additional Third Party Data Feed. Depending on its needs and bandwidth, a User may opt to receive all or some of the feeds or services included in an Additional Third Party Data Feed.
The Exchange proposes to add the connectivity fees for the Additional Third Party Data to its existing list in the Price List. The additional items would be as follows:
Third party data feedMonthly recurring 
               connectivity 
               fee per 
               third party 
               data feedCME Group$3,000Euronext Optiq Compressed Cash900Euronext Optiq Compressed Derivatives600Euronext Optiq Shaped Cash1,200Euronext Optiq Shaped Derivatives900International Securities Exchange (ISE)1,000
In addition, the Exchange proposes to remove the Current Euronext Feed from the list of Third Party Data Feeds when the proposed Euronext Optiq Compressed Derivatives third party data feed is available. The Exchange understands that the proposed Euronext Optiq Compressed Derivatives third party data feed is a similar platform to the Current Euronext Feed. The proposed Euronext Optiq Compressed Derivatives data feed will be offered at the same price as the Current Euronext Feed. A User of the Current Euronext Feed that wishes to continue to receive such data would enter into a contract with the content service provider to purchase the proposed Euronext Optiq Compressed Derivatives data feed, when available. The Exchange will not cease to offer connectivity to the Current Euronext Feed until the Euronext Optiq Compressed Derivatives data feed is available.
Connectivity to Third Party Testing and Certification Feeds
The Exchange offers Users connectivity to third party certification and testing feeds. Certification feeds are used to certify that a User conforms to any of the relevant content service provider's requirements for accessing Third Party Systems or receiving Third Party Data, while testing feeds provide Users an environment in which to conduct tests with non-live data. Such feeds, which are solely used for certification and testing and do not carry live production data, are available over the IP network.
The Exchange charges a connectivity fee of $100 per month per third party certification and testing feed. The Exchange proposes to offer Users connectivity to the Euronext Optiq Cash EUA and the Euronext Optiq Derivatives EUA testing data feeds for the same connectivity fee of $100 per month per feed.
General
As is the case with all Exchange co-location arrangements, (i) neither a User nor any of the User's customers would be permitted to submit orders directly to the Exchange unless such User or customer is a member organization, a Sponsored Participant or an agent thereof (e.g., a service bureau providing order entry services); (ii) use of the co-location services proposed herein would be completely voluntary and available to all Users on a non-discriminatory basis; [12] 
           and (iii) a User would only incur one charge for the particular co-location service described herein, regardless of whether the User connects only to the Exchange or to the Exchange and one or both the Affiliate SROs.[13] 

The proposed change is not otherwise intended to address any other issues relating to co-location services and/or related fees, and the Exchange is not aware of any problems that Users would have in complying with the proposed change.
2. Statutory Basis
The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act,[14] 
           in general, and furthers the objectives of Sections 6(b)(5) of the Act,[15] 
           in particular, because it is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in regulating, clearing, settling, processing information with respect to, and facilitating transactions in securities, to remove impediments to, and perfect the mechanisms of, a free and open market and a national market system and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest and because it is not designed to permit unfair discrimination between customers, issuers, brokers, or dealers.
The Exchange believes that the proposed changes would remove impediments to, and perfect the mechanisms of, a free and open market and a national market system and, in general, protect investors and the public interest because, by offering additional services, the Exchange would give each User additional options for addressing its access and connectivity needs, responding to User demand for access and connectivity options. Providing additional services would help each User tailor its data center operations to the requirements of its business operations by allowing it to select the form and latency of access and connectivity that best suits its needs.
The Exchange would provide Access and Connectivity as conveniences to Users. Use of Access or Connectivity would be completely voluntary. The Exchange is not aware of any impediment to third parties offering Access or Connectivity. Because the Start Printed Page 29618Euronext Products are not yet available, the Exchange does not know whether third parties will offer Users access and connectivity options to connect to the Euronext Products. Similarly, the Exchange does not have visibility into whether third parties currently offer, or intend to offer, Users connectivity to the CME and ISE Additional Third Party Data Feeds. However, if one or more third parties opt to offer (or, in the case of the CME and ISE Additional Third Party Data Feeds, presently offer) such access and connectivity to Users, a User may opt to access or connect to such services and products through a connection to an Exchange access center outside the data center, through another User, a third party access center or a third party vendor. In such a case, the User potentially would be able to make such connection through the Exchange's SFTI network, through a third party telecommunication provider, third party wireless network, or a combination thereof.
The Exchange believes that the proposed changes would remove impediments to, and perfect the mechanisms of, a free and open market and a national market system and, in general, protect investors and the public interest because, by offering connectivity to each of the Euronext Products as they come into production by Euronext, and offering connectivity to the CME and ISE data feeds to Users upon the effective date of this filing, the Exchange would give Users additional options for connectivity and access to new services as soon as they are available, responding to User demand for access and connectivity options.
The Exchange believes that the proposed changes would remove impediments to, and perfect the mechanisms of, a free and open market and a national market system and, in general, protect investors and the public interest because the Exchange proposes not to remove the Current Euronext Feed from the list of Third Party Data Feeds until the proposed Euronext Optiq Compressed Derivatives third party data feed is available. The proposed Euronext Optiq Compressed Derivatives data feed will be offered to Users at the same price at the Current Euronext Feed, and the Exchange understands that the proposed Euronext Optiq Compressed Derivatives data feed is a similar platform to the Current Euronext Feed. All Users, whether or not they currently subscribe to the Current Euronext Feed, will have the opportunity to enter into a contract with Euronext to purchase the proposed Euronext Optiq Compressed Derivatives data feed, when available.
The Exchange also believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b)(4) of the Act,[16] 
           in particular, because it provides for the equitable allocation of reasonable dues, fees, and other charges among its members, issuers and other persons using its facilities and does not unfairly discriminate between customers, issuers, brokers or dealers.
The Exchange believes that the proposed fee changes are consistent with Section 6(b)(4) of the Act for multiple reasons. The Exchange operates in a highly competitive market in which exchanges offer co-location services as a means to facilitate the trading and other market activities of those market participants who believe that co-location enhances the efficiency of their operations. Accordingly, fees charged for co-location services are constrained by the active competition for the order flow of, and other business from, such market participants. If a particular exchange charges excessive fees for co-location services, affected market participants will opt to terminate their co-location arrangements with that exchange, and adopt a possible range of alternative strategies, including placing their servers in a physically proximate location outside the exchange's data center (which could be a competing exchange), or pursuing strategies less dependent upon the lower exchange-to-participant latency associated with co-location. Accordingly, the exchange charging excessive fees would stand to lose not only co-location revenues but also the liquidity of the formerly co-located trading firms, which could have additional follow-on effects on the market share and revenue of the affected exchange.
The Exchange believes that the additional services and fees proposed herein would be equitably allocated and not unfairly discriminatory because, in addition to the services being completely voluntary, they would be available to all Users on an equal basis (i.e., the same products and services would be available to all Users). All Users that voluntarily selected to receive Access or Connectivity would be charged the same amount for the same services. Users that opted to use Access or Connectivity would not receive access or connectivity that is not available to all Users, as all market participants that contracted with the relevant market or content provider would receive access or connectivity.
The Exchange believes that the proposed charges would be reasonable, equitably allocated and not unfairly discriminatory because the Exchange would offer the Access and Connectivity as conveniences to Users, but in order to do so must provide, maintain and operate the data center facility hardware and technology infrastructure. The Exchange must handle the installation, administration, monitoring, support and maintenance of such services, including by responding to any production issues. Since the inception of co-location, the Exchange has made numerous improvements to the network hardware and technology infrastructure and has established additional administrative controls. The Exchange has expanded the network infrastructure to keep pace with the increased number of services available to Users, including resilient and redundant feeds. In addition, in order to provide Access and Connectivity, the Exchange would maintain multiple connections to each ATPD and ATPS, allowing the Exchange to provide resilient and redundant connections; adapt to any changes made by the relevant third party; and cover any applicable fees charged by the relevant third party, such as port fees. In addition, Users would not be required to use any of their bandwidth for Access and Connectivity unless they wish to do so.
The Exchange believes the proposed fees for connectivity to the ATPD would be reasonable because they would allow the Exchange to defray or cover the costs associated with offering Users connectivity to ATPD while providing Users the convenience of receiving such ATPD within co-location, helping them tailor their data center operations to the requirements of their business operations. In regards to the Additional Euronext Third Party Data Feeds, the Exchange expects that the shaped feeds will include more data than the compressed feeds. The Exchange accordingly believes that the proposed fees for the compressed and shaped data feeds for both the new Euronext cash and new Euronext derivatives services are reasonable because they would allow the Exchange to defray or cover the costs associated with offering such connectivity, including the maintenance and operating costs associated with the transatlantic Euronext data feeds, while providing Users the benefit of receiving such Additional Euronext Third Party Data Feeds within co-location, helping them tailor their data center operations to the requirements of their business operations by allowing them to select the form and latency of connectivity that best suits their needs, including by selecting between shaped and compressed formats.Start Printed Page 29619

The Exchange believes that the addition of the two new Euronext testing feeds for the same price as the monthly connectivity fees currently charged for other third party testing and certification feeds offered by the Exchange would be reasonable, equitably allocated and not unfairly discriminatory because it would provide Users with the benefit of having an environment in which to conduct tests with non-live data, including testing for upcoming releases and product enhancements or the User's own software development.
For the reasons above, the proposed changes would not unfairly discriminate between or among market participants that are otherwise capable of satisfying any applicable co-location fees, requirements, terms and conditions established from time to time by the Exchange.
For these reasons, the Exchange believes that the proposal is consistent with the Act.
B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition
In accordance with Section 6(b)(8) of the Act,[17] 

           the Exchange believes that the proposed rule change will not impose any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act because, in addition to the proposed services being completely voluntary, they are available to all Users on an equal basis (i.e. the same products and services are available to all Users).
The Exchange believes that providing Users with additional options for connectivity and access to new services when available would not impose any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act because such proposed Access and Connectivity would satisfy User demand for access and connectivity options. The Exchange would provide Access and Connectivity as conveniences equally to all Users. Because the Euronext Products are not yet available, the Exchange does not know whether third parties will offer Users access and connectivity options to connect to the Euronext Products. Similarly, the Exchange does not have visibility into whether third parties currently offer, or intend to offer, Users connectivity to the CME and ISE Additional Third Party Data Feeds, as such third parties are not required to make that information public. However, if one or more third parties opt to offer (or, in the case of the CME and ISE Additional Third Party Data Feeds, presently offer) such access and connectivity to Users, a User may opt to access or connect to such services and products through a connection to an Exchange access center outside the data center, through another User, a third party access center or a third party vendor. In such a case, depending on the service offered by the third party, the User would be able to make such connection through the SFTI network, through a third party telecommunication provider, third party wireless network, or a combination thereof. Users that opt to use the proposed Access or Connectivity would not receive access or connectivity that is not available to all Users, as all market participants that contract with the content provider may receive access or connectivity. In this way, the proposed changes would enhance competition by helping Users tailor their Access and Connectivity to the needs of their business operations by allowing them to select the form and latency of access and connectivity that best suits their needs.
In addition, the Exchange believes that providing Users with connectivity to each of the Euronext Products as they become available would not impose any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act because such proposed Access and Connectivity would satisfy User demand for additional options for connectivity and access to new services by providing them as soon as Euronext makes them available, responding to User demand for access and connectivity options.
The Exchange operates in a highly competitive market in which exchanges offer co-location services as a means to facilitate the trading and other market activities of those market participants who believe that co-location enhances the efficiency of their operations. Accordingly, fees charged for co-location services are constrained by the active competition for the order flow of, and other business from, such market participants. If a particular exchange charges excessive fees for co-location services, affected market participants will opt to terminate their co-location arrangements with that exchange, and adopt a possible range of alternative strategies, including placing their servers in a physically proximate location outside the exchange's data center (which could be a competing exchange), or pursuing strategies less dependent upon the lower exchange-to-participant latency associated with co-location. Accordingly, the exchange charging excessive fees would stand to lose not only co-location revenues but also the liquidity of the formerly co-located trading firms, which could have additional follow-on effects on the market share and revenue of the affected exchange. For the reasons described above, the Exchange believes that the proposed rule change reflects this competitive environment.
C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants, or Others
No written comments were solicited or received with respect to the proposed rule change.
III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action
Because the foregoing proposed rule change does not: (i) Significantly affect the protection of investors or the public interest; (ii) impose any significant burden on competition; and (iii) become operative for 30 days from the date on which it was filed, or such shorter time as the Commission may designate, it has become effective pursuant to Section 19(b)(3)(A)(iii) of the Act [18] 
           and subparagraph (f)(6) of Rule 19b-4 thereunder.[19] 
           A proposed rule change filed under Rule 19b-4(f)(6) normally does not become operative prior to 30 days after the date of filing.[20] 
           Rule 19b-4(f)(6)(iii), however, permits the Commission to designate a shorter time if such action is consistent with the protection of investors and the public interest.[21] 

The Exchange has asked the Commission to waive the 30-day operative delay so that the proposal may become operative immediately upon filing. The Exchange states that waiver of the operative delay will permit Users to obtain the benefits of the proposed new access and connectivity services and help Users tailor their data center operations to the requirements of their business operations without delay. The Commission believes that waiving the 30-day operative delay is consistent with the protection of investors and the public interest. Therefore, the Commission hereby waives the operative delay and designates the Start Printed Page 29620proposed rule change operative upon filing.[22] 

At any time within 60 days of the filing of such proposed rule change, the Commission summarily may temporarily suspend such rule change if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. If the Commission takes such action, the Commission shall institute proceedings under Section 19(b)(2)(B) [23] 
           of the Act to determine whether the proposed rule change should be approved or disapproved.

As specified in the Price List, a User that incurs co-location fees for a particular co-location service pursuant thereto would not be subject to co-location fees for the same co-location service charged by the Exchange's affiliates NYSE MKT LLC (“NYSE MKT”) and NYSE Arca, Inc. (“NYSE Arca” and, together with NYSE MKT, the “Affiliate SROs”). See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 70206 (August 15, 2013), 78 FR 51765 (August 21, 2013) (SR-NYSE-2013-59).

     Information flows over existing network connections in two formats: “unicast” format, which is a format that allows one-to-one communication, similar to a phone line, in which information is sent to and from the Exchange; and “multicast” format, which is a format in which information is sent one-way from the Exchange to multiple recipients at once, like a radio broadcast.

12.
     As is currently the case, Users that receive co-location services from the Exchange will not receive any means of access to the Exchange's trading and execution systems that is separate from, or superior to, that of other Users. In this regard, all orders sent to the Exchange enter the Exchange's trading and execution systems through the same order gateway, regardless of whether the sender is co-located in the data center or not. In addition, co-located Users do not receive any market data or data service product that is not available to all Users, although Users that receive co-location services normally would expect reduced latencies in sending orders to, and receiving market data from, the Exchange.

Mergers and acquisitions[edit]
NYSE and Archipelago Holdings[edit]
The merger between NYSE and Archipelago Holdings was initially approved in 2005 by a 95% majority of voting NYSE members.[8] The acquisition of Archipelago, which held possession of highly regarded market technology at the time, was intended to bring automated trading to NYSE markets (which had previously utilized an "open outcry" system) and increase efficiency.
For the first time in its 213-year history, the New York Stock Exchange became a for-profit company, and began trading publicly on its own stock exchange under the NYX ticker.[9] Owners of the 1,366 NYSE seats received 80,177 shares of NYSE Group stock plus $300,000 in cash and $70,571 in dividends for each seat.[10] The completion of this deal created two new branches of the NYSE Group: NYSE Arca and NYSE Arca Europe, which launched after the acquisition of Euronext.
NYSE Group and Euronext merger April 4, 2007[edit]
In April 2006, NYSE Group and Euronext signed a merger agreement, subject to shareholder vote and regulatory approval.[11] Euronext shareholders gave approval to the transaction on December 19, 2006, and shareholders from the NYSE Group followed suit one day later.[12] In April 2007 the Euronext shareholders tendering shares can receive NYSE shares and cash amounting to $11,141 million from NYSE Euronext for their assets.[13] About 94% of the 112,557,259 shares are tendered in the first round.[14]
The NYSE Group and Euronext merger on April 4, 2007, signaled the creation of the world's largest and most liquid exchange group—NYSE Euronext.[15]
NYSE Euronext and NYFIX[edit]
NYSE Euronext, through its wholly owned subsidiary NYSE Technologies, Inc. acquired NYFIX, Inc. (Nasdaq: NYFX) for $144 million in November 2009. NYFIX is a provider of solutions that optimize trading efficiency. NYSE Euronext incorporated NYFIX's trading software into the company's package of offerings to customers.[16]
Attempted merger between NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse[edit]
In 2011, Bloomberg reported that the German exchange operator Deutsche Börse was in advanced talks to buy NYSE Euronext for $9.53 billion in a deal that would create the world's largest trading powerhouse.[17] The shares of both companies were temporarily frozen on the news due to the risk of large price movements and clarifications of the deal. A successful deal would see the new company becoming the world's largest stock exchange operator with a market capitalization of listed companies equal to $15 trillion.[18]
The proposed group would have dual headquarters, in Deutsche Boerse's newly built green tower near Frankfurt, Germany, and in New York City at 11 Wall Street. It would be led by a board with seventeen members—fifteen directors plus the Chairman and the CEO. Of the fifteen directors, nine to be designated by Deutsche Boerse and six by NYSE Euronext. Current NYSE Euronext CEO Duncan Niederauer would assume the same role with the newly founded company and would lead an Executive Committee with an equal number of current Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext executives.[19]
On July 7, 2011, NYSE Euronext shareholders voted in favor of the merger, and on July 13, 2011, Deutsche Boerse shareholders approved the deal as well. These decisions move the two sides closer to completing the transaction, which must still pass through forty separate regulatory approval processes to be finalized.[20]
The merger was subject to review in both the United States and with the European Union (EU) for concerns it could create a “de facto monopoly”.
In October 2011, CEO Niederauer said the company had received the EU's so-called statement of objections, which was more than 100 pages long, and would be responding within two weeks, possibly by asking for the opportunity for an oral hearing with the regulators. The EU examination of the proposal formally began June 29 has said its expanded probe has a Dec. 13 deadline. In March, Joaquin Almunia, the EU's antitrust commissioner, expressed concern that the deal would maybe monopolize the derivatives market due to Deutsche Boerse's “vertical silo” which routes all trade clearing through its own services. Almunia said then he preferred a “more open business model” for markets.[21]
On December 22, 2011, Deutsche Boerse won U.S. antitrust approval to buy NYSE Euronext, on condition that a Deutsche Boerse subsidiary, the International Securities Exchange, divest its 31.5 percent interest in Direct Edge.[22] NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Boerse AG delayed the deadline for completing their merger until March 31, 2012 so the exchange operators could try to persuade European regulators to approve the deal.[23]
On February 1, 2012, the European Union blocked the planned merger between NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Boerse. The European Commission—the EU's executive body—ruled against the merger because, they said, the combined exchange would control more than 90% of the trade in European derivatives. The European Commission report stated, "The merger between Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext would have led to a near-monopoly in European financial derivatives worldwide... These markets are at the heart of the financial system and it is crucial for the whole European economy that they remain competitive".[24]
On February 2, 2012, the NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse agreed with strong opposition by the EU for the planned merger, to scrap the merger.[25]
IntercontinentalExchange acquisition of NYSE Euronext[edit]
On December 20, 2012, the boards of directors of both IntercontinentalExchange (ICE) and the NYSE Euronext approved an $8 billion acquisition of NYSE Euronext. Under the terms shareholders of NYSE would receive either $33.12 in cash for each share or .2581 IntercontinentalExchange Inc. shares, or a combination of $11.27 in cash per share plus .1703 shares of stock.[26] The acquisition is subject to regulator approval, though since the operations of ICE and NYSE have little in common—ICE is largely devoted to trading commodities, as opposed to NYSE's business of trading stocks and securities—the deal is not expected to be blocked.[27] ICE said that after the deal closed it would sell the Euronext portion of the company, including stock exchanges in Amsterdam, Brussels, Lisbon and Paris.[28] The deal went through and Euronext is a sister division to NYSE and part of IntercontinentalExchange. ICE CEO Jeffrey C. Sprecher would continue in that position at the combined company, while NYSE CEO Duncan Niederauer would serve as president.[27] The future of the New York Stock Exchange's historic trading floor under ICE has not been announced. ICE closed the high profile and historic trading floors of its other earlier acquisitions—the International Petroleum Exchange and the New York Board of Trade in New York.[29]
Company structure[edit]
Derivatives[edit]
The Derivatives segment consists of NYSE Euronext's derivatives trading and clearing businesses. This includes NYSE Liffe, NYSE Liffe Clearing, NYSE Liffe US, NYSE Amex Options, NYSE Arca Option, and related derivatives market data.[30]
NYSE Liffe[edit]
NYSE Liffe comprises the derivatives market operated by LIFFE Administration and Management, Euronext Amsterdam, Euronext Brussels, Euronext Lisbon, and Euronext Paris. It offers customers the advantages of one of the most technologically advanced derivatives trading platforms as well as one of the widest choices of products of any derivatives market.[30]
Through a single electronic trading platform, NYSE Liffe offers customers access to a wide range of interest-rate, equity, index, commodity and currency derivative products. This platform has been designed to handle significant order flows and transaction volumes. Orders can be matched either on a price/time or pro rata basis, configurable by contract, with transacted prices and volumes and the aggregate size of all bids and offers at each price level updated on a real-time basis. Users can continually notified of all active orders in the central order book, making market depth easy to monitor.[30]
NYSE Liffe also offers its customers the Bclear and Cscreen services, which bridge the listed and over-the-counter (OTC) markets. This provides a simple and cost-effective way to register and process wholesale derivatives trades through NYSE Liffe to clearing at NYSE Liffe Clearing. Following the launch of NYSE Liffe Clearing, NYSE Liffe assumed full responsibility for clearing activities on its own London market.[30]
NYSE Liffe US, NYSE Euronext's U.S. futures exchange, makes available for trading full- and mini-sized gold and silver futures, options on full-sized gold and silver futures and futures on Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) Indices. A significant minority equity stake in NYSE Liffe US is held by six external investors: Citadel Securities, DRW Investments, Getco, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and UBS. Under this ownership structure, NYSE Euronext remains the largest shareholder in the entity and consolidates its financial reporting. NYSE Euronext manages the day-to-day operations of NYSE Liffe US, which operates under the supervision of a separate board of directors.[30]
NYSE Amex Options[edit]
The NYSE Amex Options business uses a hybrid model combining both auction-based and electronic trading capabilities that is designed to provide a stable, liquid and less volatile market. This feature provides the opportunity for price and/or size improvement.[30]
In 2010, NYSE Euronext announced the sale of a significant equity interest in NYSE Amex Options to seven external investors: Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Barclays Capital, Citadel Securities, Citi, Goldman Sachs, TD Ameritrade, and UBS. Under the framework, NYSE Euronext remains the largest shareholder in the entity and manages the day-to-day operations of NYSE Amex Options, which operates under the supervision of a separate board of directors and chief executive officer. NYSE Euronext consolidates this entity for financial reporting purposes.[30]
NYSE Arca Options[edit]
NYSE Arca Options, the other of NYSE Euronext's two U.S. options exchanges, offers immediate, cost-effective electronic order execution in nearly two thousand options issues. The NYSE Arca Options business uses a technology platform and market structure designed to enhance the speed and quality of trade execution for its customers, as well as to attract additional sources of liquidity. Its structure allows market makers to access its markets remotely and integrates floor-based participants as well.[30]
Cash Trading and Listings[edit]
The Cash Trading and Listings segment includes the New York Stock Exchange, Euronext, NYSE Amex, NYSE Arca, NYSE Alternext, NYSE Arca Europe, SmartPool, BlueNext, and NYSE Blue, as well as related cash trading market data.[30]
New York Stock Exchange[edit]
The New York Stock Exchange is registered as a national securities exchange under the Exchange Act. In addition to common stock, preferred stock and warrants, the NYSE lists debt and corporate structured products, such as capital securities, mandatory convertibles, and repackaged securities.[30]
Euronext[edit]
Euronext is the first integrated cross-border exchange, combining the stock exchanges of Amsterdam, Paris, Brussels and Lisbon into a single market. Issuers who meet European Union regulatory standards are qualified for listing on the regulated markets operated by Euronext. The company's exchanges list a wide variety of securities, including domestic and international equity securities, convertible bonds, warrants, trackers and debt securities, including corporate and government bonds.[30]
All of Euronext's markets are operated by its subsidiaries, each of which holds a national license as an exchange operator.[30]
NYSE Amex[edit]
NYSE Euronext completed its acquisition of the Amex (American Stock Exchange) on October 1, 2008. The transaction extended NYSE Euronext's leadership in U.S. option, cash equities, and exchange-traded funds (ETFs), making it the third largest U.S. equity options marketplace based on number of contracts traded. Since the merger, Amex has been integrated into the company, with former Amex listings now trading directly on the NYSE, and has begun trading certain Nasdaq-listed securities.[30]
NYSE Arca is the first electronic market to offer listed ETP issuers a Lead Market Maker program, which encourages liquidity provision that contributes to the best prices and depth in the ETP marketplace. It is registered as a national securities exchange under the Exchange Act.[30]
NYSE Alternext[edit]
NYSE Alternext was created by NYSE Euronext to meet the needs of small and mid-sized companies seeking simplified access to the stock market. Its streamlined listing requirements and trading rules are suited to the size and business needs of such firms. The rules also ensure investor transparency. NYSE Alternext's special listing procedures, unique market model, and listings of sponsor companies for members are its most notable features.[30]
NYSE Alternext is an exchange-regulated market with a lighter regulatory regime. It is not a regulated market as defined by the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID), but rather is regulated by NYSE Euronext through a body of rules applicable to intermediaries and listed companies.[30]
NYSE Arca Europe[edit]
NYSE Arca Europe is a pan-European multilateral trading facility (MTF) that extends the trading scope of Euronext's regulated markets by adding blue-chip stocks from 14 European countries: Austria, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. Arca Europe integrates this trading facility with the other business components of the company, giving customers the flexibility in trading of an MTF while maintaining the global market reach of NYSE Euronext.[30]
SmartPool[edit]
SmartPool Trading Limited is a UK-registered company supplying an MTF approved by the Financial Services Authority (FSA). It provides an exchange-led dark pool for the execution of block orders covering 15 different European markets, with a full central counter party back-end solution through LCH.Clearnet and EuroCCP. SmartPool was created by NYSE Euronext in partnership with BNP Paribas, HSBC, and J.P. Morgan Chase.[30]
BlueNext and NYSE Blue[edit]
NYSE Euronext holds a 60% interest in BlueNext with the remaining 40% held by CDC Climat. BlueNext operates a spot market in carbon dioxide emission allowances and credits that is the European leader in the field. It seeks to establish a leading position in trading in environment-related instruments, and has also launched a futures market with physical delivery of allowances and credits.[30]
In September 2010, NYSE Euronext announced plans to create NYSE Blue, a new global company that will focus on environmental and sustainable energy markets. NYSE Euronext contributed its ownership in BlueNext in return for a majority interest in NYSE Blue, and APX, Inc. (a leading provider of regulatory infrastructure and services for environmental and sustainable energy markets) will contribute its business in return for a minority interest in the venture. The transaction closed on February 18, 2011.[30]
Information Services and Technology Solutions[edit]
The Information Services and Technology Solutions segment refers to NYSE Euronext's commercial technology transactions, data, and infrastructure businesses. NYSE Euronext operates NYSE Technologies, Free Market, and also owns NYFIX, Inc., a leading provider of innovative solutions that optimize trading efficiency.[30]
NYSE Technologies[edit]
NYSE Technologies is the commercial technology division of NYSE Euronext. Launched in January 2009, it provides data and infrastructure services, comprehensive transaction, and managed solutions for buy-side, sell-side, and exchange communities that require next-generation performance and expertise. NYSE Technologies' advanced integrated solutions power the trading operations of global financial institutions and exchanges, including non-NYSE Euronext markets in addition to all the exchanges in the NYSE Euronext group.[30]
NYSE Technologies operates five business:

Global Market Data offers a broad array of global market information products covering multiple asset classes;
Trading Solutions creates and implements high performance, end-to-end messaging software, real-time market data distribution and integration products;
Exchange Solutions provides multi-asset exchange platform services, managed services and expert consultancy;
Global Connectivity offers one of the world's largest, most reliable financial transaction networks connecting firms and exchanges worldwide;
Transactions primarily comprises the former NYFIX FIX business and incorporates the NYFIX Marketplace and the FIX Software business.

Marché Libre[edit]
The Free Markets of Brussels and Paris, organized by NYSE Euronext, are not regulated markets in the sense of the EU Directive. The criteria for admission to these markets are much simpler, and listing costs are low. They provide a channel for disseminating buy and sell orders, with trades executed by NYSE Euronext member firms. The securities traded on these markets have not gone through any admission procedures and issuers are not subject to any disclosure requirements. The Free Markets serve companies that are too young or too small to be listed on one of the regulated compartments of NYSE Euronext.[30]
NYSE Regulation and FINRA[edit]
On May 4, 2010, NYSE Euronext and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) announced that FINRA would assume responsibility for performing the market surveillance and enforcement functions originally conducted by NYSE Regulation. The agreement was subject to review by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and was completed in June 2010.[30]
Under the announced agreement, FINRA assumed regulatory functions for NYSE Euronext's U.S. equities and options markets – the New York Stock Exchange, NYSE Arca, and NYSE Amex. NYSE Euronext, through its subsidiary NYSE Regulation, remains ultimately responsible for overseeing FINRA's performance of regulatory services for the NYSE markets.[30]
Libor administration[edit]
In early 2014, NYSE Euronext took over the administration of the London interbank offered rate from the British Bankers Association.[31] The new administrator is NYSE Euronext Rates Administration Limited,[32] a London-based, UK registered company, regulated by the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority.[33]
Global marketing and branding[edit]
NYSE Euronext maintains an active marketing campaign, both for its own brand, as well as for its listed companies. The Global Marketing and Branding department is responsible for the full spectrum of NYSE Euronext's brand marketing, including advertising, marketing communications, event management, and market research.[34]
Through the NYSE Global Partnership Program, NYSE Euronext has created a series of strategic resources to support its listed companies' growth initiatives, so as to act as a conduit that enables them to reach new and important audiences.[35] NYSE Euronext's 8,000 listed issues provide members with an extensive network of global investors and business leaders with which to interact. The company offers opportunities for co-branded advertising, linking listed companies to one another, as well as to the powerful brand that is NYSE Euronext.[36]
Events[edit]
The Events department of NYSE Euronext is responsible for coordinating bell ceremonies, receptions, conferences, and street events. Beginning in 2010, the NYSE Euronext opened its doors to non-listed companies to utilize NYSE facilities for after-hours events.
Opening and closing ceremonies[edit]
The opening and closing bell ceremonies hosted by the NYSE date back to 1903, taking place Monday through Friday at 9:30 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. respectively in New York City.
The opportunity to ring the bell at the New York Stock Exchange has long been considered an honor. Representatives from listed companies, especially newly listed companies and IPOs, celebrities, politicians, and other dignitaries have become fixtures at the bell podium. Bell ceremonies are seen by millions, and are the most widely watched TV events each day.
The bell tradition has been extended to the branches in Paris, Brussels, and Lisbon. In Amsterdam, the opening bell was replaced by a gong, which is sounded the signal the beginning and end of the trading day. In the European offices, the opening and closing ceremonies take place at 9:00 a.m. and 5:30 p.m., respectively.[37]
Experience Square[edit]
The Broad Street area in front of the Exchange is known as Experience Square,[citation needed] where listed companies are able to market themselves and their products directly to the thousands of visitors to New York's Financial District each day. The façade of the exchange is often used as a billboard to showcase branding and new listings.[citation needed]
NYSE Magazine[edit]
NYSE Magazine is NYSE Euronext's quarterly publication. It provides insights into the world’s best companies, giving readers a close-up look at the distinguished leaders who constitute the Exchange community. Written for a sophisticated audience of CEOs and other senior global executives, each issue centers on what makes companies succeed. Designed to foster a sense of community among the NYSE’s key constituents, NYSE magazine has grown to become a strategic tool for business leaders that delivers opinions, strategies and insights from their peers. Extended articles, Q&As, videos, photo, and slideshows are now available at www.nysemagazine.com and on iPad via the NYSE magazine app. NYSE magazine print and digital editions reach thousands of opinion leaders around the globe, including top management of publicly traded and private companies, government officials, the financial community and the media. NYSE ceased production of the print edition in 2013 and currently publishes content exclusively online.

Mergers and acquisitions[edit]
NYSE and Archipelago Holdings[edit]
The merger between NYSE and Archipelago Holdings was initially approved in 2005 by a 95% majority of voting NYSE members.[8] The acquisition of Archipelago, which held possession of highly regarded market technology at the time, was intended to bring automated trading to NYSE markets (which had previously utilized an "open outcry" system) and increase efficiency.
For the first time in its 213-year history, the New York Stock Exchange became a for-profit company, and began trading publicly on its own stock exchange under the NYX ticker.[9] Owners of the 1,366 NYSE seats received 80,177 shares of NYSE Group stock plus $300,000 in cash and $70,571 in dividends for each seat.[10] The completion of this deal created two new branches of the NYSE Group: NYSE Arca and NYSE Arca Europe, which launched after the acquisition of Euronext.
NYSE Group and Euronext merger April 4, 2007[edit]
In April 2006, NYSE Group and Euronext signed a merger agreement, subject to shareholder vote and regulatory approval.[11] Euronext shareholders gave approval to the transaction on December 19, 2006, and shareholders from the NYSE Group followed suit one day later.[12] In April 2007 the Euronext shareholders tendering shares can receive NYSE shares and cash amounting to $11,141 million from NYSE Euronext for their assets.[13] About 94% of the 112,557,259 shares are tendered in the first round.[14]
The NYSE Group and Euronext merger on April 4, 2007, signaled the creation of the world's largest and most liquid exchange group—NYSE Euronext.[15]
NYSE Euronext and NYFIX[edit]
NYSE Euronext, through its wholly owned subsidiary NYSE Technologies, Inc. acquired NYFIX, Inc. (Nasdaq: NYFX) for $144 million in November 2009. NYFIX is a provider of solutions that optimize trading efficiency. NYSE Euronext incorporated NYFIX's trading software into the company's package of offerings to customers.[16]
Attempted merger between NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse[edit]
In 2011, Bloomberg reported that the German exchange operator Deutsche Börse was in advanced talks to buy NYSE Euronext for $9.53 billion in a deal that would create the world's largest trading powerhouse.[17] The shares of both companies were temporarily frozen on the news due to the risk of large price movements and clarifications of the deal. A successful deal would see the new company becoming the world's largest stock exchange operator with a market capitalization of listed companies equal to $15 trillion.[18]
The proposed group would have dual headquarters, in Deutsche Boerse's newly built green tower near Frankfurt, Germany, and in New York City at 11 Wall Street. It would be led by a board with seventeen members—fifteen directors plus the Chairman and the CEO. Of the fifteen directors, nine to be designated by Deutsche Boerse and six by NYSE Euronext. Current NYSE Euronext CEO Duncan Niederauer would assume the same role with the newly founded company and would lead an Executive Committee with an equal number of current Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext executives.[19]
On July 7, 2011, NYSE Euronext shareholders voted in favor of the merger, and on July 13, 2011, Deutsche Boerse shareholders approved the deal as well. These decisions move the two sides closer to completing the transaction, which must still pass through forty separate regulatory approval processes to be finalized.[20]
The merger was subject to review in both the United States and with the European Union (EU) for concerns it could create a “de facto monopoly”.
In October 2011, CEO Niederauer said the company had received the EU's so-called statement of objections, which was more than 100 pages long, and would be responding within two weeks, possibly by asking for the opportunity for an oral hearing with the regulators. The EU examination of the proposal formally began June 29 has said its expanded probe has a Dec. 13 deadline. In March, Joaquin Almunia, the EU's antitrust commissioner, expressed concern that the deal would maybe monopolize the derivatives market due to Deutsche Boerse's “vertical silo” which routes all trade clearing through its own services. Almunia said then he preferred a “more open business model” for markets.[21]
On December 22, 2011, Deutsche Boerse won U.S. antitrust approval to buy NYSE Euronext, on condition that a Deutsche Boerse subsidiary, the International Securities Exchange, divest its 31.5 percent interest in Direct Edge.[22] NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Boerse AG delayed the deadline for completing their merger until March 31, 2012 so the exchange operators could try to persuade European regulators to approve the deal.[23]
On February 1, 2012, the European Union blocked the planned merger between NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Boerse. The European Commission—the EU's executive body—ruled against the merger because, they said, the combined exchange would control more than 90% of the trade in European derivatives. The European Commission report stated, "The merger between Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext would have led to a near-monopoly in European financial derivatives worldwide... These markets are at the heart of the financial system and it is crucial for the whole European economy that they remain competitive".[24]
On February 2, 2012, the NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse agreed with strong opposition by the EU for the planned merger, to scrap the merger.[25]
IntercontinentalExchange acquisition of NYSE Euronext[edit]
On December 20, 2012, the boards of directors of both IntercontinentalExchange (ICE) and the NYSE Euronext approved an $8 billion acquisition of NYSE Euronext. Under the terms shareholders of NYSE would receive either $33.12 in cash for each share or .2581 IntercontinentalExchange Inc. shares, or a combination of $11.27 in cash per share plus .1703 shares of stock.[26] The acquisition is subject to regulator approval, though since the operations of ICE and NYSE have little in common—ICE is largely devoted to trading commodities, as opposed to NYSE's business of trading stocks and securities—the deal is not expected to be blocked.[27] ICE said that after the deal closed it would sell the Euronext portion of the company, including stock exchanges in Amsterdam, Brussels, Lisbon and Paris.[28] The deal went through and Euronext is a sister division to NYSE and part of IntercontinentalExchange. ICE CEO Jeffrey C. Sprecher would continue in that position at the combined company, while NYSE CEO Duncan Niederauer would serve as president.[27] The future of the New York Stock Exchange's historic trading floor under ICE has not been announced. ICE closed the high profile and historic trading floors of its other earlier acquisitions—the International Petroleum Exchange and the New York Board of Trade in New York.[29]
Company structure[edit]
Derivatives[edit]
The Derivatives segment consists of NYSE Euronext's derivatives trading and clearing businesses. This includes NYSE Liffe, NYSE Liffe Clearing, NYSE Liffe US, NYSE Amex Options, NYSE Arca Option, and related derivatives market data.[30]
NYSE Liffe[edit]
NYSE Liffe comprises the derivatives market operated by LIFFE Administration and Management, Euronext Amsterdam, Euronext Brussels, Euronext Lisbon, and Euronext Paris. It offers customers the advantages of one of the most technologically advanced derivatives trading platforms as well as one of the widest choices of products of any derivatives market.[30]
Through a single electronic trading platform, NYSE Liffe offers customers access to a wide range of interest-rate, equity, index, commodity and currency derivative products. This platform has been designed to handle significant order flows and transaction volumes. Orders can be matched either on a price/time or pro rata basis, configurable by contract, with transacted prices and volumes and the aggregate size of all bids and offers at each price level updated on a real-time basis. Users can continually notified of all active orders in the central order book, making market depth easy to monitor.[30]
NYSE Liffe also offers its customers the Bclear and Cscreen services, which bridge the listed and over-the-counter (OTC) markets. This provides a simple and cost-effective way to register and process wholesale derivatives trades through NYSE Liffe to clearing at NYSE Liffe Clearing. Following the launch of NYSE Liffe Clearing, NYSE Liffe assumed full responsibility for clearing activities on its own London market.[30]
NYSE Liffe US, NYSE Euronext's U.S. futures exchange, makes available for trading full- and mini-sized gold and silver futures, options on full-sized gold and silver futures and futures on Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) Indices. A significant minority equity stake in NYSE Liffe US is held by six external investors: Citadel Securities, DRW Investments, Getco, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and UBS. Under this ownership structure, NYSE Euronext remains the largest shareholder in the entity and consolidates its financial reporting. NYSE Euronext manages the day-to-day operations of NYSE Liffe US, which operates under the supervision of a separate board of directors.[30]
NYSE Amex Options[edit]
The NYSE Amex Options business uses a hybrid model combining both auction-based and electronic trading capabilities that is designed to provide a stable, liquid and less volatile market. This feature provides the opportunity for price and/or size improvement.[30]
In 2010, NYSE Euronext announced the sale of a significant equity interest in NYSE Amex Options to seven external investors: Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Barclays Capital, Citadel Securities, Citi, Goldman Sachs, TD Ameritrade, and UBS. Under the framework, NYSE Euronext remains the largest shareholder in the entity and manages the day-to-day operations of NYSE Amex Options, which operates under the supervision of a separate board of directors and chief executive officer. NYSE Euronext consolidates this entity for financial reporting purposes.[30]
NYSE Arca Options[edit]
NYSE Arca Options, the other of NYSE Euronext's two U.S. options exchanges, offers immediate, cost-effective electronic order execution in nearly two thousand options issues. The NYSE Arca Options business uses a technology platform and market structure designed to enhance the speed and quality of trade execution for its customers, as well as to attract additional sources of liquidity. Its structure allows market makers to access its markets remotely and integrates floor-based participants as well.[30]
Cash Trading and Listings[edit]
The Cash Trading and Listings segment includes the New York Stock Exchange, Euronext, NYSE Amex, NYSE Arca, NYSE Alternext, NYSE Arca Europe, SmartPool, BlueNext, and NYSE Blue, as well as related cash trading market data.[30]
New York Stock Exchange[edit]
The New York Stock Exchange is registered as a national securities exchange under the Exchange Act. In addition to common stock, preferred stock and warrants, the NYSE lists debt and corporate structured products, such as capital securities, mandatory convertibles, and repackaged securities.[30]
Euronext[edit]
Euronext is the first integrated cross-border exchange, combining the stock exchanges of Amsterdam, Paris, Brussels and Lisbon into a single market. Issuers who meet European Union regulatory standards are qualified for listing on the regulated markets operated by Euronext. The company's exchanges list a wide variety of securities, including domestic and international equity securities, convertible bonds, warrants, trackers and debt securities, including corporate and government bonds.[30]
All of Euronext's markets are operated by its subsidiaries, each of which holds a national license as an exchange operator.[30]
NYSE Amex[edit]
NYSE Euronext completed its acquisition of the Amex (American Stock Exchange) on October 1, 2008. The transaction extended NYSE Euronext's leadership in U.S. option, cash equities, and exchange-traded funds (ETFs), making it the third largest U.S. equity options marketplace based on number of contracts traded. Since the merger, Amex has been integrated into the company, with former Amex listings now trading directly on the NYSE, and has begun trading certain Nasdaq-listed securities.[30]
NYSE Arca is the first electronic market to offer listed ETP issuers a Lead Market Maker program, which encourages liquidity provision that contributes to the best prices and depth in the ETP marketplace. It is registered as a national securities exchange under the Exchange Act.[30]
NYSE Alternext[edit]
NYSE Alternext was created by NYSE Euronext to meet the needs of small and mid-sized companies seeking simplified access to the stock market. Its streamlined listing requirements and trading rules are suited to the size and business needs of such firms. The rules also ensure investor transparency. NYSE Alternext's special listing procedures, unique market model, and listings of sponsor companies for members are its most notable features.[30]
NYSE Alternext is an exchange-regulated market with a lighter regulatory regime. It is not a regulated market as defined by the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID), but rather is regulated by NYSE Euronext through a body of rules applicable to intermediaries and listed companies.[30]
NYSE Arca Europe[edit]
NYSE Arca Europe is a pan-European multilateral trading facility (MTF) that extends the trading scope of Euronext's regulated markets by adding blue-chip stocks from 14 European countries: Austria, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. Arca Europe integrates this trading facility with the other business components of the company, giving customers the flexibility in trading of an MTF while maintaining the global market reach of NYSE Euronext.[30]
SmartPool[edit]
SmartPool Trading Limited is a UK-registered company supplying an MTF approved by the Financial Services Authority (FSA). It provides an exchange-led dark pool for the execution of block orders covering 15 different European markets, with a full central counter party back-end solution through LCH.Clearnet and EuroCCP. SmartPool was created by NYSE Euronext in partnership with BNP Paribas, HSBC, and J.P. Morgan Chase.[30]
BlueNext and NYSE Blue[edit]
NYSE Euronext holds a 60% interest in BlueNext with the remaining 40% held by CDC Climat. BlueNext operates a spot market in carbon dioxide emission allowances and credits that is the European leader in the field. It seeks to establish a leading position in trading in environment-related instruments, and has also launched a futures market with physical delivery of allowances and credits.[30]
In September 2010, NYSE Euronext announced plans to create NYSE Blue, a new global company that will focus on environmental and sustainable energy markets. NYSE Euronext contributed its ownership in BlueNext in return for a majority interest in NYSE Blue, and APX, Inc. (a leading provider of regulatory infrastructure and services for environmental and sustainable energy markets) will contribute its business in return for a minority interest in the venture. The transaction closed on February 18, 2011.[30]
Information Services and Technology Solutions[edit]

Marché Libre[edit]
The Free Markets of Brussels and Paris, organized by NYSE Euronext, are not regulated markets in the sense of the EU Directive. The criteria for admission to these markets are much simpler, and listing costs are low. They provide a channel for disseminating buy and sell orders, with trades executed by NYSE Euronext member firms. The securities traded on these markets have not gone through any admission procedures and issuers are not subject to any disclosure requirements. The Free Markets serve companies that are too young or too small to be listed on one of the regulated compartments of NYSE Euronext.[30]
NYSE Regulation and FINRA[edit]
On May 4, 2010, NYSE Euronext and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) announced that FINRA would assume responsibility for performing the market surveillance and enforcement functions originally conducted by NYSE Regulation. The agreement was subject to review by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and was completed in June 2010.[30]
Under the announced agreement, FINRA assumed regulatory functions for NYSE Euronext's U.S. equities and options markets – the New York Stock Exchange, NYSE Arca, and NYSE Amex. NYSE Euronext, through its subsidiary NYSE Regulation, remains ultimately responsible for overseeing FINRA's performance of regulatory services for the NYSE markets.[30]
Libor administration[edit]
In early 2014, NYSE Euronext took over the administration of the London interbank offered rate from the British Bankers Association.[31] The new administrator is NYSE Euronext Rates Administration Limited,[32] a London-based, UK registered company, regulated by the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority.[33]
Global marketing and branding[edit]
NYSE Euronext maintains an active marketing campaign, both for its own brand, as well as for its listed companies. The Global Marketing and Branding department is responsible for the full spectrum of NYSE Euronext's brand marketing, including advertising, marketing communications, event management, and market research.[34]
Through the NYSE Global Partnership Program, NYSE Euronext has created a series of strategic resources to support its listed companies' growth initiatives, so as to act as a conduit that enables them to reach new and important audiences.[35] NYSE Euronext's 8,000 listed issues provide members with an extensive network of global investors and business leaders with which to interact. The company offers opportunities for co-branded advertising, linking listed companies to one another, as well as to the powerful brand that is NYSE Euronext.[36]
Events[edit]
The Events department of NYSE Euronext is responsible for coordinating bell ceremonies, receptions, conferences, and street events. Beginning in 2010, the NYSE Euronext opened its doors to non-listed companies to utilize NYSE facilities for after-hours events.
Opening and closing ceremonies[edit]
The opening and closing bell ceremonies hosted by the NYSE date back to 1903, taking place Monday through Friday at 9:30 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. respectively in New York City.
The opportunity to ring the bell at the New York Stock Exchange has long been considered an honor. Representatives from listed companies, especially newly listed companies and IPOs, celebrities, politicians, and other dignitaries have become fixtures at the bell podium. Bell ceremonies are seen by millions, and are the most widely watched TV events each day.
The bell tradition has been extended to the branches in Paris, Brussels, and Lisbon. In Amsterdam, the opening bell was replaced by a gong, which is sounded the signal the beginning and end of the trading day. In the European offices, the opening and closing ceremonies take place at 9:00 a.m. and 5:30 p.m., respectively.[37]
Experience Square[edit]
The Broad Street area in front of the Exchange is known as Experience Square,[citation needed] where listed companies are able to market themselves and their products directly to the thousands of visitors to New York's Financial District each day. The façade of the exchange is often used as a billboard to showcase branding and new listings.[citation needed]

Mergers and acquisitions[edit]
NYSE and Archipelago Holdings[edit]
The merger between NYSE and Archipelago Holdings was initially approved in 2005 by a 95% majority of voting NYSE members.[8] The acquisition of Archipelago, which held possession of highly regarded market technology at the time, was intended to bring automated trading to NYSE markets (which had previously utilized an "open outcry" system) and increase efficiency.
For the first time in its 213-year history, the New York Stock Exchange became a for-profit company, and began trading publicly on its own stock exchange under the NYX ticker.[9] Owners of the 1,366 NYSE seats received 80,177 shares of NYSE Group stock plus $300,000 in cash and $70,571 in dividends for each seat.[10] The completion of this deal created two new branches of the NYSE Group: NYSE Arca and NYSE Arca Europe, which launched after the acquisition of Euronext.
NYSE Group and Euronext merger April 4, 2007[edit]
In April 2006, NYSE Group and Euronext signed a merger agreement, subject to shareholder vote and regulatory approval.[11] Euronext shareholders gave approval to the transaction on December 19, 2006, and shareholders from the NYSE Group followed suit one day later.[12] In April 2007 the Euronext shareholders tendering shares can receive NYSE shares and cash amounting to $11,141 million from NYSE Euronext for their assets.[13] About 94% of the 112,557,259 shares are tendered in the first round.[14]
The NYSE Group and Euronext merger on April 4, 2007, signaled the creation of the world's largest and most liquid exchange group—NYSE Euronext.[15]
NYSE Euronext and NYFIX[edit]
NYSE Euronext, through its wholly owned subsidiary NYSE Technologies, Inc. acquired NYFIX, Inc. (Nasdaq: NYFX) for $144 million in November 2009. NYFIX is a provider of solutions that optimize trading efficiency. NYSE Euronext incorporated NYFIX's trading software into the company's package of offerings to customers.[16]
Attempted merger between NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse[edit]
In 2011, Bloomberg reported that the German exchange operator Deutsche Börse was in advanced talks to buy NYSE Euronext for $9.53 billion in a deal that would create the world's largest trading powerhouse.[17] The shares of both companies were temporarily frozen on the news due to the risk of large price movements and clarifications of the deal. A successful deal would see the new company becoming the world's largest stock exchange operator with a market capitalization of listed companies equal to $15 trillion.[18]
The proposed group would have dual headquarters, in Deutsche Boerse's newly built green tower near Frankfurt, Germany, and in New York City at 11 Wall Street. It would be led by a board with seventeen members—fifteen directors plus the Chairman and the CEO. Of the fifteen directors, nine to be designated by Deutsche Boerse and six by NYSE Euronext. Current NYSE Euronext CEO Duncan Niederauer would assume the same role with the newly founded company and would lead an Executive Committee with an equal number of current Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext executives.[19]
On July 7, 2011, NYSE Euronext shareholders voted in favor of the merger, and on July 13, 2011, Deutsche Boerse shareholders approved the deal as well. These decisions move the two sides closer to completing the transaction, which must still pass through forty separate regulatory approval processes to be finalized.[20]
The merger was subject to review in both the United States and with the European Union (EU) for concerns it could create a “de facto monopoly”.
In October 2011, CEO Niederauer said the company had received the EU's so-called statement of objections, which was more than 100 pages long, and would be responding within two weeks, possibly by asking for the opportunity for an oral hearing with the regulators. The EU examination of the proposal formally began June 29 has said its expanded probe has a Dec. 13 deadline. In March, Joaquin Almunia, the EU's antitrust commissioner, expressed concern that the deal would maybe monopolize the derivatives market due to Deutsche Boerse's “vertical silo” which routes all trade clearing through its own services. Almunia said then he preferred a “more open business model” for markets.[21]
On December 22, 2011, Deutsche Boerse won U.S. antitrust approval to buy NYSE Euronext, on condition that a Deutsche Boerse subsidiary, the International Securities Exchange, divest its 31.5 percent interest in Direct Edge.[22] NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Boerse AG delayed the deadline for completing their merger until March 31, 2012 so the exchange operators could try to persuade European regulators to approve the deal.[23]
On February 1, 2012, the European Union blocked the planned merger between NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Boerse. The European Commission—the EU's executive body—ruled against the merger because, they said, the combined exchange would control more than 90% of the trade in European derivatives. The European Commission report stated, "The merger between Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext would have led to a near-monopoly in European financial derivatives worldwide... These markets are at the heart of the financial system and it is crucial for the whole European economy that they remain competitive".[24]
On February 2, 2012, the NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse agreed with strong opposition by the EU for the planned merger, to scrap the merger.[25]
IntercontinentalExchange acquisition of NYSE Euronext[edit]
On December 20, 2012, the boards of directors of both IntercontinentalExchange (ICE) and the NYSE Euronext approved an $8 billion acquisition of NYSE Euronext. Under the terms shareholders of NYSE would receive either $33.12 in cash for each share or .2581 IntercontinentalExchange Inc. shares, or a combination of $11.27 in cash per share plus .1703 shares of stock.[26] The acquisition is subject to regulator approval, though since the operations of ICE and NYSE have little in common—ICE is largely devoted to trading commodities, as opposed to NYSE's business of trading stocks and securities—the deal is not expected to be blocked.[27] ICE said that after the deal closed it would sell the Euronext portion of the company, including stock exchanges in Amsterdam, Brussels, Lisbon and Paris.[28] The deal went through and Euronext is a sister division to NYSE and part of IntercontinentalExchange. ICE CEO Jeffrey C. Sprecher would continue in that position at the combined company, while NYSE CEO Duncan Niederauer would serve as president.[27] The future of the New York Stock Exchange's historic trading floor under ICE has not been announced. ICE closed the high profile and historic trading floors of its other earlier acquisitions—the International Petroleum Exchange and the New York Board of Trade in New York.[29]
Company structure[edit]
Derivatives[edit]
The Derivatives segment consists of NYSE Euronext's derivatives trading and clearing businesses. This includes NYSE Liffe, NYSE Liffe Clearing, NYSE Liffe US, NYSE Amex Options, NYSE Arca Option, and related derivatives market data.[30]
NYSE Liffe[edit]
NYSE Liffe comprises the derivatives market operated by LIFFE Administration and Management, Euronext Amsterdam, Euronext Brussels, Euronext Lisbon, and Euronext Paris. It offers customers the advantages of one of the most technologically advanced derivatives trading platforms as well as one of the widest choices of products of any derivatives market.[30]
Through a single electronic trading platform, NYSE Liffe offers customers access to a wide range of interest-rate, equity, index, commodity and currency derivative products. This platform has been designed to handle significant order flows and transaction volumes. Orders can be matched either on a price/time or pro rata basis, configurable by contract, with transacted prices and volumes and the aggregate size of all bids and offers at each price level updated on a real-time basis. Users can continually notified of all active orders in the central order book, making market depth easy to monitor.[30]
NYSE Liffe also offers its customers the Bclear and Cscreen services, which bridge the listed and over-the-counter (OTC) markets. This provides a simple and cost-effective way to register and process wholesale derivatives trades through NYSE Liffe to clearing at NYSE Liffe Clearing. Following the launch of NYSE Liffe Clearing, NYSE Liffe assumed full responsibility for clearing activities on its own London market.[30]
NYSE Liffe US, NYSE Euronext's U.S. futures exchange, makes available for trading full- and mini-sized gold and silver futures, options on full-sized gold and silver futures and futures on Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) Indices. A significant minority equity stake in NYSE Liffe US is held by six external investors: Citadel Securities, DRW Investments, Getco, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and UBS. Under this ownership structure, NYSE Euronext remains the largest shareholder in the entity and consolidates its financial reporting. NYSE Euronext manages the day-to-day operations of NYSE Liffe US, which operates under the supervision of a separate board of directors.[30]
NYSE Amex Options[edit]
The NYSE Amex Options business uses a hybrid model combining both auction-based and electronic trading capabilities that is designed to provide a stable, liquid and less volatile market. This feature provides the opportunity for price and/or size improvement.[30]
In 2010, NYSE Euronext announced the sale of a significant equity interest in NYSE Amex Options to seven external investors: Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Barclays Capital, Citadel Securities, Citi, Goldman Sachs, TD Ameritrade, and UBS. Under the framework, NYSE Euronext remains the largest shareholder in the entity and manages the day-to-day operations of NYSE Amex Options, which operates under the supervision of a separate board of directors and chief executive officer. NYSE Euronext consolidates this entity for financial reporting purposes.[30]
NYSE Arca Options[edit]
NYSE Arca Options, the other of NYSE Euronext's two U.S. options exchanges, offers immediate, cost-effective electronic order execution in nearly two thousand options issues. The NYSE Arca Options business uses a technology platform and market structure designed to enhance the speed and quality of trade execution for its customers, as well as to attract additional sources of liquidity. Its structure allows market makers to access its markets remotely and integrates floor-based participants as well.[30]
Cash Trading and Listings[edit]
The Cash Trading and Listings segment includes the New York Stock Exchange, Euronext, NYSE Amex, NYSE Arca, NYSE Alternext, NYSE Arca Europe, SmartPool, BlueNext, and NYSE Blue, as well as related cash trading market data.[30]
New York Stock Exchange[edit]
The New York Stock Exchange is registered as a national securities exchange under the Exchange Act. In addition to common stock, preferred stock and warrants, the NYSE lists debt and corporate structured products, such as capital securities, mandatory convertibles, and repackaged securities.[30]
Euronext[edit]
Euronext is the first integrated cross-border exchange, combining the stock exchanges of Amsterdam, Paris, Brussels and Lisbon into a single market. Issuers who meet European Union regulatory standards are qualified for listing on the regulated markets operated by Euronext. The company's exchanges list a wide variety of securities, including domestic and international equity securities, convertible bonds, warrants, trackers and debt securities, including corporate and government bonds.[30]
All of Euronext's markets are operated by its subsidiaries, each of which holds a national license as an exchange operator.[30]
NYSE Amex[edit]
NYSE Euronext completed its acquisition of the Amex (American Stock Exchange) on October 1, 2008. The transaction extended NYSE Euronext's leadership in U.S. option, cash equities, and exchange-traded funds (ETFs), making it the third largest U.S. equity options marketplace based on number of contracts traded. Since the merger, Amex has been integrated into the company, with former Amex listings now trading directly on the NYSE, and has begun trading certain Nasdaq-listed securities.[30]
NYSE Arca is the first electronic market to offer listed ETP issuers a Lead Market Maker program, which encourages liquidity provision that contributes to the best prices and depth in the ETP marketplace. It is registered as a national securities exchange under the Exchange Act.[30]
NYSE Alternext[edit]
NYSE Alternext was created by NYSE Euronext to meet the needs of small and mid-sized companies seeking simplified access to the stock market. Its streamlined listing requirements and trading rules are suited to the size and business needs of such firms. The rules also ensure investor transparency. NYSE Alternext's special listing procedures, unique market model, and listings of sponsor companies for members are its most notable features.[30]
NYSE Alternext is an exchange-regulated market with a lighter regulatory regime. It is not a regulated market as defined by the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID), but rather is regulated by NYSE Euronext through a body of rules applicable to intermediaries and listed companies.[30]
NYSE Arca Europe[edit]
NYSE Arca Europe is a pan-European multilateral trading facility (MTF) that extends the trading scope of Euronext's regulated markets by adding blue-chip stocks from 14 European countries: Austria, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. Arca Europe integrates this trading facility with the other business components of the company, giving customers the flexibility in trading of an MTF while maintaining the global market reach of NYSE Euronext.[30]
SmartPool[edit]
SmartPool Trading Limited is a UK-registered company supplying an MTF approved by the Financial Services Authority (FSA). It provides an exchange-led dark pool for the execution of block orders covering 15 different European markets, with a full central counter party back-end solution through LCH.Clearnet and EuroCCP. SmartPool was created by NYSE Euronext in partnership with BNP Paribas, HSBC, and J.P. Morgan Chase.[30]
BlueNext and NYSE Blue[edit]
NYSE Euronext holds a 60% interest in BlueNext with the remaining 40% held by CDC Climat. BlueNext operates a spot market in carbon dioxide emission allowances and credits that is the European leader in the field. It seeks to establish a leading position in trading in environment-related instruments, and has also launched a futures market with physical delivery of allowances and credits.[30]
In September 2010, NYSE Euronext announced plans to create NYSE Blue, a new global company that will focus on environmental and sustainable energy markets. NYSE Euronext contributed its ownership in BlueNext in return for a majority interest in NYSE Blue, and APX, Inc. (a leading provider of regulatory infrastructure and services for environmental and sustainable energy markets) will contribute its business in return for a minority interest in the venture. The transaction closed on February 18, 2011.[30]
Information Services and Technology Solutions[edit]
The Information Services and Technology Solutions segment refers to NYSE Euronext's commercial technology transactions, data, and infrastructure businesses. NYSE Euronext operates NYSE Technologies, Free Market, and also owns NYFIX, Inc., a leading provider of innovative solutions that optimize trading efficiency.[30]
NYSE Technologies[edit]
NYSE Technologies is the commercial technology division of NYSE Euronext. Launched in January 2009, it provides data and infrastructure services, comprehensive transaction, and managed solutions for buy-side, sell-side, and exchange communities that require next-generation performance and expertise. NYSE Technologies' advanced integrated solutions power the trading operations of global financial institutions and exchanges, including non-NYSE Euronext markets in addition to all the exchanges in the NYSE Euronext group.[30]
NYSE Technologies operates five business:

Global Market Data offers a broad array of global market information products covering multiple asset classes;
Trading Solutions creates and implements high performance, end-to-end messaging software, real-time market data distribution and integration products;
Exchange Solutions provides multi-asset exchange platform services, managed services and expert consultancy;
Global Connectivity offers one of the world's largest, most reliable financial transaction networks connecting firms and exchanges worldwide;
Transactions primarily comprises the former NYFIX FIX business and incorporates the NYFIX Marketplace and the FIX Software business.

Marché Libre[edit]
The Free Markets of Brussels and Paris, organized by NYSE Euronext, are not regulated markets in the sense of the EU Directive. The criteria for admission to these markets are much simpler, and listing costs are low. They provide a channel for disseminating buy and sell orders, with trades executed by NYSE Euronext member firms. The securities traded on these markets have not gone through any admission procedures and issuers are not subject to any disclosure requirements. The Free Markets serve companies that are too young or too small to be listed on one of the regulated compartments of NYSE Euronext.[30]
NYSE Regulation and FINRA[edit]
On May 4, 2010, NYSE Euronext and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) announced that FINRA would assume responsibility for performing the market surveillance and enforcement functions originally conducted by NYSE Regulation. The agreement was subject to review by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and was completed in June 2010.[30]
Under the announced agreement, FINRA assumed regulatory functions for NYSE Euronext's U.S. equities and options markets – the New York Stock Exchange, NYSE Arca, and NYSE Amex. NYSE Euronext, through its subsidiary NYSE Regulation, remains ultimately responsible for overseeing FINRA's performance of regulatory services for the NYSE markets.[30]
Libor administration[edit]
In early 2014, NYSE Euronext took over the administration of the London interbank offered rate from the British Bankers Association.[31] The new administrator is NYSE Euronext Rates Administration Limited,[32] a London-based, UK registered company, regulated by the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority.[33]
Global marketing and branding[edit]
NYSE Euronext maintains an active marketing campaign, both for its own brand, as well as for its listed companies. The Global Marketing and Branding department is responsible for the full spectrum of NYSE Euronext's brand marketing, including advertising, marketing communications, event management, and market research.[34]
Through the NYSE Global Partnership Program, NYSE Euronext has created a series of strategic resources to support its listed companies' growth initiatives, so as to act as a conduit that enables them to reach new and important audiences.[35] NYSE Euronext's 8,000 listed issues provide members with an extensive network of global investors and business leaders with which to interact. The company offers opportunities for co-branded advertising, linking listed companies to one another, as well as to the powerful brand that is NYSE Euronext.[36]
Events[edit]
The Events department of NYSE Euronext is responsible for coordinating bell ceremonies, receptions, conferences, and street events. Beginning in 2010, the NYSE Euronext opened its doors to non-listed companies to utilize NYSE facilities for after-hours events.
Opening and closing ceremonies[edit]
The opening and closing bell ceremonies hosted by the NYSE date back to 1903, taking place Monday through Friday at 9:30 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. respectively in New York City.
The opportunity to ring the bell at the New York Stock Exchange has long been considered an honor. Representatives from listed companies, especially newly listed companies and IPOs, celebrities, politicians, and other dignitaries have become fixtures at the bell podium. Bell ceremonies are seen by millions, and are the most widely watched TV events each day.
The bell tradition has been extended to the branches in Paris, Brussels, and Lisbon. In Amsterdam, the opening bell was replaced by a gong, which is sounded the signal the beginning and end of the trading day. In the European offices, the opening and closing ceremonies take place at 9:00 a.m. and 5:30 p.m., respectively.[37]
Experience Square[edit]
The Broad Street area in front of the Exchange is known as Experience Square,[citation needed] where listed companies are able to market themselves and their products directly to the thousands of visitors to New York's Financial District each day. The façade of the exchange is often used as a billboard to showcase branding and new listings.[citation needed]
NYSE Magazine[edit]
NYSE Magazine is NYSE Euronext's quarterly publication. It provides insights into the world’s best companies, giving readers a close-up look at the distinguished leaders who constitute the Exchange community. Written for a sophisticated audience of CEOs and other senior global executives, each issue centers on what makes companies succeed. Designed to foster a sense of community among the NYSE’s key constituents, NYSE magazine has grown to become a strategic tool for business leaders that delivers opinions, strategies and insights from their peers.

Mergers and acquisitions[edit]
NYSE and Archipelago Holdings[edit]
The merger between NYSE and Archipelago Holdings was initially approved in 2005 by a 95% majority of voting NYSE members.[8] The acquisition of Archipelago, which held possession of highly regarded market technology at the time, was intended to bring automated trading to NYSE markets (which had previously utilized an "open outcry" system) and increase efficiency.
For the first time in its 213-year history, the New York Stock Exchange became a for-profit company, and began trading publicly on its own stock exchange under the NYX ticker.[9] Owners of the 1,366 NYSE seats received 80,177 shares of NYSE Group stock plus $300,000 in cash and $70,571 in dividends for each seat.[10] The completion of this deal created two new branches of the NYSE Group: NYSE Arca and NYSE Arca Europe, which launched after the acquisition of Euronext.
NYSE Group and Euronext merger April 4, 2007[edit]
In April 2006, NYSE Group and Euronext signed a merger agreement, subject to shareholder vote and regulatory approval.[11] Euronext shareholders gave approval to the transaction on December 19, 2006, and shareholders from the NYSE Group followed suit one day later.[12] In April 2007 the Euronext shareholders tendering shares can receive NYSE shares and cash amounting to $11,141 million from NYSE Euronext for their assets.[13] About 94% of the 112,557,259 shares are tendered in the first round.[14]
The NYSE Group and Euronext merger on April 4, 2007, signaled the creation of the world's largest and most liquid exchange group—NYSE Euronext.[15]
NYSE Euronext and NYFIX[edit]
NYSE Euronext, through its wholly owned subsidiary NYSE Technologies, Inc. acquired NYFIX, Inc. (Nasdaq: NYFX) for $144 million in November 2009. NYFIX is a provider of solutions that optimize trading efficiency. NYSE Euronext incorporated NYFIX's trading software into the company's package of offerings to customers.[16]
Attempted merger between NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse[edit]
In 2011, Bloomberg reported that the German exchange operator Deutsche Börse was in advanced talks to buy NYSE Euronext for $9.53 billion in a deal that would create the world's largest trading powerhouse.[17] The shares of both companies were temporarily frozen on the news due to the risk of large price movements and clarifications of the deal. A successful deal would see the new company becoming the world's largest stock exchange operator with a market capitalization of listed companies equal to $15 trillion.[18]
The proposed group would have dual headquarters, in Deutsche Boerse's newly built green tower near Frankfurt, Germany, and in New York City at 11 Wall Street. It would be led by a board with seventeen members—fifteen directors plus the Chairman and the CEO. Of the fifteen directors, nine to be designated by Deutsche Boerse and six by NYSE Euronext. Current NYSE Euronext CEO Duncan Niederauer would assume the same role with the newly founded company and would lead an Executive Committee with an equal number of current Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext executives.[19]
On July 7, 2011, NYSE Euronext shareholders voted in favor of the merger, and on July 13, 2011, Deutsche Boerse shareholders approved the deal as well. These decisions move the two sides closer to completing the transaction, which must still pass through forty separate regulatory approval processes to be finalized.[20]
The merger was subject to review in both the United States and with the European Union (EU) for concerns it could create a “de facto monopoly”.
In October 2011, CEO Niederauer said the company had received the EU's so-called statement of objections, which was more than 100 pages long, and would be responding within two weeks, possibly by asking for the opportunity for an oral hearing with the regulators. The EU examination of the proposal formally began June 29 has said its expanded probe has a Dec. 13 deadline. In March, Joaquin Almunia, the EU's antitrust commissioner, expressed concern that the deal would maybe monopolize the derivatives market due to Deutsche Boerse's “vertical silo” which routes all trade clearing through its own services. Almunia said then he preferred a “more open business model” for markets.[21]
On December 22, 2011, Deutsche Boerse won U.S. antitrust approval to buy NYSE Euronext, on condition that a Deutsche Boerse subsidiary, the International Securities Exchange, divest its 31.5 percent interest in Direct Edge.[22] NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Boerse AG delayed the deadline for completing their merger until March 31, 2012 so the exchange operators could try to persuade European regulators to approve the deal.[23]
On February 1, 2012, the European Union blocked the planned merger between NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Boerse. The European Commission—the EU's executive body—ruled against the merger because, they said, the combined exchange would control more than 90% of the trade in European derivatives. The European Commission report stated, "The merger between Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext would have led to a near-monopoly in European financial derivatives worldwide... These markets are at the heart of the financial system and it is crucial for the whole European economy that they remain competitive".[24]
On February 2, 2012, the NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse agreed with strong opposition by the EU for the planned merger, to scrap the merger.[25]
IntercontinentalExchange acquisition of NYSE Euronext[edit]
On December 20, 2012, the boards of directors of both IntercontinentalExchange (ICE) and the NYSE Euronext approved an $8 billion acquisition of NYSE Euronext. Under the terms shareholders of NYSE would receive either $33.12 in cash for each share or .2581 IntercontinentalExchange Inc. shares, or a combination of $11.27 in cash per share plus .1703 shares of stock.[26] The acquisition is subject to regulator approval, though since the operations of ICE and NYSE have little in common—ICE is largely devoted to trading commodities, as opposed to NYSE's business of trading stocks and securities—the deal is not expected to be blocked.[27] ICE said that after the deal closed it would sell the Euronext portion of the company, including stock exchanges in Amsterdam, Brussels, Lisbon and Paris.[28] The deal went through and Euronext is a sister division to NYSE and part of IntercontinentalExchange. ICE CEO Jeffrey C. Sprecher would continue in that position at the combined company, while NYSE CEO Duncan Niederauer would serve as president.[27] The future of the New York Stock Exchange's historic trading floor under ICE has not been announced. ICE closed the high profile and historic trading floors of its other earlier acquisitions—the International Petroleum Exchange and the New York Board of Trade in New York.[29]
Company structure[edit]
Derivatives[edit]
The Derivatives segment consists of NYSE Euronext's derivatives trading and clearing businesses. This includes NYSE Liffe, NYSE Liffe Clearing, NYSE Liffe US, NYSE Amex Options, NYSE Arca Option, and related derivatives market data.[30]
NYSE Liffe[edit]
NYSE Liffe comprises the derivatives market operated by LIFFE Administration and Management, Euronext Amsterdam, Euronext Brussels, Euronext Lisbon, and Euronext Paris. It offers customers the advantages of one of the most technologically advanced derivatives trading platforms as well as one of the widest choices of products of any derivatives market.[30]
Through a single electronic trading platform, NYSE Liffe offers customers access to a wide range of interest-rate, equity, index, commodity and currency derivative products. This platform has been designed to handle significant order flows and transaction volumes. Orders can be matched either on a price/time or pro rata basis, configurable by contract, with transacted prices and volumes and the aggregate size of all bids and offers at each price level updated on a real-time basis. Users can continually notified of all active orders in the central order book, making market depth easy to monitor.[30]
NYSE Liffe also offers its customers the Bclear and Cscreen services, which bridge the listed and over-the-counter (OTC) markets. This provides a simple and cost-effective way to register and process wholesale derivatives trades through NYSE Liffe to clearing at NYSE Liffe Clearing. Following the launch of NYSE Liffe Clearing, NYSE Liffe assumed full responsibility for clearing activities on its own London market.[30]
NYSE Liffe US, NYSE Euronext's U.S. futures exchange, makes available for trading full- and mini-sized gold and silver futures, options on full-sized gold and silver futures and futures on Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) Indices. A significant minority equity stake in NYSE Liffe US is held by six external investors: Citadel Securities, DRW Investments, Getco, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and UBS. Under this ownership structure, NYSE Euronext remains the largest shareholder in the entity and consolidates its financial reporting. NYSE Euronext manages the day-to-day operations of NYSE Liffe US, which operates under the supervision of a separate board of directors.[30]
NYSE Amex Options[edit]
The NYSE Amex Options business uses a hybrid model combining both auction-based and electronic trading capabilities that is designed to provide a stable, liquid and less volatile market. This feature provides the opportunity for price and/or size improvement.[30]
In 2010, NYSE Euronext announced the sale of a significant equity interest in NYSE Amex Options to seven external investors: Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Barclays Capital, Citadel Securities, Citi, Goldman Sachs, TD Ameritrade, and UBS. Under the framework, NYSE Euronext remains the largest shareholder in the entity and manages the day-to-day operations of NYSE Amex Options, which operates under the supervision of a separate board of directors and chief executive officer. NYSE Euronext consolidates this entity for financial reporting purposes.[30]
NYSE Arca Options[edit]
NYSE Arca Options, the other of NYSE Euronext's two U.S. options exchanges, offers immediate, cost-effective electronic order execution in nearly two thousand options issues. The NYSE Arca Options business uses a technology platform and market structure designed to enhance the speed and quality of trade execution for its customers, as well as to attract additional sources of liquidity. Its structure allows market makers to access its markets remotely and integrates floor-based participants as well.[30]
Cash Trading and Listings[edit]
The Cash Trading and Listings segment includes the New York Stock Exchange, Euronext, NYSE Amex, NYSE Arca, NYSE Alternext, NYSE Arca Europe, SmartPool, BlueNext, and NYSE Blue, as well as related cash trading market data.[30]
New York Stock Exchange[edit]
The New York Stock Exchange is registered as a national securities exchange under the Exchange Act. In addition to common stock, preferred stock and warrants, the NYSE lists debt and corporate structured products, such as capital securities, mandatory convertibles, and repackaged securities.[30]
Euronext[edit]
Euronext is the first integrated cross-border exchange, combining the stock exchanges of Amsterdam, Paris, Brussels and Lisbon into a single market. Issuers who meet European Union regulatory standards are qualified for listing on the regulated markets operated by Euronext. The company's exchanges list a wide variety of securities, including domestic and international equity securities, convertible bonds, warrants, trackers and debt securities, including corporate and government bonds.[30]
All of Euronext's markets are operated by its subsidiaries, each of which holds a national license as an exchange operator.[30]
NYSE Amex[edit]
NYSE Euronext completed its acquisition of the Amex (American Stock Exchange) on October 1, 2008. The transaction extended NYSE Euronext's leadership in U.S. option, cash equities, and exchange-traded funds (ETFs), making it the third largest U.S. equity options marketplace based on number of contracts traded. Since the merger, Amex has been integrated into the company, with former Amex listings now trading directly on the NYSE, and has begun trading certain Nasdaq-listed securities.[30]
NYSE Arca is the first electronic market to offer listed ETP issuers a Lead Market Maker program, which encourages liquidity provision that contributes to the best prices and depth in the ETP marketplace. It is registered as a national securities exchange under the Exchange Act.[30]
NYSE Alternext[edit]
NYSE Alternext was created by NYSE Euronext to meet the needs of small and mid-sized companies seeking simplified access to the stock market. Its streamlined listing requirements and trading rules are suited to the size and business needs of such firms. The rules also ensure investor transparency. NYSE Alternext's special listing procedures, unique market model, and listings of sponsor companies for members are its most notable features.[30]
NYSE Alternext is an exchange-regulated market with a lighter regulatory regime. It is not a regulated market as defined by the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID), but rather is regulated by NYSE Euronext through a body of rules applicable to intermediaries and listed companies.[30]
NYSE Arca Europe[edit]
NYSE Arca Europe is a pan-European multilateral trading facility (MTF) that extends the trading scope of Euronext's regulated markets by adding blue-chip stocks from 14 European countries: Austria, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. Arca Europe integrates this trading facility with the other business components of the company, giving customers the flexibility in trading of an MTF while maintaining the global market reach of NYSE Euronext.[30]
SmartPool[edit]
SmartPool Trading Limited is a UK-registered company supplying an MTF approved by the Financial Services Authority (FSA). It provides an exchange-led dark pool for the execution of block orders covering 15 different European markets, with a full central counter party back-end solution through LCH.Clearnet and EuroCCP. SmartPool was created by NYSE Euronext in partnership with BNP Paribas, HSBC, and J.P. Morgan Chase.[30]
BlueNext and NYSE Blue[edit]
NYSE Euronext holds a 60% interest in BlueNext with the remaining 40% held by CDC Climat. BlueNext operates a spot market in carbon dioxide emission allowances and credits that is the European leader in the field. It seeks to establish a leading position in trading in environment-related instruments, and has also launched a futures market with physical delivery of allowances and credits.[30]
In September 2010, NYSE Euronext announced plans to create NYSE Blue, a new global company that will focus on environmental and sustainable energy markets. NYSE Euronext contributed its ownership in BlueNext in return for a majority interest in NYSE Blue, and APX, Inc. (a leading provider of regulatory infrastructure and services for environmental and sustainable energy markets) will contribute its business in return for a minority interest in the venture. The transaction closed on February 18, 2011.[30]
Information Services and Technology Solutions[edit]
The Information Services and Technology Solutions segment refers to NYSE Euronext's commercial technology transactions, data, and infrastructure businesses. NYSE Euronext operates NYSE Technologies, Free Market, and also owns NYFIX, Inc., a leading provider of innovative solutions that optimize trading efficiency.[30]
NYSE Technologies[edit]
NYSE Technologies is the commercial technology division of NYSE Euronext. Launched in January 2009, it provides data and infrastructure services, comprehensive transaction, and managed solutions for buy-side, sell-side, and exchange communities that require next-generation performance and expertise. NYSE Technologies' advanced integrated solutions power the trading operations of global financial institutions and exchanges, including non-NYSE Euronext markets in addition to all the exchanges in the NYSE Euronext group.[30]
NYSE Technologies operates five business:

Global Market Data offers a broad array of global market information products covering multiple asset classes;
Trading Solutions creates and implements high performance, end-to-end messaging software, real-time market data distribution and integration products;
Exchange Solutions provides multi-asset exchange platform services, managed services and expert consultancy;
Global Connectivity offers one of the world's largest, most reliable financial transaction networks connecting firms and exchanges worldwide;
Transactions primarily comprises the former NYFIX FIX business and incorporates the NYFIX Marketplace and the FIX Software business.

Marché Libre[edit]
The Free Markets of Brussels and Paris, organized by NYSE Euronext, are not regulated markets in the sense of the EU Directive. The criteria for admission to these markets are much simpler, and listing costs are low. They provide a channel for disseminating buy and sell orders, with trades executed by NYSE Euronext member firms. The securities traded on these markets have not gone through any admission procedures and issuers are not subject to any disclosure requirements. The Free Markets serve companies that are too young or too small to be listed on one of the regulated compartments of NYSE Euronext.[30]
NYSE Regulation and FINRA[edit]
On May 4, 2010, NYSE Euronext and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) announced that FINRA would assume responsibility for performing the market surveillance and enforcement functions originally conducted by NYSE Regulation. The agreement was subject to review by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and was completed in June 2010.[30]
Under the announced agreement, FINRA assumed regulatory functions for NYSE Euronext's U.S. equities and options markets – the New York Stock Exchange, NYSE Arca, and NYSE Amex. NYSE Euronext, through its subsidiary NYSE Regulation, remains ultimately responsible for overseeing FINRA's performance of regulatory services for the NYSE markets.[30]
Libor administration[edit]
In early 2014, NYSE Euronext took over the administration of the London interbank offered rate from the British Bankers Association.[31] The new administrator is NYSE Euronext Rates Administration Limited,[32] a London-based, UK registered company, regulated by the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority.[33]
Global marketing and branding[edit]
NYSE Euronext maintains an active marketing campaign, both for its own brand, as well as for its listed companies. The Global Marketing and Branding department is responsible for the full spectrum of NYSE Euronext's brand marketing, including advertising, marketing communications, event management, and market research.[34]
Through the NYSE Global Partnership Program, NYSE Euronext has created a series of strategic resources to support its listed companies' growth initiatives, so as to act as a conduit that enables them to reach new and important audiences.[35] NYSE Euronext's 8,000 listed issues provide members with an extensive network of global investors and business leaders with which to interact. The company offers opportunities for co-branded advertising, linking listed companies to one another, as well as to the powerful brand that is NYSE Euronext.[36]
Events[edit]
The Events department of NYSE Euronext is responsible for coordinating bell ceremonies, receptions, conferences, and street events. Beginning in 2010, the NYSE Euronext opened its doors to non-listed companies to utilize NYSE facilities for after-hours events.
Opening and closing ceremonies[edit]
The opening and closing bell ceremonies hosted by the NYSE date back to 1903, taking place Monday through Friday at 9:30 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. respectively in New York City.
The opportunity to ring the bell at the New York Stock Exchange has long been considered an honor. Representatives from listed companies, especially newly listed companies and IPOs, celebrities, politicians, and other dignitaries have become fixtures at the bell podium. Bell ceremonies are seen by millions, and are the most widely watched TV events each day.
The bell tradition has been extended to the branches in Paris, Brussels, and Lisbon. In Amsterdam, the opening bell was replaced by a gong, which is sounded the signal the beginning and end of the trading day. In the European offices, the opening and closing ceremonies take place at 9:00 a.m. and 5:30 p.m., respectively.[37]
Experience Square[edit]
The Broad Street area in front of the Exchange is known as Experience Square,[citation needed] where listed companies are able to market themselves and their products directly to the thousands of visitors to New York's Financial District each day. The façade of the exchange is often used as a billboard to showcase branding and new listings.[citation needed]
NYSE Magazine[edit]
NYSE Magazine is NYSE Euronext's quarterly publication. It provides insights into the world’s best companies, giving readers a close-up look at the distinguished leaders who constitute the Exchange community. Written for a sophisticated audience of CEOs and other senior global executives, each issue centers on what makes companies succeed. Designed to foster a sense of community among the NYSE’s key constituents, NYSE magazine has grown to become a strategic tool for business leaders that delivers opinions, strategies and insights from their peers.

Mergers and acquisitions[edit]
NYSE and Archipelago Holdings[edit]
The merger between NYSE and Archipelago Holdings was initially approved in 2005 by a 95% majority of voting NYSE members.[8] The acquisition of Archipelago, which held possession of highly regarded market technology at the time, was intended to bring automated trading to NYSE markets (which had previously utilized an "open outcry" system) and increase efficiency.
For the first time in its 213-year history, the New York Stock Exchange became a for-profit company, and began trading publicly on its own stock exchange under the NYX ticker.[9] Owners of the 1,366 NYSE seats received 80,177 shares of NYSE Group stock plus $300,000 in cash and $70,571 in dividends for each seat.[10] The completion of this deal created two new branches of the NYSE Group: NYSE Arca and NYSE Arca Europe, which launched after the acquisition of Euronext.
NYSE Group and Euronext merger April 4, 2007[edit]
In April 2006, NYSE Group and Euronext signed a merger agreement, subject to shareholder vote and regulatory approval.[11] Euronext shareholders gave approval to the transaction on December 19, 2006, and shareholders from the NYSE Group followed suit one day later.[12] In April 2007 the Euronext shareholders tendering shares can receive NYSE shares and cash amounting to $11,141 million from NYSE Euronext for their assets.[13] About 94% of the 112,557,259 shares are tendered in the first round.[14]
The NYSE Group and Euronext merger on April 4, 2007, signaled the creation of the world's largest and most liquid exchange group—NYSE Euronext.[15]
NYSE Euronext and NYFIX[edit]
NYSE Euronext, through its wholly owned subsidiary NYSE Technologies, Inc. acquired NYFIX, Inc. (Nasdaq: NYFX) for $144 million in November 2009. NYFIX is a provider of solutions that optimize trading efficiency. NYSE Euronext incorporated NYFIX's trading software into the company's package of offerings to customers.[16]
Attempted merger between NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse[edit]
In 2011, Bloomberg reported that the German exchange operator Deutsche Börse was in advanced talks to buy NYSE Euronext for $9.53 billion in a deal that would create the world's largest trading powerhouse.[17] The shares of both companies were temporarily frozen on the news due to the risk of large price movements and clarifications of the deal. A successful deal would see the new company becoming the world's largest stock exchange operator with a market capitalization of listed companies equal to $15 trillion.[18]
The proposed group would have dual headquarters, in Deutsche Boerse's newly built green tower near Frankfurt, Germany, and in New York City at 11 Wall Street. It would be led by a board with seventeen members—fifteen directors plus the Chairman and the CEO. Of the fifteen directors, nine to be designated by Deutsche Boerse and six by NYSE Euronext. Current NYSE Euronext CEO Duncan Niederauer would assume the same role with the newly founded company and would lead an Executive Committee with an equal number of current Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext executives.[19]
On July 7, 2011, NYSE Euronext shareholders voted in favor of the merger, and on July 13, 2011, Deutsche Boerse shareholders approved the deal as well. These decisions move the two sides closer to completing the transaction, which must still pass through forty separate regulatory approval processes to be finalized.[20]
The merger was subject to review in both the United States and with the European Union (EU) for concerns it could create a “de facto monopoly”.
In October 2011, CEO Niederauer said the company had received the EU's so-called statement of objections, which was more than 100 pages long, and would be responding within two weeks, possibly by asking for the opportunity for an oral hearing with the regulators. The EU examination of the proposal formally began June 29 has said its expanded probe has a Dec. 13 deadline. In March, Joaquin Almunia, the EU's antitrust commissioner, expressed concern that the deal would maybe monopolize the derivatives market due to Deutsche Boerse's “vertical silo” which routes all trade clearing through its own services. Almunia said then he preferred a “more open business model” for markets.[21]
On December 22, 2011, Deutsche Boerse won U.S. antitrust approval to buy NYSE Euronext, on condition that a Deutsche Boerse subsidiary, the International Securities Exchange, divest its 31.5 percent interest in Direct Edge.[22] NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Boerse AG delayed the deadline for completing their merger until March 31, 2012 so the exchange operators could try to persuade European regulators to approve the deal.[23]
On February 1, 2012, the European Union blocked the planned merger between NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Boerse. The European Commission—the EU's executive body—ruled against the merger because, they said, the combined exchange would control more than 90% of the trade in European derivatives. The European Commission report stated, "The merger between Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext would have led to a near-monopoly in European financial derivatives worldwide... These markets are at the heart of the financial system and it is crucial for the whole European economy that they remain competitive".[24]
On February 2, 2012, the NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse agreed with strong opposition by the EU for the planned merger, to scrap the merger.[25]
IntercontinentalExchange acquisition of NYSE Euronext[edit]
On December 20, 2012, the boards of directors of both IntercontinentalExchange (ICE) and the NYSE Euronext approved an $8 billion acquisition of NYSE Euronext. Under the terms shareholders of NYSE would receive either $33.12 in cash for each share or .2581 IntercontinentalExchange Inc. shares, or a combination of $11.27 in cash per share plus .1703 shares of stock.[26] The acquisition is subject to regulator approval, though since the operations of ICE and NYSE have little in common—ICE is largely devoted to trading commodities, as opposed to NYSE's business of trading stocks and securities—the deal is not expected to be blocked.[27] ICE said that after the deal closed it would sell the Euronext portion of the company, including stock exchanges in Amsterdam, Brussels, Lisbon and Paris.[28] The deal went through and Euronext is a sister division to NYSE and part of IntercontinentalExchange. ICE CEO Jeffrey C. Sprecher would continue in that position at the combined company, while NYSE CEO Duncan Niederauer would serve as president.[27] The future of the New York Stock Exchange's historic trading floor under ICE has not been announced. ICE closed the high profile and historic trading floors of its other earlier acquisitions—the International Petroleum Exchange and the New York Board of Trade in New York.[29]
Company structure[edit]
Derivatives[edit]
The Derivatives segment consists of NYSE Euronext's derivatives trading and clearing businesses. This includes NYSE Liffe, NYSE Liffe Clearing, NYSE Liffe US, NYSE Amex Options, NYSE Arca Option, and related derivatives market data.[30]
NYSE Liffe[edit]
NYSE Liffe comprises the derivatives market operated by LIFFE Administration and Management, Euronext Amsterdam, Euronext Brussels, Euronext Lisbon, and Euronext Paris. It offers customers the advantages of one of the most technologically advanced derivatives trading platforms as well as one of the widest choices of products of any derivatives market.[30]
Through a single electronic trading platform, NYSE Liffe offers customers access to a wide range of interest-rate, equity, index, commodity and currency derivative products. This platform has been designed to handle significant order flows and transaction volumes. Orders can be matched either on a price/time or pro rata basis, configurable by contract, with transacted prices and volumes and the aggregate size of all bids and offers at each price level updated on a real-time basis. Users can continually notified of all active orders in the central order book, making market depth easy to monitor.[30]
NYSE Liffe also offers its customers the Bclear and Cscreen services, which bridge the listed and over-the-counter (OTC) markets. This provides a simple and cost-effective way to register and process wholesale derivatives trades through NYSE Liffe to clearing at NYSE Liffe Clearing. Following the launch of NYSE Liffe Clearing, NYSE Liffe assumed full responsibility for clearing activities on its own London market.[30]
NYSE Liffe US, NYSE Euronext's U.S. futures exchange, makes available for trading full- and mini-sized gold and silver futures, options on full-sized gold and silver futures and futures on Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) Indices. A significant minority equity stake in NYSE Liffe US is held by six external investors: Citadel Securities, DRW Investments, Getco, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and UBS. Under this ownership structure, NYSE Euronext remains the largest shareholder in the entity and consolidates its financial reporting. NYSE Euronext manages the day-to-day operations of NYSE Liffe US, which operates under the supervision of a separate board of directors.[30]
NYSE Amex Options[edit]
The NYSE Amex Options business uses a hybrid model combining both auction-based and electronic trading capabilities that is designed to provide a stable, liquid and less volatile market. This feature provides the opportunity for price and/or size improvement.[30]
In 2010, NYSE Euronext announced the sale of a significant equity interest in NYSE Amex Options to seven external investors: Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Barclays Capital, Citadel Securities, Citi, Goldman Sachs, TD Ameritrade, and UBS. Under the framework, NYSE Euronext remains the largest shareholder in the entity and manages the day-to-day operations of NYSE Amex Options, which operates under the supervision of a separate board of directors and chief executive officer. NYSE Euronext consolidates this entity for financial reporting purposes.[30]
NYSE Arca Options[edit]
NYSE Arca Options, the other of NYSE Euronext's two U.S. options exchanges, offers immediate, cost-effective electronic order execution in nearly two thousand options issues. The NYSE Arca Options business uses a technology platform and market structure designed to enhance the speed and quality of trade execution for its customers, as well as to attract additional sources of liquidity. Its structure allows market makers to access its markets remotely and integrates floor-based participants as well.[30]
Cash Trading and Listings[edit]
The Cash Trading and Listings segment includes the New York Stock Exchange, Euronext, NYSE Amex, NYSE Arca, NYSE Alternext, NYSE Arca Europe, SmartPool, BlueNext, and NYSE Blue, as well as related cash trading market data.[30]
New York Stock Exchange[edit]
The New York Stock Exchange is registered as a national securities exchange under the Exchange Act. In addition to common stock, preferred stock and warrants, the NYSE lists debt and corporate structured products, such as capital securities, mandatory convertibles, and repackaged securities.[30]
Euronext[edit]
Euronext is the first integrated cross-border exchange, combining the stock exchanges of Amsterdam, Paris, Brussels and Lisbon into a single market. Issuers who meet European Union regulatory standards are qualified for listing on the regulated markets operated by Euronext. The company's exchanges list a wide variety of securities, including domestic and international equity securities, convertible bonds, warrants, trackers and debt securities, including corporate and government bonds.[30]
All of Euronext's markets are operated by its subsidiaries, each of which holds a national license as an exchange operator.[30]
NYSE Amex[edit]
NYSE Euronext completed its acquisition of the Amex (American Stock Exchange) on October 1, 2008. The transaction extended NYSE Euronext's leadership in U.S. option, cash equities, and exchange-traded funds (ETFs), making it the third largest U.S. equity options marketplace based on number of contracts traded. Since the merger, Amex has been integrated into the company, with former Amex listings now trading directly on the NYSE, and has begun trading certain Nasdaq-listed securities.[30]
NYSE Arca is the first electronic market to offer listed ETP issuers a Lead Market Maker program, which encourages liquidity provision that contributes to the best prices and depth in the ETP marketplace. It is registered as a national securities exchange under the Exchange Act.[30]
NYSE Alternext[edit]
NYSE Alternext was created by NYSE Euronext to meet the needs of small and mid-sized companies seeking simplified access to the stock market. Its streamlined listing requirements and trading rules are suited to the size and business needs of such firms. The rules also ensure investor transparency. NYSE Alternext's special listing procedures, unique market model, and listings of sponsor companies for members are its most notable features.[30]
NYSE Alternext is an exchange-regulated market with a lighter regulatory regime. It is not a regulated market as defined by the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID), but rather is regulated by NYSE Euronext through a body of rules applicable to intermediaries and listed companies.[30]
NYSE Arca Europe[edit]
NYSE Arca Europe is a pan-European multilateral trading facility (MTF) that extends the trading scope of Euronext's regulated markets by adding blue-chip stocks from 14 European countries: Austria, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. Arca Europe integrates this trading facility with the other business components of the company, giving customers the flexibility in trading of an MTF while maintaining the global market reach of NYSE Euronext.[30]
SmartPool[edit]
SmartPool Trading Limited is a UK-registered company supplying an MTF approved by the Financial Services Authority (FSA). It provides an exchange-led dark pool for the execution of block orders covering 15 different European markets, with a full central counter party back-end solution through LCH.Clearnet and EuroCCP. SmartPool was created by NYSE Euronext in partnership with BNP Paribas, HSBC, and J.P. Morgan Chase.[30]
BlueNext and NYSE Blue[edit]
NYSE Euronext holds a 60% interest in BlueNext with the remaining 40% held by CDC Climat. BlueNext operates a spot market in carbon dioxide emission allowances and credits that is the European leader in the field. It seeks to establish a leading position in trading in environment-related instruments, and has also launched a futures market with physical delivery of allowances and credits.[30]
In September 2010, NYSE Euronext announced plans to create NYSE Blue, a new global company that will focus on environmental and sustainable energy markets. NYSE Euronext contributed its ownership in BlueNext in return for a majority interest in NYSE Blue, and APX, Inc. (a leading provider of regulatory infrastructure and services for environmental and sustainable energy markets) will contribute its business in return for a minority interest in the venture. The transaction closed on February 18, 2011.[30]
Information Services and Technology Solutions[edit]
The Information Services and Technology Solutions segment refers to NYSE Euronext's commercial technology transactions, data, and infrastructure businesses. NYSE Euronext operates NYSE Technologies, Free Market, and also owns NYFIX, Inc., a leading provider of innovative solutions that optimize trading efficiency.[30]
NYSE Technologies[edit]
NYSE Technologies is the commercial technology division of NYSE Euronext. Launched in January 2009, it provides data and infrastructure services, comprehensive transaction, and managed solutions for buy-side, sell-side, and exchange communities that require next-generation performance and expertise. NYSE Technologies' advanced integrated solutions power the trading operations of global financial institutions and exchanges, including non-NYSE Euronext markets in addition to all the exchanges in the NYSE Euronext group.[30]
NYSE Technologies operates five business:

Global Market Data offers a broad array of global market information products covering multiple asset classes;
Trading Solutions creates and implements high performance, end-to-end messaging software, real-time market data distribution and integration products;
Exchange Solutions provides multi-asset exchange platform services, managed services and expert consultancy;
Global Connectivity offers one of the world's largest, most reliable financial transaction networks connecting firms and exchanges worldwide;
Transactions primarily comprises the former NYFIX FIX business and incorporates the NYFIX Marketplace and the FIX Software business.

Marché Libre[edit]
The Free Markets of Brussels and Paris, organized by NYSE Euronext, are not regulated markets in the sense of the EU Directive. The criteria for admission to these markets are much simpler, and listing costs are low. They provide a channel for disseminating buy and sell orders, with trades executed by NYSE Euronext member firms. The securities traded on these markets have not gone through any admission procedures and issuers are not subject to any disclosure requirements. The Free Markets serve companies that are too young or too small to be listed on one of the regulated compartments of NYSE Euronext.[30]
NYSE Regulation and FINRA[edit]
On May 4, 2010, NYSE Euronext and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) announced that FINRA would assume responsibility for performing the market surveillance and enforcement functions originally conducted by NYSE Regulation. The agreement was subject to review by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and was completed in June 2010.[30]
Under the announced agreement, FINRA assumed regulatory functions for NYSE Euronext's U.S. equities and options markets – the New York Stock Exchange, NYSE Arca, and NYSE Amex. NYSE Euronext, through its subsidiary NYSE Regulation, remains ultimately responsible for overseeing FINRA's performance of regulatory services for the NYSE markets.[30]
Libor administration[edit]
In early 2014, NYSE Euronext took over the administration of the London interbank offered rate from the British Bankers Association.[31] The new administrator is NYSE Euronext Rates Administration Limited,[32] a London-based, UK registered company, regulated by the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority.[33]
Global marketing and branding[edit]
NYSE Euronext maintains an active marketing campaign, both for its own brand, as well as for its listed companies. The Global Marketing and Branding department is responsible for the full spectrum of NYSE Euronext's brand marketing, including advertising, marketing communications, event management, and market research.[34]
Through the NYSE Global Partnership Program, NYSE Euronext has created a series of strategic resources to support its listed companies' growth initiatives, so as to act as a conduit that enables them to reach new and important audiences.[35] NYSE Euronext's 8,000 listed issues provide members with an extensive network of global investors and business leaders with which to interact. The company offers opportunities for co-branded advertising, linking listed companies to one another, as well as to the powerful brand that is NYSE Euronext.[36]
Events[edit]
The Events department of NYSE Euronext is responsible for coordinating bell ceremonies, receptions, conferences, and street events. Beginning in 2010, the NYSE Euronext opened its doors to non-listed companies to utilize NYSE facilities for after-hours events.
Opening and closing ceremonies[edit]
The opening and closing bell ceremonies hosted by the NYSE date back to 1903, taking place Monday through Friday at 9:30 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. respectively in New York City.
The opportunity to ring the bell at the New York Stock Exchange has long been considered an honor. Representatives from listed companies, especially newly listed companies and IPOs, celebrities, politicians, and other dignitaries have become fixtures at the bell podium. Bell ceremonies are seen by millions, and are the most widely watched TV events each day.
The bell tradition has been extended to the branches in Paris, Brussels, and Lisbon. In Amsterdam, the opening bell was replaced by a gong, which is sounded the signal the beginning and end of the trading day. In the European offices, the opening and closing ceremonies take place at 9:00 a.m. and 5:30 p.m., respectively.[37]
Experience Square[edit]
The Broad Street area in front of the Exchange is known as Experience Square,[citation needed] where listed companies are able to market themselves and their products directly to the thousands of visitors to New York's Financial District each day. The façade of the exchange is often used as a billboard to showcase branding and new listings.[citation needed]
NYSE Magazine[edit]
NYSE Magazine is NYSE Euronext's quarterly publication. It provides insights into the world’s best companies, giving readers a close-up look at the distinguished leaders who constitute the Exchange community. Written for a sophisticated audience of CEOs and other senior global executives, each issue centers on what makes companies succeed. Designed to foster a sense of community among the NYSE’s key constituents, NYSE magazine has grown to become a strategic tool for business leaders that delivers opinions, strategies and insights from their peers.

How This New Fuel Source Is Set to Create Billions in New Wealth for Investors…

How This New Fuel Source Is Set to Create Billions in New Wealth for Investors… 

By MONEY MORNING STAFF REPORTSIt can light and heat your home…
Run factories…
Propel space ships…
It can even power the ENTIRE U.S. electrical grid…
Even tech giants like Google are getting in early to related technologies – they’ve invested $1.8 billion into solar and wind power systems that simply will not work when it’s cloudy or not windy…
 
That is, without the use of this fuel.
And Apple is investing nearly $1 billion in the same thing!
Everywhere you look, America’s biggest companies are investing in systems that will be compatible with this fuel including:

Facebook
Amazon
AT&T
General Motors
Costco
Target

The list goes on.
But to truly reap the benefits and rewards of investing in OBL, you must act quickly to stake your claim before the mainstream media blows this story open and ordinary investors become privy to this opportunity. 
Historically, those who invested early in new energy sources made fortunes that allowed them total financial freedom.
Looking back, according to our estimates…

A $100 investment in Standard Oil would now be worth $153,285…
A $1,000 investment would be worth $1.5 million…
A $10,000 investment would be worth $15.3 million…

We are talking about staggering generational wealth, the kind that could make your family mega-rich today – and keep it that way 100 years from now.
And it all starts with ONE COMPANY at the heart of this massive shift.
Even if you only start with a few dollars, that’s fine. As you saw, even a thousand bucks could make you a fortune.
With an opportunity like this – pure ground floor – it doesn’t always matter how much you put in… what matters is that you get in early.

ARE STOCKS RISKY?

                                                   All stocks carry an inherent risk. Only a small percentage of penny stocks are in fast companies with good foundations and solid financials. We aim to take the guesswork out of penny stock investing and provide our members with expert advice on companies with great potential.
                                                


HOW CAN I START TRADING PENNY STOCKS?

                                                   We do not trade stocks and are not investment advisors, nor can we handle your investment for you. What you can do to start though, is sign up for a brokerage account that has easy access to penny stocks. We recommend common firms like Firstrade, Scottrade, or Tradestation.
                                                


HOW MUCH MONEY DO I NEED TO GET STARTED?

                                                   It's up to you! Many of our members started with just $100 and moved on to trade in thousands.

ARE STOCKS RISKY?

                                                   All stocks carry an inherent risk. Only a small percentage of penny stocks are in fast companies with good foundations and solid financials. We aim to take the guesswork out of penny stock investing and provide our members with expert advice on companies with great potential.
                                                


HOW CAN I START TRADING PENNY STOCKS?

                                                   We do not trade stocks and are not investment advisors, nor can we handle your investment for you. What you can do to start though, is sign up for a brokerage account that has easy access to penny stocks. We recommend common firms like Firstrade, Scottrade, or Tradestation.
