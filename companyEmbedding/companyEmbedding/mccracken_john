Texts by Daniel Baumann, Andrea Bellini, Alex Farquharson, Marianna Vecellio, and Marc-Olivier Wahler
John McCracken was published on the occasion of the artist’s first major museum survey at Castello di Rivoli, Turin, in 2011. The survey presented approximately sixty works, including early abstract paintings from the 1960s and the artist’s most recent work, Wonder and Fair, two stainless steel columns from 2010 that were created specifically for the exhibition. Available in hardcover, this catalogue includes essays by Rivoli co-director Andrea Bellini, curator Alex Farquharson, and Marc-Olivier Wahler, director of the Palais de Tokyo, Paris; an interview with the artist by Rivoli curator Marianna Vecellio; and a conversation on McCracken between curator Daniel Baumann and artist John Armleder. Also featured are a selection of the artist’s sketchbooks; a detailed chronology of his exhibitions; and an extensive anthology of selected texts.

John McCracken
John McCracken (1934-2011) developed his early sculptural work while studying painting at the California College of Arts and Crafts in Oakland in the late 1950s and early 1960s. While experimenting with increasingly three-dimensional canvases, the artist began to produce objects made with industrial materials, including plywood, sprayed lacquer, and pigmented resin, creating the highly reflective, smooth surfaces that he was to become known for.

Interview with the artist by Neville Wakefield 
 
John McCracken: Sketchbook, published concurrently with the 2008 solo exhibition John McCracken at David Zwirner, presents the first of two treasured sketchbooks that the artist used from the mid 1960s until the mid 1970s. These pages show his thought processes, insights, and working sketches—all of which predate and presage his later work. The format, paper, and reproduction quality of the book have been designed to faithfully reproduce in facsimile the original pages from this fascinating document. A supplemental booklet, bound separately and inserted into a pocket in the back of the book, shows his sculptures in their realized form. Also included is an interview with the artist by curator and writer Neville Wakefield.
