The Good
Income-Based Approval System
First Financial is giving consumers the opportunity to obtain financing through their trusted lender network, regardless of bankruptcies, repossessions, liens, judgments, charge-offs, and outstanding debts. The company lends based on income instead of credit score, using bank statements, government benefits letters, and payroll stubs-rather than just a score-believing in the philosophy that everyone deserves a second chance.
Accepts Most Credit Scores
To qualify for a personal loan with First Financial Bank, applicants must have a credit score of at least 600. This would be considered a "poor" score and is lower than just about any lender from other institutions will allow. First Financial does not charge any loan origination or Prepayment fees.
Simple Application Process
Customers of First Financial Bank who apply for this type of loan have an advantage because the institution already has all their personal information and financial data. All one has to do is either go into a branch to apply or fill out an online application. First Financial will then pull the credit score, and a representative will be in touch with you the same business day. This quick and easy process is especially helpful when the cash is needed for immediate use and payments.
In the rare instances where there are problems with application materials, the money available could be delayed a few business days.



The Bad
Potentially High APR
At First Financial Bank, an applicant can secure a personal loan at a rate of anything between 16 percent and 420 percent. This incredibly large range is due to applicants' variations in income and other factors. As one would imagine, better income would equal a much better rate. Conversely, if the applicant has low income, he or she will be restricted to have a very high-interest rate.
Small Max Loan Amount
The maximum loan amount through First Financial varies from borrower to borrower, though $1,000 appears the be its average maximum among borrowers. First Financial Bank advertises that this type of loan is designed for someone who is trying to repair or establish their credit.

The Bottom Line
First Financial has a very different approach to personal lending compared to its competitors. Most lenders rely heavily on credit scores to help them approve or deny customers while First Financial relies on current income. This is very helpful for those customers in the low credit score bracket. With that being said, First Financial offers small loan amounts, with the max being $1,000. There is also a possibility that the interest rate for payback could be in the 400th percentile. It is clear that First Financial has a specific target market that they are seeking to help. For those customers who have poor credit scores, First Financial is worth a look (keeping in mind the high-interest rates). But for those customers who are looking for larger loan sizes, check out these top recommended companies.

Terrible service. If you're one minute late with your payment, they start calling you relentlessly. Then they will repossess without notice. Avoid at all costs.

Not sure about being available in all states....the first question it asks is your zip code. I live in West Virginia. I put in my zip code and it immediately responded with I'm sorry but we can't help you.

Insurance & Annuities
Reaching your financial goals involves protecting your assets as well as managing them. At Ameriprise Financial, we recommend a balanced and customized approach to asset and risk management.
Ameriprise offers a full range of high-quality insurance and annuity products through third-party insurance carriers and our affiliates, RiverSource Life Insurance Company (RiverSource Life), RiverSource Life Insurance Co. of New York (RiverSource Life of New York) and Ameriprise Auto and Home Insurance. Together, both RiverSource Life and RiverSource Life of New York are ranked as the 19th largest life insurance company of about 850 life insurance companies, based on total assets.1 In addition, RiverSource Life and RiverSource Life of New York consistently earned positive ratings from independent rating agencies2 — a fact that can give you the added confidence of working with a strong, reliable company.




Annuities
An annuity can be a valuable tool for investing and saving for retirement. Plus, the contract's tax deferral gives you the freedom to control when you pay taxes on your earnings.


Auto and home insurance
With a team of agents dedicated specifically to advisors and their clients, we're always working to provide you with the kind of personal service you deserve.


Individual major medical health insurance
Major medical insurance provides you and your family with financial protection against unexpected medical expenses as well as coverage for everyday care. Plus, you might qualify for a premium tax credit through the Federal Marketplace.


Life insurance
A life insurance policy can help you plan for your family’s financial needs and may also offer features that can help you meet other goals, including education, retirement, tax savings and estate planning.


Long-term care insurance
Long term care insurance provides benefits to offset out of pocket expenses in the event of an extended care need. A secure financial future typically includes protecting your retirement income, assets and your independence in the event of an extended care need.


Disability income insurance
Protect yourself, your family and your lifestyle by insuring your income in the event of long-term illness or injury. Disability income insurance provides the resources you need when you are unable to work.





Your resource for insurance and annuity solutions
An Ameriprise financial advisor can help you identify areas where you may benefit from coverage, and recommend products that fit your needs. Whatever life sends your way, you'll feel better knowing you are protecting yourself and your loved ones financially.
