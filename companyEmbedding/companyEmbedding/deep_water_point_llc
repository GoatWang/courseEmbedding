Specialized Services




























Deep Water Point provides expertise, services and solutions across the full business lifecycle, so clients can increase their win probability at any phase. And we help clients become more competitive overall by providing a backplane of support that accelerates their path to business success.
You can profitably engage Deep Water Point at any one of these critical developmental phases:
Establishing a new company
Building early growth
Qualifying opportunities and developing account plans
Capture management
Proposal quality assessment
Marketing your federal contract
Establishing the value of your company
Our ability to support each successive phase gives us a long-term view onto a client’s business performance that’s impossible to gain from a one-off contract bid. This sustained relationship can provide early visibility onto trends that offer new sources of advantage, or pose risks to future growth.
Our infinitely scalable structure then gives us the agility and resources to help clients make the right response at the right time, so they can quickly pivot from things that don’t work to things that do. This lean approach helps our clients reduce their capture time and effort, increase their win rates, and cut their overhead costs – not just in choice of tactics, but agencies, deals and relationship targets as well.

Business Role




























Part of the beauty and value Deep Water Point provides is that our team has "been there and done that." We intimately understand and appreciate the challenges current business leaders face because our Partners and Principals join us after holding and succeeding in top executive and business development positions. We bring our "lessons learned" experience to clients, and, more often than not, they benefit from our guidance beyond the project for which we are initially engaged.
Executive Leadership
C-level executives have broad cross-functional responsibility for operations, marketing, banking, legal, capture, human resources, and accounting. Beyond the day-to-day, they also have a greater responsibility – to provide vision. They must look ahead to see what lies beyond the firm’s current needs, so they can prepare the company for future success and growth.
Deep Water Point is called in by top level executives to advise on current issues as well as provide input to their  long term goals and objectives. While C-level leadership often knows what’s best for their particular firm, they also know that at times, receiving an external, qualified and trusted opinion can provide the keys needed to reach the next level.
In this role, we can:
Connect clients to the business resources they need, when they need them
Improve their strategic growth by reducing tactical distractions
Gain cross-function abilities beyond their team’s current skills and needs
Free their ability to win from current business conditions
For owners and investors, we can provide new ways to:
Realize target valuations faster with fewer dedicated resources
Reduce business risk in an uncertain market
Directly associate business development, capture and marketing investment with business outcomes
Move at the speed of opportunity
Business Development
Deep Water Point recognizes the substantial challenges business development professionals are tackling in this quickly changing federal market place. Our team listens to the issues at hand, contributes specific knowledge of certain accounts, and then works side by side with BD management to apply the necessary intelligence requird to  increase opportunity win probability.
In this role, we can help clients:
Get out ahead of the bid by aligning their capabilities to the most desirable opportunities
Handle and win more bids with the resources they already have
Gain more consideration across more agencies
Level the playing field against larger competitors
Our ability to adapt development strategy at any point can help reduce our client’s capture time and effort, increase win rates, and cut overhead costs.
