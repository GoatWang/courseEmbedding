Summary Prospectus   
  Key Facts About BIF Tax-Exempt Fund 
  Investment Objective
  
The investment objectives of BIF Tax-Exempt Fund (formerly known as
CMA® Tax-Exempt Fund) (Tax-Exempt Fund or the Fund) are to seek current income exempt from Federal
income tax, preservation of capital and liquidity.    Fees and
Expenses of the Fund   
This table describes the fees and expenses that you may pay if you buy and hold shares of Tax-Exempt Fund.

 The fees and expenses shown in the table and the example that follows include both the expenses of Tax-Exempt Fund and Tax-Exempt Funds share of the
allocated expenses of Master Tax-Exempt LLC (Master LLC). Tax-Exempt Funds management fees are paid by Master LLC.

 Miscellaneous Other Expenses have been restated to reflect current fees. 


3
 The Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses do not correlate to the ratio of expenses to average net assets given in Tax-Exempt Funds most recent annual
report, which does not include the restatement of Miscellaneous Other Expenses to reflect current fees.   
Example:  This Example is intended to help you compare the
cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of investing in other mutual funds. The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods indicated and then redeem all of your shares at the end of those periods. The Example also
assumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the Funds operating expenses remain the same. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:

Principal Investment Strategies of the Fund 
  Tax-Exempt Fund seeks to achieve its objectives by investing in a diversified
portfolio of high quality, short-term, tax-exempt securities. These securities consist principally of tax-exempt notes and commercial paper, short-term tax-exempt bonds, tax-exempt variable rate demand obligations and short-term
tax-exempt derivatives. Certain short-term securities have maturities that are longer than 397 days, but give the Fund the right to demand payment from a financial institution within that period. The Fund treats these securities as having a maturity
of 397 days or less. The Funds dollar-weighted average maturity will be 60 days or less and the dollar-weighted average life of all of its investments will be 120 days or less. 
  Under normal circumstances, the Fund invests at least 80% of its assets in short-term
tax-exempt securities or so that at least 80% of the income it distributes will be exempt from Federal income tax (including the Federal alternative minimum tax). The Fund also may invest up to 20% of its assets in short-term municipal securities,
which may subject investors to Federal alternative minimum tax. Throughout this prospectus, interest paid on tax-exempt and/or municipal securities may be referred to as tax-exempt. 
  The Fund does not presently intend to invest more than 25% of its total assets in
short-term tax-exempt securities of issuers located in a single state.   
2 


Principal Risks of Investing in the Fund
   Tax-Exempt
Fund cannot guarantee that it will achieve its objectives.    An investment
in the Fund is not a deposit in any bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The Fund could lose money if the issuer of an instrument held by the Fund defaults or if
short-term interest rates rise sharply in a manner not anticipated by Fund management. Although the Fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it is possible to lose money by investing in the Fund. The following is a
summary description of certain risks of investing in the Fund.   


n
 
 Credit Risk  Credit risk refers to the possibility that the issuer of a security will not be able to make payments of interest and principal
when due. Changes in an issuers credit rating or the markets perception of an issuers creditworthiness may also affect the value of the Funds investment in that issuer. 
 


n
 
 Income Risk  Income risk is the risk that the Funds yield will vary as short-term securities in its portfolio mature and the proceeds
are reinvested in securities with different interest rates.   


n
 
 Interest Rate Risk  Interest rate risk is the risk that the value of a debt security may fall when interest rates rise. In general, the
market price of debt securities with longer maturities will go up or down more in response to changes in interest rates than the market price of shorter term securities. 
 


 
Additionally, securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S. Government, its agencies, instrumentalities and sponsored enterprises have historically involved little risk of loss of
principal if held to maturity. However, due to fluctuations in interest rates, the market value of such securities may vary during the period shareholders own shares of the Fund. 
 


n
 
 Market Risk and Selection Risk  Market risk is the risk that one or more markets in which the Fund invests will go down in value, including
the possibility that the markets will go down sharply and unpredictably. Selection risk is the risk that the securities selected by Fund management will underperform the markets, the relevant indices or the securities selected by other funds with
similar investment objectives and investment strategies. This means you may lose money.   


n
 
 Municipal Securities Risks  Municipal securities risks include the ability of the issuer to repay the obligation, the relative lack of
information about certain issuers of municipal securities, and the possibility of future legislative changes which could affect the market for and value of municipal securities. Certain municipal securities, including private activity bonds, are not
backed by the full faith, credit and taxing power of the issuer. Additionally, if events occur after the security is acquired that impact the securitys tax-exempt status, the Fund and its shareholders could be subject to substantial tax
liabilities.   


n
 
 Taxability Risk  Future laws, regulations, rulings or court decisions may cause interest on tax-exempt or municipal securities to be subject,
directly or indirectly, to Federal income taxation or may otherwise prevent the Fund from realizing the full current benefit of the tax-exempt status of such securities. Any such change could also affect the market price of such securities, and thus
the value of an investment in the Fund.   


n
 
 Variable Rate Demand Obligations and Municipal or Tax-Exempt Derivatives Risk  Investments in variable rate demand obligations or short-term
municipal or tax-exempt derivatives involve credit risk with respect to the financial institution providing the Fund with the right to demand payment or put (sell) the security. While the Fund invests only in short-term municipal or tax-exempt
securities of high quality issuers, or which are backed by high quality financial institutions, those issuers or financial institutions may still default on their obligations. Short-term municipal or tax-exempt derivatives present certain unresolved
tax, legal, regulatory and accounting issues not presented by investments in other short-term municipal or tax-exempt securities. These issues might be resolved in a manner adverse to the Fund.

Performance Information 
  The information shows you how Tax-Exempt Funds performance has varied year by
year and provides some indication of the risks of investing in the Fund. Information for the periods before February 2003 (when the Fund changed to a master/feeder structure) reflects the Funds operations as a stand alone fund. As
with all such investments, past performance is not an indication of future results. The table includes all applicable fees and sales charges. If the Funds investment manager and its affiliates had not waived or reimbursed certain
Fund expenses during these periods, the Fund's returns would have been lower. Updated information on the Fund's results can be obtained by visiting www.blackrock.com/moneymarketreports or can be obtained by phone at (800) 626-1960. The Fund is
a money market fund managed pursuant to the requirements of Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act). Effective May 28, 2010, Rule 2a-7 was amended to impose new liquidity, credit
quality and maturity requirements on all money market funds. Fund performance shown prior to May 28, 2010 is based on Investment Company Act rules then in effect and is not an indication of future returns. 
  BIF Tax-Exempt Fund 
ANNUAL TOTAL RETURNS  As of

Investment Manager 
  Tax-Exempt Funds investment manager is BlackRock Advisors, LLC
(BlackRock). The Funds sub-adviser is BlackRock Investment Management, LLC. Where applicable, BlackRock refers also to the Funds sub-adviser. 
  Purchase and Sale of Fund Shares
   If you are
a Cash Management Account (CMA) service subscriber, there is no minimum initial investment for Fund shares. The minimum assets for the CMA service is $20,000 in cash and/or securities. Other programs may have different minimum asset
requirements. If you are not a CMA service or other Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated (Merrill Lynch) central asset account program subscriber, the minimum initial investment for the Fund is $5,000. If you are an
eligible CMA service subscriber and you choose to have your cash balances automatically invested in the Fund, generally cash balances of more than $1 in a CMA account are automatically invested in shares of the Fund daily at the next determined net
asset value on each business day on which both the New York Stock Exchange (the Exchange) and New York banks are open; cash balances of less than $1 will be automatically invested in shares of the Fund at the next determined net asset
value not later than the first business day of each week on which both the Exchange and New York banks are open, which will usually be a Monday. If you are a CMA service or other eligible Merrill Lynch central asset account program subscriber, you
may make manual investments of $1,000 or more at any time in shares of any fund associated with the CMA service not designated as your primary money account. Generally, manual purchases placed through Merrill Lynch will be effective on the day
following the day   
4 



the order is placed with the Fund, subject to certain timing considerations. If you are a CMA service subscriber, you may redeem your shares by directly submitting a written notice of redemption
to Merrill Lynch, which will submit the request to the Funds transfer agent. You may sell shares held at the Funds transfer agent by writing to Financial Data Services, Inc., P.O. Box 45290, Jacksonville, Florida 32231-5290. 
  Tax Information
   The Fund
will distribute dividends of net investment income, if any, daily and net realized capital gains, if any, at least annually. The Fund anticipates that most of its distributions will be excludable from gross income for Federal income tax purposes.
   Payments to Broker/Dealers and Other Financial Intermediaries
   If you
purchase shares of the Fund through a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary, the Fund and BlackRock Investments, LLC, the Fund's distributor, or its affiliates may pay the intermediary for the sale of Fund shares and related services. These
payments may create a conflict of interest by influencing the broker-dealer or other financial intermediary and your individual financial professional to recommend the Fund over another investment. Ask your individual financial professional or visit
your financial intermediary's website for more information.   
* * *   
The Funds prospectus and statement of additional information, both dated July 29, 2010, are incorporated by reference into this Summary Prospectus.
