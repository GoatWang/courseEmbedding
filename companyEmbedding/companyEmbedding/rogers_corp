Rogers Corporation is an American specialty materials company with headquarters originally located in Rogers, Connecticut. Recently, the company moved the corporate headquarters from Connecticut to Arizona in June 2017 to facilitate greater access to business and technology centers on the west coast.[2]
In 1832, Peter Rogers founded the company, which started out as a materials manufacturer for the textile industry. Rogers is known as one of the oldest public companies in America, and has a great standing of innovation and collaborative problem solving with its customers. Originally a paperboard manufacturing company, Rogers has formed into a major global materials technology leader, creating a variety of high-technology devices and systems. Rogers, as of 2014, has 2,800 full-time employees both in the U.S. and around the world in Japan, Taiwan, Singapore, Korea, China, Germany and Belgium.
Rogers Corporation has three core business segments, Advanced Connectivity Solutions,[3] Elastomeric Material Solutions[4] and Power Electronics Solutions.
Rogers continues to focus its research, development, and engineering investments on megatrends, a large, long-lasting, global shift in thinking or an approach that affects countries, industries and organizations, which drives global demand for a cleaner, safer, and more connected world. The company was listed on the New York Stock Exchange in April, 2000.

Rogers Corp. Introduces New Products

Rogers Corporation has recently introduced three new items to their extensive product line including PORON® SlimGripTM Foam, PORON® Foam Tape Window Adhesive, and BISCO® RS-700 Series. SRP Co. is an industry leader in custom fabrication, die and dieless cutting of non-metallic materials into custom parts and components. We are proud to be a Preferred Converter for Rogers Corporation. Our Product Partnership with Rogers ensures Quality, High Performance & Value for your finished SRP component.  PORON® SlimGripTM Foam: 4701-SGRL-06020-90PORON® SlimGripTM foam, the softest PORON material to-date, is 0.5mm thick and can squeeze into gaps under 0.05mm thick. This high level of compressibility proves SlimGrip foam ideal for display gaskets.PORON® SlimGrip foam can compress to its final thickness with very little force. SlimGrip foam requires 3X less force to achieve 0.05mm thickness compared to competitors, all while maintaining excellent rebound properties. This material is 50% more effective at dust sealing than competitive materials, further protecting the integrity of displays. PORON® SlimGripTM Foam Data Sheet PORON® Foam Tape (0.25mm) Window AdhesivePORON® Foam Tape is more than the sum of its parts. The high performance microcellular urethane construction with a specially engineered adhesive combine to produce a versatile window adhesive with superior bond strength, impact protection and reliability.Why Choose PORON® Foam Tape Window Adhesive?Superior BondingHelps prevent catastrophic window delamination with a 20% stronger bond than the best competitive material Impressive bond strength, even with low application force Performs well in extreme environments ReliabilityResists creep and compression set to secure window placement Seals out dust & water Excellent Impact Protection15% greater impact protection than the competition Protects displays from nearly 140cm (55”) drops (Rogers Impact Protection test) ProcessabilityDimensional stability allows for easy repositioning Adhesive removes cleanly during rework & repositioning  PORON® Foam Tape (0.25mm) Window Adhesive Data Sheet  BISCO® RS-700 SeriesCONTINUOUS ROLL CLOSED-CELL SILICONE SPONGEThe new RS-700 series materials are closed cell silicone sponges made in continuous rolls which complement BISCO®Silicones current material offering (BF-1000 and HT-800 series). They provide high tensile strength, low compression set and a smooth surface to laminate and bond adhesives. The RS-700 series is available in 3 densities, varying in thicknesses from 0.031” thk. to 0.500”. PSA is also available on the RS-700 series. Some applications require a gasket with extra strength and durability. With high tensile strength and elongation, BISCO RS-700 series materials live up to the tough demands for gasketing and seals in harsh environments requiring a silicone material. BENEFITSWon’t tear in extreme conditionsHigh sealabilityEase of adhesive applicationBetter machine utilization     BISCO® RS-700 Series Data Sheet

Rogers Corp. Opens Manufacturing Facility in China (11/14)

Future expansion planned in 2003.Rogers Corporation (NYSE:ROG) today announced the opening of Rogers Technologies Suzhou Company Ltd (RSZ), a wholly owned subsidiary, located in Suzhou, Peoples Republic of China, which will add manufacturing capability for the ENDUR® product line currently produced by the Rogers Elastomer Components Division, in its plant located in South Windham, CT.  

About the transfer of current high-volume business, David Smith, Vice President of Rogers Elastomer Components Division, commented, “The ever-growing demand from our customers for low-cost components is the primary reason for adding manufacturing capacity in China for some of our ENDUR® products. Another advantage is that we will now be in close proximity to many of our customers’ manufacturing facilities.”

In August, Rogers signed a lease for a 25,400 sq. ft. facility, which will produce ENDUR® rollers and other components serving the imaging and computer markets.  The company plans to begin producing qualification samples by the end of this month, and to commence full production in January 2003. 

Walter E. Boomer, Chairman and CEO of Rogers Corporation, remarked that global expansion continues to be a strong focus of Rogers. He added, “The facility in Suzhou provides a solid base for future expansion strategies in this region.”

With the signing of a second lease earlier this month for another 20,000 sq. ft. facility adjacent to the first building, RSZ will commence manufacturing Nitrophyl® floats in March of next year.  Nitrophyl® specialty floats serve the automotive, liquid propane, marine and small engine markets as well as other uses in general liquid level sensing and monitoring equipment. Nitrophyl® floats will also continue to be produced by Rogers Elastomer Components Division in South Windham, CT.

Mr. Smith said, “In addition to meeting the demands of our current customers in North America and in Europe, we are expanding capacity in China because we feel the largest opportunity for growth in floats is in this area of the world.”

Rogers Corporation, headquartered in Rogers, CT, U.S.A., develops and manufactures specialty materials serving the transportation/automotive, consumer, imaging, communications and computer markets. Rogers operates manufacturing facilities in Connecticut, Arizona, and Illinois in the U.S. and in Ghent, Belgium. Sales offices are located in Japan, Hong Kong, China, Taiwan, Korea and Singapore. Rogers has joint ventures in Japan with Inoac Corporation, in Taiwan with Chang Chun Plastics, and in the U.S. with Mitsui Chemicals and with 3M Corporation. Rogers Technologies Suzhou Company Ltd. is a manufacturing facility located in Suzhou, China.

BBB Reason for Ratings


        BBB rating is based on 13 factors: Get the details about the factors considered.










BBB Reports On









Licensing









                        Licensing information is provided in the BBB Business Profiles to inform the public about industries that may require professional licensing, bonding, or registration. Better Business Bureau encourages you to check with the appropriate agency to be certain any requirements are currently being met.
                    





Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.
                    





Government Actions









                        BBB reports on known significant government actions involving the business's marketplace conduct.
                    





Out of Business









                        BBB reports on a company that is out of business for three years from the date the company closes its doors or ceases to do business.
                    





Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo









                        BBB reports on unauthorized use of the Better Business Bureau's name and/or logo for as long as the business continues to use it in any advertising, or for one year after the business ceases any repeated unauthorized uses.
                    





Bankruptcy









                        BBB reports on a business’s bankruptcy as long as the business remains in bankruptcy.
                    





Mail Returned









                        BBB reports when mail sent to the business was returned by the Postal Service.

BBB Rating System Overview














Customer Review Rating:









                        The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business.
                        The Customer Review Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive,
                        neutral, and negative reviews posted.

Composite Score:





                        National Pen Company has received 3.75 out of 5 stars based on 27 Customer Reviews and a BBB Rating of A+.
                        






                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.
