We love to help!Should I form my business as an LLC?Despite being a relatively new option, the limited liability company (LLC) is now one of the most popular business structures among smaller organizations. While allowing business owners to remain free from a great deal of the regulations imposed on other types of companies, it still provides limited liability protection for its owners (members). This means that the personal assets of an LLC's ownership cannot be collected to fulfill the debts of the business. What is involved in forming an LLC?All states require potential LLC owners to file a substantial set of documents, typically called the Articles of Organization, in order to establish their business. We can take care of this process for you, saving you time, effort, and allowing you to focus on developing your business – not filing paperwork. How should I name my LLC?The name you choose for your LLC is an important decision, as it will be how you represent yourself to potential associates and clients. With that in mind, it is advisable that you take some time to craft a name that you will be proud to have representing you and your business.Your name must be unique, and not deceptively similar, to any other trademarked name or business. It is also required that your name not be used to intentionally misrepresent the products or services you offer. For LLCs, nearly all states will also require you to add a signifier of your limited liability status, such as "LLC" or "L.L.C." to the end of your company's name. You may be able to operate under a name other than your formal LLC name by applying for and using a dba. Are there a required number of individuals needed to form an LLC?There is no minimum requirement as to the number of owners (also referred to as members) that an LLC must have. At the federal level, single-member LLCs qualify for pass-through taxation, however this is not always true at the state level.

How to Form a Texas LLC in 3 Simple Steps
Are you looking for the freedom that comes with owning your own company? An LLC is a popular choice for many
new Texas business owners. In the Lone Star State, business owners can take advantage of several tax
benefits, strong asset protection and flexible profit choices—in a state with one of the fastest growing
economies. Here’s how to start your LLC in Texas.


Step One: Choosing Your Texas LLC’s Name
The first step in forming a new LLC in Texas is to create a name. The name you choose for your Texas LLC has to
be different from other Texas business or LLC names. Here are a couple of laws unique to Texas that will impact
naming your LLC:

What you can’t do: The name can’t contain words or phrases that could give the impression that
the LLC has been organized for some purpose other than that specified in its articles, or one that’s not allowed
by state law.
What you must do: The LLC name must end in one of the following terms or its abbreviations:
“Limited Liability Company;” “LLC” or “L.L.C.;” “Limited Company;” “LC” or “L.C.”
Step Two: Creating and Filing Your Articles of Organization

Once you have a name, Texas law states that you must write up and file articles of organization for your new
LLC. The articles of organization must list:


The LLC’s name and business purpose.
The name and address of your LLC’s registered agent (see below for specific requirements for Texas
registered agents.

How long it’s planned to last (usually perpetual unless otherwise specified).
The name and addresses of the organizer(s) and their signature(s).
Whether the LLC will be managed by a manager or managers.
The name and address of each manager or initial member.
The signature of a manager, organizer, member, trustee, or fiduciary, and the signer’s position.
Any other relevant information.

Registered Agents in Texas
Texas LLCs must each have a registered agent in Texas — someone designated to receive official
correspondence from state administrative or legal agencies. A registered agent for an LLC in Texas can
be an individual resident, a Texas LLC or corporation, or an out-of-state (“foreign”) corporation or LLC
with an office in Texas. The LLC must keep a business office at the same address as its registered
office, and it must be a street address, not just a post office box or answering service.
If you need a registered agent in Texas, Incfile can provide that service.


Your LLC is “organized” when an original and one copy of the articles of organization are given to the Texas
Secretary of State’s office along with the filing fee, and their office confirms that they comply with state
requirements. Incfile will
submit these forms for you.
The Secretary of State endorses both copies, keeps the original, and returns the signed copy. The articles of
organization are effective as of the date and time they are filed unless a later date and time are
specified.
Step 3: Writing Your Operating Agreement
After you’ve filed your articles of incorporation, your LLC needs an operating agreement. This isn’t required by
state law, but it’s a critical internal document that officially explains how the LLC will operate. It
lists:

The members (see below for how membership works in a Texas LLC).
How much they have invested.
How profits are divided.
How much weight each member has when votes are taken.
It may also list standards for meetings (how much notice, what constitutes a quorum, rules for voting, etc.)
and so on, but is not required to do so.


A typical operating agreement also includes requirements mandated by the state of Texas, and can be amended or
repealed as specified by the agreement or applicable law.
How Membership Works in a Texas LLC
Texas LLCs must have at least one member, and each member must be a natural person (as opposed to a corporate entity). To become a member, an individual usually has to make a contribution, pay money, or transfer property to the LLC, or else assume an obligation to do so or render some kind of service.
A member can resign from an LLC, but only in the way specified in the articles of organization or operating agreement. These documents also usually specify a minimum period of time a member can be a member before being allowed to resign. LLCs have the option of penalizing a resigning member for damages suffered by the LLC due to his resignation.
Ongoing Requirements for LLCs in Texas - Including Taxes
Texas LLCs are required to file an annual report with the Texas Secretary of State including the following:

LLC name and the state where the LLC was organized (if not Texas).
Address of the registered office and the name of the registered agent.
Address of the principal LLC office.
Names and business addresses of the LLC’s managers.

The Texas Franchise Tax filing requirements state that you must file an annual Franchise Tax Report, and an Information Report. You must file additional forms if you take any credits on your report, file as a tiered partnership, or file as a combined group.
When you form your LLC with Incfile, we’ll send reminder emails about Texas’ ongoing requirements as the due dates approach.
How are LLC taxes handled in Texas? 
An LLC has some tax advantages when compared to a corporation, including the availability of more deductions. However, there is no requirement for an LLC to be a separate tax entity like a corporation. Instead, an LLC can be a “pass-through entity” when it comes to taxes, so that the LLC owner or owners report business losses or profits on their personal tax returns, in the same way that a partnership would.
The IRS treats single-member LLCs as sole proprietorships for tax purposes unless you choose for your LLC to be taxed as a corporation. This means the LLC itself does not pay taxes and does not have to file a tax return. The IRS treats multi-owned LLCs as partnerships for tax purposes, unless you choose for your LLC to be taxed as a corporation. This means that LLC owners each pay taxes on their lawful share of the profits on their personal income tax returns, not the LLC itself.
When starting a new LLC in Texas, you may need to obtain a federal tax identification or employment identification number (EIN). In most cases, you won’t need a separate EIN for your LLC if you are the sole owner and the LLC has no employees. However, if you are not the sole owner of the LLC, or if the LLC has employees, the LLC will need a separate EIN to open a bank account and to meet tax filing requirements.
Dissolution of an LLC in Texas
A Texas LLC is dissolved when any one of the following events occurs:

Event(s) specified in the articles of organization or operating agreement
There is an agreement to dissolve by the number or percentage of members specified in the operating
agreement

An event that makes it illegal for the LLC to continue to operate
When a member leaves the LLC, unless the remaining members agree to continue the LLC within 90 days, or the
company continues under specifications set out in the
operating agreement

Judicial decree ordering dissolution

What business type is right for you?
When you're starting a new business, you want to determine the business structure that's right for you. What's the difference between a limited liability company (LLC) and a corporation (Inc.)? And how is a C corporation different from an S corporation? Use these charts to help decide what business type is best for your needs.








LLC vs. Corporation






Limited Liability Company (LLC)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my LLCCorporation (Inc)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my Corporation







What is an S corporation?
After you create a corporation or LLC, you also have the opportunity to decide how you'd like your business to be taxed.Single owner LLCs can be taxed either as a sole proprietorship or a corporation.  LLCs with more than one owner can be taxed either as a partnership or a corporation.  Income from LLCs treated as sole proprietorships or partnerships is reported directly on the owner’s individual tax returns.New corporations, as well as LLCs considering corporate taxation can choose between filing taxes as a C corporation ("C corp") or an S corporation ("S corp"). An S corp is considered a "pass-through entity," which means the business itself isn't taxed. Instead, income is reported on the owners' personal tax returns. Businesses taxed as C corporations are not pass through entities.  Income is taxed at the corporate level, and, if dividends are distributed, at the individual level as well.We can help you understand your options so you choose what's best for your business. Talk to one of our network of attorneys today.








C-corp or S-corp 






Here's a comparison of some key characteristics of businesses that choose to be treated as C corps and S corps.C DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensS DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensYou don't have to decide about S corp status right away. You have 75 days after the formation of your business to file with the IRS. If you're still not sure what to do, you may want to consult with one of our attorneys or tax specialists.





Step-by-Step Guide on Starting Your Business













Easy as 1-2-3




1. Select the business structure that's right for you and fill out a simple questionnaire.





2. We'll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state.





3. You'll receive your completed paperwork by mail.








Ask away. We have answers.



Common questions

Can I start a business without creating a corporation or LLC?
You don't need a corporation or LLC to go into business. Many business owners are in partnerships or are sole proprietors. But both a corporation and LLC canshield you from liability and may offer tax advantages.


What are the main differences between an LLC and a sole proprietorship?
You don't need to file any paperwork with your state to create a sole proprietorship (though you may still need business permits and licenses to operate lawfully). But an LLC protects you from personal liability  - a sole proprietorship doesn't.Also, LLCs provide more flexibility as you grow your business.


What are the main differences between an LLC and an S corporation?
An LLC has more flexibility and fewer corporate formalities than an S corporation. S corporations are required to have annual meetings of shareholders and directors, while meetings of LLC member and/or managers are not required..  Also,  LLCs can provide for a flexible management structure by members or managers, while corporations require management by a Board of Directors.Learn more.


Do I need a name or DBA for my business?
You only need a DBA ("doing business as") if you are operating a sole proprietorship or partnership and you want to use a fictitious name for the business. You don't need a DBA for an LLC or a corporation unless you are using a name other than your LLC or corporate name while doing business.Learn more.


Do I need any other licenses or permits to start my business? 
Some cities, counties, and states require businesses to obtain licenses and permits to operate lawfully. We can help you figure out what you need. Learn More.

Compare Business Structures – LLC vs. Corporation, S Corporation and C Corporation 

		 You’ve decided to start a business, but you’re not sure where to begin. You don’t know if you should form an LLC or corporation, and need guidance to help you choose the right business structure. Each business structure has its advantages and disadvantages that are important to understand because choosing the wrong business entity could result in legal and tax implications down the road. The information above will allow you to compare LLC vs. corporation, and learn the difference between an S corporation and C corporation. LLCs and corporations both offer personal liability protection, but the most significant difference between LLC and corporation is that corporations are preferred by outside investors. When comparing LLC vs S corp, there are a few important differences to be aware of which are outlined above. Once you determine which business structure you need, you can start a business with LegalZoom in just three easy steps. The process begins by filling out a simple questionnaire. We’ll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state, and you’ll receive your completed paperwork by mail. If you need help deciding which business structure is right for you, a LegalZoom legal plan attorney can explain how each business entity works and help you decide.

LLC Pricing Packages - Affordable LLC Formation Services from LegalZoomWhen you decided to form an LLC, one of your first questions may have been "how much does an LLC cost"? Fortunately, LegalZoom makes the process of starting an LLC affordable and simple. With three LLC pricing packages to choose from, there is a package to fit the needs of any business. The Economy package LLC cost includes filing of the document forming the LLC with the state, a personalized operating agreement, name availability check, a financial account authorization letter, and a 30 business day turnaround. Standard package LLC fees include everything from the Economy package with a 15 business day turnaround, plus a company seal and binder, and 20 customized membership certificates. The Express Gold LLC formation package includes everything from the Standard package with a 7-10 business day turnaround, plus a Federal Tax ID (EIN) (discounted and expedited), a tax consultation with 1-800Accountant, and a 30-day trial of attorney advice. Get started forming an LLC by answering a few questions about your business. We'll assemble your LLC documents and file them directly with the appropriate state agency and you'll receive your completed LLC package by mail. The LLC price for all packages includes a 100% satisfaction guarantee and a Peace of Mind Review.

We love to help!Should I form my business as an LLC?Despite being a relatively new option, the limited liability company (LLC) is now one of the most popular business structures among smaller organizations. While allowing business owners to remain free from a great deal of the regulations imposed on other types of companies, it still provides limited liability protection for its owners (members). This means that the personal assets of an LLC's ownership cannot be collected to fulfill the debts of the business. What is involved in forming an LLC?All states require potential LLC owners to file a substantial set of documents, typically called the Articles of Organization, in order to establish their business. We can take care of this process for you, saving you time, effort, and allowing you to focus on developing your business – not filing paperwork. How should I name my LLC?The name you choose for your LLC is an important decision, as it will be how you represent yourself to potential associates and clients. With that in mind, it is advisable that you take some time to craft a name that you will be proud to have representing you and your business.Your name must be unique, and not deceptively similar, to any other trademarked name or business. It is also required that your name not be used to intentionally misrepresent the products or services you offer. For LLCs, nearly all states will also require you to add a signifier of your limited liability status, such as "LLC" or "L.L.C." to the end of your company's name. You may be able to operate under a name other than your formal LLC name by applying for and using a dba. Are there a required number of individuals needed to form an LLC?There is no minimum requirement as to the number of owners (also referred to as members) that an LLC must have. At the federal level, single-member LLCs qualify for pass-through taxation, however this is not always true at the state level.

How to Form a Texas LLC in 3 Simple Steps
Are you looking for the freedom that comes with owning your own company? An LLC is a popular choice for many
new Texas business owners. In the Lone Star State, business owners can take advantage of several tax
benefits, strong asset protection and flexible profit choices—in a state with one of the fastest growing
economies. Here’s how to start your LLC in Texas.


Step One: Choosing Your Texas LLC’s Name
The first step in forming a new LLC in Texas is to create a name. The name you choose for your Texas LLC has to
be different from other Texas business or LLC names. Here are a couple of laws unique to Texas that will impact
naming your LLC:

What you can’t do: The name can’t contain words or phrases that could give the impression that
the LLC has been organized for some purpose other than that specified in its articles, or one that’s not allowed
by state law.
What you must do: The LLC name must end in one of the following terms or its abbreviations:
“Limited Liability Company;” “LLC” or “L.L.C.;” “Limited Company;” “LC” or “L.C.”
Step Two: Creating and Filing Your Articles of Organization

Once you have a name, Texas law states that you must write up and file articles of organization for your new
LLC. The articles of organization must list:


The LLC’s name and business purpose.
The name and address of your LLC’s registered agent (see below for specific requirements for Texas
registered agents.

How long it’s planned to last (usually perpetual unless otherwise specified).
The name and addresses of the organizer(s) and their signature(s).
Whether the LLC will be managed by a manager or managers.
The name and address of each manager or initial member.
The signature of a manager, organizer, member, trustee, or fiduciary, and the signer’s position.
Any other relevant information.

Registered Agents in Texas
Texas LLCs must each have a registered agent in Texas — someone designated to receive official
correspondence from state administrative or legal agencies. A registered agent for an LLC in Texas can
be an individual resident, a Texas LLC or corporation, or an out-of-state (“foreign”) corporation or LLC
with an office in Texas. The LLC must keep a business office at the same address as its registered
office, and it must be a street address, not just a post office box or answering service.
If you need a registered agent in Texas, Incfile can provide that service.


Your LLC is “organized” when an original and one copy of the articles of organization are given to the Texas
Secretary of State’s office along with the filing fee, and their office confirms that they comply with state
requirements. Incfile will
submit these forms for you.
The Secretary of State endorses both copies, keeps the original, and returns the signed copy. The articles of
organization are effective as of the date and time they are filed unless a later date and time are
specified.
Step 3: Writing Your Operating Agreement
After you’ve filed your articles of incorporation, your LLC needs an operating agreement. This isn’t required by
state law, but it’s a critical internal document that officially explains how the LLC will operate. It
lists:

The members (see below for how membership works in a Texas LLC).
How much they have invested.
How profits are divided.
How much weight each member has when votes are taken.
It may also list standards for meetings (how much notice, what constitutes a quorum, rules for voting, etc.)
and so on, but is not required to do so.


A typical operating agreement also includes requirements mandated by the state of Texas, and can be amended or
repealed as specified by the agreement or applicable law.
How Membership Works in a Texas LLC
Texas LLCs must have at least one member, and each member must be a natural person (as opposed to a corporate entity). To become a member, an individual usually has to make a contribution, pay money, or transfer property to the LLC, or else assume an obligation to do so or render some kind of service.
A member can resign from an LLC, but only in the way specified in the articles of organization or operating agreement. These documents also usually specify a minimum period of time a member can be a member before being allowed to resign. LLCs have the option of penalizing a resigning member for damages suffered by the LLC due to his resignation.
Ongoing Requirements for LLCs in Texas - Including Taxes
Texas LLCs are required to file an annual report with the Texas Secretary of State including the following:

LLC name and the state where the LLC was organized (if not Texas).
Address of the registered office and the name of the registered agent.
Address of the principal LLC office.
Names and business addresses of the LLC’s managers.

The Texas Franchise Tax filing requirements state that you must file an annual Franchise Tax Report, and an Information Report. You must file additional forms if you take any credits on your report, file as a tiered partnership, or file as a combined group.
When you form your LLC with Incfile, we’ll send reminder emails about Texas’ ongoing requirements as the due dates approach.
How are LLC taxes handled in Texas? 
An LLC has some tax advantages when compared to a corporation, including the availability of more deductions. However, there is no requirement for an LLC to be a separate tax entity like a corporation. Instead, an LLC can be a “pass-through entity” when it comes to taxes, so that the LLC owner or owners report business losses or profits on their personal tax returns, in the same way that a partnership would.
The IRS treats single-member LLCs as sole proprietorships for tax purposes unless you choose for your LLC to be taxed as a corporation. This means the LLC itself does not pay taxes and does not have to file a tax return. The IRS treats multi-owned LLCs as partnerships for tax purposes, unless you choose for your LLC to be taxed as a corporation. This means that LLC owners each pay taxes on their lawful share of the profits on their personal income tax returns, not the LLC itself.
When starting a new LLC in Texas, you may need to obtain a federal tax identification or employment identification number (EIN). In most cases, you won’t need a separate EIN for your LLC if you are the sole owner and the LLC has no employees. However, if you are not the sole owner of the LLC, or if the LLC has employees, the LLC will need a separate EIN to open a bank account and to meet tax filing requirements.
Dissolution of an LLC in Texas
A Texas LLC is dissolved when any one of the following events occurs:

Event(s) specified in the articles of organization or operating agreement
There is an agreement to dissolve by the number or percentage of members specified in the operating
agreement

An event that makes it illegal for the LLC to continue to operate
When a member leaves the LLC, unless the remaining members agree to continue the LLC within 90 days, or the
company continues under specifications set out in the
operating agreement

Judicial decree ordering dissolution
