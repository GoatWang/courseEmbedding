Consumers Energy Company: $378 Million Securitization Bonds Offering

Thursday, July 24, 2014








Hunton & Williams LLP advised the joint book-running managers on an SEC-registered offering of $378,000,000 aggregate principal amount of senior secured securitization bonds by Consumers 2014 Securitization Funding LLC, issued pursuant to a securitization structure. The bond proceeds will be used by Consumers Energy Company (“Consumers”) to recover the remaining book value of certain coal-fired generating units. The bonds are a category of utility rate reduction bonds issued on behalf of public utilities. Approximately $50 billion of utility rate reduction bonds have been issued to date.



Consumers 2014 Securitization Funding LLC is a special purpose entity, wholly owned by Consumers, created solely for the purpose of issuing the bonds. The bonds were sold pursuant to a financing order of the Michigan Public Service Commission (“MPSC”), issued pursuant to enabling legislation. The bonds are secured by securitization property comprised of the rights and interests of Consumers under the financing order, which include the right to impose, collect and receive a special, irrevocable, nonbypassable charge, paid by retail electric customers of Consumers, or any successor, and the right to obtain annual and more frequent true-up adjustments to those charges. The securitization property was sold by Consumers to Consumers 2014 Securitization Funding LLC in connection with issuance of the bonds.

The Hunton & Williams LLP team included Michael Fitzpatrick, Adam O’Brian, Kevin Felz and Jason Harbour. Cary Tolley and Emily Winbigler provided tax advice.

NYT: Wells Fargo Pattern of Filing False Documents with Federal Court

livinglies.wordpress.com | June 15, 2017
It’s nice to see Gretchen Morgenson back on the beat of financial fraud. We need more exposure to what everyone who has battling foreclosures already knows — that virtually all of the documents relied upon by would-be foreclosers are false, fraudulent, fabricated and forged. These revelations appear to be the only way judges will stop allowing presumptions of false facts to dominate their rulings.

Most U.S. Homes are Worth Less than Before the Crash

Resecuritization
livinglies.wordpress.com | March 7, 2017 As predicted on my blog back in 2008, we are seeing new names of Trusts emerge in foreclosure cases — involving old loans that were declared in default years ago by parties asserting they represent the alleged servicer of either a named bank or servicer or an old trust. What happened? As our sources had revealed, the alleged trusts had nothing in them and were the source of extreme liability of the Master Servicer acting as underwriter to the investors and third parties who traded in securities based upon the representation that the Trust actually owned the debts of millions of homeowners.

Citigroup’s Crime Spree Against Americans Continues With Slaps on the Wrist
livinglies.wordpress.com | February 14, 2017 Last week, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) charged two units of the Wall Street mega bank, Citigroup, with insidious fraudulent acts against homeowners while it imposed a modest $28.8 million in relief and penalties. The penalty portion of $7.4 million is meaningless because this is a bank that serially breaks the law, laughs at its regulators, and, most outrageously, it was simultaneously engaging in heinous misdeeds against Americans while the U.S. government was using taxpayer money to bail out its failed business model of brazen financial frauds. The $7.4 million in fines also stands in contrast to the $14.9 billion that Citigroup reported as net income for 2016.

Governor Cuomo Announces $28 Million Fine Levied Against PHH Mortgage Corporation for Shoddy Mortgage Origination and Servicing Practices 
stopforeclosurefraud.com | November 14, 2016
Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced that PHH Mortgage Corporation and its affiliate, PHH Home Loans LLC, will pay a $28 million fine and engage a third-party auditor as part of a consent order for violations of federal and New York laws designed to protect homeowners. The consent order between the two companies and the Department of Financial Services was reached following a series of examinations that uncovered persistent shortcomings in their mortgage origination and servicing practices, including discrepancies in how mortgage foreclosures were documented and processed.

False Claims by False Claimants

Casting Doubt on Validity of Servicer Affidavits in Foreclosure Litigation 
livinglies.wordpress.com | November 4, 2016
Most institutional lenders, trusts and large financial institutions that loan money to borrowers or acquire distressed loans use loan servicers to service their loans after the loans are originated or otherwise assigned to them. Loan servicing is the process by which a lender uses a third party to, among other things, collect principal, interest and escrow payments from the borrower in connection with a loan.

Wells Fargo in Talks With Prosecutors Over Potential Mortgage Abuses 
wsj.com | November 3, 2016
              Wells Fargo & Co. is in talks with a group of federal and state prosecutors examining potential abuses related to mortgages as it continues to grapple with investigations and public outrage from its sales-practices scandal. The bank disclosed in its most recent quarterly securities filing posted Thursday that it is in discussions with the Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities Working Group of the Financial Fraud Enforcement Task Force. That group, which includes the Justice Department, has levied billions of dollars in fines on other big U.S. banks, including a $16.65 billion payout from Bank of America Corp. and $13 billion from J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.

Double Blind Foreclosure Scheme is Working for the Banks: States Quietly Resetting Title Across the Board 
livinglies.wordpress.com | November 3, 2016
The plain fact is that if homes were fraudulently foreclosed based upon void fabricated instruments, the foreclosure itself is void. That is what is true under current law. But states like Massachusetts have passed legislation that most homeowners neither know about nor understand. Their rights to possession and title to property that is still legally owned by them (if current law was applied) are again being foreclosed legislatively. This completes the bank scheme in which the TBTF banks received a windfall "profit" in the trillions that really was a double blind fraudulent scheme. Both investors and homeowners alike are the victims while the TBTF banks are the victors.

Are We Heading for Another Housing Crisis?
money.usnews.com | May 12, 2016
                Ten years ago, a storm was brewing in the housing market. Lenders were handing out mortgages seemingly to anyone who applied, and in many cases, borrowers weren't asked for documentation to prove income. Some institutions rolled out adjustable-rate mortgages that featured teaser rates and were marketed to consumers as loans that could be easily refinanced before the interest rate was scheduled to reset and send payments into the stratosphere.

California high court opens door to wrongful foreclosure suits 
latimes.com | March 6, 2016 
                During the bust that followed last decade's housing boom, hundreds of thousands of Californians lost their homes to foreclosure. It was a process later found to be rife with problems, such as overwhelmed bank employees who sometimes didn't even read the foreclosure documents in front of them. But challenging foreclosures on the basis of paperwork problems proved to be mostly futile, given California courts had ruled that borrowers who weren't paying their mortgages didn't suffer financial harm.

The Banks Business Model is Foreclosing on Homeowners 
March 2, 2016 
                Securitization is the reason banks want homeowners to foreclose. When a bank assigns the risk of a loan to the investors (certificate holders) of a Real Estate Investment Conduit Trust (SPV), the “bank” is no longer a traditional bank that gets the benefit of mortgage payments. Mortgage banks give as few modifications as possible and comply minimally with statutes put in place to protect borrowers, all while employing tricks to “cash in” on homeowners’ defaults, pushing them to foreclosure.

$5.4 Million! Jury Finds Wells Fargo Committed Fraud When It Used Robo-Signed Document 
i-uv.com | December 14, 2015
                Congratulations to the experts and attorneys on this. As Marie McDonnell states in the article reproduced below this case is important because it is the first time that Robo-signing has resulted in an award of damages for fraud. I would add that the lawyers must have done a fine job at trial — because ordinarily we don’t see jury instructions that would support punitive damages for robo-signing. The pages are turning on a new chapter.

Proof of Standing Required: Seffar v. Residential Credit Solutions Inc

It is NOT enough to ALLEGE standing. They must PROVE it. 
Judges across the country are making mistakes with this simple concept. Standing to SUE is presumed if you allege (in words or by incorporation of 
exhibits) that you have it. Possession of the “original note” can be alleged but at trial the foreclosing party must PROVE (not argue) that 
(1) they have the original note and (2) they have the right to enforce it either because they own it or because they have been authorized by a person who owns 
it or a person who has the right to enforce it.

Among a host of other issues, one of the critical things that contributed to the housing crisis of 2008 was the fact that speculative borrowers had nearly no “skin in the game.”  Anyone who decided they wanted a piece of the rapidly inflating housing bubble could go out and buy multiple houses with no money down or, in some cases, even do “cash out” purchases whereby banks would finance more than 100% of the purchase price leaving ‘buyers’ to pocket the excess.

Default, Foreclosure and the Impact on Physical and Mental Health Function

Neuroscientists have concluded that chronic stress and cortisol damage the brain.  Although there are no formal studies to date on the health ramifications of default, prolonged litigation, and post-foreclosure trauma, it would be safe to conclude that people who are exposed to chronic stress over an extended period of time are prone to mental issues like anxiety and mood disorders as well as physical illnesses.  The most common mental disorders in protracted litigation are post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety and depression that unfortunately result in altered brain structure and chemistry.

The Bank failed to prove the series of transactions through which it purportedly acquired the note from the indorsee and the judge ordered an involuntary dismissal.  However, because this is Florida and statute of limitations are not upheld, it is likely that Wells Fargo will have time to regroup, create a new strategy, and file to foreclose again on the tortured homeowners.

What happened? As our sources had revealed, the alleged trusts had nothing in them and were the source of extreme liability of the Master Servicer acting as underwriter to the investors and third parties who traded in securities based upon the representation that the Trust actually owned the debts of millions of homeowners.

Citigroup’s Crime Spree Against Americans Continues With Slaps on the Wrist
livinglies.wordpress.com | February 14, 2017 Last week, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) charged two units of the Wall Street mega bank, Citigroup, with insidious fraudulent acts against homeowners while it imposed a modest $28.8 million in relief and penalties. The penalty portion of $7.4 million is meaningless because this is a bank that serially breaks the law, laughs at its regulators, and, most outrageously, it was simultaneously engaging in heinous misdeeds against Americans while the U.S. government was using taxpayer money to bail out its failed business model of brazen financial frauds. The $7.4 million in fines also stands in contrast to the $14.9 billion that Citigroup reported as net income for 2016.

Trump’s Treasury pick says his bank didn’t ‘robo-sign.’ These court papers say it did.
thinkprogress.org | February 8, 2017 
              Before he was picked by President Trump to lead the Treasury Department, Steve Mnuchin ran a bank named OneWest, which foreclosed on tens of thousands of homeowners under his leadership. After his Senate hearing, he was asked specifically about the practice of robo-signing, which entails mortgage officials rapidly signing off on hundreds or thousands of foreclosure documents without verifying that the information is accurate or giving it a thorough review as required by law. Thus a bank can speed up the foreclosure process and, in some cases, get courts to let it take possession of a property with a full trial.

RESCISSION: It’s time for another slap on the wrist for state and federal judges

50 years ago Congress decided to slap punitive measures on lenders who ignore or attempt to go around (table-funded loans) existing laws on required disclosures --- instead of creating a super agency that would review every loan closing before it could be consummated. So it made the punishment so severe that only the stupidest lenders would attempt to violate Federal law. That worked for a while --- until the era of securitization fail. (Adam Levitin's term for illusion under the cloak of false securitization).

Are mortgage-backed securities backed by any guarantees? 
tradebuddy.online.com | January 31, 2017 
Actually, any mortgage-backed security (MBS) guarantee depends on who issued it. To review, an MBS is a security, created through the process of securitization, in which the underlying assets are loans made to individuals and companies who are using the funds to purchase buildings and homes. The mortgages are secured to the lender by the properties purchased by the borrowers and are often backed by some form of homeowners’ insurance. However, this insurance will only protect the issuer of the mortgages (mortgagee), and not the owners of an MBS that is issued using the same underlying mortgage. Therein lies part of the risk to MBS investors.

Federal Reserve Bankers Mocked Unemployed Americans Behind Closed Doors

In 2011, unemployment was at a near crisis level. The jobless rate was stuck around 9 percent nationally, an unusually high number due to the continuing effects of the financial crash. House Democrats were aghast. “With almost five unemployed Americans for every job opening, too many people remain jobless because of a lack of work, not a lack of wanting to work,” said Congressman Lloyd Doggett, D-Tex. So in early November 2011, they introduced a bill to reauthorize Federal unemployment benefits, an insurance program designed to aide those looking for work.

Moody’s Settlement with SEC Does Nothing for Homeowners 
livinglies.wordpress.org | January 20, 2017 
These settlements are a slap in the face to homeowners who were forced into battle with an over-reaching enemy supported by the government. We have acknowledgements of wrongdoing here by Moody's with respect to injury suffered by investors. But if the homeowners were not signing the false documents (the "loan contract") there would have been no "loans" and there would be no "derivatives", i.e., "securities" deriving their value from inactive or nonexistent trusts who issued certificates masked as "mortgage bonds."

Lawsuit Seeking Disgorgement Might Not Be Barred by Statute of Limitations 
livinglies.wordpress..com | January 15, 2017 
What is apparent here is that the Courts are coming to terms with the possibility that those relying upon a statute of limitation as a defense to various claims might NOT be protected by an otherwise applicable statute of limitations. The premise enunciated in a decision that seeks affirmation from the U.S. Supreme Court, is that disgorgement is not monetary damages or a penalty. It is an equitable finding that a party has been unjustly enriched and therefore has no present right to hold onto ill-gotten gains. The decision could result in elimination of the statute of limitations as a defense for the banks.

Chase-WAMU Letter Reveals "Expungement" and "Assignments" of Alleged Mortgages Not on the Books and Records of WAMU 
livinglies.wordpress..com | January 11, 2017 
There is an old saying on Wall Street that "Bulls make money, Bears make money but Pigs never do." The obvious circumstances of Chase claiming ownership to nonexistent loan portfolios contained within WAMU coupled with the admission in this letter to the FDIC, shows just how arrogant Chase felt when they informed the FDIC that they wanted to get paid by the FDIC for expunging documents and fabricating other instruments for "loans" that were not on the books and records of WAMU at the time of their purchase and sale agreement wherein Chase acquired the WAMU estate.

"Chase agreed to settle for only PART of the property tax owed. The bankruptcy court approved the settlement agreement so It is a done deal. Once I submitted your audit, in my amended objection to their proof of claim, they started talking about a settlement. Anyway, I am interested in taking your three day course at a future date. Thanks again."
