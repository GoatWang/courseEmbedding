Our Story







It began in a 12-foot by 20-foot building.









Houchens Industries began in 1917 with the Houchens Food Group when Ervin G. Houchens opened his first grocery store in a rural area of Kentucky. The potential of the small store was recognized as Houchens took the lead in promoting his stores by utilizing the latest innovations and theories in grocery management, and also by purchasing businesses that correlated to the grocery industry.

"The principle of trying to do something for your employees, is the same principle we apply today."
Jimmie Gipson
Chairman/CEO





Nearly a century later and more than 18,000 employees corporate-wide, Houchens Industries is one of the largest employee-owned companies in the United States. We maintain a widely diverse portfolio of holdings to support company growth and prosperity for our employee owners.

"We are basically looking for companies that are well run, have a good profitable history and have the mindset that they want to be part of something that is good for everyone."
Jimmie Gipson
Chairman/CEO

Our services help you solve legal issues, learn more about your legal situation, and navigate the legal process—all with ease.Your  guide to online legal researchIt's tough to know where to start when you're researching legal questions. With this guide, you'll be able to define your legal issue, research it, and get the help you need.Step 1: define your legal issueWhen you're just getting started, there are a few things to figure out about your legal issue—like, is it a criminal or civil case? Which laws apply—municipal, state, federal? And, what area of the law represents your issue? Once you have answers to these questions, you can start researching and learning about possible outcomes and next steps.Is this a true legal issue?First you need to determine whether you have a legal issue or simply a problem. Maybe you don't like your downstairs neighbor playing loud music during the day. But, if they're not breaking any laws, what you have is a personal matter, not a legal one.A legal problem is one that can be solved by using the law. It's an issue that's addressed within federal, state, or municipal laws and regulations.Can I sue?If you've determined that your problem is a legal one, you might be wondering if you can sue. While in theory you can pretty much sue anyone for anything, the reality is that doing so is often a waste of time and money. It's always a good idea to consult with an attorney to determine whether you can take your suit to court. You might consider mediation or arbitration first.The question should not be “Can I sue?” but “Should I sue?”Consider the following:Do you have a written contract with the party you want to sue? If you don't have a written contract, do you believe you had a clear agreement, even if it wasn't written down?Can you demonstrate that the party you want to sue violated their part of the agreement? Can you demonstrate that you held up your end?Do you think you have a good chance of winning?Is this a good use of your time and resources? Weigh the cons, like time, money, and stress against the possible pros, like justice and compensation. It's also worth determining if the party you're sueing has enough money to pay your claim.Is this a criminal matter or a civil matter?There are two main types of legal issues: criminal matters and civil matters. In criminal cases, the government prosecutes the case. In civil cases, the person bringing the suit hires an attorney to prosecute. If you've been arrested, you're looking at a criminal matter, but depending on the circumstances, it could be a civil matter as well.Civil lawsuits are easier to win because the burden of proof is lower. And it's not necessarily one or the other. There can be a criminal case and a civil case for the same matter. If you're considering whether or not to sue someone, or you have been sued, you're looking at a civil matter.There are two main types of legal issues: criminal matters and civil matters.What about municipal, state, and federal laws?Federal, state, and local governments each have their own sets of laws. Your legal issue will likely fall under one of these three categories. Depending on your issue, you may want to research all three.For any legal issue, make sure you do it in the correct court and consult with an attorney to figure out which court to file in.What practice area does it fall under?The best way to research your legal issue is to start by identifying the broad category that it falls under. You may have noticed that lawyers almost always associate themselves with “practice areas.” These are the areas they have particular experience and knowledge in. Common practice areas include, but are not limited to,  corporate law, criminal law, estate planning, employment law, personal injury, and business law. You probably wouldn't want to talk to a heart surgeon about a sprained ankle, and similarly, you probably don't want an attorney in criminal law to handle a divorce.Finding the most relevant practice area can be tricky. For instance, you know that your issue is about medical malpractice, but you may not know that it falls under the category of personal injury law. Or maybe you're in the middle of a situation—like, you've asked your landlord to add a disabled parking spot outside your building, and your landlord has refused. You could be looking into three separate topics: tenant/landlord laws, discrimination, and civil rights.If you still aren’t sure how to categorize your issue, you can ask a question about it or read recently asked questions on Avvo’s free Q&A forum.Step 2: research your legal issueOnce you've defined your legal issue, you can start researching online. It's helpful to begin by breaking down all the facts—this process will help you identify some important keywords that you can use to kick off your research.What are the facts?When researching a legal issue, many attorneys get to the facts of the case by using a common legal research method called TARP, which stands for thing, cause of action, relief sought, person/parties involved. You can do the same. TThingACause of ActionRRelief SoughtPPerson/Parties InvolvedStart with the thing. What's the subject matter? It could be one thing, for example—a divorce. Or it could be a couple things like divorce plus child custody.Then look at the cause of action. That is, how were you wronged under the law? This may be an issue like negligence, breach of contract, fraud, or slander.Next is relief sought. Relief could be monetary compensation for covering costs associated with the issue or for pain and suffering. Or it could be to prevent the defendant from engaging in certain behavior again.Finally, person/parties involved. Who are the players? What are their roles? What are their relationships to each other? For example: employer-employee; father-son; or neighbor-neighbor.Now that you know what kind of issue you have, what category it falls under, and what the basic facts are, you're ready to begin solving your legal puzzle.How do I research my legal issue online?Here are step-by-step instructions to researching online.Start with Avvo. You'll find plenty of free legal advice in Avvo's guides with information on over 1,000 legal topics and over 7 million questions and answers. Just remember that laws can vary significantly from state to state. When researching online, don't rely on information about another state's laws, as it may not be relevant to your situation.Look up your local court system. Simply search Google for “[your city] court.” This is often the place to get information on traffic court and family court in your area. You can also get info on state and federal courts at USCourts.gov.Learn more from your local Bar association. Search Google for your state or county Bar association. The association's website will often have resources for the public.Dig into the laws themselves. The Legal Information Institute at Cornell has laws organized by location and topic, plus online legal advice to help you interpret them. Also try searching “[your state] laws,” as your state will have local resources.If you get stuck, you can quickly check with an attorney to explain what you've found.Step 3: resolve your issueResolution can come in many forms—after doing your research, you may decide to handle it yourself or decide that it's not worth pursuing. Or, you may seek additional clarification or legal advice before making a move. Or, you may be convinced that you need to hire a lawyer right away. The main thing to know is that you have options.Can I do it myself?If you want to do it yourself (DIY), it's your right to be your own representative in legal matters. This is called pro se legal representation, from the Latin meaning “for oneself.” It's fairly common in uncontested divorces and in small claims courts (especially in states that prohibit lawyers in small claims court).In certain matters, attorneys are required by law, whether you want one or not. In most cases, it's a good idea to get some input from a lawyer regardless.The fact is, you don't know what you don't know, and that's ok. Speaking with an attorney—even just for a quick consultation—could give you insight into how to move forward and peace of mind.If you want to forge ahead and handle your legal issue yourself, do your research and come up with a plan. If you want to talk to an attorney, some offer free consultations, but these sessions are usually used as a way to get to know each other and talk about whether you have a case. If you want quick legal advice, you can always get on the phone with a lawyer with Avvo Advisor—it's a 15-minute conversation with a lawyer for $39.If I hire a lawyer, what can I expect?When you hire a lawyer, you're hiring someone to represent you. Depending on your issue, your lawyer may represent you in litigation (in court) or in mediation/arbitration proceedings. Or they may create, review, process, or file documents.Even more importantly, your lawyer will give you advice, proactively work for your interests, and anticipate problems that you may not see coming.Many attorneys provide free consultations to new clients to see if there's a good fit between need and expertise.When you decide to hire an attorney, do your due diligence and take a look at Avvo's guide to finding and hiring a great lawyer.This may all sound overwhelming, but with a little work you'll have a better understanding of what to do and how to take action.

Operations[edit]
The company is best known as a grocer, owning and operating convenience stores (Jr. Food Stores, Tobacco Shoppe) and supermarkets (Houchens Markets, IGA, Save-A-Lot, Mad Butcher and most recently Price Less Foods/Price Less IGA). In 2004, Houchens acquired Food Giant supermarkets, which operates stores under the Food Giant, Market Place and Piggly Wiggly name.[3]
In recent years, Houchens Industries has diversified greatly, with acquisitions of a Bowling Green-based construction company, as well as recycling, insurance, cigarette manufacturing, and warehousing.
Price Less Foods/Price Less IGA is the newest brand of stores to join Houchens.
Price Less Foods and Price Less IGA[edit]
Price Less Foods and Price Less IGA are a chain supermarkets located in Alabama, Kentucky, Illinois, Indiana, Tennessee and Virginia. They operate on a cost-plus format. They price their products at the cost and then add 10 percent to the final cost at the checkout. They do not have rewards cards or weekly sales ads. The only difference between Price Less Foods and Price Less IGA is that "Foods" does not sell IGA brand products. They sell Best Choice and Always Save brands as well as other top national brands. They currently have 28 locations, and are expanding. [4]
History[edit]




Houchens first store


The company traces its beginnings to 1917, when founder Ervin Houchens opened his first store ("BG Wholesale") at the age of 19 in a shed in southern Kentucky. This shed, along with other historical structures, has been well preserved and is open to the public. He sold the company in 1983.[2] The current CEO, Jimmie Gibson, started with the company in 1965, as an accountant.[2]
In 2004, Houchens acquired Hitcents, an Internet marketing and development company founded by two high school students from Bowling Green, and now headquartered at Hitcents Park Plaza in Downtown Bowling Green.
In 2007, the company sold its Commonwealth Brands subsidiary - the fourth-largest cigarette producer in the United States - to the British company Imperial Tobacco Group PLC, for $1.9 billion. It had acquired the company from its founder Brad Kelley in 2001; it was the first time that Houchens had ever sold one of its acquisitions.[2]
Diversification continued in 2007 when Houchens announced that it would acquire Hilliard Lyons, a full-service stock broker and investment firm based in Louisville, from PNC Financial Services.[5] The sale was completed in March 2008.[6]
In January 2008, Houchens announced that it would acquire 14 convenience stores which sell Shell Oil products from Bowling Green businessman Jerry Browning. The stores are located in Bowling Green and surrounding towns.[7]
In April 2008, Buehler Foods of Jasper, Indiana, signed a letter of intent to sell the company to Houchens.[8]
In July 2008, Houchens acquired juice maker Tampico Beverages.[9]
In January 2010, White's Fresh Foods, in the Tri-Cities, Tennessee area sold their local grocery chain to Houchens.[10]
Other[edit]

The company has been completely owned by its employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) since 1988. Employees select members of the board of directors and vote on the sale of any substantial assets.[2]
Houchens Industries sponsors the annual Kentucky High School Athletic Association's Girls' "Sweet 16" Basketball Championship Tournament, held annually at WKU's E.A. Diddle Arena.
Houchens also contributes heavily to the community, most notably Western Kentucky University, even having acquiring naming rights to WKU's football home, Houchens Industries-L. T. Smith Stadium in Bowling Green.

An ESOP provides employees with an opportunity to contribute to the success of the retirement plan.The value of the ESOP shares is determined by the total appraised value of the company at the end of each fiscal year.ESOPs are regulated by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act [ERISA], a federal law that sets minimum standards for investment plans in private industry.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

Our Story







It began in a 12-foot by 20-foot building.









Houchens Industries began in 1917 with the Houchens Food Group when Ervin G. Houchens opened his first grocery store in a rural area of Kentucky. The potential of the small store was recognized as Houchens took the lead in promoting his stores by utilizing the latest innovations and theories in grocery management, and also by purchasing businesses that correlated to the grocery industry.

"The principle of trying to do something for your employees, is the same principle we apply today."
Jimmie Gipson
Chairman/CEO





Nearly a century later and more than 18,000 employees corporate-wide, Houchens Industries is one of the largest employee-owned companies in the United States. We maintain a widely diverse portfolio of holdings to support company growth and prosperity for our employee owners.

"We are basically looking for companies that are well run, have a good profitable history and have the mindset that they want to be part of something that is good for everyone."
Jimmie Gipson
Chairman/CEO

Operations[edit]
The company is best known as a grocer, owning and operating convenience stores (Jr. Food Stores, Tobacco Shoppe) and supermarkets (Houchens Markets, IGA, Save-A-Lot, Mad Butcher and most recently Price Less Foods/Price Less IGA). In 2004, Houchens acquired Food Giant supermarkets, which operates stores under the Food Giant, Market Place and Piggly Wiggly name.[3]
In recent years, Houchens Industries has diversified greatly, with acquisitions of a Bowling Green-based construction company, as well as recycling, insurance, cigarette manufacturing, and warehousing.
Price Less Foods/Price Less IGA is the newest brand of stores to join Houchens.
Price Less Foods and Price Less IGA[edit]
Price Less Foods and Price Less IGA are a chain supermarkets located in Alabama, Kentucky, Illinois, Indiana, Tennessee and Virginia. They operate on a cost-plus format. They price their products at the cost and then add 10 percent to the final cost at the checkout. They do not have rewards cards or weekly sales ads. The only difference between Price Less Foods and Price Less IGA is that "Foods" does not sell IGA brand products. They sell Best Choice and Always Save brands as well as other top national brands. They currently have 28 locations, and are expanding. [4]
History[edit]




Houchens first store


The company traces its beginnings to 1917, when founder Ervin Houchens opened his first store ("BG Wholesale") at the age of 19 in a shed in southern Kentucky. This shed, along with other historical structures, has been well preserved and is open to the public. He sold the company in 1983.[2] The current CEO, Jimmie Gibson, started with the company in 1965, as an accountant.[2]
In 2004, Houchens acquired Hitcents, an Internet marketing and development company founded by two high school students from Bowling Green, and now headquartered at Hitcents Park Plaza in Downtown Bowling Green.
In 2007, the company sold its Commonwealth Brands subsidiary - the fourth-largest cigarette producer in the United States - to the British company Imperial Tobacco Group PLC, for $1.9 billion. It had acquired the company from its founder Brad Kelley in 2001; it was the first time that Houchens had ever sold one of its acquisitions.[2]
Diversification continued in 2007 when Houchens announced that it would acquire Hilliard Lyons, a full-service stock broker and investment firm based in Louisville, from PNC Financial Services.[5] The sale was completed in March 2008.[6]
In January 2008, Houchens announced that it would acquire 14 convenience stores which sell Shell Oil products from Bowling Green businessman Jerry Browning. The stores are located in Bowling Green and surrounding towns.[7]
In April 2008, Buehler Foods of Jasper, Indiana, signed a letter of intent to sell the company to Houchens.[8]
In July 2008, Houchens acquired juice maker Tampico Beverages.[9]
In January 2010, White's Fresh Foods, in the Tri-Cities, Tennessee area sold their local grocery chain to Houchens.[10]
Other[edit]

The company has been completely owned by its employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) since 1988. Employees select members of the board of directors and vote on the sale of any substantial assets.[2]
Houchens Industries sponsors the annual Kentucky High School Athletic Association's Girls' "Sweet 16" Basketball Championship Tournament, held annually at WKU's E.A. Diddle Arena.
Houchens also contributes heavily to the community, most notably Western Kentucky University, even having acquiring naming rights to WKU's football home, Houchens Industries-L. T. Smith Stadium in Bowling Green.

He sold the company in 1983.[2] The current CEO, Jimmie Gibson, started with the company in 1965, as an accountant.[2]
In 2004, Houchens acquired Hitcents, an Internet marketing and development company founded by two high school students from Bowling Green, and now headquartered at Hitcents Park Plaza in Downtown Bowling Green.
In 2007, the company sold its Commonwealth Brands subsidiary - the fourth-largest cigarette producer in the United States - to the British company Imperial Tobacco Group PLC, for $1.9 billion. It had acquired the company from its founder Brad Kelley in 2001; it was the first time that Houchens had ever sold one of its acquisitions.[2]
Diversification continued in 2007 when Houchens announced that it would acquire Hilliard Lyons, a full-service stock broker and investment firm based in Louisville, from PNC Financial Services.[5] The sale was completed in March 2008.[6]
In January 2008, Houchens announced that it would acquire 14 convenience stores which sell Shell Oil products from Bowling Green businessman Jerry Browning. The stores are located in Bowling Green and surrounding towns.[7]
In April 2008, Buehler Foods of Jasper, Indiana, signed a letter of intent to sell the company to Houchens.[8]
In July 2008, Houchens acquired juice maker Tampico Beverages.[9]
In January 2010, White's Fresh Foods, in the Tri-Cities, Tennessee area sold their local grocery chain to Houchens.[10]
Other[edit]

The company has been completely owned by its employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) since 1988. Employees select members of the board of directors and vote on the sale of any substantial assets.[2]
Houchens Industries sponsors the annual Kentucky High School Athletic Association's Girls' "Sweet 16" Basketball Championship Tournament, held annually at WKU's E.A. Diddle Arena.
Houchens also contributes heavily to the community, most notably Western Kentucky University, even having acquiring naming rights to WKU's football home, Houchens Industries-L. T. Smith Stadium in Bowling Green.

I lost the check in the ATM. I expected at least the check should have come out if ATM crashed , my debit card came out the machine but not the check.  

I called the helpline on the ATM machine but didn't get the answer from the support. I logged the complain with bank of america same night. I got a call from their support in the morning but they didn't assure me of anything and promised to put some deposit in my account so I can carry out my other dependent transaction on the check. They didn't keep the promise and my account doesn't show any activity or deposit or even mention of the check.  

I want to sue the bank,  I am not able to sleep now
if this is valid case please call me on number 925-640-6805 Is it possible to force a buy out for a business partner who is harassing and threatening you?Asked in Washington, DC - Jul 26, 2017 - 2 attorney answers I have a LLC business in DC. I had a personal relationship with the Co-Owner that soured. They are now threatening me, and threatening to release my personal information and life details to clients. It's a 51/49 partnership with me holding the majority.

I'd rather not dissolve if I can. I've tried to maintain professional and cordial contact with my partner, but they've made it clear that they intend to hurt regardless if the business follows suit.

We are a small business that contracts with clients, and hire independent contractors to fulfill some of our obligations, in the even of a dissolution what happens to the clients and contractors?

Also, I paid for the start up cost, including registering our business name would I be able to keep the business name if both came up with it but I paid for it? MY DIVORCE & HUSBAND BORROWED MONEY  FROM MY FATHER?Asked in Montclair, NJ - Jul 26, 2017 - 3 attorney answers In 2012 ,My father lend $51,000 to my husband in cash with the purpuse my husband wanted to own a construction & cleaning company to render services to banks with houses in forclosure & hetold my father he will pay him as soon he generates the money from such as company which never took place.I had my own business from 2010-2011 but I got sick, i could not handle my business any longer& later 2015 i got disabled. i gave my business to husband from 2011 to 2017 he registered it only in his name with my consent, in the last 3 years he hided all the business bank statements&never disclosed the business profit & inever got apenny from it & he never worked at the business, always hired people to work in his behalf, now 2017 he planned break up w/me, i told my dad promptly to stop himleaving with the $$ owned to father,both went tothebank, he requestd a certified check onmy father'sname, after the check was given, wants todivorce me,he is acting verywisely due that father trusted him & never provided a loan contract or writting for the loan. Now divorce is in procress, he is claiming half of the money from my father's check as marital assets due that there is not a loan proof.  How can I secure my interest in a vehicle in my spouse's name that I make payments on?Asked in Richmond, VA - Jul 25, 2017 - 3 attorney answers My wife and I are likely to divorce.  Both vehicles are in her name in loans she took applied for due to higher income and best credit.  We currently live separately but are not legally separated.  Recently, a power-play was utilized to get me to do something I didn't want to do, and a threat was made to report as stolen the vehicle I drive and make payments on (even though it was not stolen nor was it even requested nor demanded that I relinquish it). 

This has made me very uncomfortable.  I wish to keep the vehicle, as it's new, but I do not want to make large payments into something that can be pulled from me on a whim, or, worse, used as leverage in false felony allegations of theft or unauthorized use.  

What options do I have, while the vehicle is and must remain in her name (I can't get reasonable financing for it that comes anywhere close to its current factory financing rate), in terms of a potential notarized letter, or contract between us that might protect me from another (but actualized) emotional triggering where "my" vehicle is used as leverage or false allegations of theft or unauthorized use might be utilized against me?  Do I need a lawyer for this? Can I advertise local businesses without their consent, even if It benefits their business as well as mine ?Asked in Stockton, CA - Jul 25, 2017 - 4 attorney answers I want to market local businesses in and around my city, however I am not sure if i can just grab their contact information that is already advertised on their trucks as well as in the yellow pages. I simply want to market directly to customers without altering their own words that they have used in place with other advertising agencies.  Should I receive an injunction for trespassing?Asked in Winter Haven, FL - Jul 25, 2017 - 3 attorney answers A Sheriff's Officer spoke to me concerning an issue I'd had with a Winn Dixie worker month's back.  Although the Officer is aware that there'd been no contact between me and the individual, and this individual will be leaving soon, he stated that the Winn Dixie Regional Manager and a Resident Manager request that I not visit that location ever again.  Shouldn't I receive an injunction for trespass or some other court order, or do I just take the Sheriff's word? Why File your Corporation or LLC in CaliforniaWritten by attorney Gerald Prettyman - Jul 25, 2017There are several benefits for businesses located in California to file in California.Restrictive Covenant when selling a business in the trade industry?Asked in Alexandria, VA - Jul 25, 2017 - 4 attorney answers I recently sold my nail salon business to another person.  I worked there as a technician as well during my ownership and now as an employee/former owner.  The sales agreement has a restrictive covenant  which states: "Sellers further, jointly and severally, covenant that neither any of the Sellers not any business in which any of the Sellers shall solicit trade from the Business for a period of Five Years."  I want to quit the nail salon and go work for another one but I have built up quite a huge clientele list.  How do I notify my clients that I am leaving and will be working for another salon without violating the restrictive covenant?  I am told that handing out personal business cards with my name and number would be considered soliciting and (of course), telling my customers that if they want to see me in the future, to go to the new salon.  I would not worry about this so much but unfortunately, I suspect the person I sold my business to is now trying to keep me from leaving because she is aware that my clientele will follow. I signed a contract that had a clause in it. The clause said both parties had to agree to part ways before a certain date. Asked in Dallas, TX - Jul 25, 2017 - 3 attorney answers I worked as an independent contractor with a signed contract for one year. The contract had a stipulation to where either I or the client could cancel the contract before a certain named date with both parties in agreement. The client canceled the contract after the date stating it was basically because I took non competing side work, which the contract said I could do. She now owes me over $16K of non payment. Is this a cut and dry case? I sent her an email asking for my payout and she had her lawyer respond with all of these other reasons for canceling the contract. They do however avoid the conversation of the fact she did not cancel the contract in the manner she outlined. If I would have left after the date I would have owed her instead. What is my next step? Gathering evidence to presumed ANSWERs. Asked in Granger, WA - Jul 25, 2017 - 3 attorney answers I have filed a Summons&Complaint Form, Proof of Service,3copies to LNI along with fee via certified mail.Summary: Came into a written contract with a Licensed Contractor for addition to my home, remodel of existing bathroom, kitchen and bedrooms. Total cost was $50,000 in which $35,000 was due prior to commencing project. A week later a such amount was handed to him, 3 weeks later he Submitted the application for building permit. 5 individuals were later witnessed in my home knocking down walls, removing existing windows,a big machine used for cutting was being used inside my home.it was founded these individuals were not licensed. 7 months later foundation to addition was completed. 9 months later the framing was completed. 11 months later siding and roofing were semi completed. In between these months he asked for an additional 3,500 & advanced payment of $7,000 for material. It's been 2 months with no word from him. 
Now, I await 20 days Defendant has to file his ANDWERS. 
Will the photos I have of the poor quality of work he did help me in court? This includes incomplete exterior work, trusses left outside for 6 months exposed to rain, heavy snow. Do I have a case?  How to sue my father's insurance?Asked in Colorado Springs, CO - Jul 25, 2017 - 4 attorney answers I was injured on my father's rental property, where to begin a claim with his insurance. I can't go through him, he is unwilling to assist me with everything. He has an insurance policy that will cover up to 300k, which would help with my medical issues and personal as well as business losses resulting from said accident.  Can I use copyrighted fabrics for an online business?Asked in Marysville, WA - Jul 24, 2017 - 4 attorney answers The product that I want to sell is wall art using copyrighted fabric.    I buy the material from Joanns Craft stores and use the material to cover an blank art canvas.  When a contract is signed but the companies name is not spelled correctly, can it be nullified?Asked in Sacramento, CA - Jul 24, 2017 - 3 attorney answers Example: People Law Assistant Group is written as Law Assistant Group.

The top of the paper says People Law Assistant Group and the address but the contract starts with:

I __________ does hereby employ the services of Law Assistant Group, (hereinafter identified as THE GROUP), as my designated representative to represent me in my personal injury claim.......! A client has 34 day past due invoice. She paid an initial deposit but will not respond to any calls or emails. Should I sue?Asked in Newport News, VA - Jul 24, 2017 - 3 attorney answers I have a client that agreed to pay me $795.00 for Full Wedding Planning service. The day of her initial consultation she signed her contract and paid her $150.00 deposit, which I require before I begin services. I sent an invoice to her on 13 June 17 for $75.00.  Since sending the invoice she texted me and told me that she would pay on 22 June 17 but she and her fiance have called the wedding off and she would still make the rest of her payments. I have a cancellation clause in my contract that reads, "Cancellation Policy – If event is canceled, no portion of the fees paid to Consultant will be returned. If event is canceled, full payment will be required to compensate for hours of service already rendered and loss of event date. If the event is postponed, services contracted can be applied to a new date if available (refer to Postponement Policy)."  I have sent multiple emails, calls, and texts, but she is unresponsive. She still owes a remaining balance of $645.00. Can I terminate her contract? Can I file a lawsuit and if I do can I file it for the entire balance due or just the past due invoice??

My parents plan to register as a sole proprietorship and appoint me as registered agent. I will be the only family member living in the house and we will rent out the 2 other bedrooms and the basement.

Operations[edit]
The company is best known as a grocer, owning and operating convenience stores (Jr. Food Stores, Tobacco Shoppe) and supermarkets (Houchens Markets, IGA, Save-A-Lot, Mad Butcher and most recently Price Less Foods/Price Less IGA). In 2004, Houchens acquired Food Giant supermarkets, which operates stores under the Food Giant, Market Place and Piggly Wiggly name.[3]
In recent years, Houchens Industries has diversified greatly, with acquisitions of a Bowling Green-based construction company, as well as recycling, insurance, cigarette manufacturing, and warehousing.
Price Less Foods/Price Less IGA is the newest brand of stores to join Houchens.
Price Less Foods and Price Less IGA[edit]
Price Less Foods and Price Less IGA are a chain supermarkets located in Alabama, Kentucky, Illinois, Indiana, Tennessee and Virginia. They operate on a cost-plus format. They price their products at the cost and then add 10 percent to the final cost at the checkout. They do not have rewards cards or weekly sales ads. The only difference between Price Less Foods and Price Less IGA is that "Foods" does not sell IGA brand products. They sell Best Choice and Always Save brands as well as other top national brands. They currently have 28 locations, and are expanding. [4]
History[edit]




Houchens first store


The company traces its beginnings to 1917, when founder Ervin Houchens opened his first store ("BG Wholesale") at the age of 19 in a shed in southern Kentucky. This shed, along with other historical structures, has been well preserved and is open to the public. He sold the company in 1983.[2] The current CEO, Jimmie Gibson, started with the company in 1965, as an accountant.[2]
In 2004, Houchens acquired Hitcents, an Internet marketing and development company founded by two high school students from Bowling Green, and now headquartered at Hitcents Park Plaza in Downtown Bowling Green.
In 2007, the company sold its Commonwealth Brands subsidiary - the fourth-largest cigarette producer in the United States - to the British company Imperial Tobacco Group PLC, for $1.9 billion. It had acquired the company from its founder Brad Kelley in 2001; it was the first time that Houchens had ever sold one of its acquisitions.[2]
Diversification continued in 2007 when Houchens announced that it would acquire Hilliard Lyons, a full-service stock broker and investment firm based in Louisville, from PNC Financial Services.[5] The sale was completed in March 2008.[6]
In January 2008, Houchens announced that it would acquire 14 convenience stores which sell Shell Oil products from Bowling Green businessman Jerry Browning. The stores are located in Bowling Green and surrounding towns.[7]
In April 2008, Buehler Foods of Jasper, Indiana, signed a letter of intent to sell the company to Houchens.[8]
In July 2008, Houchens acquired juice maker Tampico Beverages.[9]
In January 2010, White's Fresh Foods, in the Tri-Cities, Tennessee area sold their local grocery chain to Houchens.[10]
Other[edit]

The company has been completely owned by its employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) since 1988. Employees select members of the board of directors and vote on the sale of any substantial assets.[2]
Houchens Industries sponsors the annual Kentucky High School Athletic Association's Girls' "Sweet 16" Basketball Championship Tournament, held annually at WKU's E.A. Diddle Arena.
Houchens also contributes heavily to the community, most notably Western Kentucky University, even having acquiring naming rights to WKU's football home, Houchens Industries-L. T. Smith Stadium in Bowling Green.

Operations[edit]
The company is best known as a grocer, owning and operating convenience stores (Jr. Food Stores, Tobacco Shoppe) and supermarkets (Houchens Markets, IGA, Save-A-Lot, Mad Butcher and most recently Price Less Foods/Price Less IGA). In 2004, Houchens acquired Food Giant supermarkets, which operates stores under the Food Giant, Market Place and Piggly Wiggly name.[3]
In recent years, Houchens Industries has diversified greatly, with acquisitions of a Bowling Green-based construction company, as well as recycling, insurance, cigarette manufacturing, and warehousing.
Price Less Foods/Price Less IGA is the newest brand of stores to join Houchens.
Price Less Foods and Price Less IGA[edit]
Price Less Foods and Price Less IGA are a chain supermarkets located in Alabama, Kentucky, Illinois, Indiana, Tennessee and Virginia. They operate on a cost-plus format. They price their products at the cost and then add 10 percent to the final cost at the checkout. They do not have rewards cards or weekly sales ads. The only difference between Price Less Foods and Price Less IGA is that "Foods" does not sell IGA brand products. They sell Best Choice and Always Save brands as well as other top national brands. They currently have 28 locations, and are expanding. [4]
History[edit]




Houchens first store


The company traces its beginnings to 1917, when founder Ervin Houchens opened his first store ("BG Wholesale") at the age of 19 in a shed in southern Kentucky. This shed, along with other historical structures, has been well preserved and is open to the public. He sold the company in 1983.[2] The current CEO, Jimmie Gibson, started with the company in 1965, as an accountant.[2]
In 2004, Houchens acquired Hitcents, an Internet marketing and development company founded by two high school students from Bowling Green, and now headquartered at Hitcents Park Plaza in Downtown Bowling Green.
In 2007, the company sold its Commonwealth Brands subsidiary - the fourth-largest cigarette producer in the United States - to the British company Imperial Tobacco Group PLC, for $1.9 billion. It had acquired the company from its founder Brad Kelley in 2001; it was the first time that Houchens had ever sold one of its acquisitions.[2]
Diversification continued in 2007 when Houchens announced that it would acquire Hilliard Lyons, a full-service stock broker and investment firm based in Louisville, from PNC Financial Services.[5] The sale was completed in March 2008.[6]
In January 2008, Houchens announced that it would acquire 14 convenience stores which sell Shell Oil products from Bowling Green businessman Jerry Browning. The stores are located in Bowling Green and surrounding towns.[7]
In April 2008, Buehler Foods of Jasper, Indiana, signed a letter of intent to sell the company to Houchens.[8]
In July 2008, Houchens acquired juice maker Tampico Beverages.[9]
In January 2010, White's Fresh Foods, in the Tri-Cities, Tennessee area sold their local grocery chain to Houchens.[10]
Other[edit]

The company has been completely owned by its employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) since 1988. Employees select members of the board of directors and vote on the sale of any substantial assets.[2]
Houchens Industries sponsors the annual Kentucky High School Athletic Association's Girls' "Sweet 16" Basketball Championship Tournament, held annually at WKU's E.A. Diddle Arena.
Houchens also contributes heavily to the community, most notably Western Kentucky University, even having acquiring naming rights to WKU's football home, Houchens Industries-L. T. Smith Stadium in Bowling Green.

Operations[edit]
The company is best known as a grocer, owning and operating convenience stores (Jr. Food Stores, Tobacco Shoppe) and supermarkets (Houchens Markets, IGA, Save-A-Lot, Mad Butcher and most recently Price Less Foods/Price Less IGA). In 2004, Houchens acquired Food Giant supermarkets, which operates stores under the Food Giant, Market Place and Piggly Wiggly name.[3]
In recent years, Houchens Industries has diversified greatly, with acquisitions of a Bowling Green-based construction company, as well as recycling, insurance, cigarette manufacturing, and warehousing.
Price Less Foods/Price Less IGA is the newest brand of stores to join Houchens.
Price Less Foods and Price Less IGA[edit]
Price Less Foods and Price Less IGA are a chain supermarkets located in Alabama, Kentucky, Illinois, Indiana, Tennessee and Virginia. They operate on a cost-plus format. They price their products at the cost and then add 10 percent to the final cost at the checkout. They do not have rewards cards or weekly sales ads. The only difference between Price Less Foods and Price Less IGA is that "Foods" does not sell IGA brand products. They sell Best Choice and Always Save brands as well as other top national brands. They currently have 28 locations, and are expanding. [4]
History[edit]




Houchens first store


The company traces its beginnings to 1917, when founder Ervin Houchens opened his first store ("BG Wholesale") at the age of 19 in a shed in southern Kentucky. This shed, along with other historical structures, has been well preserved and is open to the public. He sold the company in 1983.[2] The current CEO, Jimmie Gibson, started with the company in 1965, as an accountant.[2]
In 2004, Houchens acquired Hitcents, an Internet marketing and development company founded by two high school students from Bowling Green, and now headquartered at Hitcents Park Plaza in Downtown Bowling Green.
In 2007, the company sold its Commonwealth Brands subsidiary - the fourth-largest cigarette producer in the United States - to the British company Imperial Tobacco Group PLC, for $1.9 billion. It had acquired the company from its founder Brad Kelley in 2001; it was the first time that Houchens had ever sold one of its acquisitions.[2]
Diversification continued in 2007 when Houchens announced that it would acquire Hilliard Lyons, a full-service stock broker and investment firm based in Louisville, from PNC Financial Services.[5] The sale was completed in March 2008.[6]
In January 2008, Houchens announced that it would acquire 14 convenience stores which sell Shell Oil products from Bowling Green businessman Jerry Browning. The stores are located in Bowling Green and surrounding towns.[7]
In April 2008, Buehler Foods of Jasper, Indiana, signed a letter of intent to sell the company to Houchens.[8]
In July 2008, Houchens acquired juice maker Tampico Beverages.[9]
In January 2010, White's Fresh Foods, in the Tri-Cities, Tennessee area sold their local grocery chain to Houchens.[10]
Other[edit]

The company has been completely owned by its employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) since 1988. Employees select members of the board of directors and vote on the sale of any substantial assets.[2]
Houchens Industries sponsors the annual Kentucky High School Athletic Association's Girls' "Sweet 16" Basketball Championship Tournament, held annually at WKU's E.A. Diddle Arena.
Houchens also contributes heavily to the community, most notably Western Kentucky University, even having acquiring naming rights to WKU's football home, Houchens Industries-L. T. Smith Stadium in Bowling Green.
