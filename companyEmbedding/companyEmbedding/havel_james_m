Welcome to Havel's
TRY OUR LOW PRICED ECHOSTIMŽ FOR FREESafer more effective Peripheral Nerve Blocks are also more affordable with Havels market leading EchoStimŽ Echogenic Insulated needles.  The EchoStimŽ has 4 rows of 4 bright reflectors near the tip to help you identify the needle under ultrasound, and most say they are priced $4 or $5 less than our competitors needles.The EchoStimŽ 4x4 reflector pattern puts 16 reflectors in the first 5.5mm of the needle.  This allows you focus on the tip, which is the most important part of the needle.  Other needles have reflectors as far as 20mm up the shaft, which adds to the price and could lead to a false assumption as to the tips location if the actual tip is somehow obscured or out of plane.  An abundance of reflectors could also cause a cloud or halo around the needle, which in some cases could possibly blur the target.  Dont pay for reflectors you dont need.  Instead, focus on the tip with Havels EchoStimŽ.Havels is proud to be the exclusive distributor of HakkoŽ Medical, Japan, the manufacturer of innovative spinal and procedure needles trusted by doctors the world over.

Micro Flannel Micro Flannel® is an innovative new fabrication with unique features and benefits. This patent pending construction has an amazingly soft and luxurious feel. It offers warmth, without the weight of bulky fleece sheet sets. Micro Flannel® has received 5 star reviews from our Retail Partners’ customers. They were rated “Tester’s Choice for Softness” by the Good Housekeeping Research Institute in their March 2012 issue. This wonderful fabric does not shrink or pill, it is wrinkle resistant and fits your bed like a glove. Micro Flannel® envelopes you in a soft and cozy comfort that keeps your body at a consistent temperature! It creates a wonderful ambient cocoon for a perfect sleeping environment. Our Micro Flannel® sheet sets are easy care, with quick wash and quick dry benefit that can save you money on your energy bills.

 
RV Bedding Life on the open road can still be luxurious with our RV bedding sheets. You won't hit any bumps along the way with our comfortable specially sized bedding and sheet sets for your RV, Camper & Motorhome! Whether you have bunk or short queen mattresses, we have a selection of bunk and short queen sheet sets that will fit your home away from home just perfectly. Luxuriously skin-soft 100% polyester, Micro Flannel® RV sheets, high thread count and anti-pill features deliver the warmth and delight you deserve. For affordable, easy-care thermal coziness,  the fine finish of Micro Fiber RV sheets deliver comfort for both body and budget. 

 
Ultra Velvet Blankets The softest, most luxurious throw and blanket, one touch and you will never put it down. Ultra Velvet is a double face heavy raschel knit fabric that is bound together with a dyed to match whipstitch binding. Offered in a complete palette of soft muted pastels and deep jewel tones, the pile adds a gentle sheen to the surface. The throws and blankets are warm and cuddly whether on your sofa or in your favorite chair, or on your bed, you will be amazed at the quality!

 
Throws Hi Pile Raschel Knits are offered as throws in two sizes. Designs range from our popular wildlife animals to more home decorator patterns. Each has deep saturated colors that will not fade over time! The throws are soft and luxurious with a wonderful feel and great thermal qualities. Our Hi Pile throws are versatile and can be used in many ways. Bring color to any room by throwing it over the sofa or chair in your family room or drape it at the end of your bed. It is wonderfully cozy so you can cuddle up in front of the TV or a good book. Take it with you on a picnic, camping trip, or to your favorite sporting event. The beautiful and unique designs also work well as a wall hanging. We hope these will inspire you to find new ways to add color to your life with our throws! View our gallery.
