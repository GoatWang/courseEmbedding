TrustManager (Trust Manager)

The Trust Manager has a number of preferences that affect an application's environment security. Administrators are advised to review these settings and configure client installations so that they are satisfied with the overall security of their workflows.
        This preference category contains the following subfeature(s):
        
Certified Document Trust
Disabling Privileged Locations
Enhanced Security
Internet Access
Protected View
Specifying Privileged Locations

Internet Access

Because Internet access is a potential security risk, end users are provided with the means to manage that risk by controlling what sites can be accessed via the Internet Access panel in the Trust Manager. Note that the Privileged Locations panel in the Security (Enhanced) pane also provides the means to trust specific hosts. However, Trust Manager settings always take precedence for hosts; for example, if www.adobe.com is blocked by the Trust Manager but is marked as a trusted host in Privileged Locations, then that site will be blocked. 
    
					Note:
      The behavior is slightly different for files and folders: for 9.2 and earlier, Trust Manager settings take precedence, while with 9.3, Privileged Locations take precedence. For example, a file or folder which is trusted in Privileged Locations can contain links that Acrobat can follow even if the host in the link is set as Blocked or URLS are set to Block all in Trust Manager. Also, cross domain access always requires specifically trusting those domains as a Privileged Location--simply trusting those sites in the Trust Manager will not work.The following options are available: 
    
					
Allowing or blocking access to all web sites.
Specifying a list of allowed and blocked web sites.
Setting the behavior for access to web sites that are not in the specified list to "Always ask," "Allow access," or "Block access."

Summary table


iUnknownURLPerms
Specifies whether to ask for, allow, or block access to web sites that are not in the user specified list.


iURLPerms
Specifies whether to allow or block all websites or use a custom setting.


tHostPerms
Stores a list of URLs to trust when iURLPerms is set to Custom Setting.

Version #
7.0+


HKCU Path
TrustManager\cDefaultLaunchURLPerms


HKLM Path

Summary
Stores a list of URLs to trust when iURLPerms is set to Custom Setting.


Details
If the user has selected the setting "Let me specify a list of allowed and blocked websites" or "Custom Setting" in the UI (the wording varies across versions), then this preference is used to store a list of trusted URLs. iURLPerms controls tHostPerms usage as described below. When present, the URL list appears as follows:  version:1|http://www.another_allowed_website.com:2|http://www.manageinternetaccess.com:3 
      Note: Some earlier updated versions of the 10.x product (e.g. 10.0.1, etc.) experienced a bug where the Manage Internet Access preference panel items were greyed out and disabled. The solution is to delete this preference under HKCU and let it repopulate itself by exercising the UI. Fixed in 10.1. 
      For more information, refer to the Application Security Guide.

0: Custom Setting
1: Block all websites
2: Allow all websites
For more information, refer to the Application Security Guide.


GUI mapping

Enhanced Security

The enhanced security feature is designed to limit document behaviors in workflows where those behaviors are perceived as a vulnerability or security risk. In workflows where security is critical, turn this feature on. Administrators lock down the setting so it can't be changed by the user. See also bCrossDomainLogging. 
    
					Note:
      Enhanced security blockes 6 specific behaviors: data injection, script injection, silent printing, web links (if not allowed by Trust Manager settings), cross domain access, and access to external streams.

If a file, folder, or host is specified as a privileged location, enhanced security restrictions are bypassed.
Enhanced security preferences are stored under TrustManager, and ES and TM settings sometimes interact. 
      
							All key (tID) names should be unique.
For more information, refer to the Application Security Guide.

Specifying Privileged Locations

Privileged locations are designed to let users and administrators specify trusted content that should be exempt from security retrictions. Security restrictions come from features like the following: 
    
					
Enhanced Security: Restricts cross domain access, data injection, and script injection, etc.
User preferences: User interface controls for Web access, JavaScript, XObject (external streams), multimedia that plays in 3rd party players, and so on.
Application preferences: Adobe's JS blacklist, high privileged JS, and other items that are blocked by default.
Privileged locations provide a way to bypass these restrictions. A location may be a file, folder, or host, and there can be an end user list in HKCU and an IT-only list in HKLM. IT can disable user interface controls and lock restrictions in place so that end usrs can't change them via features like Enhanced Security and the JavaScript controls. For trusted locations, admins then specify directories and hosts that are known to be trustworthy in the relevant cabs (e.g. cCrossdomain, cDataInjection), thereby effectively creating a white list for secure workflows. 
    You can also elevate Trusted Win OS zones to privileged locations since these are already under IT control. Prior to 10.1.2/9.5, bTrustOSTrustedSites provided trust for Trusted Sites. With these versions, trust is also extended to Local Intranet Zones. Privileged location support is evolving rapidly, so pay attention to the version. 
    Privileged locations are identified by a unique t(id) with a string value pointing to the trusted location. The container cab determines which restriction the document can bypass. For example, a t(id) under cCrossDomain allows cross domain access. Adding _recursive to tIDs under TrustedFolders results in setting recursive trust, though this is on by default beginning with 10.1. 
    Note the following: 
    
TrustManager\cTrustedFolders contains cabs for trusted folders AND files.
TrustManager\cTrustedSites contains cabs for trusted http and https hosts.
Each t(ID) must be unique. In the example below, t3 could reside in each of the cabs, but there could not be more than one t3 in each cab. 
    
					Registry Configuration: Cross domain file trust

[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Adobe\Acrobat
Reader\9.0\TrustManager\cTrustedFolders\cCrossdomain]
"t3"="C:\\DocumentsandSettings\\brogers\\MyDocuments\\acrobat_logo16.png"

    The feature behaves as follows:
    
					
The Trust Manager hive does not appear in the registry until the user interface is exercised. However, you can create it manually.
A privileged location may be a file, folder, or host.
With 10.1 and later, folder trust is recursive; that is, all subfolders are trusted when the parent folder is trusted.
Privileged locations can be permanently disabled or enabled by the administrator.
Configuration may occur via the user interface or directly in the registry.
If configured through the user interface, the privileged location ID only may or may not appear under under all the possible cabs. Functionality changes across releases, so test the UI and see what trust is assigned.
Administrator's can lock down the feature in HKLM so that users cannot change the setting. To do so, create an identical set of preferences in HKLM. ADmins can also disable the end user's ability to modify the list by setting  bDisableTrustedSites and bDisableTrustedFolders. 
Permissions granted by other features often overlap. For example, cross domain policies, internet access settings in Trust Manager, and certificate trust settings for certified documents sometimes interact so that the most permissive setting takes precedence. TEST YOUR CONFIGURATION prior to deployment.
All key (tID) names under a particular cab must be unique.
10.x products support the use of wildcard matching of subdomain components for trusted host URLs. For example, for a basic URL of a.b.c.adobe.com, you can wildcard on all of a, b, or c. It is required that at least the first subdomain is specified (adobe in this case). So *.corp.adobe.com or lcforms.*.adobe.com works, but *forms.corp.adobe.com or lcforms.corp.*.com will not.
For more information, refer to the Application Security Guide.

Summary
Prior to 10.1, the _recursive suffix on t(folder ID) makes the trust recursive.


Details
With 10.1 and later, folder trust is recursive; that is, all subfolders are trusted when the parent folder is trusted. For versions prior to 10.1, append "_recursive" to t(folder ID). For example: [HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Adobe\Adobe Acrobat\9.0\TrustManager\cTrustedFolders\cScriptInjection] "t5_recursive"="C:\\Aardvark". This key is indirectly lockable since the administrator can preconfigure privileged locations and then turn off the user's ability to change them via bDisableTrustedSites and bDisableTrustedFolders.

Details
There can be an admin list in HKLM and an end user list in HKCU. Beginning with 10.x, the product supports the use of wildcard matching of subdomain components for trusted host URLs. For example, for a basic URL of a.b.c.adobe.com, you can wildcard on all of a, b, or c. It is required that at least the first subdomain is specified (adobe in this case). So *.corp.adobe.com or lcforms.*.adobe.com works, but *forms.corp.adobe.com or lcforms.corp.*.com will not.

Disabling Privileged Locations

Disabling and locking the end user's ability to add files, folders, and hosts as a privileged location prevents them from assigning trust and thereby exempting that location from enhanced security restrictions. 
    The following options are available: 
    
Disabling and locking the ability to trust folders and files.
Disabling and locking the ability to trust hosts/sites.
Disabling and locking the ability to trust sites Internet Explorer trusts.

Example: Disabling Privileged Locations

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Adobe\AcrobatReader\9.0\FeatureLockDown]
"bDisableTrustedFolders"=dword:00000001
"bDisableTrustedSites"=dword:00000001

Certified Document Trust

11.0 introduces the ability to elevate any certified document to a privileged location (all product versions). When set, certified documents become trusted for exemption from the same security restrictions from which other privileged locations are exempt. Note the following: 
    
					
The PDF's certification signature must be valid and chain to a trusted root.
The setting is off by default.
The one exception to such trusted PDF's parity with privileged locations is that this level of trust does not apply when the PDF is viewed in Protected View.

They will work with you in regards to your hours and...yeah, just your hours. Oh, they really value their relationships with their customers (work with credit scores under 560).ConsNo overtime at all. Expecting that processor bonus that you're used to? HA. Don't look for it here. Because most loans have credit scores in the low 500's, it is HARD to get these loans to closing on time. Company can barely push out 40 loans a month, AS A WHOLE. Management is okay. They will help you when needed, but when it all boils down to it, they will look out for themselves before you. The CEO can be very disrespectful towards his employees...he will not prosper in the long run.Advice to ManagementLook for a new job before your company goes under. Scott will not have your back just like you don't have the backs of your employees.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (0) Montage Mortgage Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Montage Mortgage 2016-12-11 19:57 PST Jan 12, 2017 Montage Mortgage Logo"Processor"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementFormer Employee - Anonymous Employee in Charlotte, NCFormer Employee - Anonymous Employee in Charlotte, NCDoesn't RecommendNeutral OutlookI worked at Montage Mortgage full-time (More than a year)ProsA small Mortgage Company environmentConsNo 90 day review, no pay raises, no chance for advancementAdvice to ManagementBetter Compensation and provide growth opportunitiesShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (0) Montage Mortgage Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Montage Mortgage 2017-01-12 15:15 PST Dec 1, 2016 Montage Mortgage Logo"Weird stuff going on here...really!"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementCurrent Employee - Anonymous Employee in Charlotte, NCCurrent Employee - Anonymous Employee in Charlotte, NCDoesn't RecommendNegative OutlookI have been working at Montage Mortgage full-timeProsthey do have their license to operate....I saw it.ConsI was told to write a positive review on Glassdoor...no if's and's or buts!

It was good that I knew my job very well because the powers that be did not know it. If you are looking to work in a professional environment, this is not the place. While I was working my two week notice, I was told by my manager to GET OUT!! Never in my decades of professional work experience have I ever been spoken to in that manner so I did not complete my two week notice. Closed the highest number of loans the previous month and I was told that when I submitted my notice, it disqualified me from getting a monthly bonus. I was told that I would get my accrued PTO since I put in a two week notice but then was told I would not even though the employee manual states accrued PTO is paid. Management does not adhere to the employee manual.Advice to ManagementPlease!!! Please!!! Treat your employees like they have feelings and do matter. If you continue to let one particular manager be a loose cannon, you will continue to lose good employees. I knew the value that I added to this company but I refused to keep giving my all and get nothing in return that showed appreciation.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (0) Montage Mortgage Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Montage Mortgage 2016-12-01 11:21 PST Nov 24, 2016 Montage Mortgage Logo"Unethical"StarStarStarStarStarFormer Employee - Anonymous Employee in Charlotte, NCFormer Employee - Anonymous Employee in Charlotte, NCI worked at Montage Mortgage (More than a year)ProsThere were no redeemable qualitiesConsEverything about them was a con.
