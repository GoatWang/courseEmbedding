UQM values Pi Innovo’s ECUs and strong controls engineering and we get to leverage UQM’s growing presence in China. It should be a win-win.Pi Innovo sees strategic partnerships as a key to growth, especially where we work in collaboration with other technology providers to deliver innovative system solutions as well as providing subsystems.MoreReply33MMarkusCall takeaways:1.  They need to be moving in the low thousands of units out the door to see positive cash flow.  They presently deliver hundreds.  Even with the backlog, management does not foresee profitability in the near future.2.  "Brad, this is David. We're still burning about $1 million a quarter. That's been a fairly consistent burn rate for a number of quarters now. We recently closed a line of credit with the bank for $5.6 million that we have the ability to draw on as we needed. And we believe that, that bank financing is going to give us enough time and room to allow us to execute on our strategic plan of finding a strategic partner and trying to get some kind of investments from that partner to supplement our cash. So at the moment, we are not contemplating another capital raise."They need to get a partner to avoid having to do an equity offering.  At their burn rate they'd need to have this in progress by late this year and closed in early 2018.  3.  Joe makes no promises relative to selling a majority stake and control in the company.  He intimates that this is almost a necessity for doing business in China, which seems to be the location of his presumed salvation.Seems the future is clear - the Q seeks to sell a large stake in itself to a Chinese company.  And if this doesn't happen they'll have to price a secondary to keep the lights on for as their line will be tapped.  On their own, profitability isn't in the cards for quite some time.MoreReplyReplies (3)52AAndrewSounds like they are very optimistic about the future!  If you believe that electric vehicles are a significant part of the future then you should know that one of the producers of high quality power trains will be very busy, very soon.  As far as I'm concerned, all the stars are aligned for a big 2017-18.  Great time to get in.

	RISK FACTORS



	The following factors and other information in this document and the
	information incorporated by reference should be carefully considered before investing in
	our securities.



	 


	Risks Related to our Business




	We have incurred significant net losses and may continue to do so.



	We have incurred significant net losses as shown in the following tables:







	Quarter Ended June 30,











	2004







	2003







	Net loss





	$ 714,903





	$ 390,326












	Fiscal Year
	Ended March 31,











	2004







	2003







	2002







	Net loss





	$ 4,786,953





	$ 3,598,650





	$ 8,592,655






	We have had accumulated deficits as follows:







	June 30, 2004





	$ 52,857,884






	March 31, 2004





	$ 52,142,981






	March 31, 2003





	$ 47,356,028







	In the future we plan to make additional investments in product
	development and commercialization, which is likely to cause us to remain unprofitable.




	 



	Our net losses and working capital requirements could consume our
	current cash balances.



	Our net loss for the first quarter ended June 30, 2004 was $714,903
	versus a net loss for the comparable quarter last year of $390,326. At June 30, 2004, our
	cash balances were $2,887,678. For our most recently completed fiscal year ended March 31,
	2004 we had a net loss of $4,786,953 which includes the impairment of the carrying value
	of our discontinued electronic products segment and other estimated losses from the
	discontinuance of this business totaling $3,364,638. If our losses continue they could
	consume some or all of our cash balances. Management expects to make additional
	investments in human resources, manufacturing facilities and equipment, production and
	application engineering among other things in order to effectively compete in the emerging
	market for hybrid electric vehicles, which we expect will expand our operating losses and
	require us to secure additional funding beyond our existing cash resources. We cannot
	assure you, however, that funding will be available on terms acceptable to us, if at all.



	 


	Our government contracts can be cancelled with little or no notice and
	could restrict our ability to commercialize our technology.



	Some of our technology has been developed under government funding by
	United States government agencies. In some cases, government agencies in the United States
	can require us to obtain or produce components for our systems from sources located in the
	United States rather than foreign countries. Our contracts with government agencies are
	also subject to the risk of termination at the convenience of the contracting agency and
	in some cases grant "march-in" rights to the government. March-in rights are the
	right of the United States government or the applicable government agency, under limited
	circumstances, to exercise a non-exclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable worldwide license to
	any technology developed under contracts funded by the government to facilitate
	commercialization of technology developed with government funding. March-in rights can be
	exercised if we fail to commercialize the developed technology. The implementation of
	restrictions on our sourcing of components or the exercise of march-in rights by the
	government or an agency of the government could restrict our ability to commercialize our
	technology.



	 


	We face intense competition in our motor development and may be unable
	to compete successfully.



	In developing electric motors for use in vehicles and other
	applications, we face competition from very large domestic and international companies,
	including the worlds largest automobile manufacturers. These companies have far
	greater resources to apply to research and development efforts than we have, and they may
	independently develop motors that are technologically more advanced than ours.



	 


	If we are unable to protect our patents and other proprietary
	technology, we will be unable to prevent third parties from using our technology, which
	would impair our competitiveness and ability to commercialize our products. In addition,
	the cost of enforcing our proprietary rights may be expensive and result in increased
	losses.



	Our ability to compete effectively against other companies in our
	industry will depend, in part, on our ability to protect our proprietary technology.
	Although we have attempted to safeguard and maintain our proprietary rights, we do not
	know whether we have been or will be successful in doing so. We have historically pursued
	patent protection in a limited number of foreign countries where we believe significant
	markets for our products exist or where potentially significant competitors have
	operations. It is possible that a substantial market could develop in a country where we
	have not received patent protection and under such circumstances our proprietary products
	would not be afforded legal protection in these markets. Further, our competitors may
	independently develop or patent technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior
	to ours. We cannot assure that additional patents will be issued to us or, if they are
	issued, as to the scope of their protection. Patents granted may not provide meaningful
	protection from competitors. Even if a competitors products were to infringe patents
	owned by us, it would be costly for us to pursue our rights in an enforcement action, it
	would divert funds and resources which otherwise could be used in our operations and we
	cannot assure that we would be successful in enforcing our intellectual property rights.
	In addition, effective patent, trademark, service mark, copyright and trade secret
	protection may not be available in every country where we may operate or sell our products
	in the future. If third parties assert technology infringement claims against us, the
	defense of the claims could involve significant legal costs and require our management to
	divert time and attention from our business operations. If we are unsuccessful in
	defending any claims of infringement, we may be forced to obtain licenses or to pay
	royalties to continue to use our technology. We may not be able to obtain any necessary
	licenses on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If we fail to obtain necessary
	licenses or other rights, or if these licenses are costly our results of operations may
	suffer either from reductions in revenues through our inability to serve customers or from
	increases in costs to license third-party technologies.



	 


	Use of our motors in vehicles could subject us to product liability
	claims, and product liability insurance claims could cause an increase in our insurance
	rates or could exceed our insurance limits, which could impair our financial condition,
	results of operations and liquidity.



	Because some of our motors are designed to be used in vehicles, and
	because vehicle accidents can cause injury to persons and property, we are subject to a
	risk of claims for product liability. We carry product liability insurance of $1 million
	covering all of our products. If we were to experience a large insured loss, it might
	exceed our coverage limits, or our insurance carriers could decline to further cover us or
	raise our insurance rates to unacceptable levels, any of which could impair our financial
	position, results of operations and liquidity.



	 


	We are defending a lawsuit that has been brought against our wholly
	owned subsidiary, UQM Electronics, Inc., involving breach of contract and other claims. An
	adverse outcome of this lawsuit could have a material adverse effect on our , financial
	condition, results of operations and liquidity.



	A lawsuit has been filed against our wholly owned subsidiary, UQM
	Electronics, Inc., alleging breach of contract and other claims. The claimed damages
	exceed our working capital. For a description of this legal action, see "Legal
	Proceedings" in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30,
	2004, delivered with this prospectus. We believe this lawsuit is without merit and intend
	to contest it vigorously. However, the action is in a preliminary phase and the ultimate
	outcome is uncertain. An adverse outcome of this lawsuit could have a material adverse
	effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.


	 



	 


	Risks Related to this Offering





	You will experience immediate and significant dilution in the value of
	your shares and will experience further dilution upon any future exercise of warrants and
	stock options.



	If you purchase common stock in this offering, you will incur immediate
	dilution, which means that you will pay a price per share that exceeds the net tangible
	book value per share of common stock immediately following the offering. Based on an
	assumed offering price of $2.40 per share, the dilution, on a pro forma basis, would have
	been equal to $1.90 per share as of June 30, 2004 with respect to the shares purchased in
	this offering, assuming no exercise of the underwriters over-allotment option.


	We have outstanding options and warrants to acquire 2,906,533 shares of

	the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Securities
	Exchange Act. These statements appear in a number of places in this prospectus and the
	documents we incorporate by reference and include statements regarding our plans, beliefs
	or current expectations, including those plans, beliefs and expectations of our officers
	and directors with respect to, among other things, the development of markets for our
	products; the adequacy of the Companys cash balances and liquidity to meet future
	operating needs; and the ability of the Company to sell equity or debt securities.
	Important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from those contained in
	the forward-looking statements are listed above under "Risk Factors."



	 



	UQM TECHNOLOGIES, INC.



	We develop and manufacture energy efficient, power dense electric motors, generators
	and power electronic controllers. Our primary focus is incorporating our advanced
	technology into products aimed at existing commercial markets for electrically propelled
	vehicles such as wheelchairs, golf carts and industrial utility vehicles as well as
	emerging markets that we expect will experience rapid growth, including propulsion systems
	for clean electric, hybrid electric and fuel cell electric on-road and off-road vehicles,
	vehicle auxiliaries including those configured to operate at 42 volts and environmentally
	friendly, distributed power generators. Our $0.01 par value common stock trades on the
	American Stock Exchange under the symbol "UQM."


	Our revenue from continuing operations is derived from two principal
	sources: 1) funded contract research and development services performed for strategic
	partners, customers and the U.S. government directed toward either the advancement of our
	proprietary technology portfolio or the application of proprietary technology to
	customers products; and 2) the manufacture and sale of products engineered by us.


	Our objective is to leverage our technology base and name recognition
	to develop and manufacture products for our customers that are superior in performance at
	competitive prices. To this end, we have focused our attention on four market areas that
	we believe have significant growth potential:



	(1) electric propulsion systems, generators and power electronic controllers for
	electric, hybrid electric and fuel cell electric vehicles. Automobile and truck
	manufacturers worldwide are developing such vehicles. In the case of hybrid electric
	powerplants, additional customers include Tier I and Tier II automotive suppliers who hope
	to provide complete hybrid electric systems to their automotive customers;




	(2) electric propulsion systems and electronic controllers for small vehicles, such as
	electric wheelchairs, golf carts, small industrial vehicles, lawn and ground care
	equipment and the like;




	(3) vehicle auxiliaries including under-the-hood power accessories, such as electric
	air conditioning compressors and electric power steering which are expected to replace
	existing belt-driven parasitic components now in use as part of the automotive
	industrys adoption of a new 42 volt standard and fuel cell components such as air
	compressor drive motors and electronic controllers to manage the operation of the fuel
	cell and its power generation; and




	(4) distributed power generation products such as wind generators, engine generators
	and power electronic controllers for both residential and commercial customers that need
	standby or backup power, remote stand-alone power and grid-connected power. Fundamental to
	this strategy is the continual advancement of our proprietary motor, generator, power
	electronic controller and software technology portfolio and the maintenance of a high
	quality and competitive manufacturing capability for products developed by us.



	We have two principal operating units: 1) UQM Technologies, Inc.,
	located in Frederick, Colorado, which includes the Corporate Headquarters and Engineering
	and Product Development Center; and 2) wholly-owned subsidiary UQM Power Products,
	Inc.("UQM Power"), also located in Frederick, Colorado, which manufactures
	permanent magnet electric motors and generators.




	 





	DILUTION



	Investors in this offering will experience dilution, measured by the difference between
	the purchase price of the securities sold and the adjusted net tangible book value per
	share after the offering. Net tangible book value per share of common stock on any given
	date is determined by dividing the net tangible book value (total tangible assets less
	total liabilities), by the number of shares of common stock outstanding. At June 30, 2004,
	our net tangible book value was $4,665,689, or $0.24 per share of common stock
	outstanding. If we had sold 3,125,000 shares at $2.40 per share (the closing price of our
	stock on August 17, 2004), on June 30, 2004 (less assumed underwriting discount of 9% and
	other expenses of the offering), our adjusted net tangible book value on June 30, 2004
	would have been $11,394,689, or $0.50 per share, representing an immediate increase in net
	tangible book value of $0.26 per share to existing stockholders and an immediate dilution
	of $1.90 per share to purchasers of common stock in this offering.


	The following table illustrates this example on a per share basis:







	Common stock purchase price





	$2.40






	Net tangible book value before the offering





	$0.24






	Increase attributable to new investors





	$0.26







	Adjusted net tangible book value after the
	offering





	$0.50






	Dilution to purchasers





	$1.90






	The example excludes 2,906,533 shares which were subject to outstanding options and
	warrants as of August 17, 2004, at exercise prices ranging from $2.41 to $8.75 per share


	and


	assumes no exercise of the underwriters'
	over-allotment option. To the extent these securities are exercised there may be further
	dilution to new investors.




	 





	USE OF PROCEEDS



	The net proceeds from this offering, assuming the shares are sold at a price of $2.40
	per share, will be approximately $6,729,000, after deducting the underwriting discount of
	9% and estimated offering expenses of $96,000. We expect to receive net proceeds of
	approximately $7,752,750 if the underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full,
	after deducting the underwriting discount and other estimated expenses.


	We plan to use the net proceeds from this offering for general corporate purposes,
	including working capital and other business opportunities.



	 



	DETERMINATION OF OFFERING
	PRICE



	The offering price of securities issued by us under this prospectus will be based on
	the market price of our common stock, with appropriate adjustment for market demand, and
	negotiations between us and I-Bankers Securities, the underwriter.

	PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION



	We have entered into an underwriting agreement with the underwriter relating to the
	offering and sale of the common stock covered by this prospectus. In the underwriting
	agreement, we have agreed to sell to the underwriter, and the underwriter has agreed to
	purchase from us, the aggregate number of shares of common stock set forth opposite its
	name below:








	Underwriter






	Number



	of Shares







	IBS Holding Corporation (d/b/a I-Bankers
	Securities)





	___,000







	 


	The underwriter has an option, exercisable within 30 days after the date of this
	prospectus, to purchase up to an aggregate of 468,750 additional shares of common stock at
	the public offering price less the underwriting discount. The underwriter may exercise
	this option solely to cover over-allotments, if any, made in this offering.


	The obligations of the underwriter under the underwriting agreement to purchase common
	stock from us are subject to certain conditions in the underwriting agreement being
	satisfied. The nature of the underwriter's obligations is such that it is committed to
	purchase and pay for all of the above shares of common stock if any are purchased.


	The underwriter has advised us that it proposes to offer the common stock to the public
	at the public offering price that appears on the cover page of this prospectus. The
	underwriter may offer the securities to selected dealers at the public offering price
	minus a selling concession not in excess of $0.___ per share of common stock. In addition,
	the underwriter may allow, and those selected dealers may reallow, a selling concession
	not in excess of $0.___ per share of common stock.


	In the underwriting agreement, we have agreed that:


	- we will pay our expenses related to this offering, which we estimate will be $96,000;



	- we will reimburse the underwriter, IBS Corporation (d/b/a I-Bankers Securities), for
	its direct expenses, including postage, telephone, travel, transportation and other
	similar expenses; and


	- we have agreed to indemnify the underwriter against certain liabilities, including
	liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, or to contribute to payments the underwriter
	may be required to make because of any of those liabilities.



	In addition, we have agreed to issue to I-Bankers Securities a warrant to purchase a
	number of shares of common stock equal to 10% of the aggregate amount of common stock
	actually sold by the underwriter. The warrants shall be exercisable for a period of four
	years and shall have an exercise price of 120% of the offering price attributable to such
	shares. I-Bankers Securities shall not be entitled to cashless exercise of the warrants
	but will be granted customary "piggyback" registration rights with respect to
	the shares obtained upon exercise of the warrants, all as may be agreed to in more detail
	by the parties. The warrant will be restricted from sale, transfer, assignment or
	hypothecation for a period of one year from the effective date of the offering, except to
	officers or partners (but not directors) of the agent and members of the selling group.


	Further, if we issue securities in a subsequent financing within 12 months of the
	closing of this offering, and an investor in that offering is one that was introduced to
	us in this offering by I-Bankers Securities, then I-Bankers Securities will have the right
	of first refusal to act as agent for those investors. This right of first refusal is
	considered additional underwriter compensation for I-Bankers Securities in this offering,
	in the amount of one percent of this offering.


	The underwriter and any dealers may be customers of, engage in transactions with, or
	perform services for, us and our subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business.

	Item 15

	. Indemnification of Directors and Officers


	Article VI of the Bylaws of the Company provides for the indemnification by the Company
	of each director, officer, employee or agent of the Company and its subsidiaries in
	connection with any claim, action, suit or proceeding brought or threatened by reason of
	his position with the Company or any of its subsidiaries, provided that the indemnified
	party acted in good faith and in a manner he believed to be in the Company's best
	interest. In addition, Article XI of the Company's Articles of Incorporation provides that
	to the fullest extent permitted by the Colorado Corporation Code, as the same exists or
	hereafter shall be amended, a director of the Company shall not be liable to the Company
	or its shareholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director.


	Section 7-109-102 of the Colorado Business Corporation Act permits indemnification of a
	director of a Colorado corporation, in the case of a third party action, if the director
	(a) conducted himself in good faith, (b) reasonably believed that (i) in the case of
	conduct in his official capacity, his conduct was in the corporation's best interest, or
	(ii) in all other cases, his conduct was not opposed to the corporation's best interest,
	and (c) in the case of any criminal proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe that
	his conduct was unlawful. The section further provides for mandatory indemnification of
	directors and officers who are successful on the merits or otherwise in litigation.


	The statute limits the indemnification that a corporation may provide to its directors
	in two key respects. A corporation may not indemnify a director in a derivative action in
	which the director is held liable to the corporation, or in any proceeding in which the
	director is held liable on the basis of his improper receipt of a personal benefit. The
	statute permits a corporation to indemnify and advance litigation expenses to officers,
	employees and agents who are not directors to a greater extent than directors if
	consistent with law and provided for by the articles of incorporation, the bylaws, a
	resolution of directors or shareholders, or a contract between the corporation and the
	officer, employee or agent.

	Item 17. Undertakings




	(a) Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933
	may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the registrant pursuant
	to the provisions set forth in Item 15, or otherwise, the registrant has been advised that
	in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against
	public policy as expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that
	a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the
	registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of
	the registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by
	such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being
	registered, the registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been
	settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the
	question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the
	Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue. (b) The registrant
	hereby undertakes that:



	(1) For the purposes of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, the
	information omitted from the form of prospectus filed as a part of this registration
	statement in reliance upon Rule 430A and contained in a form of prospectus filed by the
	registrant pursuant to rule 424(b)(1) or (4) or 497(h) under the Securities Act shall be
	deemed to be a part of this registration statement as of the time it was declared
	effective.


	(2) For the purposes of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933,
	each post-effective amendment that contains a form of prospectus shall be deemed to be a
	new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of
	such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.




	 




	 




	SIGNATURES



	Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, the registrant certifies
	that it has reasonable grounds to believe that it meets all of the requirements for filing
	on Form S-2 and has duly caused this registration statement to be signed on its behalf by
	the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized, in the City of Frederick, Colorado on the 20th
	day of August, 2004.

	Re: Registration Statement on Form S-2 of UQM Technologies, Inc.


	Ladies and Gentlemen:




	As counsel for UQM Technologies, Inc., a Colorado
	corporation (the "Company"), we have examined the above-referenced Registration
	Statement on Form S-2 under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Registration
	Statement") that the Company is filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission
	with respect to the registration of 3,125,000 shares of its common stock, par value $0.01
	per share (the "Shares").


	We have also examined the Companys Restated Articles of Incorporation, as
	amended, Bylaws and the record of its corporate proceedings and have made such other
	investigation as we have deemed necessary in order to express the opinion set forth below.


	In all such examinations, we have assumed without independent investigation or inquiry
	the legal capacity of all natural persons executing documents, the genuineness of all
	signatures on original or certified copies, the authenticity of all original or certified
	copies and the conformity to original or certified documents of all copies submitted to us
	as conformed or reproduction copies. We have relied as to factual matters upon and have
	assumed the accuracy of, the statements made in the certificates of officers of the
	Company delivered to us and the certificates and other statements or information of or
	from public officials and officers and representatives of the Company.


	Based on such examination and the limitations and assumptions set forth herein, it is
	our opinion that the Shares, when issued and sold in the manner and for the consideration
	contemplated by the Registration Statement, will be validly issued, fully paid and
	nonassessable.


	The opinions expressed herein are limited to the laws of the State of Colorado.


	We hereby consent to the reference to us under the caption "Legal Matters" in
	the Registration Statement; provided, however, that in giving this consent we do not admit
	that we are included in the category of persons whose consent is required under
	Section 7 of the Act or the rules of the SEC promulgated thereunder. We further
	consent to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to the Registration Statement. We
	express no opinion as to any matters not expressly set forth herein.


	The opinions expressed herein are rendered as of the date hereof. We do not undertake
	to advise you of matters that may come to our attention subsequent to the date hereof and
	that may affect the opinions expressed herein, including without limitation, future
	changes in applicable law. This letter is our opinion as to certain legal conclusions as
	specifically set forth herein and is not and should not be deemed to be a representation
	or opinion as to any factual matters.

FlashRatings - All research for my stocks!

The most comprehensive equity research coverage available online.


          Never miss a single piece of research, upgrade, downgrade or target price change by any analyst firm on any stock!

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The UQM PowerPhase® technology is mature, in use as propulsion systems that power commercial and passenger vehicles worldwide. The underlying technology is highly cost-effective and designed to be manufacturing friendly, using standard production processes.  UQM’s technology has the ability to achieve the highest power density in the industry, which leads to low cost due to the use of less active materials needed to achieve a given power or torque requirement. These two attributes: manufacturability and high torque density, lead to the lowest cost, given equal performance requirements and production volumes. (See Motor Technology for more on Power Density).
Our electric drive system technology is enabled by key IP, including 15 patents on motors, controllers and control algorithms developed over 40 years in the industry. UQM IP has been accumulated by internal development as well as funded programs from the DOE, DOD, DARPA and others.  UQM currently owns all of our accumulated IP and will entertain licensing for certain market segments. (Contact Sales for more information regarding IP and technology licensing) .





Superior Efficiency 







UQM Electric Drive Systems with high operating efficiency enable longer vehicle range, or alternatively reduced battery pack capacity, leading to lower overall vehicle cost. UQM achieves superior Electric Drive System efficiency with optimized, proprietary magnetic circuits in the motor and proprietary software control algorithms in the controller to extract the most power with the least loss.  This leads to extremely high efficiency over a very wide speed and power range.  All of our efficiency curves are published based on actual test data (not calculations), taken from calibrated dynamometers certified by TUV for ECE R85 testing. In addition, all of our efficiency curves are provided at the system level (DC into the controller to the mechanical shaft output).
An efficiency map from a typical UQM system is shown to the left.  For efficiency maps of specific UQM systems contact UQM Sales.






Cost Saving Potential





UQM systems allow the use of significantly less batteries due to high system efficiency. In turn, high-efficiency systems reduce battery content and lower cost (Batteries represent 50%-70% of an electric vehicles’ cost).
UQM’s products unlock cost saving potential for EV makers who lose efficiency by pairing dissimilar motors and controllers that are not optimized to each other.
UQM also maintains industry leading proprietary motor control software developed through numerous vehicles, incorporating invaluable cumulative experience.
