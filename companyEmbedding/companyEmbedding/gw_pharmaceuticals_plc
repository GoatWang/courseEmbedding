Political Risk Increases For Medical Marijuana - GW Pharmaceuticals plc (NASDAQ:GWPH) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGOÂ»Political Risk Increases For Medical MarijuanaJul. 4.17 | About: GW Pharmaceuticals (GWPH) Nick Cox Long/short equity, value, Growth, growth at reasonable priceSummaryThe Trump administration is likely to increase pressure on all cannabis businesses.GW Pharma remains the best play.Other cannabis companies represent poor risk/reward.The policies of the Trump Administration pose a growing risk to all companies involved in the cannabis sphere. Attorney General Sessions is an implacable foe of all things cannabis and can make life difficult in the legal, government approval and finance areas. GW Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:GWPH) is furthest down the line in terms of approval and product promise. It still represents the best play for those willing to accept some risk. Recreational cannabis remains an extremely high risk area. This is both in terms of government policy and in terms of the doubtful corporate governance of the players in the market. Government Policy My article in May gave details at that time. Since then there have been some fresh developments. Attorney General Sessions wants to get rid of the Rohrbacher-Farr Amendment. This is despite the fact that he has always been a leading advocate of States' rights. The amendment states that federal funds can't be used to countermand laws brought in by individual states. 28 states currently have medical marijuana laws on their statute books. In May, Sessions wrote to members of Congress urging them to overturn it: "I believe it would be unwise for Congress to restrict the discretion of the Justice Department to fund particular prosecutions." It is doubtful whether he will succeed in this though. Members of Congress are aware of the popularity of medical marijuana amongst their constituents, and many of them share Sessions' contradictory views on states rights. Sessions can, however, continue to ensure that companies involved in the cannabis business do not get the usual corporate tax deductions. He can ensure they are not allowed to access banking services. He will ensure that cannabis remains a Schedule 1 drug on a par with heroin. Ridiculously, a Schedule 1 drug is one that has "no medical use". That is self-evidently untrue in the case of medical marijuana.
 Sessions talks of the necessity of the war on drugs. In fact, research has shown that where medical marijuana is available, people get weaned off opiod pain-killers. Opioids are the greatest killer drugs in the States at the moment, accounting for reportedly 33,000 deaths in the USA in 2015. Several companies such as Nemus Bioscience Inc. (NASDAQ:OTCQB:NMUS) are in fact involved in research to use marijuana derivatives to replace opioids as pain-killers. The recent Eaze Report also showed that those on anti-depressants greatly reduced their dependence on them when they took medical marijuana. They also greatly reduced their alcohol intake. That of course explains why alcohol companies have been major contributors to anti-cannabis campaigns. Sessions may try other measures. He might overturn the so-called "Cole Memo". In this memo, President Obama's Deputy Attorney-General James Cole held back on federal prosecution of federal law towards the states on cannabis. He might also use RICO (Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organisations Act) to prosecute cannabis companies even if they have the go-ahead from local states. He may also try to pressure the DEA (Drug Enforcement Agency). After an NDA approval for a specific drug based on a cannabinoid, the DEA would need to make a final ruling. This would normally be a formality. It could be made into a problem if the Trump Administration so willed. On a separate negative issue, there is the possibility that the Trump Administration will clamp down on drug pricing in general. This was much promised in the election campaign. It could well have a negative effect on the price GW Pharma could set, for instance, for its Epidiolex treatment for epilepsy. However, like much else from the campaign, it is probably unlikely that this will be followed through in action by the Administration. On a positive political note, a bi-partisan group of congressmen announced in June they would re-introduce their Carers Act. This would change the Controlled Substances Act and specify CBD (cannabidiol) as a separate substance from cannabis. It would also open up banking services to medical marijuana companies. If that were to happen, medical marijuana stocks would undoubtedly rise rapidly. However, this legislation failed when first introduced in 2015 and is most unlikely to pass Congress now. Even it if did, the President would probably refuse to sign it into law.
 The gap between states and the federal government is growing ever-wider on the issue of cannabis. Already various states are becoming quite reliant on their taxation of cannabis. Last year, for instance, Colorado garnered about US$200 million from this source. The Tax Foundation has estimated that a mature cannabis market would bring in tax revenue of approximately US$28 billion. States are also developing medical marijuana programs themselves. For instance, New York state recently approved cannabis tampons for relief of period pain. Developments Elsewhere Outside the USA, medical marijuana continues to gain approval rapidly. The most recent developments include Mexico drafting legislation to legalise it. Already used quite extensively there, especially for multiple sclerosis and chronic pain, the new legislation is now being finalised. The percentage of THC (the psychoactive element in cananbis) will be restricted. The momentum in the Americas is gaining rapidly, with countries such as Canada, Argentina and Uruguay already fully legalised. In Europe, the momentum seems even more unstoppable. The latest country to announce it is legalising medical marijuana is Poland. It will be available through pharmacies by prescription. This might seem surprising given Poland is perhaps the most Catholic and conservative country in Europe. It shows which way the wind is blowing. Poland is following similar recent moves by Germany, the Czech Republic, Spain, Portugal and Ireland. Interesting new research in the U.K. has shown promising development in the use of cannabinoids for cancer treatment, in this case specifically for leukaemia. Much of the future research for cancer treatment in this way is likely to take place outside of the USA due to restrictions from the U.S. government. North American Medical Marijuana Stocks GW Pharma remains the furthest down the road towards approvals, and with the widest range of testing under process. My article in May gave full details of this, so I will not repeat all that here. Some of the many conditions being tested for with various development drugs are:
 Childhood Epilepsies, Adult Epilepsy, Autism spectrum disorder, GBM brain cancer, NHIE, Schizophrenia, Multiple sclerosis, Diabetes and Cancer pain. The range of drugs under process include: Sativex, Epidiolex, GWP 42006 CPDV, GWP42003, GWP42002 and GWP42003. The company's work on GBM brain cancer is seen as particularly exciting long term. There are increasing indications of the positive effects of cannabinoids for treatment of many different types of cancer. Analysts have focused a lot on the possible dollar income to be derived from Epidiolex for three different childhood epilepsies. This is the drug and the application expecting a final decision from the FDA this year. It is, however, just the tip of the iceberg for the potential for Epidiolex itself and for GW Pharma's range of products. It currently has 14 cannabinoids in pre-clinical research. Epidiolex is being tested for a host of other conditions. If approved for childhood epilepsies, it could also be extended to the much more common adult epilepsies. Epidiolex itself is expected to be priced at about US$30,000 for a year's treatment. There are about 5,000 U.S. physicians who currently prescribe anti-epileptic drug treatments on a regular basis. These will be the target market for the GW Pharma sales force that is being set up. Whether insurance companies will agree to pay for Epidiolex is a moot question. The current dysfunctional state of the U.S. healthcare system makes such predictions hard to make accurately. Epidiolex would need to compete against off the shelf natural CBD. The status of natural CBD legally in the country is unclear. Whether insurers would pay for that is also unclear. One positive for GW Pharma is its focus on Orphan designation drugs. These allow for 7 years protection in the USA and 10 years in Europe. Orphan designation targets specific rare medical conditions not currently targeted by Big Pharma. One reason this status protection is of particular focus by GW Pharma is due to the fact that the company is developing products which are based on naturally occurring compounds.
 Another positive for the company may be the fact that it originates in the U.K. That is where it grows its raw materials. Last year, it greatly increased its growing area. Bearing in mind the questions about cannabis legality in the USA, it might be thankful to have its growing facility as pictured below located outside the USA. 

 GW Pharma may conversely benefit if pure cannabis for medical purposes gets cracked down on harder by the Trump Administration. If its cannabinoid drugs do get approved by the FDA, it will be the only game in town if pure cannabis is not available to people. Nemus Bioscience is a company I have covered before. It is an interesting and professionally managed research company. It is the only such company in the USA which has the approval to grow cannabis for research purposes. This is in conjunction with the University of Mississippi. Of course, that could potentially change under the Trump Administration. One of its lead CBD candidates is aimed at reducing chronic pain. It is estimated that 100 million Americans suffer from this condition, so the end-market potential is vast. One of its THC candidates is aimed specifically at eye problems. Latest developments on this were released in a paper given in June. Glaucoma and macular eye degeneration are being targeted in particular. Other conditions Nemus is targeting overlap with those being targeted by GW Pharma. Nemus is, however, a long long way from bringing drugs to market, and may or may not be able to raise the finances to continue. Its stock price chart as below tells a familiar medical marijuana story: 


 One company which has its backers is Insys Therapeutics (NASDAQ:INSY). A previous article of mine gave some details of this. Without going into great detail, for me this is a company with huge risks for any investor. It is embroiled in an ongoing scandal concerning its marketing of its non-cannabinoid product Subsys. This is a fentanyl based opiod pain-killer. Its CEO was arrested and various executives are pleading guilty to defrauding insurers and making illicit payments to doctors to prescribe the product. Cannabis companies are a high enough risk already without what will be a long-pending criminal investigation of the company. Additionally, its most promising CBD product is targeted also at childhood epilepsies. If Epidiolex gets approved on schedule, then Insys would very much be second to the party. Other companies which have their backers and which I have previously written about include Zynerba Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:ZYNE) and Vitality Biopharma (OTCQB:VBIO). To me they just don't have a good risk/reward profile for numerous reasons. Zynerba has two promising drug products, ZYN001 and ZYN002. They are, however, far away from commercial realisation and further share dilution is likely if they are ever to come to market. With the risk in cannabis companies, some might like to play the ETF market. In April, a fund was launched on the Toronto Stock Exchange: the Horizons Medical Marijuana Life Sciences ETF (HMMJ). This covers North American medical marijuana companies. To me this does not really spread the risk as virtually all companies in the sector are high risk. North American Recreational Marijuana Stocks Recreational marijuana is a huge growing market in the USA. It is likely to remain that way despite the best efforts of the Trump Administration. It is estimated that the legal cannabis market last year was worth US$7 billion. Arcview Market Research reckons this will rise to US$20 billion by 2021. Of course, the illegal market is much bigger. Recreational cannabis companies to invest in are another story though. There have been endless stories of scams and ramping up of small companies with poor finances and no particular market advantage anyway.
 A classic example of this is Growlife (OTCPK:PHOT), about which I have written before. The 5-year graph below tells the tale: 

 This is a typical story. A penny stock with no particular advantage for the market gets puffed up on sites such as this. The price surges: the smart money takes the gains and runs: the stock price reverts to the mean. Conclusion GW Pharma has first mover advantage and a host of possible medical treatments from a range of drugs under development. This makes it the best bet in the medical marijuana space. If one believes that cannabinoids could be beneficial in a wide variety of medical conditions, including cancer, then the potential is vast. Long term, the legalisation of medical marijuana seems a given. Short term, political obstructions in Washington could hurt the company and the whole sector. GW Pharma is better financed than most of its competitors. Delays caused by political factors in Washington would hurt the whole sector in a business where the rush to approval for drugs is dependent upon financial resources. An additional bullish trend for the company is that it is a very possible takeover target. Many Big Pharma companies are looking at shrinking drug pipelines. Its Enterprise Value of US$2.1 billion compared to its Market Cap of US$2.5 billion means it is quite well valued for such a possible takeover.

[12] HortaPharm grew medicinal strains for the Dutch government.[13][14] [15] [16]

GW Pharmaceuticals and its U.S. Subsidiary Greenwich Biosciences Announce Publication of Groundbreaking Study of EpidiolexÂ® (Cannabidiol) in The New England Journal of Medicine
May 25 17
GW Pharmaceuticals plc along with its U.S. subsidiary Greenwich Biosciences, announced that The New England Journal of Medicine has published results from a Phase 3 study of EpidiolexÂ® (cannabidiol) in children with Dravet syndrome. Epidiolex, GW's lead product candidate and the potential first in a new category of anti-epileptic drugs, is a liquid formulation of purified, plant-derived cannabidiol (CBD), a non-psychoactive cannabinoid, which is being studied for the treatment of a number of rare, severe pediatric-onset epilepsy disorders. In the study, Epidiolex significantly reduced monthly convulsive seizure frequency compared to placebo in highly treatment-resistant children when added to existing treatment. Treatment with Epidiolex was generally well tolerated, with a safety profile consistent with prior open label experience. There are currently no treatments approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for Dravet syndrome, a rare form of epilepsy associated with a high mortality rate and significant developmental delays. Results from this study represent the only well-controlled clinical evaluation of a cannabinoid medication for this devastating and drug-resistant condition. The New Drug Application for Epidiolex remains on track for submission to the FDA in the middle of 2017. The study randomized 120 children ages two to 18 years (mean age 9.8), with Dravet syndrome whose seizures were not controlled by their current anti-epileptic regimen, to receive either Epidiolex (20mg/kg/day) or placebo in addition to standard treatment. Conducted in 23 study centers in the United States and Europe, patients in the study had tried a median of four prior anti-epileptic drugs (range 0-26) and were taking a median of three (range 1-5) during the study. At baseline, patients had a median frequency of 13 convulsive seizures per month, with a wide range of 3.7 to 1,717 seizures per month. Over the 14-week treatment period, patients taking Epidiolex had a significantly greater median reduction in convulsive seizures (39%) compared to placebo (13%). The estimated median treatment difference between groups was 23% (p=0.01). The proportion of patients who had a 50% or better reduction in convulsive seizure frequency was 43% with Epidiolex versus 27% with placebo (p=0.08). The study also measured improvement on the Caregiver Global Impression of Change (CGIC) scale. 62% of patients treated with Epidiolex were rated as improved in overall condition on the CGIC compared to 34% of the placebo group (p=0.02). Additionally, more patients became seizure-free on Epidiolex than placebo (5% vs 0%: p=0.08) and total monthly seizure count was significantly reduced with Epidiolex (p=0.03). Epidiolex was generally well tolerated in the trial. The most common adverse events (AEs) (>10%) were somnolence, diarrhea, decreased appetite, fatigue, vomiting, pyrexia, lethargy, convulsion, upper respiratory tract infection. Of the 93% of patients on Epidiolex that experienced an AE, 84% reported it to be mild or moderate. Ten patients on Epidiolex experienced a serious adverse event compared with three patients on placebo. Eight patients on Epidiolex discontinued treatment due to adverse events compared with one patient on placebo. Elevations in liver enzymes occurred in 12 patients taking Epidiolex and one patient taking placebo, all of whom were on concomitant valproic acid. Four of these patients withdrew from the trial, three on Epidiolex and one on placebo. In the remaining nine patients taking Epidiolex, elevations returned to normal while on treatment.

GW Pharmaceuticals Announces Research & Development Management Appointments 




















May 15, 2017 07:00 ET

 | Source: GW Pharmaceuticals plc






â Dr. Volker Knappertz appointed Chief Medical Officer ââ Professor Ben Whalley to join as Head of Discovery Research â LONDON, May  15, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GW Pharmaceuticals plc (NASDAQ:GWPH) (GW, the Company or the Group), a biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering, developing and commercializing novel therapeutics from its proprietary cannabinoid product platform, announced the appointment of Volker Knappertz, M.D. as Chief Medical Officer (CMO). Reporting to GWâs Chief Executive Officer Justin Gover, Dr. Knappertz will be based in the Companyâs U.S. headquarters in Carlsbad, California. In addition, GW has appointed Prof. Ben Whalley as Head of Discovery Research, based in the UK. âI am delighted to welcome Volker and Ben to GW in these important R&D roles,â statedÂ Justin Gover, GWâs Chief Executive Officer. âVolker has an impressive record of successful new drug development and obtaining regulatory approvals which, together with his deep experience in neurology, makes him ideally suited to lead GWâs clinical and regulatory activities with respect to EpidiolexÂ® and our product pipeline. In addition, Benâs prominent position in the field of cannabinoid science, particularly with respect to epilepsy, will also be a major asset to GW in the pursuit of our pipeline discovery programs.â Dr. Knappertz has over 25 years of clinical trial experience and 17 years of pharmaceutical drug development experience, holding leadership positions with responsibilities for managing international clinical trial and medical affairs programs. Most recently, as the Vice President of clinical development for multiple sclerosis, oncology and biosimilar products at Teva Pharmaceuticals, Dr. Knappertz oversaw multiple regulatory submissions and approvals in the U.S., Canada, Europe and Japan. Prior to joining Teva in 2012, Dr. Knappertz served in clinical and medical roles in CNS, CV, and biologics at Bayer Pharmaceuticals and AstraZeneca. Dr. Knappertz is a U.S. Board certified neurologist who received his residency training at Yale University, New Haven, CT where he served as chief resident and was fellowship trained at Wake Forest University, Winston-Salem, NC. He received his clinical scientist training and M.D. as well as a doctorate degree in research on glioblastoma from the University at Cologne in Germany. In addition to the appointment of Dr. Knappertz as CMO, Professor Ben Whalley has been appointed to the newly created position of Head of Discovery Research. Previously, Prof. Whalley was Professor of Neuropharmacology at the Reading School of Pharmacy at the University of Reading, UK Since 2007, he has been GWâs principal academic collaborator in the field of epilepsy pre-clinical research and is the author of key papers related to the pre-clinical studies of CBD and CBDV in the treatment of seizures. In this time, he has become a leading authority on the effects of cannabinoids in the central nervous system. âI am truly excited about the opportunity to continue the work of providing regulatory approved cannabinoid-based pharmaceutical medicines to patients with high unmet medical needs and look forward to building on the progress of the Epidiolex program in treatment resistant forms of epilepsy and to driving GWâs rich pipeline of products forward,â stated Dr. Knappertz. âThe strength of the Epidiolex data is compelling and it is a privilege to begin my work at GW with the late-stage development and regulatory submissions of Epidiolex. Personally, having experienced first hand in my family the devastating effects of epilepsy, the opportunity to contribute directly to making a new treatment available for those affected by these often intractable epilepsy conditions allows me to return my focus to the therapeutic area that motivated my career as a neurologist and drug developer.â âHaving now worked for the last decade in collaboration with GW to explore the pre-clinical effects of cannabinoids, I am convinced of the breadth of the potential of cannabinoid science to provide breakthroughs not only in epilepsy but across a range of disease areas,â stated Professor Whalley. âI look forward to contributing to GWâs drug discovery efforts and to advancing the next generation of pipeline candidates.â About GW Pharmaceuticals plc Founded in 1998, GW is a biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering, developing and commercializing novel therapeutics from its proprietary cannabinoid product platform in a broad range of disease areas. GW is advancing an orphan drug program in the field of childhood epilepsy with a focus on EpidiolexÂ® (cannabidiol), an investigational product which is in Phase 3 clinical development for the treatment of Dravet syndrome, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, Tuberous Sclerosis Complex and Infantile Spasms. GW commercialized the worldâs first plant-derived cannabinoid prescription drug, SativexÂ®, which is approved for the treatment of spasticity due to multiple sclerosis in 31 countries outside the United States. The Company has a deep pipeline of additional cannabinoid product candidates which includes compounds in Phase 1 and 2 trials for glioma, schizophrenia and epilepsy.

History[edit]
Background[edit]
Doctors Geoffrey Guy and Brian Whittle founded GW Pharmaceuticals in 1998. That year they obtained a cultivation license from the United Kingdom Home Office and the MHRA, allowing GW Pharmaceuticals to cultivate cannabis from seeds and clones to conduct scientific research concerning the medicinal uses of the plant.[7][8]

HortaPharm[edit]
In July 1998, GW Pharmaceuticals collaborated with HortaPharm B.V., a cannabis research and development business based in the Netherlands,[9] founded by two expert horticulturists from California,[10] Robert Connell Clarke[11] and David Paul Watson, also known as 'Sam the Skunkman'. [12] HortaPharm grew medicinal strains for the Dutch government.[13][14] [15] [16]
Marketed products[edit]
Sativex[edit]
Main article: Nabiximols
Nabiximols (trade name Sativex) is a botanical drug that is a cannabis extract, administered as a mouth spray; it was approved in the UK in 2010 as a treatment for multiple sclerosis (MS) patients to alleviate neuropathic pain, spasticity, overactive bladder, and other symptoms.[17]
Nabiximols is made with two unknown Cannabis strains, and is extracted with ethanol and carbon dioxide.[18][19]
In 2011, GW Pharmaceuticals concluded a partnership with Bayer for the distribution of Sativex in the UK,[20] and have an estimated annual production of 100 tons of medicinal cannabis since 2012.[21]
Products in development[edit]
Epidiolex[edit]
In 2015 GW Pharmaceutical initiated Phase 3 clinical trials of an investigational cannabidiol, Epidiolex, for treatment of two orphan conditions in children â Dravet and Lennox-Gastaut syndromes.[22] GW also received fast track designation from the US FDA for use of the drug candidate to treat newborns with epilepsy.[23]

SativexÂ® is an oromucosal spray of a formulated extract of the cannabis sativa plant that contains the principal cannabinoids THC and CBD as well as specific minor cannabinoids and other non-cannabinoid components. We developed Sativex to be administered as an oral spray, whereby the active ingredients are absorbed in the lining of the mouth, either under the tongue or inside the cheek.Â GW's licensing partners are commercializing Sativex for MS spasticity in 16 countries outside the United States. We have also received regulatory approval in an additional 12 countries, and we anticipate commercial launches in several of these countries in the next 12 months. Two additional countries have recommended approval for Sativex and regulatory filings are ongoing in 12 other countries, principally in the Middle East and Latin America where we expect approvals over the next 12 months.

GWâs EpidiolexÂ® Clinical Program
GW is committed to developing new medicines to treat rare, treatment-resistant epilepsy conditions where there are limited or in some cases, no approved treatment options.
Epidiolex is GWâs lead cannabinoid product candidate and is a proprietary oral solution of pure plant-derived cannabidiol, or CBD. GWâs Epidiolex development is initially concentrating on severe, orphan, early-onset, treatment-resistant epilepsy syndromes including Dravet syndrome, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS), Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) and Infantile Spasms (IS).
GWâs Epidiolex development includes two distinct programs:
FDA-authorized clinical trials program

We have commenced a series of clinical trials designed to obtain safety and efficacy data on Epidiolex to provide to the FDA and other regulatory authorities around the world, which is necessary to be considered for approval as a prescription medicine. Target indications currently include Dravet syndrome, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, Tuberous Sclerosis Complex, and Infantile Spasms. In these trials, eligible patients are randomly assigned to receive Epidiolex or placebo added to their current treatment and evaluated over a specific period of time. These trials are âblindedâ meaning that patients, families, and physicians do not know which treatment arm they have been assigned.
GWâs current Phase 3 pivotal trials program for Epidiolex includes two Phase 3 trials in Dravet syndrome, two in LGS, one in TSC, and one in IS. The first two of these Phase 3 trials, one in Dravet syndrome and one in LGS, have showed significantly greater reductions in specific seizure types for patients taking Epidiolex compared to those taking placebo. Â (see GW press releases: 14 March 2016 & 27 June 2016,Â 26 September 2016).
To learn more about GWâs Epidiolex clinical trials please see the ClinicalTrials.gov website here.
Link to a form for your health care professional to fill out to reach GWâs medical affairs group. Â Please note: You must be a health care professional (HCP) to fill out this form. By clicking submit, you are confirming you are a health care professional. Please do not include any patient-identifying information.

FDA-authorized, independent Physician-led program or Expanded Access (which are at times called Compassionate Use programs in some countries) and for which GW supplies Epidiolex* (click here for information on the U.S. Expanded Access Program)

The FDA may authorize expanded access programs to facilitate access to investigational drugs for treatment use for patients with a serious or immediately life-threatening disease or condition who lack therapeutic alternatives. This is done through FDA granting Investigational New Drug (IND) applications.
The FDA has granted individual patient emergency INDs to physicians as well as INDs to physicians and state programs to treat groups of patients suffering from intractable epilepsy with Epidiolex.
The most recent physician-reported data from this Expanded Access Program was presented in December 2015 at the American Epilepsy Societyâs annual meeting. Results from 261 patients receiving Epidiolex under these INDs showed promising signals of clinical effect in reducing seizures (link to press release and poster).

Support and Advocacy Organizations

There are a number of organizations which provide invaluable help, information, and support to people living with epilepsy. They are also a useful resource for caregivers, friends, and relatives. The following list includes links to some websites of patient organizations that may be useful.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and weâll set up your first campaign for you for free. Weâll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. Weâre here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
