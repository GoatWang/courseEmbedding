Easy Ways to Save
 Max C. Bingman - Tuesday, August 09, 2016Do you always feel like you are pinching pennies? Think there is no room in your budget for saving? Step back and take a good look at your finances,

Help Setting Financial Goals
 Max C. Bingman - Sunday, August 07, 2016Financial goals without a solid foundation are no more than lofty dreams. You may aspire to be financially secure, independent and sustainable
                by a specific age. However, without a solid foundation and framework these dreamy aspirations become no more than a straw house. Full Article

Saving For A Rainy Day
 Max C. Bingman - Wednesday, July 27, 2016A little less than half of US households have a savings account with less than $3000.00 set aside for a rainy day. Just over thirty five percent of
        mid to low income households have a savings account, usually totaling less than $1000.00. Few would argue the practicality of saving for a rainy
        day. Unfortunately, most don’t know where to start. Full Article

 Easy Ways to Save 
 Max C. Bingman - Tuesday, August 09, 2016 
  Do you always feel like you are pinching pennies? Think there is no room in your budget for saving? Step back and take a good look at your finances,
        if you look close enough, you’re bound to find a few extra pennies.

Still Using Cable? How many channels do you really watch? Think about switching to a streaming service like Netflix or Hulu. You could easily save
        up to $100 by cutting the cable umbilical cord.
Do the People at Starbucks Know Your Name? While it may only seem like a dollar here and there, premium coffee drinks can add up and chances are, your
        employer offers free coffee! Think about this…if you gave up that fancy coffee drink in 6 months you could buy a new iPad! Check out a
        coffee calculator to find out how much you can save.
Don’t Get Stuck with Late Fees. If you are always getting dinged with late fees, set yourself up for success with automatic payments or a reminder
        system that lets you know when bills are due. Not only do late payments hurt your credit, they could result in higher interest rates. Not all late
        fees are from bills, be sure to return rental DVDs and library books in a timely manner as well.
Save Money on Food. Dining out should be a treat, not a way of life. If you think you are too busy to cook more at home, think again. There are lots
        of simple nutritious meals that can be cooked quicker than the time it would take you to drive to a food joint and wait for your order. Check the
        Internet for a plethora of crockpot recipes. Most crockpot meals require little preparation and will provide a great lunch the next day…another
        way to save!
Shop With a Plan. Your grocery bill an easily go from $100 to $150 if you don’t shop with a list. Create a menu plan for the week listing all the ingredients
        you’ll need to prepare those meals. Then factor in all the extras you’ll need, lunch items, pet food and other odds and ends. Limit convenience
        foods and single serve packaging which often cost more. Be sure to use coupons only for items you’ll actually use and maximize your savings by
        using a couponing website like Coupon Mom.
Avoid Impulse Buys. Whenever you go to purchase an item that’s a want not a need, wait! Give yourself a 2 week period to think about the purchase
        to see if you still want that item. You may find the urge to buy has passed or you can spend that time searching for the best price! Either way
        you’ll end up saving!
These are just a few suggestions for saving. Do an audit of your finances to find where you are spending and other ways to save. Use the Internet to
        find more options for frugal living. There are lots of great sites that can save you a buck, here are a few to get you started:

$5 Dinners – Ideas for inexpensive dinners
Coupon Geek – Frugal Living blog
Macaroni Kid – Find your local site for fun kid events, many are free
Living on the Cheap – Useful tools for living on less
And Then We Saved – Ideas for saving money

A bond is a loan an investor makes to an organization in exchange for interest payments over a specified term plus repayment of principal at the bond’s maturity date. Learn how corporate, muni, agency, Treasury and other types of bonds work.
 




 



Stocks 

When you buy shares of a company’s stock, you own a piece of that company. Stocks come in a wide variety, and they often are described based the company’s size, type, performance during market cycles and potential for short- and long-term growth. Learn more about your choices—from penny-stocks to large caps and more.
 




 



Investment Funds 

Funds—such as mutual funds, closed-end funds and exchange-traded funds—pool money from many investors and invest it according to a specific investment strategy. Funds can offer diversification, professional management and a wide variety of investment strategies and styles. But not all funds are the same. Understand how they work, and research fund fees and expenses.
 




 



Annuities 

An annuity is a contract between you and an insurance company, in which the company promises to make periodic payments, either starting immediately—called an immediate annuity—or at some future time—a deferred annuity. Learn about the different types of annuities.
 




 



Saving for College 

Funding college begins with savings, starting with how much to save. Learn the many, smart ways to save for college, including 529 College Savings Plans and Coverdell Education Savings Accounts. We’ll help you navigate your college savings options.
 




 



Retirement 

Numerous types of investments come into play when saving for retirement and managing income once you retire. For saving, tax-advantaged retirement options such as a 401(k) or an IRA can be a smart choice. Managing retirement income may require moving out of certain investments and into ones that are better suited to a retirement lifestyle.
 




 



Options 

Options are contracts that give the purchaser the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a security, such as a stock or exchange-traded fund, at a fixed price within a specific period of time. It pays to learn about different types of options, trading strategies and the risks involved.
 




 



Commodity Futures 

Commodity futures contracts are agreements to buy or sell a specific quantity of a commodity at a specified price on a particular date in the future. Commodities include metals, oil, grains and animal products, as well as financial instruments and currencies. With limited exceptions, trading in futures contracts must be executed on the floor of a commodity exchange.
 




 



Security Futures 

Federal regulations permit trading in futures contracts on single stocks, also known as single stock futures, and certain security indices. Learn more about security futures, how they differ from stock options and the risks they can pose.
 




 



Alternative and Complex Products 

These products include notes with principal protection and high-yield bonds that have lower credit ratings and higher risk of default than traditional investments, but offer more attractive rates of return. Learn about their features, risks and potential advantages.
 




 



Insurance 

Life insurance products come in various forms, including term life, whole life and universal life policies. There also are variations on these—variable life insurance and variable universal life—which are considered securities. See how insurance products may fit into an overall financial plan.

Our Philosophy
We believe that excellent service with HONESTY and INTEGRITY is the ultimate responsibility we have to our customers.  Skills can be developed, and programs can be implemented, but unless each representative possesses the personal conviction to serve in a way that sacrifices self-interest for the sake of the others, nothing extraordinary will happen.
The strength of our team of representatives is in the character of the individuals. We strive to maintain these character traits:

Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.
Be worthy of the trust our clients place in us.
Integrity is everything. We will sacrifice it for no reason.
Work is not more important than devotion to God and Family.
Failure is not fatal. Take chances and learn from life.

Licensing









                        Licensing information is provided in the BBB Business Profiles to inform the public about industries that may require professional licensing, bonding, or registration.

Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.

Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo

Introduction to Investing




Many people just like you turn to the markets to help buy a home, send children to college, or build a retirement nest egg. But unlike the banking world, where deposits are guaranteed by federal deposit insurance, the value of stocks, bonds, and other securities fluctuates with market conditions. No one can guarantee that you’ll make money from your investments, and they may lose value.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission enforces the laws on how investments are offered and sold to you. Protecting investors is an important part of our mission. We cannot tell you what investments to make, but this website provides unbiased information to help you evaluate your choices and protect yourself against fraud.

Lots! Learn more about the investment products listed below, including their benefits, risks, and fees.

Are you headed in the right direction? 

Visit the Roadmap to Saving and Investing
A few people may stumble into financial security. But for most people, the only way to attain financial security is to save and invest over a long period of time. You just need to have your money work for you. That’s investing.
Knowing how to secure your financial well-being is one of the most important things you’ll ever need in life. You don’t have to be a genius to do it. You just need to know a few basics, form a plan, and be ready to stick to it. There is no guarantee that you’ll make money from investments you make. But if you get the facts about saving and investing and follow through with an intelligent plan, you should be able to gain financial security over the years and enjoy the benefits of managing your money. For more information, SEC’s publication Saving and Investing: A Roadmap To Your Financial Security Through Saving and Investing.
 







How the Markets Work 

The stock market is where buyers and sellers meet to decide on the price to buy or sell securities, usually with the assistance of a broker: Let's take a closer look at what you need to know about how stocks are traded.
Learn More About How the Markets Work 







The Role of the SEC 

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission enforces the laws on how investments are offered and sold to you. Protecting investors is an important part of our mission.

Retirement and Retirement Plans 


      For most Americans, a retirement savings plan, which you build over time during your working years, is an essential part of securing your retirement. Learn what you can do, while employed and once retired, to make the most of your investments.

When used responsibly, margin can increase your buying power, and allow you to access a line of credit, competitive interest rates and a flexible repayment schedule. It is important to evaluate your risk tolerance before using margin. The loss can include more than the principal amount invested. Terms and conditions, risk statement and margin statement available on Scottrade.com.

Exchange-Traded Funds





ETFs represent a basket of securities – such as stocks and bonds – and they trade throughout the day on an exchange like a stock.










ETFs are professionally managed and designed in many cases to track the performance of an index. Scottrade provides access to most ETFs, which can be used to employ many investment strategies.

International Investing





Scottrade offers investment exposure to over 20 foreign markets through American Depository Receipts (ADRs). ADRs represent one or more shares of non-U.S. stocks, but are traded domestically, which can help reduce the complexities associated with trading directly in foreign markets. In addition, Scottrade offers a variety of mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that hold securities in countries around the globe, including developed and emerging nations.










As a client, you gain access to sophisticated tools and research to help you discover international investing opportunities.
