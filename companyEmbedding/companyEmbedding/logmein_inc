Technology[edit]
LogMeIn remote access products use a proprietary remote desktop protocol that is transmitted via SSL. An SSL certificate is created for each remote desktop and is used to cryptographically secure communications between the remote desktop and the accessing computer.[7]
Users access remote desktops using either the LogMeIn Ignition stand-alone application or a web portal. The web portal requires either an ActiveX plugin for Internet Explorer, or an extension for Firefox (the LogMeIn plug-in for Firefox), or an extension for Safari (the LogMeIn plug-in for Safari), or a plugin for Google Chrome.[8] Failing that it falls back to requiring Java in order to run a Java program,[9] and failing that it falls back to "a screen-shot-based HTML remote control".[10] The web portal also provides status information for the remote computers and, optionally, remote computer management functions.
The service connects the remote desktop and the local computer using SSL over TCP or UDP and utilizing NAT traversal techniques to achieve peer-to-peer connectivity when available.[7][11][12]
Company history[edit]
The company was formerly known as 3am Labs, Inc. before March 2006. As of December 31, 2012, the Company serves over 213 million Internet-enabled devices, like smartphones and tablets. There are five data centers operating in the company, four in the United States and one in Europe.[2]
The company's CEO Michael Simon and CTO Márton Anka collaborated at Uproar, an Internet game site eventually bought by Vivendi Universal at the height of the dot-com bubble.[13][14] Anka's work for Uproar allegedly laid the foundation for his RemotelyAnywhere application, which later evolved into LogMeIn after 3am Labs incorporated.[13]
3am Labs acquired the Hamachi VPN product.[15]
LogMeIn, Inc., changed its name from 3am Labs in 2006.[16]
Tridia sued LogMeIn, Inc. for patent infringement in January 2008.[17][18]
LogMeIn, Inc., completed an IPO in 2009. Trading of LogMeIn, Inc. shares on the NASDAQ Global Market commenced on July 1, 2009.[19]
In 2011, the company began a move into cloud services for the Internet of Things by acquiring Pachube, which would later become the Xively service.[20] In May 2014, it added to this initiative by acquiring Ionia Corp., which specializes in integrating connected objects.[21]
LogMeIn, Inc., acquired Bold Software, LLC in 2012.[22][23]
LogMeIn acquired Meldium for $15 Million in September 2014.[24]
LogMeIn acquired LastPass for $110 Million in October 2015.[6][25]
LogMeIn announced in July 2016 a merger with Citrix's GoTo Family of Products via a Reverse Morris Trust.[3]

Technology[edit]
LogMeIn remote access products use a proprietary remote desktop protocol that is transmitted via SSL. An SSL certificate is created for each remote desktop and is used to cryptographically secure communications between the remote desktop and the accessing computer.[7]
Users access remote desktops using either the LogMeIn Ignition stand-alone application or a web portal. The web portal requires either an ActiveX plugin for Internet Explorer, or an extension for Firefox (the LogMeIn plug-in for Firefox), or an extension for Safari (the LogMeIn plug-in for Safari), or a plugin for Google Chrome.[8] Failing that it falls back to requiring Java in order to run a Java program,[9] and failing that it falls back to "a screen-shot-based HTML remote control".[10] The web portal also provides status information for the remote computers and, optionally, remote computer management functions.
The service connects the remote desktop and the local computer using SSL over TCP or UDP and utilizing NAT traversal techniques to achieve peer-to-peer connectivity when available.[7][11][12]
Company history[edit]
The company was formerly known as 3am Labs, Inc. before March 2006. As of December 31, 2012, the Company serves over 213 million Internet-enabled devices, like smartphones and tablets. There are five data centers operating in the company, four in the United States and one in Europe.[2]
The company's CEO Michael Simon and CTO Márton Anka collaborated at Uproar, an Internet game site eventually bought by Vivendi Universal at the height of the dot-com bubble.[13][14] Anka's work for Uproar allegedly laid the foundation for his RemotelyAnywhere application, which later evolved into LogMeIn after 3am Labs incorporated.[13]
3am Labs acquired the Hamachi VPN product.[15]
LogMeIn, Inc., changed its name from 3am Labs in 2006.[16]
Tridia sued LogMeIn, Inc. for patent infringement in January 2008.[17][18]
LogMeIn, Inc., completed an IPO in 2009. Trading of LogMeIn, Inc. shares on the NASDAQ Global Market commenced on July 1, 2009.[19]
In 2011, the company began a move into cloud services for the Internet of Things by acquiring Pachube, which would later become the Xively service.[20] In May 2014, it added to this initiative by acquiring Ionia Corp., which specializes in integrating connected objects.[21]
LogMeIn, Inc., acquired Bold Software, LLC in 2012.[22][23]
LogMeIn acquired Meldium for $15 Million in September 2014.[24]
LogMeIn acquired LastPass for $110 Million in October 2015.[6][25]
LogMeIn announced in July 2016 a merger with Citrix's GoTo Family of Products via a Reverse Morris Trust.[3]

Combined Entity will be a Leading SaaS Company with a Diverse and Innovative Product Portfolio
Expected First Year Post Close Pro Forma Revenue of $1+ Billion, Anticipated Adjusted EBITDA Margins of 35% in 2017, Anticipated Pro Forma 35%+ Free Cash Flow Accretion over Standalone LogMeIn after Realizing Run Rate Synergies Run Rate Cost Synergies of $65 Million Expected in Year One and More than $100 Million Expected in Year Two Bill Wagner, LogMeIn President and CEO, to Lead Combined Company Citrix and LogMeIn Shareholders to Each Own Approximately 50% of Combined Company LogMeIn Plans to Issue $1.50 per Share in Dividends to its Shareholders Prior to the Closing BOSTON and SANTA CLARA, Calif., July  26, 2016  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --  LogMeIn, Inc. (NASDAQ:LOGM) and Citrix Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CTXS) today announced that the companies have entered into a definitive merger agreement for LogMeIn to combine with Citrix’s GoTo business in a Reverse Morris Trust transaction.  The transaction is valued at approximately $1.8 billion based on shares to be issued and LogMeIn’s closing price of $65.31 as of July 25, 2016.  The transaction, which has been unanimously approved by the Boards of Directors of Citrix and LogMeIn, is expected to be tax-free to Citrix and its shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The combined company is expected to have annual revenues in excess of $1 billion with more than two million customers in virtually every country around the globe. Upon completion of the transaction, the combined company is expected to achieve run rate cost synergies for the benefit of both Citrix and LogMeIn shareholders of $65 million within the first year post-close, and run rate cost synergies of more than $100 million in year two. The combination brings together proven innovators with a shared belief in simplifying the way people connect to customers, colleagues and the world around them. The GoTo family of products delivers collaborative communication solutions for small and medium sized businesses and has strong global brand recognition through leading products including GoToAssist, GoToMeeting, GoToMyPC, GoToTraining, GoToWebinar, Grasshopper and OpenVoice.  LogMeIn, a leading provider of cloud-based connectivity, has rapidly attracted millions of users and thousands of leading businesses to its popular and disruptive products, including join.me, LastPass, LogMeIn Rescue and BoldChat, among others. Bill Wagner, President and CEO of LogMeIn, who will lead the combined company as President and CEO, commented, “We are extremely excited about this transformative merger and the profound benefits it will bring to our customers, our people and our shareholders.  Both companies have passionate employees who are committed to developing easy-to-use software that simplifies the way we connect with people, devices, apps and products.  The additional scale of the combined company will allow us to accelerate innovation in order to deliver better outcomes for our customers and also creates a compelling financial model that will reward our shareholders.” Kirill Tatarinov, President and Chief Executive Officer of Citrix, said, “We believe this combination is a winning outcome for all parties. Both LogMeIn and GoTo have a shared goal of developing innovative solutions to exceed customer expectations by simplifying business and personal communications. Given that we have already been working towards a spinoff of GoTo, we expect this to be a smooth transition for the business. From Citrix’s perspective, this transaction will allow us to further enhance our strategic focus, operational efficiency and accelerate execution of our strategy to provide the world’s best integrated technology services for secure delivery of apps and data.” “We have great respect for Bill, the LogMeIn team and the company’s commitment to building great products that simplify how people connect,” said Bob Calderoni, Executive Chairman of Citrix. “When we announced plans to spin off our GoTo family of products last November, we emphasized the value creation opportunity for our shareholders. We believe this combination will accelerate that opportunity, further enhancing value for Citrix shareholders through the ownership of shares in the combined company. I also want to thank Chris Hylen, whose leadership as SVP and GM of the GoTo business, along with the tireless work of his team, has positioned GoTo for continued growth and success following its separation from Citrix.” Strategic Rationale A Leading SaaS Company With A Diverse Product Portfolio – Assets from both companies fill gaps in the respective product lines, resulting in better experiences and outcomes for our customers.  In addition, the scale and stability of the combined company enables accelerated growth of the businesses in emerging verticals, which include cloud-based telephony and identity, as well as IoT. A Shared Focus On Innovation That Is Enhanced by Scale – The merger brings together the combined resources of each company to address the challenges customers face in the wake of compelling secular trends, including workforce mobility, rapid adoption of cloud-based applications and the proliferation of connected products. Talented Team Positioned To Capture Exciting Growth Opportunities – Through a commitment to retaining the best talent from both companies, the new company will have a seasoned management team with a track record of driving growth, innovation, and shareholder value.  The combined company’s Board will be comprised of experienced directors from both LogMeIn and Citrix who share a commitment to customer satisfaction and shareholder value creation. Powerful Financial Profile That Drives Long-Term Shareholder Value – Shareholders are expected to benefit from the significant free cash flow generated as a result of synergy capture, and the scale of the combined company would enable us to take advantage of operational efficiencies over the longer term to continuously improve the company’s financial profile. Financial Benefits of the Transaction  LogMeIn expects the combined company to have a strong financial profile, including: Pro Forma revenue of more than $1 billionPro Forma Adjusted EBITDA margins of approximately 35%, after realizing year one run rate cost synergies of $65 millionPro Forma Free cash flow of more than $250 million (after year one run rate cost synergies)Anticipated Pro Forma 35%+ Free Cash Flow Accretion over Standalone LogMeIn (after year one run rate cost synergies) The combined company is expected to achieve run rate cost synergies of more than $100 million within two years post-close. Management, Governance and Headquarters LogMeIn’s Bill Wagner will continue in his role as President and CEO, and LogMeIn’s Ed Herdiech will serve as Chief Financial Officer. Certain members of the GoTo management team are expected to join the combined company as well. The combined company will be headquartered in Boston.        Upon closing, the combined company’s Board of Directors will consist of nine directors: five current LogMeIn directors and four Citrix director appointees. Citrix’s four director appointees have proven expertise in driving operational efficiency and will include current Citrix directors Bob Calderoni, Jesse Cohn, and Peter Sacripanti, as well as Citrix’s Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer, David Henshall. Michael Simon, former CEO and current Chairman of the Board of LogMeIn, will remain in place as Chairman of the combined company’s Board.  Bill Wagner will also retain his Board seat.  LogMeIn’s other three directors will be named at a later date. The Board will form an Operating Committee upon the close of the transaction, which will consist of two LogMeIn directors and two Citrix directors, all of whom will be named at a later date, to oversee the realization of the full value of the identified synergies. Management and the Operating Committee intend to retain the services of a globally recognized consulting firm to advise on the capture of synergies. Transaction Details  The combination of LogMeIn and Citrix’s GoTo family of products will be effected through a Reverse Morris Trust (RMT) transaction, pursuant to which Citrix has created a wholly owned subsidiary, or GetGo, to hold the GoTo business.  Citrix will distribute that subsidiary to Citrix shareholders in either a spin-off or split-off transaction. Immediately thereafter, the GetGo subsidiary will be merged with a wholly owned subsidiary of LogMeIn, with GetGo surviving the merger and remaining as a wholly owned subsidiary of LogMeIn. The combination will result in Citrix equityholders receiving an aggregate of approximately 27.6 million LogMeIn shares on a fully diluted basis. Under the RMT structure, the transaction is expected to be tax-free to Citrix and its shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Immediately following the transaction, Citrix shareholders will own approximately 50.1% of all outstanding shares of the combined company on a fully diluted basis, while existing LogMeIn shareholders will own approximately 49.9% of the combined company on a fully diluted basis. The issuance of shares by LogMeIn in connection with the transaction requires approval by LogMeIn shareholders, and the transaction is subject to certain regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions, including receipt of opinions of counsel with respect to the tax-free nature of the proposed transaction.  In connection with the definitive agreement, Michael Simon, LogMeIn’s Chairman of the Board, who currently owns more than 3% of LogMeIn’s shares, has agreed to vote in favor of the transaction. The transaction is expected to close during the first quarter of 2017. In connection with approving the transaction, on July 26, 2016, LogMeIn’s Board of Directors also declared a special cash dividend of $0.50 per share of common stock.  The special dividend will be paid on August 26, 2016 to shareholders of record on August 8, 2016.  LogMeIn currently has approximately 25.3 million shares of common stock outstanding.   As contemplated by the definitive agreement, the Company announced that it currently expects to declare an additional dividend of $0.50 per share of common stock prior to the consummation of the transaction and a final dividend of $0.50 per share of common stock subject to the consummation of the transaction, on or about the date of such consummation.

(“GetGo”), the proposed transactions and other matters. All statements other than statements of historical fact contained in this report are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and Section 21E of the United States Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Forward-looking statements usually relate to future events and anticipated revenues, earnings, cash flows or other aspects of our operations or operating results. Forward-looking statements are often identified by the words “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “plan,” “intend,” “foresee,” “should,” “would,” “could,” “may,” “estimate,” “outlook” and similar expressions, including the negative thereof. The absence of these words, however, does not mean that the statements are not forward-looking. These forward-looking statements are based on the current expectations, beliefs and assumptions of the management of LMI, Citrix and GetGo concerning future developments, business conditions, anticipated synergies, pro forma financial results, the Company’s plans to issue dividends in connection with the transaction, and their potential effects. There can be no assurance that future developments affecting the parties will be those that the parties anticipate. Among the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from those described in the forward-looking statements are the following: (1) the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could give rise to the termination of the merger agreement, (2) the risk that LMI’s stockholders may not approve the issuance of the Company common stock in connection with the proposed merger, (3) the risk that the necessary regulatory approvals may not be obtained or may be obtained subject to conditions that are not anticipated, (4) risks that any of the closing conditions to the proposed merger, including Citrix’s distribution of the shares of GetGo, may not be satisfied in a timely manner, (5) risks related to disruption of management time from ongoing business operations due to the proposed transactions, (6) failure to realize the estimated synergies or growth from the proposed transactions or that such benefits may take longer to realize than expected, (7) risks related to unanticipated costs of integration of GetGo by LMI, (8) the effect of the announcement of the proposed transactions or the consummation of the proposed transactions on the ability of LMI and Citrix to retain and hire key personnel and maintain relationships with their key business partners and customers, and on their operating results and businesses generally, (9) the length of time necessary to consummate the proposed transactions, (10) adverse trends in economic conditions generally or in the industries in which the LMI and Citrix operate, (11) adverse changes to, or interruptions in, relationships with third parties unrelated to the announcement, (12) LMI’s ability to compete effectively and successfully and to add new products and services, (13) LMI’s ability to successfully manage and integrate acquisitions, (14) the ability to attract new customers and retain existing customers in the manner anticipated, (15)  unanticipated changes relating to competitive factors in the parties’ industries, and (16) the business interruptions in connection with the LMI’s technology systems.  Discussions of additional risks and uncertainties are contained in LMI’s and Citrix’s filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). None of LMI, Citrix or GetGo is under any obligation, and each expressly disclaim any obligation, to update, alter, or otherwise revise any forward-looking statements, whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.  Persons reading this announcement are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements which speak only as of the date hereof. No Offer or Solicitation This communication is not intended to and does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to subscribe for or buy or an invitation to purchase or subscribe for any securities or the solicitation of any vote in any jurisdiction pursuant to the proposed transactions or otherwise, nor shall there be any sale, issuance or transfer of securities in any jurisdiction in contravention of applicable law.  No offer of securities shall be made except by means of a prospectus meeting the requirements of Section 10 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Subject to certain exceptions to be approved by the relevant regulators or certain facts to be ascertained, the public offer will not be made directly or indirectly, in or into any jurisdiction where to do so would constitute a violation of the laws of such jurisdiction, or by use of the mails or by any means or instrumentality (including without limitation, facsimile transmission, telephone and the internet) of interstate or foreign commerce, or any facility of a national securities exchange, of any such jurisdiction.  Important Additional Information Will be Filed with the SEC In connection with the proposed transaction, LogMeIn and GetGo intend to file registration statements with the SEC. LogMeIn will also file a proxy statement. Citrix stockholders are urged to read the prospectus and/or information statement that will be included in the registration statements and any other relevant documents when they become available, and LogMeIn stockholders are urged to read the proxy statement and any other relevant documents when they become available, because they will contain important information about LogMeIn, GetGo, Citrix and the proposed transactions.

LogMeIn Q2 2016 Earnings Press Release 











Forward-Looking Statements



This communication contains “forward-looking statements” concerning LogMeIn, Inc. (“LogMeIn”), Citrix Systems, Inc. (“Citrix”), GetGo, Inc. (“GetGo”), the proposed transactions and other matters. All statements other than statements of historical fact contained in this report are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and Section 21E of the United States Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Forward-looking statements usually relate to future events and anticipated revenues, earnings, cash flows or other aspects of our operations or operating results. Forward-looking statements are often identified by the words “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “plan,” “intend,” “foresee,” “should,” “would,” “could,” “may,” “estimate,” “outlook” and similar expressions, including the negative thereof. The absence of these words, however, does not mean that the statements are not forward-looking. These forward-looking statements are based on the current expectations, beliefs and assumptions of the management of LogMeIn concerning future developments, business conditions, anticipated synergies, pro forma financial results, LogMeIn’s plans to issue dividends in connection with the transaction, and their potential effects. There can be no assurance that future developments affecting the parties will be those that the parties anticipate.
Among the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from those described in the forward-looking statements are the following: (1) the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could give rise to the termination of the merger agreement, (2) the risk that LogMeIn’s stockholders may not approve the issuance of the LogMeIn common stock in connection with the proposed merger, (3) the risk that the necessary regulatory approvals may not be obtained or may be obtained subject to conditions that are not anticipated, (4) risks that any of the closing conditions to the proposed merger, including Citrix’s distribution of the shares of GetGo, may not be satisfied in a timely manner, (5) risks related to disruption of management time from ongoing business operations due to the proposed transactions, (6) failure to realize the estimated synergies or growth from the proposed transactions or that such benefits may take longer to realize than expected, (7) risks related to unanticipated costs of integration of GetGo by LogMeIn, (8) the effect of the announcement of the proposed transactions or the consummation of the proposed transactions on the ability of LogMeIn and Citrix to retain and hire key personnel and maintain relationships with their key business partners and customers, and on their operating results and businesses generally, (9) the length of time necessary to consummate the proposed transactions, (10) adverse trends in economic conditions generally or in the industries in which the LogMeIn and Citrix operate, (11) adverse changes to, or interruptions in, relationships with third parties unrelated to the announcement, (12) LogMeIn’s ability to compete effectively and successfully and to add new products and services, (13) LogMeIn’s ability to successfully manage and integrate acquisitions, (14) the ability to attract new customers and retain existing customers in the manner anticipated, (15)  unanticipated changes relating to competitive factors in the parties’ industries, and (16) the business interruptions in connection with the LogMeIn’s technology systems.  Discussions of additional risks and uncertainties are contained in LogMeIn’s and Citrix’s filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). None of LogMeIn, Citrix or GetGo is under any obligation, and each expressly disclaim any obligation, to update, alter, or otherwise revise any forward-looking statements, whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.  Persons reading this announcement are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements which speak only as of the date hereof.
No Offer or Solicitation
This communication is not intended to and does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to subscribe for or buy or an invitation to purchase or subscribe for any securities or the solicitation of any vote in any jurisdiction pursuant to the proposed transactions or otherwise, nor shall there be any sale, issuance or transfer of securities in any jurisdiction in contravention of applicable law.  No offer of securities shall be made except by means of a prospectus meeting the requirements of Section 10 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Subject to certain exceptions to be approved by the relevant regulators or certain facts to be ascertained, the public offer will not be made directly or indirectly, in or into any jurisdiction where to do so would constitute a violation of the laws of such jurisdiction, or by use of the mails or by any means or instrumentality (including without limitation, facsimile transmission, telephone and the internet) of interstate or foreign commerce, or any facility of a national securities exchange, of any such jurisdiction.
Important Additional Information and Where to Find It
In connection with the proposed transaction, LogMeIn filed a registration statement on Form S-4 with the SEC on September 16, 2016, as amended on October 20, 2016, November 18, 2016 and December 13, 2016, and which was declared effective on December 15, 2016. This registration statement includes a proxy statement that also constitutes a prospectus, which was sent to LogMeIn stockholders on or about December 20, 2016.  Stockholders are urged to read the proxy statement/prospectus and any other relevant documents when they become available, because they will contain important information about LogMeIn, GetGo, Citrix and the proposed merger. The proxy statement/prospectus and other documents relating to the proposed transactions (when they become available) can also be obtained free of charge from the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov. The proxy statement/prospectus and other documents (when they are available) can also be obtained free of charge from LogMeIn upon written request to LogMeIn, Inc., Investor Relations, 333 Summer Street, Boston, MA 02210 or by calling (781) 897-0694.

However, LogMeIn, Citrix and certain of their respective directors and executive officers may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies from shareholders of LogMeIn in connection with the proposed transaction under the rules of the SEC. Information about the directors and executive officers of Citrix may be found in its Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 18, 2016, and its definitive proxy statement relating to its 2016 Annual Meeting of Shareholders filed with the SEC on April 29, 2016.

Technology[edit]
LogMeIn remote access products use a proprietary remote desktop protocol that is transmitted via SSL. An SSL certificate is created for each remote desktop and is used to cryptographically secure communications between the remote desktop and the accessing computer.[7]
Users access remote desktops using either the LogMeIn Ignition stand-alone application or a web portal. The web portal requires either an ActiveX plugin for Internet Explorer, or an extension for Firefox (the LogMeIn plug-in for Firefox), or an extension for Safari (the LogMeIn plug-in for Safari), or a plugin for Google Chrome.[8] Failing that it falls back to requiring Java in order to run a Java program,[9] and failing that it falls back to "a screen-shot-based HTML remote control".[10] The web portal also provides status information for the remote computers and, optionally, remote computer management functions.
The service connects the remote desktop and the local computer using SSL over TCP or UDP and utilizing NAT traversal techniques to achieve peer-to-peer connectivity when available.[7][11][12]
Company history[edit]
The company was formerly known as 3am Labs, Inc. before March 2006. As of December 31, 2012, the Company serves over 213 million Internet-enabled devices, like smartphones and tablets. There are five data centers operating in the company, four in the United States and one in Europe.[2]
The company's CEO Michael Simon and CTO Márton Anka collaborated at Uproar, an Internet game site eventually bought by Vivendi Universal at the height of the dot-com bubble.[13][14] Anka's work for Uproar allegedly laid the foundation for his RemotelyAnywhere application, which later evolved into LogMeIn after 3am Labs incorporated.[13]
3am Labs acquired the Hamachi VPN product.[15]
LogMeIn, Inc., changed its name from 3am Labs in 2006.[16]
Tridia sued LogMeIn, Inc. for patent infringement in January 2008.[17][18]
LogMeIn, Inc., completed an IPO in 2009. Trading of LogMeIn, Inc. shares on the NASDAQ Global Market commenced on July 1, 2009.[19]
In 2011, the company began a move into cloud services for the Internet of Things by acquiring Pachube, which would later become the Xively service.[20] In May 2014, it added to this initiative by acquiring Ionia Corp., which specializes in integrating connected objects.[21]
LogMeIn, Inc., acquired Bold Software, LLC in 2012.[22][23]
LogMeIn acquired Meldium for $15 Million in September 2014.[24]
LogMeIn acquired LastPass for $110 Million in October 2015.[6][25]
LogMeIn announced in July 2016 a merger with Citrix's GoTo Family of Products via a Reverse Morris Trust.[3]

LogMeIn Central – web application focused on IT management for remotely managing PCs and servers running on Windows or Mac OS X operating systems
LogMeIn Rescue – remote support (help desk) web application used by large contact centers and help desks for diagnosing and troubleshooting computers, smartphones and tablets[citation needed]

LastPass[6]

Technology[edit]
LogMeIn remote access products use a proprietary remote desktop protocol that is transmitted via SSL. An SSL certificate is created for each remote desktop and is used to cryptographically secure communications between the remote desktop and the accessing computer.[7]
Users access remote desktops using either the LogMeIn Ignition stand-alone application or a web portal. The web portal requires either an ActiveX plugin for Internet Explorer, or an extension for Firefox (the LogMeIn plug-in for Firefox), or an extension for Safari (the LogMeIn plug-in for Safari), or a plugin for Google Chrome.[8] Failing that it falls back to requiring Java in order to run a Java program,[9] and failing that it falls back to "a screen-shot-based HTML remote control".[10] The web portal also provides status information for the remote computers and, optionally, remote computer management functions.
The service connects the remote desktop and the local computer using SSL over TCP or UDP and utilizing NAT traversal techniques to achieve peer-to-peer connectivity when available.[7][11][12]
Company history[edit]
The company was formerly known as 3am Labs, Inc. before March 2006. As of December 31, 2012, the Company serves over 213 million Internet-enabled devices, like smartphones and tablets. There are five data centers operating in the company, four in the United States and one in Europe.[2]
The company's CEO Michael Simon and CTO Márton Anka collaborated at Uproar, an Internet game site eventually bought by Vivendi Universal at the height of the dot-com bubble.[13][14] Anka's work for Uproar allegedly laid the foundation for his RemotelyAnywhere application, which later evolved into LogMeIn after 3am Labs incorporated.[13]
3am Labs acquired the Hamachi VPN product.[15]
LogMeIn, Inc., changed its name from 3am Labs in 2006.[16]
Tridia sued LogMeIn, Inc. for patent infringement in January 2008.[17][18]
LogMeIn, Inc., completed an IPO in 2009. Trading of LogMeIn, Inc. shares on the NASDAQ Global Market commenced on July 1, 2009.[19]
In 2011, the company began a move into cloud services for the Internet of Things by acquiring Pachube, which would later become the Xively service.[20] In May 2014, it added to this initiative by acquiring Ionia Corp., which specializes in integrating connected objects.[21]
LogMeIn, Inc., acquired Bold Software, LLC in 2012.[22][23]
LogMeIn acquired Meldium for $15 Million in September 2014.[24]
LogMeIn acquired LastPass for $110 Million in October 2015.[6][25]
LogMeIn announced in July 2016 a merger with Citrix's GoTo Family of Products via a Reverse Morris Trust.[3]

Products[edit]
The company's products are focused on four business areas, including Collaboration services, IT Management services, Customer support services, and Internet of Things services. The products include:

LogMeIn Pro – subscription-based remote access and administration software
LogMeIn Central – web application focused on IT management for remotely managing PCs and servers running on Windows or Mac OS X operating systems
LogMeIn Rescue – remote support (help desk) web application used by large contact centers and help desks for diagnosing and troubleshooting computers, smartphones and tablets[citation needed]
LogMeIn Hamachi – network virtualization and VPN service
LogMeIn Backup – remote backup software
join.me – a freemium meeting and online collaboration software
RemotelyAnywhere – remote access and administration software
Xively – Platform-as-a-Service for building and managing Internet of Things devices and related services
Cubby – a defunct cloud file and sync and share service [5]
BoldChat – a premier[citation needed] live chat and click-to-call customer service solution used by thousands of retail, financial services, manufacturing, software, and telecommunications organizations
AppGuru
Meldium – Team password manager, Cloud Identity & Access Management
LastPass[6]

Technology[edit]
LogMeIn remote access products use a proprietary remote desktop protocol that is transmitted via SSL. An SSL certificate is created for each remote desktop and is used to cryptographically secure communications between the remote desktop and the accessing computer.[7]
Users access remote desktops using either the LogMeIn Ignition stand-alone application or a web portal. The web portal requires either an ActiveX plugin for Internet Explorer, or an extension for Firefox (the LogMeIn plug-in for Firefox), or an extension for Safari (the LogMeIn plug-in for Safari), or a plugin for Google Chrome.[8] Failing that it falls back to requiring Java in order to run a Java program,[9] and failing that it falls back to "a screen-shot-based HTML remote control".[10] The web portal also provides status information for the remote computers and, optionally, remote computer management functions.
The service connects the remote desktop and the local computer using SSL over TCP or UDP and utilizing NAT traversal techniques to achieve peer-to-peer connectivity when available.[7][11][12]
Company history[edit]
The company was formerly known as 3am Labs, Inc. before March 2006. As of December 31, 2012, the Company serves over 213 million Internet-enabled devices, like smartphones and tablets. There are five data centers operating in the company, four in the United States and one in Europe.[2]
The company's CEO Michael Simon and CTO Márton Anka collaborated at Uproar, an Internet game site eventually bought by Vivendi Universal at the height of the dot-com bubble.[13][14] Anka's work for Uproar allegedly laid the foundation for his RemotelyAnywhere application, which later evolved into LogMeIn after 3am Labs incorporated.[13]
3am Labs acquired the Hamachi VPN product.[15]
LogMeIn, Inc., changed its name from 3am Labs in 2006.[16]
Tridia sued LogMeIn, Inc. for patent infringement in January 2008.[17][18]
LogMeIn, Inc., completed an IPO in 2009. Trading of LogMeIn, Inc. shares on the NASDAQ Global Market commenced on July 1, 2009.[19]
In 2011, the company began a move into cloud services for the Internet of Things by acquiring Pachube, which would later become the Xively service.[20] In May 2014, it added to this initiative by acquiring Ionia Corp., which specializes in integrating connected objects.[21]
LogMeIn, Inc., acquired Bold Software, LLC in 2012.[22][23]
LogMeIn acquired Meldium for $15 Million in September 2014.[24]
LogMeIn acquired LastPass for $110 Million in October 2015.[6][25]
LogMeIn announced in July 2016 a merger with Citrix's GoTo Family of Products via a Reverse Morris Trust.[3]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
