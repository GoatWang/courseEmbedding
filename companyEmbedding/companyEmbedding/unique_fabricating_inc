Unique Fabricating Participates in Inaugural Foam Expo in Novi, Michigan


As the automotive fabrication leader Unique Fabricating was honored to take part in the first Foam Expo.  Our wide range of molded and die-cut parts were on display as we fielded many questions regarding the latest material and design innovations focused on air/water sealing, acoustic and BSR applications.  Customer interest centered on new options offered by our investments in advanced molding technology; RIM PUR, fusion, compression and vacuum.  In addition, our production locations in USA, Mexico, and Canada helped differentiate us versus our competition.  We look forward to returning in 2018.

Unique Fabricating Awarded New Order for TwinShape Foam Duct

"More and more, auto suppliers are recognizing our light weight TwinShape duct system as a superior alternative to conventional blow molded duct components.

Unique Fabricating Participates in Inaugural Foam Expo in Novi, Michigan


As the automotive fabrication leader Unique Fabricating was honored to take part in the first Foam Expo.  Our wide range of molded and die-cut parts were on display as we fielded many questions regarding the latest material and design innovations focused on air/water sealing, acoustic and BSR applications.  Customer interest centered on new options offered by our investments in advanced molding technology; RIM PUR, fusion, compression and vacuum.  In addition, our production locations in USA, Mexico, and Canada helped differentiate us versus our competition.  We look forward to returning in 2018.

Unique Fabricating Awarded New Order for TwinShape Foam Duct

 
A German OEM has awarded a new program order for our TwinShape foam duct technology to be used on a popular mid-size SUV beginning in Q1 2017.  Application attributes are many vs. current blow molded plastic ducts including: 80% weight reduction, eliminates condensation and BSR's, increased NVH performance, heats up and cools down quicker, and a lower tooling investment. 
          
          "This award expands the production and utilization of our lightweight, flexible TwinShape duct system and provides one of our key customers with an innovative solution that directly addresses auto manufacturers'  priorities for weight reduction, quieter vehicles, and fuel efficiency" said John Weinhardt, Chief Executive Officer.  "More and more, auto suppliers are recognizing our light weight TwinShape duct system as a superior alternative to conventional blow molded duct components.  We have ongoing development and prototyping programs with five additional OEMs, or their Tier One suppliers, for potential inclusion in future vehicles".

AUBURN HILLS, Mich., May 2, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Unique Fabricating, Inc. ("Unique" or the "Company") (NYSE MKT: UFAB), which engineers and manufactures multi-material foam, rubber, and plastic components utilized in noise, vibration and harshness management and air/water sealing applications for the automotive and industrial appliance market, today announced it has acquired the business and substantially all of the assets of Intasco Corporation, a Canadian-based provider and manufacturer of precision die cut solutions, and purchased 100% of the outstanding capital stock of Intasco USA, Inc. (together "Intasco").








Intasco provides cutting-edge and highly specialized adhesive products to the automotive and manufacturing industries, primarily in the United States and Canada. The company is a leader in providing material conversion of pressure-sensitive products such as film, label stock and foams, as well as adhesives and automotive die cuts with a specialty in interior and exterior attachment systems.
"This strategic, highly synergistic and accretive acquisition significantly broadens our solution offerings, production capabilities, and expands our reach in our existing markets, as well as certain adjacent, markets," said John Weinhardt, Chief Executive Officer. "This acquisition is representative of our strategy to acquire profitable companies that add new markets, products and processes that enable us to recognize sales efficiencies and expand our scale. The specialized processes and customized nature of Intasco's offerings provide an attractive, high-margin growth opportunity to augment our financial performance and further capitalize on the operating leverage inherent in our business model, which we believe, will enable meaningful, profitable expansion of our business and increased free cash flow."
Intasco generated approximately $17.8 million USD in revenues, with net income of approximately $2.6 million USD and EBITDA of approximately $3.6 million USD, based on unaudited financial results for the 12 month period ending January 31, 2016. 
Mr. Weinhardt added, "Intasco is a leader in precision die cutting and double-sided attachment tapes. Through this transaction we are enhancing our position as a one-stop shop for many of our current customers and creating opportunities to expand the addressable market of the Intasco business. This combination provides us with a stronger geographic presence in Canada, additional opportunities to service key customers and it helps us strengthen our competitive position in the markets we serve." 
In consideration for the acquisition, which closed on April 29, 2016, a newly formed subsidiary of the Company, Unique-Intasco Canada, Inc. (the "Canadian Buyer"), paid approximately $26.5 million CAD ($21.0 million USD) in cash at closing for the purchase of Intasco Corporation.  In addition, Unique Fabricating NA, Inc. (the "US Buyer"),  an existing subsidiary of the Company, purchased 100% of the outstanding capital stock of Intasco USA, Inc., for approximately $1 million CAD (approximately $790,000 USD) paid by the issuance of  70,797 shares of the Company's common stock, par value $0.001 per share. The shares issued are "restricted shares" issued in reliance on an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. A portion of the purchase price is being held in escrow to fund the obligations of Intasco and a related party to indemnify the Canadian Buyer and US Buyer against certain claims, losses, and liabilities. The purchase price of the total Acquisition is subject to adjustment based upon Intasco's working capital at closing.
To finance the acquisition, Unique refinanced its existing senior credit facility with Citizens Bank, including a $30 million revolving line of credit, a $17 million term loan to Unique NA, and a $15 million term loan to Unique-Intasco Canada, with Citizens serving as the syndication agent.

We estimate that the net proceeds to us from the sale of 2,350,000 shares of our
common stock that we are selling in this offering will be approximately $19.23
million, after deducting the estimated underwriting discount and estimated
offering expenses payable by us. If the underwriters’ option to purchase
additional shares is exercised in full, we estimate that we will receive
additional net proceeds of approximately $3.08 million.

The principal purposes of this offering are to increase our capitalization and
financial flexibility, increase our visibility in the marketplace and create a
public market for our common stock. We intend to use the net proceeds from this
offering to repay the approximate $13.13 million principal amount of our 16%
senior subordinated note due March 16, 2018, together with accrued interest
through the date of payment. $11.50 million principal amount of the 16% senior
subordinated note was issued in March 2013 to finance, in part, our acquisition.
An additional $1.50 million principal amount of the note was issued in December
2013 to finance, in part, the acquisition of the PTI Business. The remaining
$0.13 million principal amount was issued to pay interest in kind. We will use
proceeds remaining after payment of the 16% senior subordinated note, including
any proceeds we receive if the over-allotment is exercised by our underwriters,
to temporarily reduce borrowings under the revolver portion of our senior
secured credit facility which matures on March 15, 2018. Borrowings under the
revolver portion of our senior secured credit facility are subject to a
borrowing base and bear interest at a rate per annum equal to 30 day LIBOR plus
a margin that ranges from 2.75% to 3.25%. At March 29, 2015, the effective
interest rate was 3.18% per annum. Amounts paid under the facility will be
available to be re-borrowed, subject to our compliance with the terms of the
facility. Borrowings under the revolver portion of our senior secured credit 
facility are used for general corporate purposes, including working capital, 
sales and marketing activities and general and administrative matters.

We retain broad discretion in the use of the net proceeds from this offering and
could utilize the proceeds for purposes other than the repayment of the 16%
senior subordinated note and borrowings under the revolver portion of our senior
credit facility, including any proceeds we receive if the overallotment option
is exercised by our underwriters. We may use net proceeds in ways that do not
necessarily improve our results of operations or enhance the value of our common
stock. Pending the uses described above, we intend to repay borrowings under our
revolver, which will be available to be re-borrowed, subject to our compliance
with the terms of the facility and to invest any net proceeds that are not so
used in short term, interest-bearing obligations, investment-grade instruments,
certificates of deposit or direct or guaranteed obligations of the U.S.
government.


The vehicle component supply industry is highly competitive. Our products
primarily compete on the basis of price, breadth of product offerings, product
quality, technical expertise and development capability, product delivery and
product service. Increased competition may lead to price reductions resulting in
reduced gross margins and loss of market share.

Current and future competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish
cooperative relationships among themselves or with others, foresee the course of
market development more accurately than we do, develop products that are
superior to our products, produce similar products at lower cost than we can or
adapt more quickly to new technologies, industry or customer requirements. By
doing so, they may enhance their ability to meet the needs of our customers or
potential future customers. These developments could limit our ability to obtain
revenues from new customers and to maintain existing revenues from our customer
base. We may not be able to compete successfully against current and future
competitors and the failure to do so may have a material adverse effect on our
business, operating results and financial condition.
