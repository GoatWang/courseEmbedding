OAKLAND, Calif., Nov. 18, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- USCF Advisers and SummerHaven Index Management LLC (SummerHaven), a Stamford, CT based commodity index provider, will collaborate to develop a mutual fund based on the SummerHaven Dynamic Commodity Index (SDCI).  The mutual fund will initially offer two share classes (A shares and I shares).  The fund will seek to track the performance of the SDCI. 








"USCF and SummerHaven broke new ground in 2010 with the launch of USCI, the United States Commodity Index Fund," said John Love, President and CEO of USCF. "We wanted to work together to offer the same type of strategy to investors who prefer mutual funds and to those seeking a quality commodity product without a K-1."   
The mutual fund will invest in commodities via a Cayman Islands subsidiary.  SummerHaven Index Management LLC (SummerHaven), a Stamford, CT based commodity index provider and commodity trading adviser, will manage the commodity investments.  USCF Advisor, LLC will serve as the investment advisor of the mutual fund. 
"We are excited to build on our long-term collaboration with USCF and to leverage the great success of USCI," said Ashraf Rizvi, Partner of SummerHaven.  "This new mutual fund utilizes the established SummerHaven Dynamic Commodity Index (SDCI) as its benchmark, providing an attractive commodity mutual fund product with no K-1 for investors."  
SummerHaven and USCF have collaborated on three exchange traded products:  the United States Copper Index Fund (Ticker: CPER), the United States Agriculture Index Fund (Ticker: USAG) and the United States Commodity Index Fund (USCI), which also uses SDCI as a benchmark.  The SDCI is a total return commodity sector index designed to broadly represent major commodities. The SDCI reflects the performance of a fully collateralized portfolio of 14 commodity futures, selected each month from a universe of 27 eligible contracts.  Unlike many commodity products, the index rebalances to equal weights on a monthly basis and features a diversification rule that allows it to maintain broad exposure to all commodity sectors. 
"Our team is thrilled with the opportunity to expand our relationship with SummerHaven," said Love.  "We feel that they possess unparalleled expertise and depth of knowledge, and their work is a benefit to the entire world of commodity investing."

Commodity Fund Disclosures: Commodity trading is highly speculative and involves a high degree of risk. Commodities and futures generally are volatile and are not suitable for all investors. Investing in commodity interests subject each Fund to the risks of its related industry. An investor may lose all or substantially all of an investment. These risks could result in large fluctuations in the price of a particular Fund's respective shares. Funds that focus on a single sector generally experience greater volatility. For further discussion of these and additional risks associated with an investment in the Funds please read the respective Fund Prospectus before investing. 
An investor should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Fund carefully before investing. To obtain a prospectus containing this and other information, please call 1-800-920-0259 or download the file from www.uscfinvestments.com. 
Diversification does not eliminate the risk of experiencing investment losses.  An investment in the fund involves risk, including loss of principle.

USCF will cause the Fund to transfer the proceeds of the sale of Creation
Baskets to the Custodian or another custodian for use in trading activities.
USCF will invest the Fund’s assets in Oil Interests. When the Fund takes short
positions in Oil Interests that are exchange-traded, the Fund will be required
to deposit typically 5% to 30% with the FCM on behalf of the exchange a portion
of the value of the contract or other interest as security to ensure payment for
the obligation under the Oil Interests at maturity. This deposit is known as
initial margin. Counterparties in transactions in OTC contracts will generally
impose similar collateral requirements on the Fund. USCF will invest the Fund’s
assets that remain after margin and collateral is posted in Treasuries, cash
and/or cash equivalents. Subject to these margin and collateral requirements,
USCF has sole authority to determine the percentage of assets that will be:

• held as margin or collateral with FCMs or other custodians;

• used for other investments; and

• held in bank accounts to pay current obligations and as reserves.

Approximately 15% to 90% of the Fund’s assets will be committed as margin for
commodity futures contracts. However, from time to time, the percentage of
assets committed as margin may be substantially more, or less, than such range.
Ongoing margin and collateral payments will generally be required for both
exchange-traded and OTC contracts based on changes in the value of the Oil
Interests. Furthermore, ongoing collateral requirements with respect to OTC
contracts are negotiated by the parties, and may be affected by overall market
volatility, volatility of the underlying commodity or index, the ability of the
counterparty to hedge its exposure under the Oil Interests, and each party’s
creditworthiness. In light of the differing requirements for initial payments
under exchange-traded and OTC contracts and the fluctuating nature of ongoing
margin and collateral payments, it is not possible to estimate what portion of
the Fund’s assets will be posted as margin or collateral at any given time. The
Treasuries, cash and cash equivalents held by the Fund will constitute reserves
that will be available to meet ongoing margin and collateral requirements. All
interest income will be used for the Fund’s benefit. USCF invests the balance of
the Fund’s assets not invested in Oil Interests or held in margin as reserves to
be available for changes in margin. All interest income is used for the Fund’s
benefit.

An FCM, counterparty, government agency or exchange could increase margin or
collateral requirements applicable to the Fund to hold trading positions at any
time. Moreover, margin is merely a security deposit and has no bearing on the
profit or loss potential for any positions held.

The assets of the Fund posted as margin for the Benchmark Oil Futures Contracts
or other exchange-traded futures contracts will be held in segregation pursuant
to the CEA and CFTC regulations.

If the Fund enters into a swap agreement, it must post both collateral and
independent amounts to its swap counterparty(ies). The amount of collateral the
Fund posts changes according to the amounts owed by the Fund to its counterparty
on a given swap transaction, while independent amounts are fixed amounts posted
by the Fund at the start of a swap transaction. Collateral and independent
amounts posted to swap counterparties will be held by a third party custodian.

The USCF Funds Trust (the “Trust”) is a Delaware statutory trust formed on March
2, 2016 pursuant to the Delaware Statutory Trust Act. The United States 3x Short
Oil Fund (the “Fund”), is one of the series of the Trust (each such series, a
“REX Fund” and together, the “REX Funds”). The Fund is a


 commodity pool that
continuously issues common shares of beneficial interest that may be purchased
and sold on NYSE. The Trust and the Fund operate pursuant to the Amended and
Restated Trust’s Declaration of Trust and Trust Agreement (the “Trust
Agreement”), dated as of June 23, 2017. Wilmington Trust, National Association,
a national banking association, with its principal place of business in the
State of Delaware, is the Delaware trustee of the Trust. The Trust and the Fund
are managed and controlled by USCF. USCF is a limited liability company formed
in Delaware on May 10, 2005, that is registered as a commodity pool operator
(“CPO”) with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) and is a member
of the National Futures Association (“NFA”).

The Fund’s Investment Objective and Strategy

The investment objective of the Fund will be for the daily changes in percentage
terms of its shares’ per share net asset value (“NAV”) to reflect three times
the inverse (-3x) of the daily change in percentage terms of the price of a
specified short-term futures contract on light, sweet crude oil (the “Benchmark
Oil Futures Contract”) less the Fund’s expenses. To achieve this objective, USCF
will endeavor to have the notional value of the Fund’s aggregate short exposure
to the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract at the close of each trading day
approximately equal to 300% of the Fund’s NAV. The Fund will seek a return that
is -300% of the return of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract for a single day
and does not seek to achieve its stated investment objective over a period of
time greater than one day. The pursuit of daily inverse leveraged investment
goals means that the return of the Fund for a period longer than a full trading
day may have no resemblance to -300% of the return of the Benchmark Oil Futures
Contract for a period of longer than a full trading day because the aggregate
return of the Fund is the product of the series of each trading day’s daily
returns.

USCF will cause the Fund to transfer the proceeds of the sale of Creation
Baskets to the Custodian or another custodian for use in trading activities.
USCF will invest the Fund’s assets in Oil Interests. When the Fund purchases Oil
Interests that are exchange-traded, the Fund will be required to deposit
typically 5% to 30% with the FCM on behalf of the exchange a portion of the
value of the contract or other interest as security to ensure payment for the
obligation under the Oil Interests at maturity. This deposit is known as initial
margin. Counterparties in transactions in OTC contracts will generally impose
similar collateral requirements on the Fund. USCF will invest the Fund’s assets
that remain after margin and collateral is posted in Treasuries, cash and/or
cash equivalents. Subject to these margin and collateral requirements, USCF has
sole authority to determine the percentage of assets that will be:

• held as margin or collateral with FCMs or other custodians;

• used for other investments; and

• held in bank accounts to pay current obligations and as reserves.

Approximately 15% to 90% of the Fund’s assets will be committed as margin for
commodity futures contracts. However, from time to time, the percentage of
assets committed as margin may be substantially more, or less, than such range.
Ongoing margin and collateral payments will generally be required for both
exchange-traded and OTC contracts based on changes in the value of the Oil
Interests. Furthermore, ongoing collateral requirements with respect to OTC
contracts are negotiated by the parties, and may be affected by overall market
volatility, volatility of the underlying commodity or index, the ability of the
counterparty to hedge its exposure under the Oil Interests, and each party’s
creditworthiness. In light of the differing requirements for initial payments
under exchange-traded and OTC contracts and the fluctuating nature of ongoing
margin and collateral payments, it is not possible to estimate what portion of
the Fund’s assets will be posted as margin or collateral at any given time. The
Treasuries, cash and cash equivalents held by the Fund will constitute reserves
that will be available to meet ongoing margin and collateral requirements. All
interest income will be used for the Fund’s benefit. USCF invests the balance of
the Fund’s assets not invested in Oil Interests or held in margin as reserves to
be available for changes in margin. All interest income is used for the Fund’s
benefit.

An FCM, counterparty, government agency or exchange could increase margin or
collateral requirements applicable to the Fund to hold trading positions at any
time. Moreover, margin is merely a security deposit and has no bearing on the
profit or loss potential for any positions held.

The assets of the Fund posted as margin for the Benchmark Oil Futures Contracts
or other exchange-traded futures contracts will be held in segregation pursuant
to the CEA and CFTC regulations.

If the Fund enters into a swap agreement, it must post both collateral and
independent amounts to its swap counterparty(ies). The amount of collateral the
Fund posts changes according to the amounts owed by the Fund to its counterparty
on a given swap transaction, while independent amounts are fixed amounts posted
by the Fund at the start of a swap transaction. Collateral and independent
amounts posted to swap counterparties will be held by a third party custodian.


Not Specified.


Company Description
The USCF Funds Trust (the “Trust”) is a Delaware statutory trust formed on March
2, 2016 pursuant to the Delaware Statutory Trust Act. The United States 3x Oil
Fund (the “Fund”) formed on June 23, 2017, is one of the series of the Trust
(each such series, a “REX Fund” and together, the “REX


 Funds”). The Fund is a
commodity pool that continuously issues common shares of beneficial interest
that may be purchased and sold on NYSE. The Trust and the Fund operate pursuant
to the Trust’s Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust and Trust Agreement
(the “Trust Agreement”), dated as of June 23, 2017. Wilmington Trust, National
Association, a national banking association, with its principal place of
business in the State of Delaware, is the Delaware trustee of the Trust. The
Trust and the Fund are managed and controlled by USCF. USCF is a limited
liability company formed in Delaware on May 10, 2005, that is registered as a
commodity pool operator (“CPO”) with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission
(“CFTC”) and is a member of the National Futures Association (“NFA”).

The Fund’s Investment Objective and Strategy 

The investment objective of the Fund will be for the daily changes in percentage
terms of its shares’ per share net asset value (“NAV”) to reflect three times
(3x) the daily change in percentage terms of the price of a specified short-term
futures contract on light, sweet crude oil (the “Benchmark Oil Futures
Contract”) less the Fund’s expenses. To achieve this objective, USCF will
endeavor to have the notional value of the Fund’s aggregate exposure to the
Benchmark Oil Futures Contract at the close of each trading day approximately
equal to 300% of the Fund’s NAV. The Fund will seek a return that is 300% of the
return of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract for a single day and does not seek
to achieve its stated investment objective over a period of time greater than
one day. The pursuit of daily leveraged investment goals means that the return
of the Fund for a period longer than a full trading day may have no resemblance
to 300% of the return of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract for a period of
longer than a full trading day because the aggregate return of the Fund is the
product of the series of each trading day’s daily returns.

Calculation methodologyThis tool provides a list of Vanguard ETFs and mutual funds that are similar to the non-Vanguard product you specified. All data and scoring is provided by Morningstar®, including the methodology which scores each product on a scale of 10 (most similar) to 0 (least similar). The methodology is based on several factors, including the category, special criteria, portfolio allocation, and performance of each product.The general process for generating a list of similar funds is as follows:First we conduct a preliminary screen of all Vanguard ETFs and mutual funds based on the category and other attributes of the product specified. For products with less than three years of performance history, a Performance score of "0" will be displayed, and the Overall similarity score will match the Portfolio score.Then we score each product based on how similar its portfolio is to that of the product you specified.We also score each product based on how similar its performance has been relative to the product you specified.Finally, we calculate an overall similarity score.The Performance score utilizes the last 36 months of returns, as of each month end. The Portfolio score utilizes the most recent daily portfolio stored for the fund and will reflect that portfolio at any given time.

PRELIMINARY PROSPECTUS




 




SUBJECT TO COMPLETION






 




 




Dated November 29, 2016




 

United
States 3x Oil Fund

1,000
Shares

*Principal
U.S. Listing Exchange: TBD.

 

The
United States 3x Oil Fund (the “Fund”), a series of the
USCF Funds Trust, is a fund that issues shares that trade on NYSE
Arca Equities, Inc. (“NYSE”). The investment objective
of the Fund is for the daily changes in percentage terms of its
shares’ per share net asset value (“NAV”) to
reflect three times (3x) the daily change in percentage terms of
the price of a specified short-term futures contract on light,
sweet crude oil called the “Benchmark Oil Futures
Contract.” The Fund seeks a return that is 300% of the return
of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract for a single day. The Fund
should not be expected to provide 300% of the cumulative return for
the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract for periods greater than a
day.

 

The Fund
pays its sponsor, United States Commodity Funds LLC
(“USCF”), a limited liability company, a management fee
and incurs certain other costs. The address of both USCF and the
Fund is 1999 Harrison Street, Suite 1530, Oakland, CA 94612. The
telephone number for both USCF and the Fund is 510.522.9600. In
order for a hypothetical investment in shares to breakeven over the
next 12 months, assuming a selling price of $25.00 the investment
would have to generate [ • ] % return or $ [
• ] .

The Fund
is an exchange traded fund. This means that most investors who
decide to buy or sell shares of the Fund place their trade orders
through their brokers and may incur customary brokerage commissions
and charges. Shares of the Fund trade on NYSE under the ticker
symbol “ [ • ] ” and are bought and sold
throughout the trading day at bid and ask prices like other
publicly traded securities.

Shares
will trade on NYSE after they are initially purchased by
“Authorized Participants,” institutional firms that
purchase shares in blocks of 50,000 shares called
“baskets” through the Fund’s marketing agent,
[•] (the “Marketing Agent”). The initial price
per share will be $25, the initial price per basket will be
$1,250,000, and [•] is the initial Authorized Participant.
Thereafter, the price of a basket will be equal to the NAV of
50,000 shares on the day that the order to purchase the basket is
accepted by the Marketing Agent. The NAV per share will be
calculated by taking the current market value of the Fund’s
total assets (after close of NYSE) subtracting any liabilities and
dividing that total by the total number of outstanding shares.
Factors that may affect the market value of the Fund, and thereby
the price per share, include, but are not limited to, worldwide and
domestic supplies of, and demand for, crude oil, regulatory
changes, and regulatory fees in the energy sector. Please see below
for additional information. The offering of the Fund’s shares
will be a “best efforts” offering, which means that
neither the Marketing Agent nor any Authorized Participant is
required to purchase a specific number or dollar amount of
shares.

USCF will
pay the Marketing Agent [ • ]. Aggregate compensation paid to
the Marketing Agent and any affiliate of USCF for
distribution-related services in connection with this offering of
shares will not exceed ten percent (10%) of the gross proceeds
of the offering.

 

The Fund
is not appropriate for all investors and presents many different
risks than other types of funds, including risks associated with
the use of leverage. The Fund is intended to be a daily trading
tool for sophisticated investors to manage daily trading risks. The
Fund uses leverage and should produce returns for a single day that
are more volatile than that of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract.
Additionally, the Fund is designed to achieve its stated investment
objective on a daily basis, but its performance over different
periods of time can differ significantly from its stated daily
objective. The Fund is riskier than securities that have
intermediate or long-term investment objectives, and may not be
suitable for investors who plan to hold shares of the Fund for a
period other than one day. The return of the Fund for a period
longer than a single day is the result of its return for each day
compounded over the period and usually will differ from the 300% of
the performance of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract for the same
period. Daily compounding of the Fund’s investment returns
can dramatically and adversely affect its longer-term performance
during periods of high volatility. Volatility may be at least as
important to the Fund’s return for a period as the return of
the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract. Accordingly, the Fund should be
purchased only by knowledgeable investors who understand the
potential consequences of seeking daily compounding leveraged long
investment results. Investors should actively and frequently
monitor their investments in the Fund, even intra-day. It is
possible that you will suffer significant losses in the Fund even
if the long-term performance of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract
is positive.

 

 




 




  

Investors
who buy or sell shares during the day from their broker may do so
at a premium or discount relative to the market value of the
underlying Benchmark Oil Futures Contracts in which the Fund
invests due to supply and demand forces at work in the secondary
trading market for shares. Investing in the Fund involves risks
similar to those involved with leveraged exposure to the Benchmark
Oil Futures Contracts, and other significant risks. See “
Risk Factors Involved with an Investment in the Fund ”
beginning on page [5].

The
offering of the Fund’s shares is registered with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) in
accordance with the Securities Act of 1933 (the “1933
Act”). The offering is intended to be a continuous offering
and is not expected to terminate until all of the registered shares
have been sold or three years from the date of the original
offering, whichever is earlier, unless extended as permitted under
the rules under the 1933 Act, although the offering may be
temporarily suspended if and when no suitable investments for the
Fund are available or practicable. The Fund is not an investment
company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940
(“1940 Act”) and is not subject to regulation under
such Act.

NEITHER
THE SEC NOR ANY STATE SECURITIES COMMISSION HAS APPROVED OR
DISAPPROVED OF THE SECURITIES OFFERED IN THIS PROSPECTUS, OR
DETERMINED IF THIS PROSPECTUS IS TRUTHFUL OR COMPLETE. ANY
REPRESENTATION TO THE CONTRARY IS A CRIMINAL
OFFENSE.

The Fund
is a commodity pool and USCF is a commodity pool operator subject
to regulation by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission
(“CFTC”) and the National Futures Association
(“NFA”) under the Commodities Exchange Act
(“CEA”).

THE
COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING COMMISSION HAS NOT PASSED UPON THE MERITS
OF PARTICIPATING IN THIS POOL NOR HAS THE COMMISSION PASSED ON THE

COMMODITY
FUTURES TRADING COMMISSION

 

RISK
DISCLOSURE STATEMENT

YOU SHOULD
CAREFULLY CONSIDER WHETHER YOUR FINANCIAL CONDITION PERMITS YOU TO
PARTICIPATE IN A COMMODITY POOL. IN SO DOING, YOU SHOULD BE AWARE
THAT COMMODITY INTEREST TRADING CAN QUICKLY LEAD TO LARGE LOSSES AS
WELL AS GAINS. SUCH TRADING LOSSES CAN SHARPLY REDUCE THE NET ASSET
VALUE OF THE POOL AND CONSEQUENTLY THE VALUE OF YOUR INTEREST IN
THE POOL. IN ADDITION, RESTRICTIONS ON REDEMPTIONS MAY AFFECT YOUR
ABILITY TO WITHDRAW YOUR PARTICIPATION IN THE POOL.

FURTHER,
COMMODITY POOLS MAY BE SUBJECT TO SUBSTANTIAL CHARGES FOR
MANAGEMENT, AND ADVISORY AND BROKERAGE FEES. IT MAY BE NECESSARY
FOR THOSE POOLS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO THESE CHARGES TO MAKE
SUBSTANTIAL TRADING PROFITS TO AVOID DEPLETION OR EXHAUSTION OF
THEIR ASSETS. THIS DISCLOSURE DOCUMENT CONTAINS A COMPLETE
DESCRIPTION OF EACH EXPENSE TO BE CHARGED THIS POOL AT PAGE 28
AND A STATEMENT OF THE PERCENTAGE RETURN NECESSARY TO BREAK EVEN,
THAT IS, TO RECOVER THE AMOUNT OF YOUR INITIAL INVESTMENT, AT
PAGE 29.

THIS BRIEF
STATEMENT CANNOT DISCLOSE ALL THE RISKS AND OTHER FACTORS NECESSARY
TO EVALUATE YOUR PARTICIPATION IN THIS COMMODITY POOL. THEREFORE,
BEFORE YOU DECIDE TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS COMMODITY POOL, YOU SHOULD
CAREFULLY STUDY THIS DISCLOSURE DOCUMENT, INCLUDING A DESCRIPTION
OF THE PRINCIPAL RISK FACTORS OF THIS INVESTMENT, AT
PAGE 5.

[YOU
SHOULD ALSO BE AWARE THAT THIS COMMODITY POOL MAY TRADE FOREIGN
FUTURES OR OPTIONS CONTRACTS. TRANSACTIONS ON MARKETS LOCATED
OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, INCLUDING MARKETS FORMALLY LINKED TO A
UNITED STATES MARKET, MAY BE SUBJECT TO REGULATIONS WHICH OFFER
DIFFERENT OR DIMINISHED PROTECTION TO THE POOL AND ITS
PARTICIPANTS. FURTHER, UNITED STATES REGULATORY AUTHORITIES MAY BE
UNABLE TO COMPEL THE ENFORCEMENT OF THE RULES OF REGULATORY
AUTHORITIES OR MARKETS IN NON-UNITED STATES JURISDICTIONS WHERE
TRANSACTIONS FOR THE POOL MAY BE EFFECTED.]

SWAPS
TRANSACTIONS, LIKE OTHER FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS, INVOLVE A VARIETY
OF SIGNIFICANT RISKS. THE SPECIFIC RISKS PRESENTED BY A PARTICULAR
SWAP TRANSACTION NECESSARILY DEPEND UPON THE TERMS OF THE
TRANSACTION AND YOUR CIRCUMSTANCES. IN GENERAL, HOWEVER, ALL SWAPS
TRANSACTIONS INVOLVE SOME COMBINATION OF MARKET RISK, CREDIT RISK,
COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISK, FUNDING RISK, LIQUIDITY RISK, AND
OPERATIONAL RISK.

HIGHLY
CUSTOMIZED SWAPS TRANSACTIONS IN PARTICULAR MAY INCREASE LIQUIDITY
RISK, WHICH MAY RESULT IN A SUSPENSION OF REDEMPTIONS. HIGHLY
LEVERAGED TRANSACTIONS MAY EXPERIENCE SUBSTANTIAL GAINS OR LOSSES
IN VALUE AS A RESULT OF RELATIVELY SMALL CHANGES IN THE VALUE OR
LEVEL OF AN UNDERLYING OR RELATED MARKET FACTOR.

IN
EVALUATING THE RISKS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH A
PARTICULAR SWAP TRANSACTION, IT IS IMPORTANT TO CONSIDER THAT A
SWAP TRANSACTION MAY BE MODIFIED OR TERMINATED ONLY BY MUTUAL
CONSENT OF THE ORIGINAL PARTIES AND SUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON
INDIVIDUALLY NEGOTIATED TERMS. THEREFORE, IT MAY NOT BE POSSIBLE
FOR THE COMMODITY POOL OPERATOR TO MODIFY, TERMINATE, OR OFFSET THE
POOL’S OBLIGATIONS OR THE POOL’S EXPOSURE TO THE RISKS
ASSOCIATED WITH A TRANSACTION PRIOR TO ITS SCHEDULED TERMINATION
DATE.

   PROSPECTUS
SUMMARY

This is
only a summary of the prospectus and, while it contains material
information about the Fund and its shares, it does not contain or
summarize all of the information about the Fund and its shares
contained in this prospectus that is material and/or which may be
important to you. You should read this entire prospectus, including
“Risk Factors Involved with an Investment in the Fund”
beginning on page 5, before making an investment decision about the
shares. For a glossary of defined terms, see Appendix
A.

 

The Fund
is not appropriate for all investors and present different risks
than other types of funds, including risks associated with the
effects of leveraged investing. An investor should only consider an
investment in the Fund if he or she understands the consequences of
seeking daily leveraged investment results. The Fund seeks to
return (before fees and expenses) a multiple (3x) of the
performance of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract for a single day,
not for any other period. The return of the Fund for a period
longer than a single day is the result of its return for each day
compounded over the period and usually will differ from the
Fund’s multiple times the return of the Benchmark Oil Futures
Contract for the same period. Daily compounding of the Fund’s
investment returns can dramatically and adversely affect its
longer-term performance during periods of high volatility.
Volatility may be at least as important to the Fund’s return
for a period as the return of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract.
The Fund uses leverage and should produce returns for a single day
that are more volatile than that of the Benchmark Oil Futures
Contract. For example, the return of the Fund for a single day
should be approximately three times as volatile as the return of a
fund for a single day with an objective of matching the same
Benchmark Oil Futures Contract. Shareholders who invest in the
Funds should actively manage and monitor their investments, as
frequently as daily.

 

  The
Trust and the Fund

 

The USCF
Funds Trust (the “Trust”) is a Delaware statutory trust
formed on March 2, 2016. The Trust is a series trust formed
pursuant to the Delaware Statutory Trust Act (each series, a
“Fund” and collectively, the “Funds”). The
United States 3x Oil Fund (the “Fund”) formed on
[ ·
]
, is a
series of the Trust. The Fund is a commodity pool that continuously
issues common shares of beneficial interest that may be purchased
and sold on NYSE Arca Equities,
Inc. stock exchange (“NYSE”). The Trust and the
Fund operate pursuant to the Trust’s Declaration of Trust and
Trust Agreement (the “Trust Agreement”), dated as of
March 2, 2016. Wilmington Trust Company, a Delaware trust company,
is the Delaware trustee of the Trust. The Trust and the Fund are
managed and controlled by USCF. USCF is a limited liability company
formed in Delaware on May 10, 2005, that is registered as a
commodity pool operator (“CPO”) with the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) and is a member of
the National Futures Association (“NFA”).


  The
Fund’s Investment Objective and Strategy

 

The
investment objective of the Fund is for the daily changes in
percentage terms of its shares’ per share net asset value
(“NAV”) to reflect three times (3x) the daily change in
percentage terms of the price of a specified short-term futures
contract on light, sweet crude oil called the “Benchmark Oil
Futures Contract.” less the Fund’s expenses. To achieve
this objective, USCF endeavors to have the notional value of the
Fund’s aggregate exposure to the Benchmark Oil Futures
Contract at the close of each trading day approximately equal to
the 300% of the Fund’s NAV. The Fund seeks a return that is
300% of the return of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract for a
single day and does not seek to achieve its stated investment
objective over a period of time greater than one day
.

 

The
pursuit of daily leveraged investment goals means that the return
of the Fund for a period longer than a full trading day may have no
resemblance to 300% of the return of the Benchmark Oil Futures
Contract for a period of longer than a full trading day because the
aggregate return of the Fund is the product of the series of each
trading day’s daily returns.

 

  What
Is the “Benchmark Oil Futures Contract”?

 

The
Benchmark Oil Futures Contract is the futures contract on light,
sweet crude oil as traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange (the
“NYMEX”) that is the near month contract to expire,
except when the near month contract is within two weeks of
expiration, in which case it will be measured by the futures
contract that is the next month contract to expire.

 

 

 




 



1



 




  

The Fund
seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing primarily in
futures contracts for light, sweet crude oil, other types of crude
oil, diesel-heating oil, gasoline, natural gas, and other
petroleum-based fuels that are traded on the NYMEX, ICE Futures
Exchange or other U.S. and foreign exchanges (collectively,
“Oil Futures Contracts”) and to a lesser extent, in
order to comply with regulatory requirements or in view of market
conditions, other oil-related investments such as cash-settled
options on Oil Futures Contracts, forward contracts for oil,
cleared swap contracts and non-exchange traded
(“over-the-counter” or “OTC”) transactions
that are based on the price of oil, other petroleum-based fuels,
Oil Futures Contracts and indices based on the foregoing
(collectively, “Other Oil-Related Investments”). Market
conditions that USCF currently anticipates could cause the Fund to
invest in Other Oil-Related Investments include those allowing the
Fund to obtain greater liquidity or to execute transactions with
more favorable pricing. (For convenience and unless otherwise
specified, Oil Futures Contracts and Other Oil-Related Investments
collectively are referred to as “Oil Interests” in this
prospectus.)

The Fund
seeks to invest in a combination of Oil Interests such that the
daily changes in its NAV, measured in percentage terms, less the
Fund’s expenses, will track three times (3x) the daily
changes in the price of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract, also
measured in percentage terms. As a specific benchmark, USCF
endeavors to place the Fund’s trades in Oil Interests and
otherwise manage the Fund’s investments so that the
difference between “A” and “B” will be
plus/minus 0.30 percent (0.30%) of “B”,
where:

 




 



•



 



A is the
average daily percentage change in the Fund’s per share NAV
for any period of thirty (30) successive valuation days,
i.e. , any NYSE trading day as of which the Fund calculates
its per share NAV, less the Fund’s expenses; and




 




 



•



 



B is three
times the average daily percentage change in the price of the
Benchmark Oil Futures Contract over the same period.




USCF
believes that market arbitrage opportunities will cause daily
changes in the Fund’s share price on NYSE on a percentage
basis, to closely track the daily changes in the Fund’s per
share NAV on a percentage basis. The Fund will not seek to achieve
its stated investment objective over a period of time greater
than one day . The pursuit of daily leveraged investment goals
means that the return of the Fund for a period longer than a full
trading day may have no resemblance to 300% of the return of the
Benchmark Oil Futures Contract for a period of longer than a full
trading day because the aggregate return of the Fund is the product
of the series of each trading day’s daily returns. During
periods of market volatility, the volatility of the Benchmark Oil
Futures Contract may affect the Fund’s return as much as or
more than the return of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract.
Further, the return for investors that invest for periods less than
a full trading day or for a period different than a trading day
will not be the product of the return of the Fund’s stated
investment objective and the performance of the Benchmark Oil
Futures Contract for the full trading day. Additionally, investors
should be aware that the Fund’s investment objective is not
for its NAV or market price of shares to equal, in dollar terms,
the spot price of light, sweet crude oil. Natural market forces
called contango and backwardation can impact the total return on an
investment in the Fund’s shares relative to a hypothetical
direct investment in crude oil and, in the future, it is likely
that the relationship between the market price of the Fund’s
shares and changes in the spot prices of light, sweet crude oil
will continue to be so impacted by contango and backwardation. (It
is important to note that the disclosure above ignores the
potential costs associated with physically owning and storing crude
oil, which could be substantial.)

  Principal
Investment Risks of an Investment in the Fund

 

An
investment in the Fund involves a degree of risk. Some of the risks
you may face are summarized below. A more extensive discussion of
these risks appears beginning on page 5.

Investment
Risk

 

Investors
may choose to use the Fund as a means of investing indirectly in
crude oil. There are significant risks and hazards inherent in the
crude oil industry that may cause the price of crude oil to widely
fluctuate.

Correlation
Risk

 

To the
extent that investors use the Fund as a means of indirectly
investing in crude oil, there is the risk that the daily changes in
the price of the Fund’s shares on the NYSE on a percentage
basis, will not closely track the daily changes in the spot price
of light, sweet crude oil on a percentage basis. This could happen
if the price of shares traded on the NYSE does not correlate
closely with the value of the Fund’s NAV; the changes in the
Fund’s NAV do not correlate closely with the changes in the
price of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract; or the changes in the
price of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract do not closely
correlate with the changes in the cash or spot price of crude oil.
This is a risk because if these correlations do not exist, then
investors may not be able to use the Fund as a cost-effective way
to indirectly invest in crude oil or as a hedge against the risk of
loss in crude oil-related transactions.

 

The price
relationship between the near month contract to expire and the next
month contract to expire that compose the Benchmark Oil Futures
Contract will vary and may impact both the total return over time
of the Fund’s NAV, as well as the degree to which its total
return tracks other crude oil price indices’ total returns.
In cases in which the near month contract’s price is lower
than the next month contract’s price (a situation known as
“contango” in the futures markets), then absent the
impact of the overall movement in crude oil prices the value of the
benchmark contract would tend to decline as it approaches
expiration. In cases in which the near month contract’s price
is higher than the next month contract’s price (a situation
known as “backwardation” in the futures markets), then
absent the impact of the overall movement in crude oil prices the
value of the benchmark contract would tend to rise as it approaches
expiration.

Compounding
Risk

 

The Fund
has a single-day investment objective. Because of daily rebalancing
and the compounding of each day’s return over time, the
return of the Fund for periods longer than a single day will be the
result of each day’s returns compounded over the period,
which will very likely differ from 300% of the return of the
Benchmark Oil Futures Contract over the same period. The Fund may
lose money if the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract performance is
flat over time, and as a result of daily rebalancing, the
volatility of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract and the effects of
compounding, it is even possible that the Fund will lose money over
time while the level of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract
increases.

 

The Fund
is designed to be utilized only by knowledgeable investors who
understand the potential consequences of seeking daily leveraged
investment results and are willing to monitor their portfolios
frequently. The Fund is not intended to be used by, and is not
appropriate for, investors who do not intend to actively monitor
and manage their portfolios.

 

Tax
Risk

 

The Fund
is organized and operated as a Delaware statutory trust, in
accordance with the provisions of its Trust Agreement and
applicable state law, but is taxed in a manner similar to a limited
partnership and therefore, has a more complex tax treatment than
conventional mutual funds.

Over-the-Counter
(“OTC”) Contract Risk

 

The Fund
may also invest in negotiated “OTC” contracts, which
are not as liquid as exchange-traded futures contracts. OTC
contracts expose the Fund to the risk that the Fund’s
counterparty may not be able to satisfy its obligations to the
Fund.

Other
Risks

 

The Fund
pays fees and expenses that are incurred regardless of whether it
is profitable.

Unlike
mutual funds, commodity pools or other investment pools that manage
their investments in an attempt to realize income and gains and
distribute such income and gains to their investors, the Fund
generally does not distribute cash to limited partners or other
shareholders. You should not invest in the Fund if you will need
cash distributions from the Fund to pay taxes on your share of
income and gains of the Fund, if any, or for any other
reason.

The Fund
has no operating history, so there is no performance history to
serve as a basis for you to evaluate an investment in the
Fund.

You will
have no rights to participate in the management of the Fund and
will have to rely on the duties and judgment of USCF to manage the
Fund.

The Fund
is subject to actual and potential inherent conflicts involving
USCF, the Marketing Agent, various commodity futures brokers and
Authorized Participants. USCF’s officers, directors and
employees do not devote their time exclusively to the Fund.
USCF’s personnel are directors, officers or employees of
other entities that may compete with the Fund for their services,
including other commodity pools (funds) that USCF manages (these
funds are referred to in this prospectus as the “Related
Public Funds” and are identified in the Glossary). USCF could
have a conflict between its responsibilities to the Fund and to
those other entities. As a result of these and other relationships,
parties involved with the Fund have a financial incentive to act in
a manner other than in the best interest of the Fund and the
shareholders.

  RISK
FACTORS INVOLVED WITH AN INVESTMENT IN THE FUND

You should
consider carefully the risks described below before making an
investment decision. You should also refer to the other information
included in this prospectus as well as information found in our
periodic reports, which includes the Trust’s and the
Fund’s financial statements and related notes.

  Risks
Related to Leveraged Investments

Due to the
compounding of daily returns, the Fund’s returns over periods
longer than a single day will likely differ in amount and possibly
even direction from the Fund multiple times the benchmark return
for the period.

 

The
investment objective of the Fund is for the daily changes in
percentage terms of its per share NAV to reflect three times (3x)
the daily change in percentage terms of the Benchmark Oil Futures
Contract. The Fund seeks investment results for a single day only,
as measured from NAV calculation time to NAV calculation time, and
not for any other period. The return of the Fund for a period
longer than a single day is the result of its return for each day
compounded over the period, and usually will differ from three
times (3x) the return of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract for the
same period. The Fund could lose money over time regardless of the
performance of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract, including as a
result of daily rebalancing, the Benchmark Oil Futures
Contract’s volatility, and compounding. Longer holding
periods, higher volatility of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract,
and greater leverage each affect the impact of compounding on the
Fund’s returns. Daily compounding of the Fund’s
investment returns can dramatically and adversely affect its
longer-term performance during periods of high volatility.
Volatility may be at least as important to the Fund’s return
for a period as the return of the Benchmark Oil Futures
Contract.

The Fund
uses leverage and should produce returns for a single day that are
more volatile than that of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract. For
example, the return for a single day should be approximately three
times as volatile for a single day as the return of a fund with an
objective of matching the performance of the Benchmark Oil Futures
Contract. The Fund is not appropriate for all investors and present
different risks than other funds. The Fund uses leverage and is
riskier than similarly benchmarked exchange-traded funds that do
not use leverage. An investor should only consider an investment in
the Fund if he or she understands the consequences of seeking daily
leveraged investment results for a single day. Daily objective
leveraged funds, if used properly and in conjunction with the
investor’s view on the future direction and volatility of the
markets, can be useful tools for investors who want to manage their
exposure to various markets and market segments and who are willing
to monitor and/or periodically rebalance their portfolios.
Shareholders who invest in the Funds should actively manage and
monitor their investments, as frequently as daily.

In
general, during periods of higher volatility for the Benchmark Oil
Futures Contract, compounding will cause the Fund’s results
for periods longer than a single day to be less than three times
(3x) the return of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract. This
effect becomes more pronounced as volatility increases. Conversely,
in periods of lower volatility for the Benchmark Oil Futures
Contract (particularly when combined with higher returns for the
Benchmark Oil Futures Contract), the Fund’s returns over
longer periods can be higher than three times (3x) the return
of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract. Actual results for a
particular period, before fees and expenses, are also dependent on
the magnitude of the return of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract
in addition to the volatility of the Benchmark Oil Futures
Contract.

Intraday
Price/Performance Risk.

The Fund
is typically rebalanced at or about the time of its NAV
calculation. As such, the intraday position of the Fund will
generally be different from the Fund’s stated daily
investment objective (i.e., 3x). When shares are bought intraday,
the performance of the Fund’s shares until the Fund’s
next NAV calculation will generally be greater than or less than
the Fund’s stated daily multiple.

The use of
leveraged positions could result in the total loss of an
investor’s investment.

The Fund
utilizes leverage in seeking to achieve its investment objective
and will lose more money in market environments adverse to its
respective daily investment objectives than funds that do not
employ leverage. The use of leveraged positions could result in the
total loss of an investor’s investment.

For
example, because the investment objective of the Fund is for the
daily changes in percentage terms of its per share NAV to reflect
three times (3x) the daily change in percentage terms of the
Benchmark Oil Futures Contract, a single-day movement in the
Benchmark Oil Futures Contract approaching 33% at any point in the
day could result in the total loss or almost total loss of an
investor’s investment if that movement is contrary to the
investment objective of the Fund, even if the Benchmark Oil Futures
Contract subsequently moves in an opposite direction, eliminating
all or a portion of the movement. This would be the case with
downward single-day or intraday movements in the Benchmark Oil
Futures Contract, even if the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract
maintains a level greater than zero at all times.

  Investment
Risk

 

The NAV
of the Fund’s shares relates directly to the value of the
Benchmark Oil Futures Contracts and other assets held by the Fund
and fluctuations in the prices of these assets could materially
adversely affect an investment in the Fund’s shares. Past
performance is not necessarily indicative of future results; all or
substantially all of an investment in the Fund could be
lost.

The net
assets of the Fund consist primarily of investments in Oil Futures
Contracts and, to a lesser extent, in Other Oil-Related
Investments. The NAV of the Fund’s shares relates directly to
the value of these assets (less liabilities, including accrued but
unpaid expenses), which in turn relates to the price of light,
sweet crude oil in the marketplace. Crude oil prices depend on
local, regional and global events or conditions that affect supply
and demand for oil.

Economic
conditions impacting crude oil. The
demand for crude oil correlates closely with general economic
growth rates. The occurrence of recessions or other periods of low
or negative economic growth will typically have a direct adverse
impact on crude oil prices. Other factors that affect general
economic conditions in the world or in a major region, such as
changes in population growth rates, periods of civil unrest,
government austerity programs, or currency exchange rate
fluctuations, can also impact the demand for crude oil. Sovereign
debt downgrades, defaults, inability to access debt markets due to
credit or legal constraints, liquidity crises, the breakup or
restructuring of fiscal, monetary, or political systems such as the
European Union, and other events or conditions that impair the
functioning of financial markets and institutions also may
adversely impact the demand for crude oil.

Other
crude oil demand-related factors. Other
factors that may affect the demand for crude oil and therefore its
price, include technological improvements in energy efficiency;
seasonal weather patterns, which affect the demand for crude oil
associated with heating and cooling; increased competitiveness of
alternative energy sources that have so far generally not been
competitive with oil without the benefit of government subsidies or
mandates; and changes in technology or consumer preferences that
alter fuel choices, such as toward alternative fueled
vehicles.

Other
crude oil supply-related factors. Crude oil
prices also vary depending on a number of factors affecting supply.
For example, increased supply from the development of new oil
supply sources and technologies to enhance recovery from existing
sources tends to reduce crude oil prices to the extent such supply
increases are not offset by commensurate growth in demand.
Similarly, increases in industry refining or petrochemical
manufacturing capacity may impact the supply of crude oil. World
oil supply levels can also be affected by factors that reduce
available supplies, such as adherence by member countries to the
Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries
(“OPEC”) production quotas and the occurrence of wars,
hostile actions, natural disasters, disruptions in
competitors’ operations, or unexpected unavailability of
distribution channels that may disrupt supplies. Technological
change can also alter the relative costs for companies in the
petroleum industry to find, produce, and refine oil and to
manufacture petrochemicals, which in turn may affect the supply of
and demand for oil.

Other
factors impacting the crude oil market. The
supply of and demand for crude oil may also be impacted by changes
in interest rates, inflation, and other local or regional market
conditions, as well as by the development of alternative energy
sources.

Price
Volatility May Possibly Cause the Total Loss of Your
Investment. Futures
contracts have a high degree of price variability and are subject
to occasional rapid and substantial changes. Consequently, you
could lose all or substantially all of your investment in the
Fund.

  Correlation
Risk

Investors
purchasing shares to hedge against movements in the price of crude
oil will have an efficient hedge only if the price investors pay
for their shares closely correlates with the price of crude oil.
Investing in the Fund’s shares for hedging purposes involves
the following risks:

 




 



•



 



The market
price at which the investor buys or sells shares may be
significantly less or more than NAV.




 




 



•



 



Daily
percentage changes in NAV may not closely correlate with daily
percentage changes, on a leveraged basis in the price of the
Benchmark Oil Futures Contract.




 




 



•



 



Daily
percentage changes in the price of the Benchmark Oil Futures
Contract may not closely correlate with daily percentage changes in
the price of light, sweet crude oil.




 

 




 



6



 




  

Further,
in order to achieve a high degree of correlation with the Benchmark
Oil Futures Contract, the Fund seeks to rebalance its portfolios
daily to keep exposure consistent with its investment objectives.
Being materially under- or overexposed to the Benchmark Oil Futures
Contract may prevent the Fund from achieving a high degree of
correlation with the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract. Market
disruptions or closures, large amounts of assets into or out of the
Fund, regulatory restrictions or extreme market volatility will
adversely affect the Fund’s ability to adjust exposure to
requisite levels. The target amount of portfolio exposure is
impacted dynamically by the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract’s
movements during each day. Because of this, it is unlikely that the
Fund will be perfectly exposed (i.e., 3x) at the end of each day,
and the likelihood of being materially under- or overexposed is
higher on days when the benchmark levels are volatile near the
close of the trading day.

In
addition, unlike other funds that do not rebalance their portfolios
as frequently, the Fund may be subject to increased trading costs
associated with daily portfolio rebalancing in order to maintain
appropriate exposure to the underlying benchmarks. Such costs
include commissions paid to the FCMs, and may vary by
FCM.

The market
price at which investors buy or sell shares may be significantly
less or more than NAV.

The
Fund’s NAV per share will change throughout the day as
fluctuations occur in the market value of the Fund’s
portfolio investments. The public trading price at which an
investor buys or sells shares during the day from their broker may
be different from the NAV of the shares. Price differences may
relate primarily to supply and demand forces at work in the
secondary trading market for shares that are closely related to,
but not identical to, the same forces influencing the prices of the
light, sweet crude oil and the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract at
any point in time. USCF expects that exploitation of certain
arbitrage opportunities by Authorized Participants and their
clients and customers will tend to cause the public trading price
to track NAV per Share closely over time, but there can be no
assurance of that.

The NAV of
the Fund’s shares may also be influenced by non-concurrent
trading hours between the NYSE Arca and the various futures
exchanges on which crude oil is traded. While the shares trade on
the NYSE Arca from 9:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time, the trading
hours for the futures exchanges on which light, sweet crude oil
trade may not necessarily coincide during all of this time. For
example, while the shares trade on the NYSE Arca until 4:00 p.m.
Eastern Time, liquidity in the global light sweet crude market will
be reduced after the close of the NYMEX at 2:30 p.m. Eastern Time.
As a result, during periods when the NYSE Arca is open and the
futures exchanges on which light, sweet crude oil is traded are
closed, trading spreads and the resulting premium or discount on
the shares may widen and, therefore, increase the difference
between the price of the shares and the NAV of the
shares.

Daily
percentage changes in the Fund’s NAV may not correlate with
daily percentage changes, on a leveraged basis, in the price of the
Benchmark Oil Futures Contract.

It is
possible that the daily percentage changes in the Fund’s NAV
per share may not closely correlate, on a leveraged basis, to daily
percentage changes in the price of the Benchmark Oil Futures
Contract. Non-correlation may be attributable to disruptions in the
market for light, sweet crude oil, the imposition of position or
accountability limits by regulators or exchanges, or other
extraordinary circumstances. As the Fund approaches or reaches
position limits with respect to the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract
and other Oil Futures Contracts or in view of market conditions,
the Fund may begin investing in Other Oil-Related Investments. In
addition, the Fund is not able to replicate exactly the changes in
the price of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract because the total
return generated by the Fund is reduced by expenses and transaction
costs, including those incurred in connection with the Fund’s
trading activities, and increased by interest income from the
Fund’s holdings of Treasuries (defined below). Tracking the
Benchmark Oil Futures Contract requires trading of the Fund’s
portfolio with a view to tracking the Benchmark Oil Futures
Contract over time and is dependent upon the skills of USCF and its
trading principals, among other factors.

Daily
percentage changes in the price of the Benchmark Oil Futures
Contract may not correlate with daily percentage changes in the
spot price of light, sweet crude oil.

The
correlation between changes in prices of the Benchmark Oil Futures
Contract and the spot price of crude oil may at times be only
approximate. The degree of imperfection of correlation depends upon
circumstances such as variations in the speculative oil market,
supply of and demand for Oil Futures Contracts (including the
Benchmark Oil Futures Contract) and Other Oil-Related Investments,
and technical influences in oil futures trading.

Natural
forces in the oil futures market known as
“backwardation” and “contango” may increase
the Fund’s tracking error and/or negatively impact total
return.

The design
of the Fund’s Benchmark Oil Futures Contract is such that
every month it begins by using the near month contract to expire
until the near month contract is within two weeks of expiration,
when, over a four day period, it transitions to the next month
contract to expire as its benchmark contract and keeps that
contract as its benchmark until it becomes the near month contract
and close to expiration. In the event of a crude oil futures market
where near month contracts trade at a higher price than next month
to expire contracts, a situation described as
“backwardation” in the futures market, then absent the
impact of the overall movement in crude oil prices the value of the
benchmark contract would tend to rise as it approaches expiration.
Conversely, in the event of a crude oil futures market where near
month contracts trade at a lower price than next month contracts, a
situation described as “contango” in the futures
market, then absent the impact of the overall movement in crude oil
prices the value of the benchmark contract would tend to decline as
it approaches expiration. When compared to total return of other
price indices, such as the spot price of crude oil, the impact of
backwardation and contango may cause the total return of the
Fund’s per share NAV to vary significantly. Moreover, absent
the impact of rising or falling oil prices, a prolonged period of
contango could have a significant negative impact on the
Fund’s per Share NAV and total return and investors could
lose part or all of their investment. See “Additional
Information About the Fund, its Investment Objective and
Investments” for a discussion of the potential effects of
contango and backwardation.

Accountability
levels, position limits, and daily price fluctuation limits set by
the exchanges have the potential to cause tracking error, which
could cause the price of shares to substantially vary from the
price of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract.

Designated
contract markets, such as the NYMEX and ICE Futures, have
established accountability levels and position limits on the
maximum net long or net short futures contracts in commodity
interests that any person or group of persons under common
trading control (other than as a hedge, which an investment by the
Fund is not) may hold, own or control. These levels and position
limits apply to the futures contracts that the Fund invests in to
meet its investment objective. In addition to accountability levels
and position limits, the NYMEX and ICE Futures also set daily price
fluctuation limits on futures contracts. The daily price
fluctuation limit establishes the maximum amount that the price of
a futures contract may vary either up or down from the previous
day’s settlement price. Once the daily price fluctuation
limit has been reached in a particular futures contract, no trades
may be made at a price beyond that limit.

The CFTC
has proposed to adopt limits on speculative positions in 28
physical commodity futures and option contracts and swaps that are
economically equivalent to such contracts in the agriculture,
energy and metals markets and rules addressing the circumstances
under which market participants would be required to aggregate
their positions with other persons under common ownership or
control, the Position Limit Rules. The Position Limit Rules, as
proposed, would apply to the futures contracts that the Fund
invests in to meet its investment objective. The Position Limit
Rules would, among other things: identify which contracts are
subject to speculative position limits; set thresholds that
restrict the number of speculative positions that a person may hold
in a spot month, individual month, and all months combined; create
an exemption for positions that constitute bona fide hedging
transactions; impose responsibilities on DCMs and SEFs to establish
position limits or, in some cases, position accountability rules;
and apply to both futures and swaps across four relevant venues:
OTC, DCMs, SEFs as well as non-U.S. located platforms. The
CFTC’s first attempt at finalizing the Position Limit Rules,
in 2011, was successfully challenged by market participants in 2012
and, since then, the CFTC has re-proposed them and solicited
comments from market participants multiple times.

Until such
time as the Position Limit Rules are adopted, the regulatory
architecture in effect prior to the adoption of the Position Limit
Rules will govern transactions in commodities and related
derivatives (collectively, “Referenced Contracts”).
Under that system, the CFTC enforces federal limits on speculation
in agricultural products (e.g., corn, wheat and soy), while futures
exchanges enforce position limits and accountability levels for
agricultural and certain energy products (e.g., oil and natural
gas). As a result, the Fund may be limited with respect to the size
of its investments in any commodities subject to these limits.
Finally, subject to certain narrow exceptions, the Position Limit
Rules require the aggregation, for purposes of the position limits,
of all positions in the 28 Referenced Contracts held by a single
entity and its affiliates, regardless of whether such position
existed on U.S. futures exchanges, non-U.S. futures exchanges, in
cleared swaps or in OTC swaps. Under the CFTC’s existing
position limits requirements and the Position Limit Rules, a market
participant is generally required to aggregate all positions for
which that participant controls the trading decisions with all
positions for which that participant has a 10 percent or greater
ownership interest in an account or position, as well as the
positions of two or more persons acting pursuant to an express or
implied agreement or understanding. At this time, it is unclear how
the Position Limit Rules may affect the Fund, but the effect may be
substantial and adverse. By way of example, the Position Limit
Rules may negatively impact the ability of the Fund to meet its
investment objectives through limits that may inhibit USCF’s
ability to sell additional Creation Baskets of the Fund.

All of
these limits may potentially cause a tracking error between the
price of the Fund’s shares and the price of the Benchmark Oil
Futures Contract. This may in turn prevent investors from being
able to effectively use the Fund as a way to hedge against crude
oil-related losses or as a way to indirectly invest in crude
oil.

The Fund
has not limited the size of its offering and is committed to
utilizing substantially all of its proceeds to purchase Oil Futures
Contracts and Other Oil-Related Investments. If the Fund encounters
accountability levels, position limits, or price fluctuation limits
for Oil Futures Contracts on the NYMEX or ICE Futures, it may then,
if permitted under applicable regulatory requirements, purchase Oil
Futures Contracts on other exchanges that trade listed crude oil
futures or enter into swaps or other transactions to meet its
investment objective. In addition, if the Fund exceeds
accountability levels on either the NYMEX or ICE Futures and is
required by such exchanges to reduce its holdings, such reduction
could potentially cause a tracking error between the price of the
Fund’s shares and the price of the Benchmark Oil Futures
Contract.

 

  Tax
Risk

 

An
investor’s tax liability may exceed the amount of
distributions, if any, on its shares.

 

Cash or
property will be distributed at the sole discretion of USCF. USCF
does not currently intend to make cash or other distributions with
respect to shares. Investors will be required to pay U.S. federal
income tax and, in some cases, state, local, or foreign income tax,
on their allocable share of the Fund’s taxable income,
without regard to whether they receive distributions or the amount
of any distributions. Therefore, the tax liability of an investor
with respect to its shares may exceed the amount of cash or
value of property (if any) distributed.

 

An
investor’s allocable share of taxable income or loss may
differ from its economic income or loss on its
shares.

 

Due to
the application of the assumptions and conventions applied by the
Fund in making allocations for tax purposes and other factors, an
investor’s allocable share of the Fund’s income, gain,
deduction or loss may be different than its economic profit or loss
from its shares for a taxable year. This difference could be
temporary or permanent and, if permanent, could result in it being
taxed on amounts in excess of its economic income.

Items of
income, gain, deduction, loss and credit with respect to shares
could be reallocated, and for taxable periods beginning after
December 31, 2017, the Fund could be liable for U.S. federal income
tax, if the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) does
not accept the assumptions and conventions applied by the Fund in
allocating those items, with potential adverse consequences for an
investor.

 

The U.S.
tax rules pertaining to entities taxed as partnerships are complex
and their application to large, publicly traded entities such as
the Fund is in many respects uncertain. The Fund applies certain
assumptions and conventions in an attempt to comply with the intent
of the applicable rules and to report taxable income, gains,
deductions, losses and credits in a manner that properly reflects
shareholders’ economic gains and losses. These assumptions
and conventions may not fully comply with all aspects of the
Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”) and applicable
Treasury Regulations, however, and it is possible that the IRS will
successfully challenge the Fund’s allocation methods and
require the Fund to reallocate items of income, gain, deduction,
loss or credit in a manner that adversely affects investors. If
this occurs, investors may be required to file an amended tax
return and to pay additional taxes plus deficiency
interest.

 

In
addition, for periods beginning after December 31, 2017, the Fund
may be liable for U.S. federal income tax on any “imputed
understatement” of tax resulting from an adjustment as a
result of an IRS audit. The amount of the imputed understatement
generally includes increases in allocations of items of income or
gains to any investor and decreases in allocations of items of
deduction, loss, or credit to any investor without any offset for
any corresponding reductions in allocations of items of income or
gain to any investor or increases in allocations of items of
deduction, loss, or credit to any investor. If the Fund is required
to pay any U.S. federal income taxes on any imputed understatement,
the resulting tax liability would reduce the net assets of the Fund
and would likely have an adverse impact on the value of the shares.
Under certain circumstances, the Fund may be eligible to make an
election to cause the investors to take into account the amount of
any imputed understatement, including any interest and penalties.
The ability of a publicly traded partnership such as the Fund to
make this election is uncertain. If the election is made, the Fund
would be required to provide investors who owned beneficial
interests in the shares in the year to which the adjusted
allocations relate with a statement setting forth their
proportionate shares of the adjustment (“Adjusted
K-1s”). The investors would be required to take the
adjustment into account in the taxable year in which the Adjusted
K-1s are issued. The resulting tax liability on an investor of
taking the adjustment into account in the year in which the
Adjusted K-1 is issued may be less favorable to the investor than
if the adjustment were taken into account in the reviewed
year.

The Fund
could be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes,
which may substantially reduce the value of the
shares.

 

The
Trust, on behalf of the Fund, has received an opinion of counsel
that, under current U.S. federal income tax laws, the Fund will be
treated as a partnership that is not taxable as a corporation for
U.S. federal income tax purposes, provided that (i) at least
90 percent of the Fund’s annual gross income consists of
“qualifying income” as defined in the Code,
(ii) the Trust and the Fund is organized and operated in
accordance with its governing agreements and applicable law and
(iii) the Trust and the Fund does not elect to be taxed as a
corporation for federal income tax purposes. Although USCF
anticipates that the Fund will satisfy the “qualifying
income” requirement for all of its taxable years, that result
cannot be assured. The Fund has not requested and nor will the Fund
request any ruling from the IRS with respect to its classification
as a partnership not taxable as a corporation for federal income
tax purposes. If the IRS were to successfully assert that the Fund
is taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes in any
taxable year, rather than passing through its income, gains, losses
and deductions proportionately to shareholders, the Fund would be
subject to tax on its net income for the year at corporate tax
rates. In addition, although the Fund currently does not intend to
make any distributions with respect to the Shares any distributions
would be taxable to shareholders as dividend income to the extent
of the Fund’s current or accumulated earnings and profits.
Subject to holding period and other requirements, any such dividend
would be a qualifying dividend subject to U.S. federal income tax
at the lower maximum tax rates applicable to long-term capital
gains. Taxation of the Trust and the Fund as a corporation could
materially reduce the after-tax return on an investment in shares
and could substantially reduce the value of the shares.

The Fund
is organized and operated as a Delaware statutory trust in
accordance with the provisions of its Trust Agreement and
applicable state law, but is taxed in a manner similar to a limited
partnership, and therefore, has a more complex tax treatment than
conventional mutual funds.

 

The Fund
is organized and operated as a Delaware statutory trust in
accordance with the provisions of its Trust Agreement and
applicable state law, but is taxed in a manner similar to a limited
partnership, and therefore, has a more complex tax treatment than
conventional mutual funds. No U.S. federal income tax is paid by
the Fund on its income. Instead, the Fund will furnish shareholders
each year with tax information on IRS Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) and
each U.S. shareholder is required to report on its U.S. federal
income tax return its allocable share of the income, gain, loss and
deduction of the Fund. This must be reported without regard to the
amount (if any) of cash or property the shareholder receives as a
distribution from the Fund during the taxable year. A shareholder,
therefore, may be allocated income or gain by the Fund but receive
no cash distribution with which to pay the tax liability resulting
from the allocation, or may receive a distribution that is
insufficient to pay such liability.

In
addition to federal income taxes, shareholders may be subject to
other taxes, such as state and local income taxes, unincorporated
business taxes, business franchise taxes and estate, inheritance or
intangible taxes that may be imposed by the various jurisdictions
in which the Fund does business or owns property or where the
shareholders reside. Although an analysis of those various taxes is
not presented here, each prospective shareholder should consider
their potential impact on its investment in the Fund. It is each
shareholder’s responsibility to file the appropriate U.S.
federal, state, local and foreign tax returns.

 

If the
Fund is required to withhold tax with respect to any Non-U.S.
shareholders, the cost of such withholding may be borne by all
shareholders.

Under
certain circumstances, the Fund may be required to pay withholding
tax with respect to allocations to Non-U.S. shareholders. Although
the Trust Agreement provides that any such withholding will be
treated as being distributed to the Non-U.S. shareholder, the Fund
may not be able to cause the economic cost of such withholding to
be borne by the Non-U.S. shareholder on whose behalf such amounts
were withheld since the Fund does not intend to make any
distributions. Under such circumstances, the economic cost of the
withholding may be borne by all shareholders, not just the
shareholders on whose behalf such amounts were withheld. This could
have a material impact on the value of the shares.

 

  OTC
Contract Risk

 

Currently,
OTC transactions are subject to changing
regulation.

 

A portion
of the Fund’s assets may be used to trade OTC contracts, such
as forward contracts, options, swaps or spot contracts. OTC
contracts are typically contracts traded on a
principal-to-principal, non-cleared basis through dealer markets
that are dominated by major money center and investment banks and
other institutions. The markets for OTC contracts rely upon the
integrity of market participants in lieu of the additional
regulation imposed by the CFTC on participants in the futures
markets. While certain regulations adopted over the past several
years are intended to provide additional protections to
participants in the OTC market, the current regulation of the OTC
contracts could expose the Fund in certain circumstances to
significant losses in the event of trading abuses or financial
failure by participants. As a result of such regulations, if the
Trust on behalf of the Fund, enters into or has entered into
certain interest rate and credit default swaps, such swaps will be
required to be centrally cleared. Determinations on other types of
swaps are expected in the future, and, when finalized, could
require the Fund to centrally clear certain OTC instruments
presently entered into and settled on a bi-lateral
basis.

 

 




 



10



 




  

The Fund
will be subject to credit risk with respect to counterparties to
OTC contracts entered into by the Trust on behalf of the Fund or
held by special purpose or structured vehicles.

 

The Fund
faces the risk of non-performance by the counterparties to the OTC
contracts. Unlike in futures contracts, the counterparty to these
contracts is generally a single bank or other financial
institution, rather than a clearing organization backed by a group
of financial institutions. As a result, there will be greater
counterparty credit risk in these transactions. A counterparty may
not be able to meet its obligations to the Fund, in which case the
Fund could suffer significant losses on these contracts.

If a
counterparty becomes bankrupt or otherwise fails to perform its
obligations due to financial difficulties, the Fund may experience
significant delays in obtaining any recovery in a bankruptcy or
other reorganization proceeding. The Trust on behalf of the Fund
may obtain only limited recovery or may obtain no recovery in such
circumstances.

Valuing
OTC derivatives may be less certain than actively traded financial
instruments.

 

In
general, valuing OTC derivatives is less certain than valuing
actively traded financial instruments such as exchange traded
futures contracts and securities or cleared swaps because the price
and terms on which such OTC derivatives are entered into or can be
terminated are individually negotiated, and those prices and terms
may not reflect the best price or terms available from other
sources. In addition, while market makers and dealers generally
quote indicative prices or terms for entering into or terminating
OTC contracts, they typically are not contractually obligated to do
so, particularly if they are not a party to the transaction. As a
result, it may be difficult to obtain an independent value for an
outstanding OTC derivatives transaction.

 

  Compounding
Risk

The Fund
has a single-day investment objective, and the Fund’s
performance for periods greater than a single day will be the
result of each day’s returns compounded over the period,
which is likely to be either better or worse than the performance
of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract times the stated multiple in
the Fund’s investment objective, before accounting for fees
and fund expenses. Compounding affects all investments, but it has
a more significant effect on an a leveraged fund. Particularly
during periods of higher Benchmark Oil Futures Contract volatility,
compounding will cause results for periods longer than a single day
to vary from three times (3x) of the return of the Benchmark Oil
Futures Contract. This effect becomes more pronounced as volatility
increases. Fund performance for periods greater than a single day
will be affected by the following factors: (i) Benchmark Oil
Futures Contract volatility, (ii) Benchmark Oil Futures Contract
performance, (iii) period of time, (iv) financing rates associated
with exposure and (v) other Fund expenses.

The Fund
is designed to be utilized only by knowledgeable investors who
understand the potential consequences of seeking daily leveraged
investment results and are willing to monitor their portfolios
frequently. The Fund is not intended to be used by, and is not
appropriate for, investors who do not intend to actively monitor
and manage their portfolios.

  Other
Risks

NYSE may
halt trading in the Fund’s shares, which would adversely
impact an investor’s ability to sell
shares.

The
Fund’s shares are listed for trading on NYSE under the market
symbol “[ • ].” Trading in shares may be halted
due to market conditions or, in light NYSE rules and procedures,
for reasons that, in the view of NYSE, make trading in shares
inadvisable. In addition, trading is subject to trading halts
caused by extraordinary market volatility pursuant to
“circuit breaker” rules that require trading to be
halted for a specified period based on a specified market decline.
Additionally, there can be no assurance that the requirements
necessary to maintain the listing of the Fund’s shares will
continue to be met or will remain unchanged.

The lack
of an active trading market for the Fund shares may result in
losses on an investor’s investment in the Fund at the time
the investor sells the shares.

Although
the Fund’s shares are listed and traded on NYSE, there can be
no guarantee that an active trading market for the shares will be
maintained. If an investor needs to sell shares at a time when no
active trading market for them exists, the price the investor
receives upon sale of the shares, assuming they were able to be
sold, likely would be lower than if an active market
existed.

 

 




 



11



 




  

Certain of
the Fund’s investments could be illiquid, which could cause
large losses to investors at any time or from time to time.
 

Futures
positions cannot always be liquidated at the desired price. It is
difficult to execute a trade at a specific price when there is a
relatively small volume of buy and sell orders in a market. A
market disruption, such as a foreign government taking political
actions that disrupt the market for its currency, its crude oil
production or exports, or another major export, can also make it
difficult to liquidate a position. Because both Oil Futures
Contracts and Other Oil-Related Investments may be illiquid, the
Fund’s Oil Interests may be more difficult to liquidate at
favorable prices in periods of illiquid markets and losses may be
incurred during the period in which positions are being liquidated.
The large size of the positions that the Fund may acquire increases
the risk of illiquidity both by making its positions more difficult
to liquidate and by potentially increasing losses while trying to
do so.

OTC
contracts that are not subject to clearing may be even less
marketable than futures contracts because they are not traded on an
exchange, do not have uniform terms and conditions, and are entered
into based upon the creditworthiness of the parties and the
availability of credit support, such as collateral, and in general,
they are not transferable without the consent of the counterparty.
These conditions make such contracts less liquid than standardized
futures contracts traded on a commodities exchange and could
adversely impact the Fund’s ability to realize the full value
of such contracts. In addition, even if collateral is used to
reduce counterparty credit risk, sudden changes in the value of OTC
transactions may leave a party open to financial risk due to a
counterparty default since the collateral held may not cover a
party’s exposure on the transaction in such
situations.

The Fund
is not actively managed and tracks the Benchmark Oil Futures
Contract during periods in which the price of the Benchmark Oil
Futures Contract is flat or declining as well as when the price is
rising.

The Fund
is not actively managed by conventional methods. Accordingly, if
the Fund’s investments in Oil Interests are declining in
value, the Fund will not close out such positions except in
connection with paying the proceeds to an Authorized Participant
upon the redemption of a basket or closing out futures positions in
connection with the monthly change in the Benchmark Oil Futures
Contract. USCF will seek to cause the NAV of the Fund’s
shares to track the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract during periods
in which its price is flat or declining as well as when the price
is rising.

Regulation
of the commodity interests and energy markets is extensive and
constantly changing; future regulatory developments are impossible
to predict but may significantly and adversely affect the
Fund.

The
futures markets are subject to comprehensive statutes, regulations,
and margin requirements. In addition, the CFTC and futures
exchanges are authorized to take extraordinary actions in the event
of a market emergency, including, for example, the retroactive
implementation of speculative position limits or higher margin
requirements, the establishment of daily price limits and the
suspension of trading. Regulation of commodity interest
transactions in the United States is a rapidly changing area of law
and is subject to ongoing modification by governmental and judicial
action. Considerable regulatory attention has been focused on
non-traditional investment pools that are publicly distributed in
the United States. In addition, various national governments
outside of the United States have expressed concern regarding the
disruptive effects of speculative trading in the energy markets and
the need to regulate the derivatives markets in general. The effect
of any future regulatory change on the Fund is impossible to
predict, but it could be substantial and adverse.

An
investment in the Fund may provide little or no diversification
benefits. Thus, in a declining market, the Fund may have no gains
to offset losses from other investments, and an investor may suffer
losses on an investment in the Fund while incurring losses with
respect to other asset classes.

Historically,
Oil Futures Contracts and Other Oil-Related Investments have
generally been non-correlated to the performance of other asset
classes such as stocks and bonds. Non-correlation means that there
is a low statistically valid relationship between the performance
of futures and other commodity interest transactions, on the one
hand, and stocks or bonds, on the other hand.

However,
there can be no assurance that such non-correlation will continue
during future periods. If, contrary to historic patterns, the
Fund’s performance were to move in the same general direction
as the financial markets, investors will obtain little or no
diversification benefits from an investment in the Fund’s
shares. In such a case, the Fund may have no gains to offset losses
from other investments, and investors may suffer losses on their
investment in the Fund at the same time they incur losses with
respect to other investments.

Variables
such as drought, floods, weather, embargoes, tariffs and other
political events may have a larger impact on crude oil prices and
crude oil-linked instruments, including Oil Futures Contracts and
Other Oil-Related Investments, than on traditional securities.
These additional variables may create additional investment risks
that subject the Fund’s investments to greater volatility
than investments in traditional securities.

Non-correlation
should not be confused with negative correlation, where the
performance of two asset classes would be opposite of each other.
There is no historical evidence that the spot price of crude oil
and prices of other financial assets, such as stocks and bonds, are
negatively correlated. In the absence of negative correlation, the
Fund cannot be expected to be automatically profitable during
unfavorable periods for the stock market, or vice versa.

Trading in
international markets could expose the Fund to credit and
regulatory risk.

 The
Fund invests primarily in Oil Futures Contracts, a significant
portion of which are traded on United States exchanges, including
the NYMEX. However, a portion of the Fund’s trades may take
place on markets and exchanges outside the United States. Some
non-U.S. markets present risks because they are not subject to the
same degree of regulation as their U.S. counterparts. Trading on
such non-U.S. markets or exchanges presents risks because they are
not subject to the same degree of regulation as their U.S.
counterparts, including potentially different or diminished
investor protections. In trading contracts denominated in
currencies other than U.S. dollars, the Fund is subject to the risk
of adverse exchange-rate movements between the dollar and the
functional currencies of such contracts. Additionally, trading on
non-U.S. exchanges is subject to the risks presented by exchange
controls, expropriation, increased tax burdens and exposure to
local economic declines and political instability. An adverse
development with respect to any of these variables could reduce the
profit or increase the loss earned on trades in the affected
international markets.

USCF is
leanly staffed and relies heavily on key personnel to manage the
Fund and other funds.

 

USCF was
formed to be the sponsor and manager of investment vehicles such as
the Fund and has been managing such investment vehicles since April
2006. The Chief Executive Officer and President of USCF manage and
direct the day-to-day activities and affairs of the
Fund.

The Sixth
Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement of USCF
(the “LLC Agreement”) provides limited authority to the
Non-Management Directors, and any Director of USCF may be removed
by USCF’s parent company, which is a closely-held private
company where the majority of shares has historically been voted by
one person.

 

USCF’s
Board of Directors currently consists of four Management Directors,
each of whom are shareholders of USCF’s parent, Wainwright
Holdings, Inc. (“Wainwright”), and three Non-Management
Directors, each of whom are considered independent for purposes of
applicable exchange and SEC rules. Under USCF’s LLC
Agreement, the Non-Management Directors have only such authority as
the Management Directors expressly confer upon them, which means
that the Non-Management Directors may have less authority to
control the actions of the Management Directors than is typically
the case with the independent members of a company’s Board of
Directors. In addition, any Director may be removed by written
consent of Wainwright, which is the sole member of USCF. Wainwright
is a privately held company in which the majority of shares are
held by or on behalf of Nicholas D. Gerber and his immediate family
members (the “Gerber Family”). Historically, shares of
Wainwright have been voted by, and on behalf of, the Gerber Family
by Nicholas D. Gerber, and it is anticipated that such trend will
continue in the future. Accordingly, although USCF is governed by
the USCF Board of Directors, which consists of both Management
Directors and Non-Management Directors, pursuant to the LLC
Agreement, it is possible for Mr. Gerber to exercise his
control of Wainwright to effect the removal of any Director
(including the Non-Management Directors which comprise the Audit
Committee) and to replace that Director with another Director.
Having control in one person could have a negative impact on USCF
and the Fund, including their regulatory obligations.

There is a
risk that the Fund will not earn trading gains sufficient to
compensate for the fees and expenses that it must pay and as such
the Fund may not earn any profit.

 

The Fund
is contractually obligated to pay a management fee to USCF, fees to
brokers subject to a cap, and certain expenses regardless of
whether the Fund’s activities are profitable. Accordingly,
the Fund must earn trading gains sufficient to compensate for these
fees and expenses before it can earn any profit.

Regulation
of the commodity interests markets is extensive and constantly
changing; future regulatory developments are impossible to predict
but may significantly and adversely affect the
Fund.

 

The
futures markets are subject to comprehensive statutes, regulations,
and margin requirements. In addition, the CFTC and futures
exchanges are authorized to take extraordinary actions in the event
of a market emergency, including, for example, the retroactive
implementation of speculative position limits or higher margin
requirements, the establishment of daily price limits and the
suspension of trading. Regulation of commodity interest
transactions in the United States is a rapidly changing area of law
and is subject to ongoing modification by governmental and judicial
action. Considerable regulatory attention has been focused on
non-traditional investment pools that are publicly distributed in
the United States. In addition, various national governments
outside of the United States have expressed concern regarding the
disruptive effects of speculative trading in the commodities
markets and the need to regulate the derivatives markets in
general. The effect of any future regulatory change on the Fund is
impossible to predict, but it could be substantial and
adverse.

The Trust
is not a registered investment company so shareholders do not have
the protections of the 1940 Act.

 

The Trust
is not an investment company subject to the 1940 Act.
Accordingly, investors do not have the protections afforded by that
statute, which, for example, requires investment companies to have
a majority of disinterested directors and regulates the
relationship between the investment company and its investment
manager.

 

The Fund
has no operating history so there is no performance history to
serve as a basis for you to evaluate an investment in the
Fund.

 

The Fund
is new and has no operating history. Therefore, you do not have the
benefit of reviewing the past performance of the Fund as a basis to
evaluate an investment in the Fund. The Sponsor’s current
experience involves managing the Related Public Funds. The
Sponsor’s results with the Related Public Funds may not be
directly applicable to the Fund since the Fund has a different
investment objective than the Related Public Funds.

The Fund
and USCF may have conflicts of interest, which may permit them to
favor their own interests to the detriment of
shareholders.

 

The Fund
is subject to actual and potential inherent conflicts involving
USCF, various commodity futures brokers, the Marketing Agent and
any Authorized Participants. USCF’s officers, directors and
employees do not devote their time exclusively to the Fund. These
persons are directors, officers or employees of other entities that
may compete with the Fund for their services. They could have a
conflict between their responsibilities to the Fund and to those
other entities. As a result of these and other relationships,
parties involved with the Fund have a financial incentive to act in
a manner other than in the best interests of the Fund and the
shareholders. USCF has not established any formal procedure to
resolve conflicts of interest. Consequently, investors are
dependent on the good faith of the respective parties subject to
such conflicts of interest to resolve them equitably. Although USCF
attempts to monitor these conflicts, it is extremely difficult, if
not impossible, for USCF to ensure that these conflicts do not, in
fact, result in adverse consequences to the
shareholders.

The Fund
may also be subject to certain conflicts with respect to its
Futures Commission Merchant (“FCM”), including, but not
limited to, conflicts that result from receiving greater amounts of
compensation from other clients, or purchasing opposite or
competing positions on behalf of third party accounts traded
through the FCM.

USCF’s
officers, directors and employees do not devote their time
exclusively to the Fund and could have a conflict between their
responsibilities to the Fund and to the Related Public
Funds.

 

The Fund
and USCF may have inherent conflicts to the extent USCF attempts to
maintain the Fund’s asset size in order to preserve its fee
income and this may not always be consistent with the Fund’s
objective of having the value of its shares’ NAV track, on a
leveraged basis, changes in the value of the Benchmark Oil Futures
Contracts.

USCF’s
officers, directors and employees do not devote their time
exclusively to the Fund. For example, USCF’s directors,
officers and employees act in such capacity for other entities,
including the Related Public Funds, that may compete with the Fund
for their services. Accordingly, they could have a conflict between
their responsibilities to the Fund and to other
entities.

USCF has
sole current authority to manage the investments and operations of
the Fund. This authority to manage the investments and operations
of the Fund may allow USCF to act in a way that furthers its own
interests in conflict with the best interests of investors.
Shareholders have very limited voting rights, which will limit the
ability to influence matters such as amending the Trust Agreement,
changing the Fund’s basic investment objective, dissolving
the Fund, or selling or distributing the Fund’s
assets.

The Fund
and REX may have conflicts of interest, which may permit REX to
favor its own interests to the detriment of Fund
shareholders.

REX may
have conflicts of interest, which may permit it to favor its own
interests to the detriment of shareholders. REX’s officers,
directors and employees do not devote their time exclusively to the
Fund or to REX MLPshares, LLC. These persons are directors,
officers or employees of other entities that may compete with the
Fund for their services. They could have a conflict between their
responsibilities to the Fund and to those other entities. As a
result of these and other relationships, parties involved with REX
may have a financial incentive to act in a manner other than in the
best interests of the Fund and the shareholders. USCF has not
established any formal procedure to resolve REX conflicts of
interest. Consequently, investors are dependent on the good faith
of the respective parties subject to such conflicts of interest to
resolve them equitably. Although USCF attempts to monitor these
conflicts, it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, for USCF
to ensure that these conflicts do not, in fact, result in adverse
consequences to the Fund’s shareholders.

REX’s
officers, directors and employees do not devote their time
exclusively to the Fund and could have a conflict between their
responsibilities to other entities.

REX’s
officers, directors and employees do not devote their time
exclusively to the Fund. Rather, REX’s directors, officers
and employees act in various capacities for other entities, some of
which may now, or in the future, compete with the Fund for their
services. Accordingly, REX’s officers, directors and
employees could have a conflict between their responsibilities to
the Fund and to other entities.

USCF has
sole current authority to manage the investments and operations of
the Fund. It has delegated certain marketing functions with respect
to the Fund to REX. REX may act in a way that furthers its own
interests in conflict with the best interests of
investors.

 

Shareholders
have only very limited voting rights and have the power to replace
USCF only under specific circumstances. Shareholders do not
participate in the management of the Fund and do not control USCF,
so they do not have any influence over basic matters that affect
the Fund.

 

Shareholders
have very limited voting rights with respect to the Fund’s
affairs and have none of the statutory rights normally associated
with the ownership of shares of a corporation (including, for
example, the right to bring “oppression” or
“derivative” actions). Shareholders may elect a
replacement sponsor only if USCF resigns voluntarily or loses its
charter. Shareholders are not permitted to participate in the
management or control of the Fund or the conduct of its business.
Shareholders must therefore rely upon the duties and judgment of
USCF to manage the Fund’s affairs. For example, the
dissolution or resignation of USCF would cause the Fund to
terminate unless, within 90 days of the event, shareholders holding
shares representing at least 66 2/3% of the outstanding shares of
the Fund elect to continue the Trust and appoint a successor
sponsor. In addition, USCF may terminate the Fund if it determines
that the Fund’s aggregate net assets in relation to its
operating expenses make the continued operation of the Fund
unreasonable or imprudent. However, no level of losses will require
USCF to terminate the Fund. The Fund’s termination would
result in the liquidation of its assets and the distribution of the
proceeds thereof, first to creditors and then to the shareholders
in accordance with their positive book capital account balances,
after giving effect to all contributions, distributions and
allocations for all periods, and the Fund could incur losses in
liquidating its assets in connection with a termination.

The Fund
could terminate at any time and cause the liquidation and potential
loss of an investor’s investment and could upset the overall
maturity and timing of an investor’s investment
portfolio.

 

The Fund
could terminate at any time, regardless of whether that the Fund
has incurred losses, subject to the terms of the Trust Agreement.
In particular, unforeseen circumstances, including the bankruptcy,
dissolution, or removal of USCF as the sponsor of the Trust could
cause the Fund to terminate unless a successor is appointed in
accordance with the Trust Agreement. However, no level of losses
will require USCF to terminate the Fund. The Fund’s
termination would cause the liquidation and potential loss of an
investor’s investment. Termination could also negatively
affect the overall maturity and timing of an investor’s
investment portfolio.

An
unanticipated number of redemption requests during a short period
of time could have an adverse effect on the Fund’s
NAV.

 

If a
substantial number of requests for redemption of Redemption Baskets
are received by the Fund during a relatively short period of time,
the Fund may not be able to satisfy the requests from the Fund
assets not committed to trading. As a consequence, it could be
necessary to liquidate positions in the Fund’s trading
positions before the time that the trading strategies would
otherwise dictate liquidation.

The Fund
does not expect to make cash distributions.

 

The Fund
does not intend to make any cash distributions and intends to
reinvest any realized gains in additional Oil Interests rather than
distributing cash to shareholders. Therefore, unlike mutual funds,
commodity pools or other investment pools that actively manage
their investments in an attempt to realize income and gains from
their investing activities and distribute such income and gains to
their investors, the Fund generally does not expect to distribute
cash to shareholders. An investor should not invest in the Fund if
the investor will need cash distributions from the Fund to pay
taxes on its share of income and gains of the Fund, if any, or for
any other reason. Nonetheless, although the Fund does not intend to
make cash distributions, the income earned from its investments
held directly or posted as margin may reach levels that merit
distribution, e.g., at levels where such income is not
necessary to support its underlying investments in Oil Interests
and investors adversely react to being taxed on such income without
receiving distributions that could be used to pay such tax. If this
income becomes significant then cash distributions may be
made.

 

Proposed
Money Market Reform

 

Currently,
the Fund may invest in money market funds, as well as Treasuries
with a maturity date of two years or less, as an investment for
assets not used for margin or collateral in the Futures Contracts.
On July 23, 2014, the SEC adopted final rules governing the
structure and operation of money market funds, in a release
adopting amendments to Rule 2a-7 under the 1940 Act. The new rules
will require institutional prime money market funds to price their
shares using market-based values instead of the amortized cost
method ( i.e. , to use a “floating NAV”). In
addition, all money market funds will be able, and in certain cases
will be required, to impose liquidity fees and temporarily suspend
redemptions during periods of market stress, subject to certain
board findings. The SEC also revised certain diversification
provisions of Rule 2a-7, as well as provisions relating to stress
testing. Compliance with these requirements is not currently
required. Accordingly, it is unclear at this time what impact of
money market reform would have on the Fund’s ability to hedge
risk. However, the imposition of a floating NAV could cause the
Fund to limit remaining assets solely in Treasuries and
cash.

The
failure or bankruptcy of a clearing broker or the Fund’s
Custodian could result in a substantial loss of the Fund’s
assets and could impair the Fund in its ability to execute
trades.

 

Under
CFTC regulations, a clearing broker maintains customers’
assets in a bulk segregated account. If a clearing broker fails to
do so, or even if the customers’ funds are segregated by the
clearing broker but the clearing broker is unable to satisfy a
substantial deficit in a customer account, the clearing
broker’s other customers may be subject to risk of a
substantial loss of their funds in the event of that clearing
broker’s bankruptcy. In that event, the clearing
broker’s customers, such as the Fund, are entitled to
recover, even in respect of property specifically traceable to
them, only a proportional share of all property available for
distribution to all of that clearing broker’s customers. The
bankruptcy of a clearing broker could result in the loss of the
Fund’s assets posted with the clearing broker. The Fund may
also be subject to the risk of the failure of, or delay in
performance by, any exchanges and markets and their clearing
organizations, if any, on which commodity interest contracts are
traded.

In
addition, to the extent the Fund’s clearing broker is
required to post the Fund’s assets as margin to a
clearinghouse, the margin will be maintained in an omnibus account
containing the margin of all the clearing broker’s customers.
If the Fund’s clearing broker defaults to a clearinghouse
because of a default by one of the clearing broker’s other
customers or otherwise, then the clearinghouse can look to all of
the margin in the omnibus account, including margin posted by the
Fund and any other non-defaulting customers of the clearing broker
to satisfy the obligations of the clearing broker.

From time
to time, clearing brokers may be subject to legal or regulatory
proceedings in the ordinary course of their business. A clearing
broker’s involvement in costly or time-consuming legal
proceedings may divert financial resources or personnel away from
the clearing broker’s trading operations, which could impair
the clearing broker’s ability to successfully execute and
clear the Fund’s trades.

In
addition, the majority of the Fund’s assets are held in
Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents with [ • ] (the
“Custodian”). The insolvency of the Custodian could
result in a loss of the Fund’s assets held by the Custodian,
which, at any given time, could comprise a substantial portion of
the Fund’s total assets.

The
liability of USCF and the Trustee are limited under the Trust
Agreement, and the value of the shares will be adversely affected
if the Fund is required to indemnify the Trustee or
USCF.

 

Under the
Trust Agreement, the Trustee and USCF are not liable, and have the
right to be indemnified, for any liability or expense incurred
absent gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the
Trustee or USCF or breach by USCF of the Trust Agreement, as the
case may be. As a result, USCF may require the assets of the Fund
to be sold in order to cover losses or liability suffered by it or
by the Trustee. Any sale of that kind would reduce the NAV of the
Fund and the value of its shares.

 

 




 



16



 




  

Although
the shares of the Fund are limited liability investments, certain
circumstances such as bankruptcy or indemnification of the Fund by
a shareholder will increase the shareholder’s
liability.

 

The
shares of the Fund are limited liability investments; shareholders
may not lose more than the amount that they invest plus any profits
recognized on their investment. However, shareholders could be
required, as a matter of bankruptcy law, to return to the estate of
the Fund any distribution they received at a time when the Fund was
in fact insolvent or in violation of its Trust Agreement. In
addition, a number of states do not have “statutory
trust” statutes such as the Delaware statutes under which the
Trust has been formed in the State of Delaware. It is possible that
a court in such state could hold that, due to the absence of any
statutory provision to the contrary in such jurisdiction, the
shareholders, although entitled under Delaware law to the same
limitation on personal liability as stockholders in a private
corporation for profit organized under the laws of the State of
Delaware, are not so entitled in such state. Finally, in the event
the Trust or the Fund is made a party to any claim, dispute, demand
or litigation or otherwise incurs any liability or expense as a
result of or in connection with any shareholder’s (or
assignee’s) obligations or liabilities unrelated to the
business of the Trust or the Fund, as applicable, such shareholder
(or assignees cumulatively) is required under the Trust Agreement
to indemnify the Trust or the Fund, as applicable, for all such
liability and expense incurred, including attorneys’ and
accountants’ fees.

Investors
cannot be assured of REX’s continued services, and
discontinuance may be detrimental to the Fund.

 

Investors
cannot be assured that REX will be willing or able to continue to
service the Fund for any length of time. If REX discontinues its
activities on behalf of the Fund, the Fund may be adversely
affected.

 

The Fund
is a series of the Trust and, as a result, a court could
potentially conclude that the assets and liabilities of the Fund
are not segregated from those of another series of the Trust,
thereby potentially exposing assets in the Fund to the liabilities
of another series of the Trust.

 

The Fund
is a series of a Delaware statutory trust and not itself a separate
legal entity. The Delaware Statutory Trust Act provides that if
certain provisions are included in the formation and governing
documents of a statutory trust organized in series and if separate
and distinct records are maintained for any series and the assets
associated with that series are held in separate and distinct
records and are accounted for in such separate and distinct records
separately from the other assets of the statutory trust, or any
series thereof, then the debts, liabilities, obligations and
expenses incurred by a particular series are enforceable against
the assets of such series only, and not against the assets of the
statutory trust generally or any other series thereof. Conversely,
none of the debts, liabilities, obligations and expenses incurred
with respect to any other series thereof shall be enforceable
against the assets of such series. USCF is not aware of any court
case that has interpreted this Inter-Series Limitation on Liability
or provided any guidance as to what is required for compliance.
USCF intends to maintain separate and distinct records for the Fund
and account for the Fund separately from any other series of the
Trust, but it is possible a court could conclude that the methods
used do not satisfy the Delaware Statutory Trust Act, which would
potentially expose assets in one series to the liabilities of
another series of the Trust.

USCF and
the Trustee are not obligated to prosecute any action, suit or
other proceeding in respect of the Fund
property.

 

Neither
USCF nor the Trustee is obligated to, although each may in its
respective discretion, prosecute any action, suit or other
proceeding in respect of the Fund property. The Trust Agreement
does not confer upon shareholders the right to prosecute any such
action, suit or other proceeding.

Third
parties may infringe upon or otherwise violate intellectual
property rights or assert that USCF has infringed or otherwise
violated their intellectual property rights, which may result in
significant costs and diverted attention.

 

It is
possible that third parties might utilize the Fund’s
intellectual property or technology, including the use of its
business methods, trademarks and trading program software, without
permission. USCF has a patent for the Fund’s business method
and has registered its trademarks. The Fund does not currently have
any proprietary software. However, if it obtains proprietary
software in the future, any unauthorized use of the Fund’s
proprietary software and other technology could also adversely
affect its competitive advantage. The Fund may not have adequate
resources to implement procedures for monitoring unauthorized uses
of its patents, trademarks, proprietary software and other
technology. Also, third parties may independently develop business
methods, trademarks or proprietary software and other technology
similar to that of USCF or claim that USCF has violated their
intellectual property rights, including their copyrights, trademark
rights, trade names, trade secrets and patent rights. As a result,
USCF may have to litigate in the future to protect its trade
secrets, determine the validity and scope of other parties’
proprietary rights, defend itself against claims that it has
infringed or otherwise violated other parties’ rights, or
defend itself against claims that its rights are invalid. Any
litigation of this type, even if USCF is successful and regardless
of the merits, may result in significant costs, divert its
resources from the Fund, or require it to change its proprietary
software and other technology or enter into royalty or licensing
agreements.

Due to the
increased use of technologies, intentional and unintentional
cyber-attacks pose operational and information security
risks.  

With the
increased use of technologies such as the Internet and the
dependence on computer systems to perform necessary business
functions, the Fund is susceptible to operational and information
security risks. In general, cyber incidents can result from
deliberate attacks or unintentional events. Cyber-attacks include,
but are not limited to, gaining unauthorized access to digital
systems for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive
information, corrupting data, or causing operational disruption.
Cyber-attacks may also be carried out in a manner that does not
require gaining unauthorized access, such as causing
denial-of-service attacks on websites. Cyber security failures or
breaches of the Fund’s clearing broker or third party service
provider (including, but not limited to, index providers, the
administrator and transfer agent, the custodian), have the ability
to cause disruptions and impact business operations, potentially
resulting in financial losses, the inability of Fund shareholders
to transact business, violations of applicable privacy and other
laws, regulatory fines, penalties, reputational damage,
reimbursement or other compensation costs, and/or additional
compliance costs.

In
addition, substantial costs may be incurred in order to prevent any
cyber incidents in the future. The Fund and its shareholders could
be negatively impacted as a result. While the Fund has established
business continuity plans, there are inherent limitations in such
plans.

 


  ADDITIONAL
INFORMATION ABOUT THE FUND, ITS INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE AND
INVESTMENTS

The Fund
is a series of the Trust. The Trust operates pursuant to the terms
of the Declaration of Trust and Trust Agreement dated as of March
2, 2016 (“Trust Agreement”) which grants full
management control of the Fund to USCF. The Trust Agreement is
posted on the Fund’s website at [ • ] . The Fund
maintains its main business office at 1999 Harrison Street,
Suite 1530, Oakland, California 94612.

The net
assets of the Fund consist primarily of investments in the Oil
Futures Contracts and Other Oil-Related Investments. Market
conditions that USCF currently anticipates could cause the Fund to
invest in Other Oil-Related Investments include those allowing the
Fund to obtain greater liquidity or to execute transactions with
more favorable pricing.

The Fund
invests substantially the entire amount of its assets in futures
contracts while supporting such investments by holding the amounts
of its margin, collateral and other requirements relating to these
obligations in short-term obligations of the United States of two
years or less (“Treasuries”), cash and cash
equivalents. The daily holdings of the Fund are available on the
Fund’s website at [ • ] .

The Fund
invests in Oil Interests to the fullest extent possible without
being unable to satisfy its current or potential margin or
collateral obligations with respect to its investments in Oil
Interests. In pursuing this objective, the primary focus of USCF is
the investment in futures contracts and the management of the
Fund’s investments in Treasuries, cash and/or cash
equivalents for margining purposes and as collateral.

The Fund
seeks to invest in a combination of Oil Interests such that the
daily changes in its NAV, measured in percentage terms, will track
three times (3x) the daily changes in the price of the Benchmark
Oil Futures Contract, also measured in percentage terms. As a
specific benchmark, USCF endeavors to place the Fund’s trades
in Oil Interests and otherwise manage the Fund’s investments
so that the difference between “A” and “B”
will be plus/minus 0.30 percent (0.30%) of “B”,
where:

 




 



•



 



A is the
average daily percentage change in the Fund’s per share NAV
for any period of thirty (30) successive valuation days,
i.e. , any NYSE trading day as of which the Fund calculates
its per share NAV; and




 




 



•



 



B is three
times the average daily percentage change in the price of the
Benchmark Oil Futures Contract over the same
period.   




USCF
believes that market arbitrage opportunities will cause the daily
change in the Fund’s share price on the NYSE exchange on a
percentage basis to closely track the daily changes in the
Fund’s per share NAV on a percentage basis. USCF further
believes that the daily changes in the Fund’s NAV in
percentage terms will track three times (3x) the daily changes in
percentage terms in the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract, less the
Fund’s expenses.

The Fund
will not seek to achieve its stated investment objective over a
period of time greater than one day . The pursuit of daily
leveraged investment goals means that the return of the Fund for a
period longer than a full trading day may have no resemblance to
300% of the return of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract for such
longer period because the aggregate return of the Fund is the
product of the series of each trading day’s daily returns.
During periods of market volatility, the volatility of the
Benchmark Oil Futures Contract may affect the Fund’s return
as much as or more than the return of the Benchmark Oil Futures
Contract. Further, the return for investors that invest for periods
less than a full trading day or for a period different than a
trading day will not be the product of the return of the
Fund’s stated investment objective and the performance of the
Benchmark Oil Futures Contract for the full trading day.
Additionally, investors should be aware that the Fund’s
investment objective is not for its NAV or market price of shares
to equal, in dollar terms, the spot price of light, sweet crude
oil. Natural market forces called contango and backwardation can
impact the total return on an investment in the Fund’s shares
relative to a hypothetical direct investment in crude oil and, in
the future, it is likely that the relationship between the market
price of the Fund’s shares and changes in the spot prices of
light, sweet crude oil will continue to be so impacted by contango
and backwardation. (It is important to note that the disclosure
above ignores the potential costs associated with physically owning
and storing crude oil, which could be substantial.)

 

 

 




 



18



 




  

The Fund
is designed to be utilized only by knowledgeable investors who
understand the potential consequences of seeking daily leveraged
investment results and are willing to monitor their portfolios
frequently. The Fund is not intended to be used by, and is not
appropriate for, investors who do not intend to actively monitor
and manage their portfolios.

  

The
Fund’s “neutral” investment strategy is designed
to permit investors generally to purchase and sell the Fund’s
shares for the purpose of investing indirectly in crude oil in a
cost-effective manner, and/or to permit participants in the oil or
other industries to hedge the risk of losses in their crude
oil-related transactions. Accordingly, depending on the investment
objective of an individual investor, the risks generally associated
with investing in crude oil and/or the risks involved in hedging
may exist. In addition, an investment in the Fund involves the risk
that the daily changes in the price of the Fund’s shares, in
percentage terms, will not accurately track the daily changes in
the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract on a leveraged basis, in
percentage terms, and that daily changes in the Benchmark Oil
Futures Contract in percentage terms, will not closely correlate
with daily changes in the spot prices of light, sweet crude oil, in
percentage terms.

  Impact
of Contango and Backwardation on Total Returns

Natural
market forces called contango and backwardation can impact the
total return on an investment in the Fund’s shares relative
to a hypothetical direct investment in crude oil and, in the
future, it is likely that the relationship between the market price
of the Fund’s shares and changes in the spot prices of light,
sweet crude oil will continue to be so impacted by contango and
backwardation. (It is important to note that the disclosure above
ignores the potential costs associated with physically owning and
storing crude oil, which could be substantial.)

Several
factors determine the total return from investing in a futures
contract position. One factor that impacts the total return that
will result from investing in near month futures contracts and
“rolling” those contracts forward each month is the
price relationship between the current near month contract and the
next month contract. For example, if the price of the near month
contract is higher than the next month contract (a situation
referred to as “backwardation” in the futures market),
then absent any other change there is a tendency for the price of a
next month contract to rise in value as it becomes the near month
contract and approaches expiration. Conversely, if the price of a
near month contract is lower than the next month contract (a
situation referred to as “contango” in the futures
market), then absent any other change there is a tendency for the
price of a next month contract to decline in value as it becomes
the near month contract and approaches expiration.

As an
example, assume that the price of crude oil for immediate delivery
(the “spot” price), was $50 per barrel, and the value
of a position in the near month futures contract was also $50. Over
time, the price of the barrel of crude oil will fluctuate based on
a number of market factors, including demand for oil relative to
its supply. The value of the near month contract will likewise
fluctuate in reaction to a number of market factors. If investors
seek to maintain their position in a near month contract and not
take delivery of the oil, every month they must sell their current
near month contract as it approaches expiration and invest in the
next month contract.

If the
futures market is in backwardation, e.g., when the price of crude
oil futures contracts that expire later than the near month
contract are lower than the near month contract’s price, the
investor would be buying a next month contract for a lower price
than the current near month contract. Using the $50 per barrel
price above to represent the front month price, the price of the
next month contract could be $49 per barrel, that is, 2% cheaper
than the front month contract. Hypothetically, and assuming no
other changes to either prevailing crude oil prices or the price
relationship between the spot price, the near month contract and
the next month contract (and ignoring the impact of commission
costs and the income earned on cash and/or cash equivalents), the
value of the $49 next month contract would rise as it approaches
expiration and becomes the new near month contract with a price of
$50. In this example, the value of an investment in the second
month contract would tend to rise faster than the spot price of
crude oil, or fall slower. As a result, it would be possible in
this hypothetical example for the spot price of crude oil to have
risen 10% after some period of time, while the value of the
investment in the second month futures contract would have risen
12%, assuming backwardation is large enough or enough time has
elapsed. Similarly, the spot price of crude oil could have fallen
10% while the value of an investment in the futures contract could
have fallen only 8%. Over time, if backwardation remained constant,
the difference would continue to increase.

If the
futures market is in contango, the investor would be buying a next
month contract for a higher price than the current near month
contract. Using again the $50 per barrel price above to represent
the front month price, the price of the next month contract could
be $51 per barrel, that is, 2% more expensive than the front month
contract. Hypothetically, and assuming no other changes to either
prevailing crude oil prices or the price relationship between the
spot price, the near month contract and the next month contract
(and ignoring the impact of commission costs and the income earned
on cash and/or cash equivalents), the value of the next month
contract would fall as it approaches expiration and becomes the new
near month contract with a price of $50. In this example, it would
mean that the value of an investment in the second month would tend
to rise slower than the spot price of crude oil, or fall faster. As
a result, it would be possible in this hypothetical example for the
spot price of crude oil to have risen 10% after some period of
time, while the value of the investment in the second month futures
contract will have risen only 8%, assuming contango is large enough
or enough time has elapsed. Similarly, the spot price of crude oil
could have fallen 10% while the value of an investment in the
second month futures contract could have fallen 12%. Over time, if
contango remained constant, the difference would continue to
increase.

Historically,
the crude oil futures markets have experienced periods of
contango and backwardation, with backwardation being in place
roughly as often as contango since oil futures trading, started in
1982. Following the global financial crisis in the fourth quarter
of 2008, the crude oil market moved into contango and remained in
contango for a period of several years. During parts of 2009,
the level of contango was unusually steep as a combination of slack
U.S. and global demand for crude oil and issues involving the
physical transportation and storage of crude oil at Cushing,
Oklahoma, the primary pricing point for oil traded in the U.S., led
to unusually high inventories of crude oil. Since then, a
combination of improved transportation and storage capacity, along
with growing demand for crude oil globally, has moderated the
inventory build-up and lead to reduced levels of contango by
2011. The crude oil futures market was primarily in a state of
contango during the year ended December 31, 2015.

Periods of
contango or backwardation do not materially impact the Fund’s
investment objective of having the daily percentage changes in its
per share NAV track, on a leveraged basis, the daily percentage
changes in the price of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract since
the impact of backwardation and contango tend to proportionally
impact the daily percentage changes in price of both the
Fund’s shares and the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract. It is
impossible to predict with any degree of certainty whether
backwardation or contango will occur in the future. It is likely
that both conditions will occur during different
periods.

  Trading
Methodology

In
managing the Fund’s assets, USCF does not use a technical
trading system that issues buy and sell orders. USCF instead
employs a quantitative methodology whereby each time a Creation
Basket is sold, USCF purchases Oil Interests, such as the Benchmark
Oil Futures Contract, that have an aggregate market value that
approximates three times (3x) the amount of Treasuries and/or cash
received upon the issuance of the Creation Basket. As of the NAV
calculation time each trading day, the Fund will also seek to
position its portfolio so that its exposure to the Benchmark Oil
Futures Contract is consistent with its investment objective to
provide investment results that correspond (before fees and
expenses) to three times (3x) the performance of the Benchmark Oil
Futures Contract.

The
specific Oil Futures Contracts purchased depend on various factors,
including a judgment by USCF as to the appropriate diversification
of the Fund’s investments in futures contracts with respect
to the month of expiration, and the prevailing price volatility of
particular contracts. While USCF has made significant investments
in NYMEX Oil Futures Contracts, for various reasons, including the
ability to enter into the precise amount of exposure to the crude
oil market, position limits or other regulatory requirements
limiting the Fund’s holdings, and market conditions, it may
invest in Oil Futures Contracts traded on other exchanges or invest
in Other Oil-Related Investments. To the extent that the Fund
invests in Other Oil-Related Investments, it would prioritize
investments in contracts and instruments that are economically
equivalent to the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract, including cleared
swaps that satisfy such criteria, and then, to a lesser extent, it
would invest in other types of cleared swaps and other contracts,
instruments and non-cleared swaps, such as swaps in the
over-the-counter market (or commonly referred to as the “OTC
market”). If the Fund is required by law or regulation, or by
one of its regulators, including a futures exchange, to reduce its
position in the Benchmark Oil Futures Contracts to the applicable
position limit or to a specified accountability level or if market
conditions dictate it would be more appropriate to invest in Other
Oil-Related Investments, a substantial portion of the Fund’s
assets could be invested in accordance with such priority in Other
Oil-Related Investments that are intended to replicate the return
on the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract. As the Fund’s assets
reach higher levels, it is more likely to exceed position limits,
accountability levels or other regulatory limits and, as a result,
it is more likely that it will invest in accordance with such
priority in Other Oil-Related Investments at such higher levels. In
addition, market conditions that USCF currently anticipates could
cause the Fund to invest in Other Oil-Related Investments include
those allowing the Fund to obtain greater liquidity or to execute
transactions with more favorable pricing. See “Risk Factors
Involved With an Investment in the Fund” for a discussion of
the potential impact of regulation on the Fund’s ability to
invest in OTC transactions and cleared swaps.

USCF may
not be able to fully invest the Fund’s assets in Benchmark
Oil Futures Contracts having an aggregate notional amount exactly
equal to three times (3x) the Fund’s NAV. For example, as
standardized contracts, the Benchmark Oil Futures Contracts are for
a specified amount of a particular commodity, and the Fund’s
NAV and the proceeds from the sale of a Creation Basket are
unlikely to be an exact multiple of the amounts of those contracts.
As a result, in such circumstances, the Fund may be better able to
achieve the exact amount of exposure to changes in price of the
Benchmark Oil Futures Contract through the use of Other Oil-Related
Investments, such as OTC contracts that have better correlation
with changes in price of the Benchmark Oil Futures
Contract.

The Fund
anticipates that to the extent it invests in Oil Futures Contracts
other than contracts on light, sweet crude oil (such as futures
contracts for diesel-heating oil, natural gas, and other
petroleum-based fuels) and Other Oil-Related Investments, it will
enter into various non-exchange-traded derivative contracts to
hedge the short-term price movements of such Oil Futures Contracts
and Other Oil-Related Investments against the current Benchmark Oil
Futures Contract.

USCF does
not anticipate letting the Fund’s Oil Futures Contracts
expire and taking delivery of the underlying commodity. Instead,
USCF will close existing positions, e.g. , when it changes
the Benchmark Oil Futures Contracts or Other Oil-Related
Investments or it otherwise determines it would be appropriate to
do so and reinvests the proceeds in new Oil Futures Contracts or
Other Oil-Related Investments. Positions may also be closed out to
meet orders for Redemption Baskets and in such case proceeds for
such baskets will not be reinvested.

The
Benchmark Oil Futures Contract is changed from the near month
contract to the next month contract over a four-day period. Each
month, the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract changes starting at the
end of the day on the date two weeks prior to expiration of the
near month contract for that month. During the first three days of
the period, the applicable value of the Benchmark Oil Futures
Contract is based on a combination of the near month contract and
the next month contract as follows: (1) day 1 consists of 75%
of the then near month contract’s price plus 25% of the price
of the next month contract, divided by 75% of the near month
contract’s prior day’s price plus 25% of the price of
the next month contract, (2) day 2 consists of 50% of the then
near month contract’s price plus 50% of the price of the next
month contract, divided by 50% of the near month contract’s
prior day’s price plus 50% of the price of the next month
contract and (3) day 3 consists of 25% of the then near month
contract’s price plus 75% of the price of the next month
contract, divided by 25% of the near month contract’s prior
day’s price plus 75% of the price of the next month contract.
On day 4, the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract is the next month
contract to expire at that time and that contract remains the
Benchmark Oil Futures Contract until the beginning of the following
month’s change in the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract over a
four-day period.

On each
day during the four-day period, USCF anticipates it will
“roll” the Fund’s positions in Oil Interests by
closing, or selling, a percentage of the Fund’s positions in
Oil Interests and reinvesting the proceeds from closing those
positions in new Oil Interests that reflect the change in the
Benchmark Oil Futures Contract.

The
anticipated dates that the monthly four-day roll period will
commence are posted on the Fund’s website at [ • ], and
are subject to change without notice.

By
remaining invested as fully as possible in Oil Futures Contracts or
Other Oil-Related Investments, USCF believes that the daily changes
in percentage terms of the Fund’s NAV will continue to
closely track, on a leveraged basis, the daily changes in
percentage terms in the price of the Benchmark Oil Futures
Contract. USCF believes that certain arbitrage opportunities result
in the price of the shares traded on the NYSE Arca closely tracking
the NAV of the Fund. Additionally, Oil Futures Contracts traded on
the NYMEX have closely tracked the spot price of light, sweet crude
oil. Based on these expected interrelationships, USCF believes that
the changes in the price of the Fund’s shares as traded on
the NYSE Arca have closely tracked and will continue to closely
track on a daily basis, the changes in the spot price of light,
sweet crude oil on a percentage basis.

  What
are the Trading Policies of the Fund?

 

Investment
Objectives

The Fund
seeks, on a daily basis, to provide investment results that
correspond (before fees and expenses) to three times (3x) the
performance of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract. The Fund does
not seek to achieve its stated objective over a period greater than
a single day. Because the Fund seeks investment results for a
single day only (as measured from the time the Fund calculates its
NAV to the time of the Fund’s next NAV calculation) and on a
leveraged basis, the Fund is different from most exchange-traded
funds.

 

 

 




 



21



 




  

As of the
NAV calculation time each trading day, the Fund will seek to
position its portfolio so that its exposure to the Benchmark Oil
Futures Contract is consistent with its investment objective. The
impact of a Benchmark Oil Futures Contract’s movements during
the day will affect whether the Fund’s portfolio needs to be
rebalanced. For example, the Fund’s long exposure will need
to be increased on days when the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract
rises and decreased on days the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract
falls. Daily rebalancing and the compounding of each day’s
return over time means that the return of the Fund for a period
longer than a single day will be the result of each day’s
returns compounded over the period, which will very likely differ
from three times (3x) the return of the Benchmark Oil Futures
Contract for the period. The Fund may lose money if the Benchmark
Oil Futures Contract’s performance is flat over time, and it
is possible for a Fund to lose money over time regardless of the
performance of the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract, as a result of
daily rebalancing, the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract’s
volatility and compounding.

There can
be no assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objective
or avoid substantial losses. The Fund does not seek to achieve its
stated investment objective over a period of time greater than a
single day because mathematical compounding prevents the Fund from
achieving such results. Results for the Fund over periods of time
greater than a single day should not be expected to be a simple
multiple (3x) of the period return of the Benchmark Oil Futures
Contract and will likely differ significantly from such. The Fund
may lose money if the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract’s
performance is flat over time, and it is possible for the Fund to
lose money over time regardless of the performance of the Benchmark
Oil Futures Contract, as a result of daily rebalancing, the
Benchmark Oil Futures Contract’s volatility and compounding.
Daily compounding of the Fund’s investment returns can
dramatically and adversely affect its longer-term performance
during periods of high volatility. Volatility may be at least as
important to the Fund’s return for a period as the return of
the Benchmark Oil Futures Contract.

Liquidity

 

The Fund
invests only in Oil Futures Contracts and Other Oil-Related
Investments that, in the opinion of USCF, are traded in sufficient
volume to permit the ready taking and liquidation of positions in
these financial interests and in Other Oil-Related Investments
that, in the opinion of USCF, may be readily liquidated with the
original counterparty or through a third party assuming the
position of the Fund.

Spot
Commodities

 

While the
crude Oil Futures Contracts traded can be physically settled, the
Fund does not intend to take or make physical delivery. The Fund
may from time to time trade in Other Oil-Related Investments,
including contracts based on the spot price of crude
oil.

Leverage

 

USCF
endeavors to have the aggregate market value of its obligations
under its Oil Futures Contracts and Other Oil-Related Investments
equal to three times (3x) the value of the Fund’s Treasuries,
cash and cash equivalents, whether held by the Fund or posted as
margin or other collateral, at the close of each trading day (as
measured at the time the Fund calculates its NAV). Commodity
pools’ trading positions in futures contracts or other
related investments are typically required to be secured by the
deposit of margin funds that represent only a small percentage of a
futures contract’s (or other commodity interest’s)
entire market value.

Borrowings

 

Borrowings
are not expected to be used by the Fund unless the Fund is required
to borrow money in the event of physical delivery, if the Fund
trades in cash commodities, or for short-term needs created by
unexpected redemptions.

OTC
Derivatives (Including Spreads and Straddles)

 

In
addition to Oil Futures Contracts, there are also a number of
listed options on the Oil Futures Contracts on the principal
futures exchanges. These contracts offer investors and hedgers
another set of financial vehicles to use in managing exposure to
the crude oil market. Consequently, the Fund may purchase options
on crude Oil Futures Contracts on these exchanges in pursuing its
investment objective.

 

 




 



22



 




  

In
addition to the Oil Futures Contracts and options on the Oil
Futures Contracts, there also exists an active non-exchange-traded
market in derivatives tied to crude oil. These derivatives
transactions (also known as OTC contracts) are usually entered into
between two parties in private contracts. Unlike most of the
exchange-traded Oil Futures Contracts or exchange-traded options on
the Oil Futures Contracts, each party to such contract bears the
credit risk of the other party, i.e. , the risk that the
other party may not be able to perform its obligations under its
contract. To reduce the credit risk that arises in connection with
such contracts, the Fund will generally enter into an agreement
with each counterparty based on the Master Agreement published by
the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc.
(“ISDA”) that provides for the netting of its overall
exposure to its counterparty.

USCF
assesses or reviews, as appropriate, the creditworthiness of each
potential or existing counterparty to an OTC contract pursuant to
guidelines approved by USCF’s board.

The Fund
may enter into certain transactions where an OTC component is
exchanged for a corresponding futures contract (an “Exchange
for Related Position” or “EFRP transaction”). In
the most common type of EFRP transaction entered into by the Fund,
the OTC component is the purchase or sale of one or more baskets of
the Fund shares. These EFRP transactions may expose the Fund to
counterparty risk during the interim period between the execution
of the OTC component and the exchange for a corresponding futures
contract. Generally, the counterparty risk from the EFRP
transaction will exist only on the day of execution.

The Fund
may employ spreads or straddles in its trading to mitigate the
differences in its investment portfolio and its goal of tracking,
on a leveraged basis, the price of the Benchmark Oil Futures
Contract. The Fund would use a spread when it chooses to take
simultaneous long and short positions in futures written on the
same underlying asset, but with different delivery
months.

The Fund
does not anticipate engaging in trading in futures contracts listed
on a foreign exchange, forward contracts or options on such
contracts, but it may do so as outlined in the Fund’s listing
exemptive order or as permitted under current
regulations.

Pyramiding

 

USCF has
not employed, and will not employ, the technique, commonly known as
pyramiding, in which the speculator uses unrealized profits on
existing positions as variation margin for the purchase or sale of
additional positions in the same or another commodity
interest.

"We wanted to work together to offer the same type of strategy to investors who prefer mutual funds and to those seeking a quality commodity product without a K-1."  The mutual fund will invest in commodities via a Cayman Islands subsidiary.  SummerHaven Index Management LLC (SummerHaven), a Stamford, CT based commodity index provider and commodity trading adviser, will manage the commodity investments.  USCF Advisor, LLC will serve as the investment advisor of the mutual fund."We are excited to build on our long-term collaboration with USCF and to leverage the great success of USCI," said Ashraf Rizvi, Partner of SummerHaven.  "This new mutual fund utilizes the established SummerHaven Dynamic Commodity Index (SDCI) as its benchmark, providing an attractive commodity mutual fund product with no K-1 for investors." SummerHaven and USCF have collaborated on three exchange traded products:  the United States Copper Index Fund (CPER), the United States Agriculture Index Fund (USAG) and the United States Commodity Index Fund (USCI), which also uses SDCI as a benchmark.  The SDCI is a total return commodity sector index designed to broadly represent major commodities. The SDCI reflects the performance of a fully collateralized portfolio of 14 commodity futures, selected each month from a universe of 27 eligible contracts.  Unlike many commodity products, the index rebalances to equal weights on a monthly basis and features a diversification rule that allows it to maintain broad exposure to all commodity sectors."Our team is thrilled with the opportunity to expand our relationship with SummerHaven," said Love.  "We feel that they possess unparalleled expertise and depth of knowledge, and their work is a benefit to the entire world of commodity investing." About USCF   USCF operates on the leading edge of Exchange Traded Product (ETP) innovation.  The firm broke new ground with the launch of the first oil ETP, the United States Oil Fund, LP (USO), in 2006.  Over the next decade, USCF designed and issued thirteen more specialty ETPs across commodity and equity asset classes.  USCF currently manages over $5 billion in assets from its headquarters in Oakland, California.  About SummerHaven Index Management SummerHaven Index Management, LLC creates innovative commodity indexes focused on providing investors with better risk-adjusted returns than traditional commodity indexes.
