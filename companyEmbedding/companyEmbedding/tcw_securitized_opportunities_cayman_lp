Investment Objective 
The goal of TCW Securitized Opportunities is to significantly outperform the Barclays Capital U.S. Aggregate Bond Index over a full market cycle. The strategy seeks to generate high returns, historically similar to the equity market but with lower volatility over the long term. TCW believes that the management team’s application of its extensive experience and committed research will add value to the investment process and enable this strategy to take advantage of market mispricings, as well as periods of market illiquidity and dislocation.
Philosophy 
Central to the TCW Securitized Opportunities investment philosophy is the belief that even in “normal” times, the securitized markets present valuation complexities that, when combined with traditional fixed income valuation factors, give rise to pricing inefficiencies that can be exploited by informed investors. Negative investor psychology, supply-demand imbalances, the lack of analytical resources, the lack of extensive experience required to understand the nuances, or a combination of such factors, work to create a barrier to entry in this market and result in opportunities for investors with the experience and resources to selectively invest.  By virtue of our constant involvement in the securitized products market, TCW believes it is well positioned to exploit the inefficiencies available in this complex sector.

* This undertaking does not affect any limits Section 102(a) of the National Securities Markets
        Improvement Act of 1996 ("NSMIA") [Pub. L. No. 104-290, 110 Stat. 3416 (Oct. 11, 1996)] imposes on the ability of States to
        require information. As a result, if the securities that are the subject of this Form D are "covered securities" for purposes 
        of NSMIA, whether in all instances or due to the nature of the offering that is the subject of this Form D, States cannot
        routinely require offering materials under this undertaking or otherwise and can require offering materials only to the
        extent NSMIA permits them to do so under NSMIA's preservation of their anti-fraud authority.
