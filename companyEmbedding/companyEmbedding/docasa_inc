PR Newswire




Mar 29, 2017 8:00 AM EDT













 


















































  SCHAUMBURG, Ill., March 29, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- DOCASA, Inc. (OTCQB: DCSA), through its award-winning subsidiary, Department of Coffee and Social Affairs Limited, based in the United Kingdom ("UK"), has announced the securing of its first coffee shop site in Manchester, UK.  The new site is located on the ground floor of Faulkner House, a 25,000 sq. ft. building of serviced offices, in Manchester's iconic Piccadilly Gardens area.  The new site, comprising nearly 3,000 square feet of space and offering 120 covers, will be the Department of Coffee and Social Affairs' flagship store and barista training hub in the northern part of England.  It will also act as a co-work space for professionals, with hot desks, breakout spaces and meeting rooms available to rent by the hour. Commenting on the new site, DOCASA, Inc.'s President & CEO, Ashley Lopez, said: "We are thrilled to be opening in Manchester, a city with such a dynamic business and arts culture and one we have been looking to locate in for some time; this is the first of several planned site openings here." She went on, "With 1.91 million professional freelancers in the UK, the increasing demand for flexible workspace is constantly growing. Manchester is no exception to the trend, and we are capitalizing on this demand by dedicating space in our new site to cater for those professionals who need alternative work space."  Manchester, the UK's second largest city with 2.6 million people, is known for its flourishing music, culture and arts scene.  In the past decade, the population has grown by about 17%, approximately double the UK growth rate.  Based on the latest Hometrack research report released this month, Manchester also tops UK cities for having the strongest home price growth:  8.8% year-on-year.  The city is home to over 100,000 businesses with an economy generating an annualized $70 billion.

Gire: The "skinny repeal" is not a "modest" change.  By eliminating the need for all to have health insurance, the insurance companies know that costs will spiral out of control.  People who think they are healthy (now) and short on cash will bail.  Sicker people will remain, so costs will go up.  Other people who think they are healthy (now) and who can't afford the higher costs will drop out.  Costs will go up.  

While this affects me (as a self-employed person), you may think it doesn't affect you and your employer-based insurance.  Oops.  With none of the ACA cost constraints, prices will return to 6% or 8% annual increases (increases are currently about 4%).  Your salary will only increase about 2% yearly.  After 10 years your insurance costs will double, while your salary will go up about 25%.  Oops.Join the Conversation1 / 52k
