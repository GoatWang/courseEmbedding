      products

BOSTON, Mass., IRVINE, Calif., & REHOVOT, Israel--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Tokai Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NASDAQ:TKAI) and Otic Pharma Ltd., a 
      privately-held, clinical-stage pharmaceutical company focusing on the 
      development and commercialization of products for disorders of the ear, 
      nose, and throat (ENT), today announced that the two companies, together 
      with the shareholders of Otic Pharma, have entered into a definitive 
      share purchase agreement under which the shareholders of Otic Pharma 
      will become the majority owners of Tokai.
    


      The transaction will result in a NASDAQ-listed company focused on the 
      development and commercialization of products for ENT disorders, 
      including Otic Pharma’s lead candidate which is a nasally-administered, 
      combination drug product (OP-02) intended to address the underlying 
      cause of otitis media and Eustachian tube dysfunction (OM/ETD), a 
      condition that affects more than 700 million people around the world 
      every year. The company will operate under the name OticPharma, Inc., 
      and will be led by Gregory J. Flesher, current Chief Executive Office of 
      Otic Pharma Ltd. Current President and Chief Executive Officer of Tokai, 
      Jodie Morrison, will remain as a member of the board of directors.
    

      “Over the last several months, Tokai has conducted an extensive review 
      of strategic alternatives aimed at maximizing value for our shareholders 
      over the long-term,” said Jodie Morrison, President and CEO of Tokai 
      Pharmaceuticals. “We believe the proposed transaction with Otic Pharma, 
      a company that has both a promising pipeline and an experienced 
      leadership team with a track record of creating significant shareholder 
      value in public pharmaceutical companies, advances this goal.”
    

      “Our lead program in otitis media, OP-02, has significant potential,” 
      said Gregory J. Flesher, Chief Executive Officer of Otic Pharma. “OP-02 
      is an investigational drug product designed to break the cycle of 
      recurrent and chronic otitis media which affect millions of people 
      around the world. We expect to have phase 1 clinical pharmacodynamic 
      data in the first half of 2017 and, with this transaction, to have the 
      capital needed to be able to move directly into phase 2 development to 
      explore the product’s ability to prevent otitis media in children.”
    

Share Purchase Agreement Details


      Under the terms of the agreement, the shareholders of Otic Pharma will 
      receive a total of 32,172,209 shares of newly issued Tokai common stock, 
      while outstanding Otic Pharma options and convertible securities will be 
      assumed by Tokai. Upon the exchange, it is expected that existing Tokai 
      stockholders will own approximately 40% of the combined company, with 
      existing Otic Pharma shareholders owning approximately 60%. The 
      transaction has been unanimously approved by the boards of directors of 
      both companies and shareholders of Otic Pharma. Tokai’s largest 
      stockholder, Apple Tree Partners, who holds approximately 35% of Tokai’s 
      common stock has entered into an agreement in support of the proposed 
      transaction. The transaction is expected to close during the first 
      quarter of 2017, subject to customary closing conditions, including 
      approval by shareholders of Tokai.
    

      Wedbush PacGrow advised Tokai Pharmaceuticals and Piper Jaffray & Co. 
      advised Otic Pharma in the proposed transaction. Wilmer Cutler Pickering 
      Hale and Dorr LLP and Gross, Kleinhendler, Hodak, Halevy, Greenberg & 
      Co. served as legal counsel to Tokai and Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP and 
      Yigal Arnon & Co. served as legal counsel to Otic Pharma.
    

Management and Organization


      Upon the close of the proposed transaction, the board of directors of 
      the combined company will consist of seven members, three to be 
      designated by Tokai and four to be designated by Otic Pharma. Officers 
      of the new company will be Gregory J. Flesher, President and Chief 
      Executive Officer; Christine G. Ocampo, Chief Financial and Compliance 
      Officer; and Dr. Catherine C. Turkel, Chief Development Officer.
    

Additional Funding

      members of the management team, has committed to invest $7 million of 
      additional capital in connection with the share purchase agreement.

The Cambridge, Massachusetts-based firm will offer 5.4 million shares at an expected price range of $13-$15 per share. If the IPO can find the midpoint of that range at $14 per share, TKAI will command a market value of $310 million.
Less Illustrious Underwriters
TKAI filed on August 11, 2014
Lead Underwriters: BMO Capital Markets Corp; Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated; William Blair and Co., L.L.C
Underwriters: Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Summary: Development of therapies for prostate cancer
TKAI is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical firm seeking to develop novel, proprietary therapies for prostate cancer as well as other hormonally-driven diseases.
The firm is currently in the process of developing galeterone, an oral small molecule drug candidate for the treatment of prostate cancer, initially targeting castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). CRPC patients exhibit prostate tumor cells that are resistant to current treatments for prostate cancer, such as top selling treatments Zytiga and Xtandi.
Galeterone takes a radically different approach to the treatment of prostate cancer by inhibiting the chemical pathway that underlies prostate cancer growth. TKAI's ongoing Phase 2 trial of galeterone has demonstrated clinically significant decreases in prostate cancer indicators.


(Source: Company website)
TKAI plans to conduct a pivotal Phase 3 trial of galeterone in the first half of 2015 and expects top line data from the trial in 2016. The firm also intends to continue to develop galeterone for the treatment of other indications.
Strong Management Could Prove Match For Major Competitors
If approved, TKAI's products will face competition from products currently marketed for the treatment of prostate cancer, many of which are marketed by firms with significantly greater financial and technical resources than TKAI.
Numerous other firms are also developing treatments for prostate cancer that may compete with galeterone. Major potential competitors include Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Orion Corporation, Janssen Biotech Inc, Astellas Pharma US Inc., Medivation Inc. (NASDAQ:MDVN), Bayer, Dendreon Corporation (NASDAQ:DNDN), Exelixis Inc (NASDAQ:EXEL), and Bavarian Nordic A/S.
President and CEO Jodie P. Morrison has served in her current roles and as a member of TKAI's board since March 2013. She previously held other roles with TKAI, including COO, Head of Clinical Affairs and Program Operations and Vice President of Clinical Affairs and Program Operations. Ms. Morrison has also served as Director of Clinical Operations and Medical Affairs at Dyax Corporation and worked in clinical management positions at Curis, Inc. and at Diacrin, Inc.
Ms. Morrison holds a B.A. in neuroscience from Mount Holyoke College, her clinical research certification from the Boston University School of Medicine and her business training through the Greater Boston Executive Program at the MIT Sloan School of Management.
Valuation
TKAI offers the following figures in its S-1 balance sheet for the six months ended June 30, 2014:

Revenue: $0.00
Net Loss: ($10,698,000.00)
Total Assets: $23,420,000.00
Total Liabilities: $3,688,000.00
Stockholders' Equity: ($65,613,000.00)
TKAI's current lack of revenue is typical of a pre-commercial biopharmaceutical firm, and should not be interpreted as a sign of its potential for future success. TKAI will not be able to generate significant revenues until it has commercialized one or more of its product candidates.
Conclusion: Not Yet A Buy
We are neutral on this stock.
Though TKAI remains a significant distance from commercializing galeterone, the treatment has shown very promising results in early trials, and an improved treatment for prostate cancer would no doubt prove highly profitable for TKAI.
That said, the firm will face massive competition even if does receive approval for galeterone, and there is no guarantee that another firm will not develop an even better treatment by the time galeterone has been commercialized.
Buying into TKAI is more or less a bet on galeterone, especially since TKAI has little else in its arsenal-investors will win big or lose big depending on the treatment's success.

(TKAI) and Otic Pharma Ltd., a privately-held, clinical-stage pharmaceutical company focusing on the development and commercialization of products for disorders of the ear, nose, and throat (ENT), today announced that the two companies, together with the shareholders of Otic Pharma, have entered into a definitive share purchase agreement under which the shareholders of Otic Pharma will become the majority owners of Tokai.The transaction will result in a NASDAQ-listed company focused on the development and commercialization of products for ENT disorders, including Otic Pharma’s lead candidate which is a nasally-administered, combination drug product (OP-02) intended to address the underlying cause of otitis media and Eustachian tube dysfunction (OM/ETD), a condition that affects more than 700 million people around the world every year. The company will operate under the name OticPharma, Inc., and will be led by Gregory J. Flesher, current Chief Executive Office of Otic Pharma Ltd. Current President and Chief Executive Officer of Tokai, Jodie Morrison, will remain as a member of the board of directors.“Over the last several months, Tokai has conducted an extensive review of strategic alternatives aimed at maximizing value for our shareholders over the long-term,” said Jodie Morrison, President and CEO of Tokai Pharmaceuticals. “We believe the proposed transaction with Otic Pharma, a company that has both a promising pipeline and an experienced leadership team with a track record of creating significant shareholder value in public pharmaceutical companies, advances this goal.”“Our lead program in otitis media, OP-02, has significant potential,” said Gregory J. Flesher, Chief Executive Officer of Otic Pharma. “OP-02 is an investigational drug product designed to break the cycle of recurrent and chronic otitis media which affect millions of people around the world. We expect to have phase 1 clinical pharmacodynamic data in the first half of 2017 and, with this transaction, to have the capital needed to be able to move directly into phase 2 development to explore the product’s ability to prevent otitis media in children.”Share Purchase Agreement DetailsUnder the terms of the agreement, the shareholders of Otic Pharma will receive a total of 32,172,209 shares of newly issued Tokai common stock, while outstanding Otic Pharma options and convertible securities will be assumed by Tokai. Upon the exchange, it is expected that existing Tokai stockholders will own approximately 40% of the combined company, with existing Otic Pharma shareholders owning approximately 60%.

About Galeterone

Tokai’s lead product candidate is galeterone, an oral small molecule that utilizes the mechanistic pathways of current second-generation hormonal therapies, including abiraterone and enzalutamide, while also introducing a unique third mechanism – androgen receptor degradation – that impairs the function of androgen receptors, decreasing their sensitivity to androgen activity and reducing tumor growth. Tokai is developing galeterone for the treatment of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. Enrollment in the ARMOR2 and ARMOR3-SV clinical trials of galeterone has been closed. Assessment of future plans for galeterone are underway at this time.
Galeterone has been studied in over 250 subjects in Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials, including in CRPC patients with and without the AR-V7 splice variant. In these trials, galeterone demonstrated good tolerability and showed clinically meaningful reductions in levels of prostate specific antigen, or PSA, a biochemical marker used to evaluate prostate cancer patients for signs of response to therapy.
We have worldwide development and commercialization rights to galeterone.










Androgen receptor degradation, which reduces the amount of androgen receptor protein in the tumor cells.







Androgen receptor antagonism, which blocks the binding of testosterone or DHT with the androgen receptor.







Inhibition of the enzyme CYP17, which blocks the synthesis of testosterone.

Tokai Pharmaceuticals is a biopharmaceutical company previously focused on developing and commercializing innovative therapies for prostate cancer and other hormonally driven diseases. Enrollment in the ARMOR2 and ARMOR3-SV clinical trials of Tokai’s drug candidate, galeterone, for the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) has been closed, with only patients in ARMOR2 long-term extension continuing treatment at this time.  Assessment of plans for galeterone, the ARDA platform and Tokai’s AR-V7 assay work are underway at this time.
On December 22, 2016, Tokai and Otic Pharma Ltd., a privately-held, clinical-stage pharmaceutical company focusing on the development and commercialization of products for disorders of the ear, nose, and throat (ENT), announced that the two companies have entered into a definitive share purchase agreement under which the shareholders of Otic Pharma will become the majority owners of Tokai.
