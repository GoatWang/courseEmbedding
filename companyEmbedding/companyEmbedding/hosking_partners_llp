 Career History



Partner

                                    2015 - Current                


Hosking Partners LLP


                  Hosking Partners is an active, contrarian manager which specializes in global, international and regional equity. They construct global equity portfolios with diversified, strong views designed to deliver long-term outperformance. The firm believes in stock market pricing inefficiency, and seeks to identify attractive shares through a bottom-up approach. They utilize a capital cycle approach to identify and target out-of-favor sectors, looking for profitability where competition is low.                




Fund Manager

                                    Current                


Hosking & Co., Ltd.


                  The business strategy of Hosking & Co. is to manage global equity portfolios with flexible investment guidelines for a limited number of sophisticated institutions worldwide. Hosking & Co. is applying for registration with the Central Bank of Ireland, and will apply for approval to launch a qualifying investor fund for which a draft prospectus will be available shortly.

The investment strategy will build on the prior experience of Jeremy Hosking at GT Management and Marathon Asset Management. It is anticipated that the fund will be managed by two multi-counsellors, Jeremy Hosking and Django Davidson. Business development and client service will be coordinated by Emily Mansouri.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.

No sell buffer

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year

A Global Equity Strategy For Institutional InvestorsOur investment philosophy, which has served clients well over many years, employs a behavioural approach to seek latent alpha. This results in a long-term investment horizon and a portfolio that is highly diversified by stock, yet powerfully concentrated in ideas.
…
We do not believe in specialisation or product proliferation: all of our best (and worst) ideas are fed into one strategy, managed by generalist portfolio managers.
…
Our firm is structured as a perpetual partnership. This means we think carefully about building a sustainable business and above all else about generating superior investment returns for our clients.
…
The investment team at Hosking Partners write ad hoc thought pieces on themes and topics that catch their eye. A selection of these pieces can be found here.
