Philip M. Pead Named Chief Executive Officer of Eclipsys Corporation | Business Wire
























































Philip M. Pead Named Chief Executive Officer of Eclipsys Corporation






May 14, 2009 07:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time



ATLANTA--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Eclipsys Corporation® (NASDAQ: ECLP), The Outcomes Company®, today 
      announced that Philip M. Pead has been named President and Chief 
      Executive Officer. Mr. Pead, an Eclipsys director, was Chairman, 
      President and Chief Executive Officer of Per-Se Technologies Inc., a 
      provider of acute care solutions, physician outsourcing services and 
      practice management and claims processing services, until its 
      acquisition by McKesson in 2007. He succeeds R. Andrew Eckert, who has 
      served as CEO and a director since 2005, and has decided to leave the 
      company after accomplishing a number of important operational goals and 
      following a transitional period during which he will work closely with 
      Mr. Pead.
    

      Mr. Eckert said: “I am proud of what we have accomplished since I joined 
      Eclipsys nearly four years ago. We have achieved significantly improved 
      KLAS scores for client satisfaction, improved our technology platform 
      and products, diversified the company through acquisitions and built an 
      industry-leading executive team. It became clear, however, that to 
      position the company for long-term growth and capitalize on the exciting 
      new opportunities taking shape in the healthcare sector, Eclipsys needs 
      a leader committed to operate from Atlanta and usher the Company through 
      the next phases of its development. Given my family ties to Silicon 
      Valley, it was not realistic for me to continue in my role as CEO. I am 
      pleased that Eclipsys is in the hands of an experienced executive who 
      will help the company continue to achieve its business objectives.”
    

      Eugene V. Fife, Chairman of Eclipsys, said: “We are delighted that Phil 
      Pead will become CEO of Eclipsys at this time of great opportunity for 
      the company. Our technology platform is robust, our integrated software 
      solutions are well positioned to help our many outstanding clients 
      capitalize on the HITECH Act, and our talented and committed employees 
      are passionate about contributing to the quality of healthcare. Given 
      his experience in the healthcare information technology sector and his 
      track record of performance, value creation and leadership at Per-Se, 
      Phil is uniquely suited to lead our company. As a member of our Board of 
      Directors, he understands our business, and has demonstrated the 
      knowledge, commitment and vision that give us confidence that he is the 
      right long-term leader for Eclipsys.
    

      “We thank Andy for his exceptional service to Eclipsys. Under his 
      leadership, the company established itself as a major enterprise player 
      in the healthcare IT marketplace. He has accomplished a great deal and 
      created a solid foundation for future growth. We are grateful for his 
      many contributions, including his efforts to ensure a seamless 
      transition, and wish him every success in the future,” Mr. Fife 
      concluded.
    

      Mr. Pead said: “I am very excited by the opportunity to lead Eclipsys. 
      The company has built an exceptional technology platform and client 
      base, and I believe it is well-positioned to be a leader in reshaping 
      our country’s healthcare infrastructure. I look forward to working with 
      the Eclipsys management team and Board of Directors to continue building 
      a culture of attentive client service, constant innovation and long-term 
      success.”
    

      Prior to joining Per-Se in 1997, Mr. Pead served as the Senior Vice 
      President with responsibility for international operations of Dun & 
      Bradstreet Software Services, Inc., a leading developer of software; and 
      as Vice President with responsibility for overseeing the Asian and Latin 
      American operations of Attachmate Corporation, a leading provider of 
      host connectivity solutions.
    

      Mr. Pead will continue as a director of the company.

Eclipsys Names Philip Pead New CEO






The Associated Press




May 14, 2009 9:57 AM EDT













 
















































 ATLANTA (AP) ¿ Eclipsys Corp., which makes software for the health care industry, said Thursday it named company director Philip M. Pead as its new chief executive. Pead, 56, replaces R. Andrew Eckert, who has been CEO since 2005. The company said he is leaving the company due to family ties on the West Coast. "Eclipsys needs a leader committed to operate from Atlanta and usher the company through the next phases of its development," Eckert, 47, said in a statement. "Given my family ties to Silicon Valley, it was not realistic for me to continue in my role as CEO." Pead was previously CEO of Per-Se Technologies Inc., a provider of health care services. Prior to that, he was a senior vice president of Dun & Bradstreet Software Services Inc. Eclipsys shares fell $1, or 6.7 percent, to $14 in morning trading.
