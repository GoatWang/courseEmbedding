Mining Waste Treatment Technology Selection—Case Study—Sequatchie Valley Coal Mine–Sequatchie County, Tennessee












 


















    Case Study as part of a Web-based
    Technical and Regulatory Guidance
Sequatchie Valley Coal Mine
    Sequatchie County, Tennessee
1. Site Information
1.1 Contacts
Western Research Institute
    Contact: Jeff Morris
    Telephone: 307-721-2422
    E-mail: jmorris@uwyo.edu
1.2 Name, Location,
    and Description
    The Sequatchie Valley Coal Mine site is next to the TN(4) site (USEPA
    2000), located approximately 16.6 miles northwest of Chattanooga (latitude
    35.30136N, longitude 85.31557W) in Sequatchie County, Tennessee (Figure 1-1).


Figure 1-1. Surroundings of the Sequatchie Valley
        Coal Mine.
      (Source: GoogleEarth 2009 with a satellite image of April 2002. Elaboration: ITRC.)

The site, owned by Kennecott Energy Company, is a reclaimed surface bituminous
    coal mine that was mined between 1970s and 1990s. Sequatchie Valley Coal
    has reclaimed approximately 1,400 acres, including 350 acres of abandoned
    mine land. The owner implemented different technologies from backfilling
    technology and chemical treatment to anoxic lime drain. Now, the site is
    covered with natural vegetation; however, due to rain and runoff, the site
    still produces acid mine drainage (AMD).
Water continues seeping through backfilled
    material, causing AMD problems in low-lying areas, where seeps drain into
    small basins and wetlands. AMD gets into the natural rivers, affecting them,
    and groundwater and soil throughout are also affected. In Figure 1-2 the
    river path nearest the site is indicated in red. The area has many rivers
    which also transport AMD; all join into the Appalachian basin.


Figure 1-2. AMD discharge flow from Sequatchie
          Valley Coal Mine. 
      (Source: GoogleEarth 2009 with a satellite image of April 2002. Elaboration: ITRC.)

2. Remedial Action and Technologies
Western Research Institute (WRI) has developed a unique biological source
    treatment technique that is distinctive from treatment techniques which focus
    on AMD effluents. The technique uses readily available, inexpensive sources
    of inocula (e.g., wastewater effluent and solids, lagoon sediments) and substrates
    (e.g., returned milk, other dairy byproducts) to raise pH and prevent AMD
    generation at the source. Microorganisms feed on the substrates and neutralize
    acidity by consuming acid-generating protons and producing alkaline bicarbonate
    as by-products of their natural metabolism. At the same time, microorganisms
    form a biofilm over the AMD source material, such as pyrite, shielding the
    material from oxygen and preventing oxidation of the pyrite.
The technology was implemented in a 10-acre area which partially contributes
  to basins (rivers and ponds) with an average flow of about 15–16 million gallons
  per year. The treatment has been operating for 3.5 years and will continue
  several more years as site is being expanded to adjacent untreated areas.  
3. Performance
To gauge the performance of the technology, an electromagnetic survey was
    used to measure the subsurface conductivity as deep as 120 m, pinpoint sources
    of AMD (see Figure 3-1), and construct a cohesive map of the overall plume
    without the need to drill monitoring wells.
The contaminants of concern to probe the performance of the technology were
    acidity, iron, and manganese. Figure 3-2 shows the positive results derived
    from the application of biological source treatment at the site. The pH of
    groundwater downgradient from injection wells has been steadily increasing
    while remaining in the neutral range.


Figure 3-1. Cohesive map using electromagnetic survey. Red
        indicates a strong presence of AMD sources. (WRI 2007)


Figure 3-2. pH behavior as a function of time down- and upgradient
        from treated area. (WRI 2007)


4. CostsThe capital and operating and maintenance costs were not estimated because
    the project is research in progress.
5. Regulatory ChallengesThe implementation of the technology encountered regulatory barriers due
    to permits needed for subsurface injections and to expand treated area. Despite
    that fact, there are open lines of communication with state regulatory agencies,
    and the existing data that support the technique are being shared when possible.
6. Stakeholder ChallengesNo stakeholder challenges were encountered.
7. Other Challenges and Lessons
    LearnedTreatment is raising pH and decreasing conductivity in treated area. Adjacent
    untreated areas were still contributing low pH drainage to surface water
    sites; therefore, the treatment zone is being expanded to treat or intercept
    low pH water from these sites prior to surface discharge.
