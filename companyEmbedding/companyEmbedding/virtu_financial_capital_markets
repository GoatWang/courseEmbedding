Virtu Financial is one of the largest high-frequency trading[1][2] (HFT) and market making firms. It provides two-sided quotations and trades in equities, commodities, currencies, options, fixed income, and other securities on over 230 exchanges, markets, and dark pools.[4] Virtu uses proprietary high-frequency trading[1][2] strategies based on big data[5] to trade large volumes of securities. On March 10, 2014, Virtu Financial filed for its initial public offering,[6] yet repeatedly delayed its IPO.[7] On April 15, 2015 Virtu Financial successfully priced its IPO[8] which began trading as a NASDAQ-listed public company on April 16, 2015.

Organization[edit]
Based in New York City, Virtu was founded by Vincent Viola, a former chairman of the New York Mercantile Exchange and current owner of the Florida Panthers.[9] Douglas Cifu, Virtu’s CEO since October 2013, co-founded Virtu with Viola in 2008. Cifu is also a co-owner of the Florida Panthers with Viola and serves as the Panthers’ alternate governor. Prior to co-founding Virtu, Cifu was a partner at the international law firm of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP, where he practiced corporate law from 1990 to 2008.
The company suggested standards for electronic firms that call themselves market makers. Virtu believes market makers should be obligated to quote at or near the inside of the national best bid and offer throughout the day and quote at various price points in a number of different securities.[10][11] Virtu was ranked as one of the five largest high-frequency traders of equities in Europe in 2011.[12]
In November 2014, Reuters reported that Chris Concannon, president and chief operating officer at Virtu Financial, will succeed William O'Brien as president of BATS Global Markets, a trading venue that was founded by high-frequency traders.[13]
Virtu has offices in New York City (headquarters), Austin, Dublin, and Singapore.[14] It expanded its European headquarters to Dublin in September, 2013.[15] Virtu Financial Ireland Limited is regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland.
Mergers and acquisitions[edit]
In May 2011, Virtu merged with proprietary trading firm Madison Tyler based in Santa Monica, California[16][17] with the backing of Silver Lake Partners, a technology focused private equity firm.[18] Vincent Viola co-founded Madison Tyler with David Salomon, a former arbitrage trader at Goldman Sachs.
Virtu acquired a market-making unit that handles NYSE Amex stocks from Cohen Capital Group LLC in December 2011. The purchase made Virtu the largest overseer of trading in shares listed on Amex, known as the American Stock Exchange before NYSE Euronext bought it for $260 million in 2008. The deal gave Virtu a designated market-maker license for New York Stock Exchange companies. With the acquisition, some of the companies Virtu was able to trade and support included New Gold Inc., Northern Oil & Gas Inc., and the American depositary receipts of British American Tobacco Plc.[19]
In September 2012, Virtu acquired the exchange-traded fund (ETF) market maker assets of Nyenburgh Holding B.V., a high-frequency trader in European ETFs.[14]
In April 2017, Virtu agreed to pay US$1.4 billion in cash to purchase rival market making firm KCG Holdings. [20]
IPO plans[edit]
Virtu Financial initially planned to go public in the first week of April 2014, then postponed its initial public offering by at least a week. At the time, prospective investors advised to wait and "let the storm pass", a reference to recent scrutiny concerning HFT practices. Later in April 2014, the company decided to ultimately postpone the IPO without specifying a new date, making the timing of a potential public offering unknown.[7] In its IPO plans, Virtu sought a valuation of about $3 billion. The IPO had been reported to make Vincent Viola the first high-frequency trading billionaire.[21] While Virtu declined to comment, Reuters reported in November 2014 that sources say Virtu Financial hopes to go public in the spring of 2015.[22] On April 15, 2015 Virtu Financial successfully priced its IPO[8] which began trading on NASDAQ on April 16, 2015.
Secondary Offering: On November 12th, 2015 Virtu Financial Inc priced a secondary public offering of 6,473,371 shares of its Class A common stock by Virtu and certain selling stockholders affiliated with Silver Lake Partners. The selling stockholders sold 6,075,837 shares of Class A common stock and Virtu offered 397,534 shares of its Class A common stock at a price to the public of $22.15 per share.
Trading activity[edit]
Virtu operates on more than 235 exchanges, markets and dark pools in 36 countries.[6] Some of these exchanges include NYSE Euronext, NASDAQ and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. The company is a designated market maker on the NYSE and NYSE Amex. Virtu makes markets by providing passive quotations to buyers and sellers in more than 12,000 securities and other financial instruments.[6]
On August 28, 2014, Virtu Financial, along with London-based GSA Capital, executed the first trades on ParFX Prime, a foreign exchange trading platform. Unlike most exchanges and trading venues, ParFX's matching engine does not adhere to the principle of price-time priority. Instead, ParFX subjects all orders to random pauses of about 20 to 80 milliseconds, trying to provide a more level playing field.[23]
When filing for its IPO in March 2014, it was disclosed that during five years Virtu Financial made profit 1,277 out of 1,278 days, losing money just one day.[24]
Gregory Laughlin, astrophysicist and department chairman at the University of California, Santa Cruz, researched Virtu's trading activity.[25] In the debate about its near-perfect trading record,[24] Virtu said that it wins 51 percent or 52 percent of its trades, leading most people to figure the remainder are losses.[25] In his research, Laughlin showed that "the number of its trades that break even are about the same as its losses" which means the HFT firm's per-trade losing percentage is only 24 instead of 48, indicating Virtu assumes little market risk.[25]
Investigations[edit]
In April 2014, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman sent Virtu a letter seeking information on its HFT practices, asking about special arrangements with dark pools and exchanges, the company's trading strategies and whether Virtu practices latency arbitrage, a high-frequency activity considered to be front running.[26]
In July 2014, Reuters reported the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was seeking information on ten HFT firms with broker-dealer licenses, including Virtu Financial, as part of an ongoing investigation into predatory trading strategies.[27] The SEC's probe focuses on abuse of order types and abusive trading like layering or spoofing, a tactic intended to trick investors into buying or selling a stock at unfavorable prices.[27]
John McCrank of Reuters noted that scrutiny around high-frequency trading intensified after the release of Michael Lewis' best-selling book Flash Boys: A Wall Street Revolt in March 2014.[27]

The IPO had been reported to make Vincent Viola the first high-frequency trading billionaire.[21] While Virtu declined to comment, Reuters reported in November 2014 that sources say Virtu Financial hopes to go public in the spring of 2015.[22] On April 15, 2015 Virtu Financial successfully priced its IPO[8] which began trading on NASDAQ on April 16, 2015.
Secondary Offering: On November 12th, 2015 Virtu Financial Inc priced a secondary public offering of 6,473,371 shares of its Class A common stock by Virtu and certain selling stockholders affiliated with Silver Lake Partners. The selling stockholders sold 6,075,837 shares of Class A common stock and Virtu offered 397,534 shares of its Class A common stock at a price to the public of $22.15 per share.
Trading activity[edit]
Virtu operates on more than 235 exchanges, markets and dark pools in 36 countries.[6] Some of these exchanges include NYSE Euronext, NASDAQ and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. The company is a designated market maker on the NYSE and NYSE Amex. Virtu makes markets by providing passive quotations to buyers and sellers in more than 12,000 securities and other financial instruments.[6]
On August 28, 2014, Virtu Financial, along with London-based GSA Capital, executed the first trades on ParFX Prime, a foreign exchange trading platform. Unlike most exchanges and trading venues, ParFX's matching engine does not adhere to the principle of price-time priority. Instead, ParFX subjects all orders to random pauses of about 20 to 80 milliseconds, trying to provide a more level playing field.[23]
When filing for its IPO in March 2014, it was disclosed that during five years Virtu Financial made profit 1,277 out of 1,278 days, losing money just one day.[24]
Gregory Laughlin, astrophysicist and department chairman at the University of California, Santa Cruz, researched Virtu's trading activity.[25] In the debate about its near-perfect trading record,[24] Virtu said that it wins 51 percent or 52 percent of its trades, leading most people to figure the remainder are losses.[25] In his research, Laughlin showed that "the number of its trades that break even are about the same as its losses" which means the HFT firm's per-trade losing percentage is only 24 instead of 48, indicating Virtu assumes little market risk.[25]
Investigations[edit]
In April 2014, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman sent Virtu a letter seeking information on its HFT practices, asking about special arrangements with dark pools and exchanges, the company's trading strategies and whether Virtu practices latency arbitrage, a high-frequency activity considered to be front running.[26]
In July 2014, Reuters reported the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was seeking information on ten HFT firms with broker-dealer licenses, including Virtu Financial, as part of an ongoing investigation into predatory trading strategies.[27] The SEC's probe focuses on abuse of order types and abusive trading like layering or spoofing, a tactic intended to trick investors into buying or selling a stock at unfavorable prices.[27]
John McCrank of Reuters noted that scrutiny around high-frequency trading intensified after the release of Michael Lewis' best-selling book Flash Boys: A Wall Street Revolt in March 2014.[27]

Virtu Financial is one of the largest high-frequency trading[1][2] (HFT) and market making firms. It provides two-sided quotations and trades in equities, commodities, currencies, options, fixed income, and other securities on over 230 exchanges, markets, and dark pools.[4] Virtu uses proprietary high-frequency trading[1][2] strategies based on big data[5] to trade large volumes of securities. On March 10, 2014, Virtu Financial filed for its initial public offering,[6] yet repeatedly delayed its IPO.[7] On April 15, 2015 Virtu Financial successfully priced its IPO[8] which began trading as a NASDAQ-listed public company on April 16, 2015.

Organization[edit]
Based in New York City, Virtu was founded by Vincent Viola, a former chairman of the New York Mercantile Exchange and current owner of the Florida Panthers.[9] Douglas Cifu, Virtu’s CEO since October 2013, co-founded Virtu with Viola in 2008. Cifu is also a co-owner of the Florida Panthers with Viola and serves as the Panthers’ alternate governor. Prior to co-founding Virtu, Cifu was a partner at the international law firm of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP, where he practiced corporate law from 1990 to 2008.
The company suggested standards for electronic firms that call themselves market makers. Virtu believes market makers should be obligated to quote at or near the inside of the national best bid and offer throughout the day and quote at various price points in a number of different securities.[10][11] Virtu was ranked as one of the five largest high-frequency traders of equities in Europe in 2011.[12]
In November 2014, Reuters reported that Chris Concannon, president and chief operating officer at Virtu Financial, will succeed William O'Brien as president of BATS Global Markets, a trading venue that was founded by high-frequency traders.[13]
Virtu has offices in New York City (headquarters), Austin, Dublin, and Singapore.[14] It expanded its European headquarters to Dublin in September, 2013.[15] Virtu Financial Ireland Limited is regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland.
Mergers and acquisitions[edit]
In May 2011, Virtu merged with proprietary trading firm Madison Tyler based in Santa Monica, California[16][17] with the backing of Silver Lake Partners, a technology focused private equity firm.[18] Vincent Viola co-founded Madison Tyler with David Salomon, a former arbitrage trader at Goldman Sachs.
Virtu acquired a market-making unit that handles NYSE Amex stocks from Cohen Capital Group LLC in December 2011. The purchase made Virtu the largest overseer of trading in shares listed on Amex, known as the American Stock Exchange before NYSE Euronext bought it for $260 million in 2008. The deal gave Virtu a designated market-maker license for New York Stock Exchange companies. With the acquisition, some of the companies Virtu was able to trade and support included New Gold Inc., Northern Oil & Gas Inc., and the American depositary receipts of British American Tobacco Plc.[19]
In September 2012, Virtu acquired the exchange-traded fund (ETF) market maker assets of Nyenburgh Holding B.V., a high-frequency trader in European ETFs.[14]
In April 2017, Virtu agreed to pay US$1.4 billion in cash to purchase rival market making firm KCG Holdings. [20]
IPO plans[edit]
Virtu Financial initially planned to go public in the first week of April 2014, then postponed its initial public offering by at least a week. At the time, prospective investors advised to wait and "let the storm pass", a reference to recent scrutiny concerning HFT practices. Later in April 2014, the company decided to ultimately postpone the IPO without specifying a new date, making the timing of a potential public offering unknown.[7] In its IPO plans, Virtu sought a valuation of about $3 billion. The IPO had been reported to make Vincent Viola the first high-frequency trading billionaire.[21] While Virtu declined to comment, Reuters reported in November 2014 that sources say Virtu Financial hopes to go public in the spring of 2015.[22] On April 15, 2015 Virtu Financial successfully priced its IPO[8] which began trading on NASDAQ on April 16, 2015.
Secondary Offering: On November 12th, 2015 Virtu Financial Inc priced a secondary public offering of 6,473,371 shares of its Class A common stock by Virtu and certain selling stockholders affiliated with Silver Lake Partners. The selling stockholders sold 6,075,837 shares of Class A common stock and Virtu offered 397,534 shares of its Class A common stock at a price to the public of $22.15 per share.
Trading activity[edit]
Virtu operates on more than 235 exchanges, markets and dark pools in 36 countries.[6] Some of these exchanges include NYSE Euronext, NASDAQ and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. The company is a designated market maker on the NYSE and NYSE Amex. Virtu makes markets by providing passive quotations to buyers and sellers in more than 12,000 securities and other financial instruments.[6]
On August 28, 2014, Virtu Financial, along with London-based GSA Capital, executed the first trades on ParFX Prime, a foreign exchange trading platform. Unlike most exchanges and trading venues, ParFX's matching engine does not adhere to the principle of price-time priority. Instead, ParFX subjects all orders to random pauses of about 20 to 80 milliseconds, trying to provide a more level playing field.[23]

The purchase made Virtu the largest overseer of trading in shares listed on Amex, known as the American Stock Exchange before NYSE Euronext bought it for $260 million in 2008. The deal gave Virtu a designated market-maker license for New York Stock Exchange companies. With the acquisition, some of the companies Virtu was able to trade and support included New Gold Inc., Northern Oil & Gas Inc., and the American depositary receipts of British American Tobacco Plc.[19]
In September 2012, Virtu acquired the exchange-traded fund (ETF) market maker assets of Nyenburgh Holding B.V., a high-frequency trader in European ETFs.[14]
In April 2017, Virtu agreed to pay US$1.4 billion in cash to purchase rival market making firm KCG Holdings. [20]
IPO plans[edit]
Virtu Financial initially planned to go public in the first week of April 2014, then postponed its initial public offering by at least a week. At the time, prospective investors advised to wait and "let the storm pass", a reference to recent scrutiny concerning HFT practices. Later in April 2014, the company decided to ultimately postpone the IPO without specifying a new date, making the timing of a potential public offering unknown.[7] In its IPO plans, Virtu sought a valuation of about $3 billion. The IPO had been reported to make Vincent Viola the first high-frequency trading billionaire.[21] While Virtu declined to comment, Reuters reported in November 2014 that sources say Virtu Financial hopes to go public in the spring of 2015.[22] On April 15, 2015 Virtu Financial successfully priced its IPO[8] which began trading on NASDAQ on April 16, 2015.
Secondary Offering: On November 12th, 2015 Virtu Financial Inc priced a secondary public offering of 6,473,371 shares of its Class A common stock by Virtu and certain selling stockholders affiliated with Silver Lake Partners. The selling stockholders sold 6,075,837 shares of Class A common stock and Virtu offered 397,534 shares of its Class A common stock at a price to the public of $22.15 per share.
Trading activity[edit]
Virtu operates on more than 235 exchanges, markets and dark pools in 36 countries.[6] Some of these exchanges include NYSE Euronext, NASDAQ and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. The company is a designated market maker on the NYSE and NYSE Amex. Virtu makes markets by providing passive quotations to buyers and sellers in more than 12,000 securities and other financial instruments.[6]
On August 28, 2014, Virtu Financial, along with London-based GSA Capital, executed the first trades on ParFX Prime, a foreign exchange trading platform. Unlike most exchanges and trading venues, ParFX's matching engine does not adhere to the principle of price-time priority. Instead, ParFX subjects all orders to random pauses of about 20 to 80 milliseconds, trying to provide a more level playing field.[23]
When filing for its IPO in March 2014, it was disclosed that during five years Virtu Financial made profit 1,277 out of 1,278 days, losing money just one day.[24]
Gregory Laughlin, astrophysicist and department chairman at the University of California, Santa Cruz, researched Virtu's trading activity.[25] In the debate about its near-perfect trading record,[24] Virtu said that it wins 51 percent or 52 percent of its trades, leading most people to figure the remainder are losses.[25] In his research, Laughlin showed that "the number of its trades that break even are about the same as its losses" which means the HFT firm's per-trade losing percentage is only 24 instead of 48, indicating Virtu assumes little market risk.[25]
Investigations[edit]
In April 2014, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman sent Virtu a letter seeking information on its HFT practices, asking about special arrangements with dark pools and exchanges, the company's trading strategies and whether Virtu practices latency arbitrage, a high-frequency activity considered to be front running.[26]
In July 2014, Reuters reported the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was seeking information on ten HFT firms with broker-dealer licenses, including Virtu Financial, as part of an ongoing investigation into predatory trading strategies.[27] The SEC's probe focuses on abuse of order types and abusive trading like layering or spoofing, a tactic intended to trick investors into buying or selling a stock at unfavorable prices.[27]
John McCrank of Reuters noted that scrutiny around high-frequency trading intensified after the release of Michael Lewis' best-selling book Flash Boys: A Wall Street Revolt in March 2014.[27]

Dutch Firm IMC Financial Markets to Buy Goldman Sachs’s NYSE Floor-Trading Business

Bradley Hope and Justin Baer broke the news that IMC Financial Markets, a Dutch high-speed trading firm, agreed to acquire Goldman Sachs’s rights to operate as a designated market maker in more than 600 NYSE-listed stocks.
The story as it appeared on Dow Jones:
May 21, 2014, 7:59 PM EDT – Dutch Firm IMC Financial Markets to Buy Goldman Sachs’s NYSE Floor-Trading Business
7:59 PM EDT: IMC-Goldman Deal Terms Not Disclosed; Sources Peg Price Under $30 Million
8:00 PM EDT: Dutch Firm to Buy Goldman Sachs NYSE Floor Trading Business
By Bradley Hope and Justin Baer
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is ceding most of its ground on the New York Stock Exchange’s trading floor.
IMC Financial Markets, a Dutch high-speed trading firm, agreed on Wednesday to acquire Goldman’s rights to operate as a designated market maker in more than 600 NYSE-listed stocks, according to Scott Knudsen, IMC’s Chicago-based head of trading. IMC will also hire about 15 floor brokers from the Wall Street firm.
The sale marks a retreat for Goldman on the NYSE floor, though it plans to remain a broker there executing trades on behalf of clients. Goldman originally acquired the trading business as part of its $6.5 billion purchase of Spear, Leeds & Kellogg LP in 2000.
One of the key factors in market-making profitability is scale–operating on dozens of exchanges around the world, handling significant trading volumes. As an electronic market-maker with a presence on 90 exchanges around the world, IMC will be positioned to expand the amount of volume it handles at one of the biggest and most-storied trading venues in the U.S.
At the time of Goldman’s SLK purchase, before electronic trading and new rules turned the way stocks are bought and sold on its head, market-makers, then called specialists, played a more central role in trading.
Terms of the IMC purchase weren’t disclosed, but people familiar with the deal said the price was under $30 million. The Wall Street Journal reported in April that IMC was in talks to acquire the business.
Electronic market-makers use high-speed connections and advanced computer algorithms to provide liquidity in certain stocks. The firms offer “two-sided quotes,” meaning they are consistently available to buy and sell shares of companies at certain prices. They seek to capture the spread between the bids and asks on those stocks, tiny profits that can add up to millions of dollars if the firms do enough volume.
The acquisition will provide a boost to IMC’s equities market-making business, said Mr. Knudsen. IMC has traditionally been a major player in options market-making, but has increased its presence in other asset classes over the past years, he said.
“We’ve become a big player in equities, but we have room to grow,” he said. ”This acquisition is part of that.”
IMC is also expecting to take a more public role in discussions about high-frequency trading and market structure, Mr. Knudsen said.
Regulators and investigative authorities have opened several probes into trading practices recently and some officials have called for a broader review of how the markets work in light of issues surrounding high-speed trading.
The New York Attorney General has categorized some practices as “Insider Trading 2.0,” arguing that some firms were using loopholes to unfairly gain access to information before ordinary investors.
The publication on March 31 of “Flash Boys,” a chronicle of a group of traders who built an alternative exchange designed to level the playing field between “fast” traders and big investors, has also energized discussions. Author Michael Lewis described the U.S. stock market as being “rigged” in favor of high-frequency traders, exchanges and big banks.
Mr. Knudsen said he was in favor of reducing complexity in the marketplace, pointing out that investors didn’t need more than 50 venues to execute trades. ”We support the SEC’s data-driven approach to these issues,” he said.
As the markets have come to be dominated by electronic traders since the turn of the century, market-making has become a major business for high-frequency trading firms.
Other major market-makers at the New York Stock Exchange are Virtu Financial Capital Markets LLC, a high-frequency trading firm, and KCG Holdings Inc., the product of a merger between the high-frequency trading firm Getco and Knight Capital Group in 2013.
Their arrivals on the NYSE floor came about in a similar manner to IMC. Getco bought Bank of America Corp.’s market-making business and Virtu bought a similar business from Cohen Capital Group in 2011.
The strategies can be highly profitable. Virtu said in its IPO prospectus that it had “only one losing trading day” over a period of 1,238 trading days. The firm reported a net income of $182.2 million on revenue of $623.7 million last year, according to the prospectus.

Investor Relations








Virtu is a leading technology-enabled market maker and liquidity provider to the global financial markets. We stand ready, at any time, to buy or sell a broad range of securities and other financial instruments, and we generate revenue by buying and selling securities and other financial instruments and earning small amounts of money on individual transactions based on the difference between what buyers are willing to pay and what sellers are willing to accept, which we refer to as ‘‘bid/ask spreads,’’ across a large volume of transactions. We make markets by providing quotations to buyers and sellers in more than 12,000 securities and other financial instruments on more than 235 unique exchanges, markets and liquidity pools in 36 countries around the world. We believe that our broad diversification, in combination with our proprietary technology platform and low-cost structure, enables us to facilitate risk transfer between global capital markets participants by supplying liquidity and competitive pricing while at the same time earning attractive margins and returns.
