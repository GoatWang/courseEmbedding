Great Ajax: Short In The Making - Great Ajax Corp (NYSE:AJX) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Great Ajax: Short In The MakingJul.21.16 | About: Great Ajax (AJX) Jan Svenda Contrarian, event-driven, Deep Value, long/short equitySummaryAJX is an mREIT focused on low-quality mortgages mainly originated during the financials crisis. I believe the market is not realizing the company’s risks; thus, downside is significant.The company is reporting a non-cash profit, while actually in cash loss. The management is using dubious accretable accounting (based solely on the management’s expectations) to arrive at the ‘profit’.The company then pays out a dividend on this non-cash profit triggering the need for additional cash. The company thus got itself into a vicious circle of raising cash.The company structure and management is full of conflict of interests and dubious history, topped with the CEO being a convicted criminal (filed a fraudulent tax report).All this is happening while the company is exempt from being audited on its financial controls as the company is labeled as ‘emerging growth company’ under the JOBS Act.Great Ajax Corp. (NYSE:AJX) is a mortgage REIT (mREIT) that is specifically focused on acquiring non-performing mortgages (NPL) and re-performing mortgages (RPL) in the US. NPL is a loan where the borrower did not pay any installments in the last seven months. RPL is a loan where the borrower paid at least five out of the last seven months, although this segment can include several exemptions (such as a loan where the borrower only paid the latest instalment, but AJX arrived at an 'agreement' with the borrower). Once it acquires these loans at a discount, it services them through a third-party and profit from the interest income from these loans. It can also potentially benefit from a foreclosure as it then can rent out or sell the underlying property. The company was incorporated in early 2014, when it bought its first loan portfolio, which was funded through private placements. Shortly thereafter, the company had an IPO and started to trade on the stock market in early 2015. The company has no employees and is managed by Thetis Asset Management, a related third-party entity. The loans are serviced by Gregory Funding LLC, a related third-party entity.
 The current portfolio is segmented in the following way (taken from company data); 

 With the following state of delinquencies: 

 The majority of these loans were originated during the period of 2006-08 as can be seen below. 

 Finally, 51% of unpaid principal balance (UPB) is tied to mortgages with fixed rates, 17% is tied to adjustable rates and 32% is tied to hybrid adjustable rates. The latter two products helped to trigger the financial crisis in 2008/09 and are susceptible to interest rate moves. The company believes that while the nature of these loans is highly risky, it is able to select the right portfolio due to its 'proprietary' models, which are able to forecast which loans are most likely to be repaid. Moreover, it also believes that through servicing of these loans, it will be able to 'support' continuous and new payments from the borrowers. I believe that the stock's risks completely outweigh any reward due to the points raised in the summary points, and that the stock is a candidate for a short position if the negative trends continue. Specifically, I believe that the company might need to keep on raising cash through equity offerings. The cash deficit that arises because of the way the company reports its profit is not going to be eradicated anytime soon. The company now holds roughly $53 million in cash while the deficit last year was $73 million. The management does not seem to convey that they would decrease their acquisition activity, which could then mean that the deficit in FY2016 might be similar and the company might need to perform another equity offering at the end of the year.
 In this article, I will only cover the financial aspect of the company. The management and company structure will be part of another installment. Regulatory Exemptions under JOBS Act I believe that the overarching issue of the company is that no one can really know whether its reporting is rigorous enough and whether it is consistent with other public companies. The reason for this is that the company was able to label itself as an 'emerging growth company' under the 'Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act. This law was primarily aimed at reducing the regulatory burden imposed by Sarbanes-Oxley for 'small' newcomer public companies with revenues under $1 billion. The most significant exemption is from the Section 404 (b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Under this exemption, AJX does not need to have a process of internal control over its financial reporting and is exempt from the mandatory auditing of these controls. This means that the company is under zero scrutiny over its accounting methods, and while it is still audited at the end, the company is able to arrive at the statements through its own unaudited reporting methods. The company will most likely continue to be exempt from this for the next 4 years. This is obviously posing a risk for the investors as the management can potentially manipulate their statements. This risk is further enhanced in the case of AJX as the CEO previously had an issue with the law regarding fraudulent tax reporting and as the business is handling low-quality mortgage loans where the value of the loans is arrived at through numerous assumptions. These assumptions are completely at management's discretion and thus investors are left to only 'believe' in what the company is doing. Again, AJX is taking this risk further as it states that it uses its own 'proprietary' models that help it in its investment decisions as seen below:    Unlike other loan acquirers, who often rely on pooled estimates in analyzing and pricing portfolios, our Manager uses proprietary models and data developed by its affiliates to evaluate individual assets and to help determine cities, neighborhoods and properties that it believes will experience home price appreciation, or HPA. These proprietary analytics have inputs for economic and demographic data that include changes in unemployment rates, median household incomes, housing starts, crime rates, education, electoral participation and other variables that we believe closely correlate to property values. Source: 10K FY2015 
 Another example of this risk is the fact that the company does not use FICO scores to determine creditworthiness of the borrowers, but rather it uses its own assumptions. I am always extremely skeptical of such statements as the management is saying that they know better than anyone else and can 'outperform' the market via their own models. These statements would at least pose a smaller amount of risk if the company needed to comply with Sarbanes-Oxley regulation, but because the company is exempt from this, the investors can't be certain about the way the company reports and presents its financial statements. I believe this creates a fundamental challenge to any argument that would support this stock. Company is reporting a net income, while actually at a cash loss The second most important issue is that the company seems to be making money, but that profit is predominantly based on an accretable yield accounting for interest income from loans, where the borrowers are not paying their interest on time. The company actually lost money every single quarter since its IPO, and this is unlikely to rapidly change. The management is not transparent enough about this fact and mentions only that they use this method, not that the company is, in cash terms, in a loss. I can utilize a simple scenario to showcase the issues with this accounting method. Bank X originates a loan of $10 million with a 5% interest rate and a maturity of 10 years. Say that the loan goes bad and the borrower can't pay (for simplicity in the very beginning). The bank wants to get rid of this 'non-performing' loan (due to capital controls etc.) and finds a buyer, AJX. Instead of paying $10 million, AJX buys the loan at a discount as there is a risk that the face value of the loan is not going to be recovered. The company also forecasts the expected recovered amount after the loan matures, so that it can warehouse the loan on its books. This is just an opinion about a future event based on modeling. Let's say, that AJX buys the loan for $5 million and expects to recover $7 million at the maturity (in 10 years).
 Now common sense would dictate that the company should only incur the interest income that is actually receiving in cash from the borrower, but because there is an accounting standard, FAS ASC 310-30, the company can do the following. AJX can report an accretable interest income of $0.2 million each year, regardless of the fact if the borrower is paying or not. This income is then bundled with the real cash interest that the company receives from other loans and is reported on the income statement. The value of the interest is derived from the difference of the acquisition cost and the expected recovery value ($7m-$5m = $2m), which is spread out over the period until maturity ($2m/10 years = $0.2m). This then makes the company's profit larger, but it does not in any way reflect the reality of the situation as the profit is completely based on the management's expectations. This issue is even more pressing when the management's expectations are not sufficiently audited as mentioned previously. Finally, if the management is ever wrong and the actual recovery value of the loans will end up lower than its forecast, it will need to impair the difference, which would not be unusual when dealing with low-quality loans. We can see that if we remove AJX's accretable component and just leave the real cash interest, the company was losing money in each period since the IPO.   Period Income (in 000's) Non Cash Accretion Adjusted Net Income   FY2014 $3,750 $(4,098) $(348)   FY2015 $25,792 $(30,936) $(5,144)   Q1 2016 $7,963 $(9,004) $(1,041)   Source: Company Data The company does not disclose this reality in any way apart from a footnote, which segments the interest income, but does not show that the company is in a loss. The only time that the company mentioned the impact of this accounting was in its IPO prospectus. Since then, the company only discloses the accounting policy and scarce footnotes, but does not showcase the implications. In the IPO prospectus, the company also mentioned that the 'phantom' income, as it calls it, should decrease over time as the borrowers are expected to start repaying the loans. This has been happening on a limited scale. I also believe that due to the fact that the company is likely to keep on acquiring new loans, the decrease will be small and thus a significant portion of the company's revenue is likely to keep on being non-cash, or in other words, non-existent. Below, you can see the actual state of the proportion for every quarter.
 

 Source: Company Data I believe that the proportional jump in Q2 of 2015 is connected to the fact that the company acquired a significant amount of new loans, which might have spurred an increase in the phantom income. Vice versa, in Q1 of 2016, the company bought a substantially lower number of loans, and thus the phantom income slightly decreased. Although it still constitutes over 50% of the income, which is definitely not sustainable. The main impact of this is on the business model, which I will cover in the next two sections. REIT status & dividends The fact that the company reports an income is then triggering the need to pay dividends, as the company is operating as a REIT and is obliged to pay at least 90% of its profits in dividends to shareholders. This means that the company created a liquidity issue for itself as it needs to raise additional cash from outside its operating activity. One can also see this as a corporate governance issue. I will cover the aspect of the management in the second article, but just as an example, the CEO, Mr. Mendelsohn, holds 3.1% in his name and thus receives dividends, which were paid only because the company uses accretable interest. This dividend is on top of his compensation as the CEO of Ajax, and interestingly enough as a manager of Thetis, the 'third-party' manager of Ajax. He is also connected to the servicer of AJX's loans, Gregory Funding LLC. This means that the insiders are able to take out additional cash from the company at the expense of the entity's liquidity as the pay-outs act as a strain on the operational cash flow. The need for cash Because the company will need to keep on paying dividends on a non-existent income, it will also need to keep on raising cash in order to sustain its operations. But because the company is also acquiring an increasing number of loans (management mentioned at least two new acquisitions during the Q1 conf. call), the phantom income will keep a strain on the cash flow.
 This then creates a vicious circle whereby the more loans the company has, the more phantom income it should potentially generate, if it is to be consistent in its accounting and the company buys loans of similar quality, which it did so far. This, in turn, increases the dividend payouts. This then increases the deficit in cash and the circle turns again. The expenses of the company are also creating a strain as the related party fees (for 'servicing' and 'management') are based on book value and the amount of loans held by the company, thus the expenses are only going to increase as the company will acquire more loans. While the company does securitize a portion of its assets, this is not creating enough cash flow as the company is acquiring increasing number of loans. Therefore, the securitized assets that are not used for REPO agreements and are sold to other investors are only used to fund these acquisitions, not to decrease the deficit. Therefore, the company has only two ways to break this cycle. And only one of those is actually within the capability of the management, which is of course to perform equity offerings. Unsurprisingly, the company already did one in June, which raised $30 million. The company also prepared itself for potential further offerings as it has a shelf offering for $120 million ready to be triggered whenever the management wants. Even the group of insider shareholders has their own shelf offering, which constitutes that they can offload their stake at any time. The other way for the company to break the cycle is to actually see increasing amount of real cash interest coming in, which would lower the amount of phantom income and the deficit would start being manageable and eventually would go to zero, which is the only way for the company to sustain its operations without the need for extra cash. This though completely relies on the strength of US economy, which needs to support the borrowers and on the management's investment decisions as they 'selected' the loans that they think are going to be repaid.
 The former is arguably 'improving', but if the Fed raises interest rates, the strength of the borrower could crumble fast as almost 50% of AJX's loans have floating interest rates. The latter can't even be scrutinized as the management is not transparent enough and therefore the investors just have to believe in what the management is doing. This, I believe, is not a satisfactory argument when the CEO is a convicted criminal, and the crime actually involved similar low-quality loans operated by Wilshire Financials. Now these company risks (macro risk and loan quality) are not unusual when looking at a mREIT, but the difference between AJX and others (apart from New Residential Investment Corp. (NYSE:NRZ), which is actually in loss as well due to the usage of accretable yield) is that AJX is completely reliant on borrowers repaying their loans, otherwise it can't ever get rid of the cash deficit. Therefore, the investors that are long are making a 'leveraged' bet on the US economy and the skill of AJX's management. Likelihood of future equity offering As one can't really know whether the company will be able to decrease its phantom income in the coming quarters, we need to look at the company's deficit to get a sense of the likelihood of next equity offering. Last year, the company had a cash deficit (or cash outflow) of $22 million or $73.4 million, if we do not include the IPO proceeds. One possible way to assess the situation is to roughly estimate if the yearly deficit might be similar in this year by looking at the number of acquisitions that the company is doing. Because if the size of the deals is going to be similar, then we can expect similar securitization schedule, similar phantom income proportion and thus a similar deficit of $73 million in FY2016. The company acquired $347 million worth of loans in FY2015. In Q1, the company was in $7 million deficit, which was lower than the historical average (of $18.3 million per quarter) because of a lower number of loan acquisitions as the company paid only $37.2 million for new loans as opposed to the average of $86 million per quarter in FY2015. Although, during the Q1 conference, the company mentioned that it has done two deals in April and May, which totaled $60.2 million, which is slightly 'compensating' for the slower first quarter. Thus the company is looking at $97.2 million loans acquired for the first five months, which is slightly lower than in 2015, where on average, it acquired $142 million of new loans.
 The management though said that US banks are going to start offloading significant portions of their 're-performing' loans in the next two years to meet the increased capital controls and thus the company expects that it could see a similar amount of deals (as in April and May) going forward. Thus, if the current acquisition streak is unbroken and continues at a similar pace, the deficit would likely be somewhere around $50.2 million. I arrived at this figure by taking the total of acquisitions in 2016 in proportion with the average of the same period from 2015 ($97.2/$142=68% -> $73.4*0.68 = $50.2). The company now has roughly $53 million in cash (including the June offering). Therefore, it might be likely that the company would need another equity offering in late Q4 as the cash position would start to dwindle yet again. Although I understand that this is just a rough estimate of the situation and I have not accounted for many variables (phantom income, securitization etc.) that could significantly change the picture. I just wanted to showcase the current situation in one possible perspective. I will update this likelihood as soon as we will get more information about Q2, which should be most likely on Tuesday, the 2nd of August. Conclusion Notwithstanding the fact that the company could further dilute shareholders, I believe that the market is not properly accounting for the other risks present in the stock. The shares are trading at around the book value and despite the equity offering in June the share price is holding up. 

 Furthermore, when we compare the price to book value and dividend yield of other similar mREITs, it shows that the market seems to be slightly irrational as it accepts significantly more risk, but lower dividend yield when it acquires a stock of AJX.
 

 Thus depending on what the company reports in Q2, the stock could be a short candidate if the following negative trends continue.  The phantom income continues to constitute a large portion of the interest income, which spurs the company to pay out dividends without actually having earned some of its profits. The company continues to acquire a significant amount of new loans, which would maintain the deficit at a similar proportion to last year and the company's cash deficit could be similar to that of 2015, which might trigger a need for additional equity offering.

Great Ajax Corp. Commences Initial Public Offering

Feb 03, 2015, 08:00 ET
		  		  					
						 from   Great Ajax Corp. 











 
















































 

 




















 


NEW YORK, Feb. 3, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Great Ajax Corp., a Maryland corporation that intends to qualify and elect to be taxed as a real estate investment trust for the year ended December 31, 2014 and that focuses primarily on acquiring, investing in and managing a portfolio of re-performing and non-performing mortgage loans secured by single-family residences and, to a lesser extent, of single-family properties, announced today that it commenced the roadshow for its initial public offering. The offering is for 5,385,000 shares of common stock.  Great Ajax is offering 4,375,000 shares of common stock and the selling stockholders are offering 1,460,000 shares of common stock.  Great Ajax and one selling stockholder have also granted the underwriters an option to acquire up to an aggregate of 875,250 additional shares of our common stock, of which Great Ajax would sell up to 834,917 shares of our common stock, to cover over-allotments, if any.  The initial public offering price is currently expected to be between $15.00 and $17.00 per share.  Great Ajax has been approved to list its common stock on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "AJX," subject to official notice of issuance.
Great Ajax expects to use the net proceeds of the offering to acquire additional mortgage loans and mortgage-related assets and for general corporate purposes.
FBR Capital Markets & Co. is acting as lead book-running manager for the proposed offering. Sterne, Agee & Leach, Inc. and Nomura Securities International, Inc. are acting as joint book-running managers and Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc. and MLV&Co. LLC are acting as co-managers.
The offering will be made only by means of a prospectus.  A copy of the preliminary prospectus for the offering may be obtained by contacting FBR Capital Markets & Co., Prospectus Department, 1300 North 17th Street, Suite 1400, Arlington, Virginia 22209, (703) 312-9726 or Prospectuses@FBR.com.
A registration statement relating to these securities has been filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission but has not yet become effective.  These securities may not be sold nor may offers to buy be accepted prior to the time the registration statement becomes effective.  This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy, nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to their registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state or jurisdiction. 
About Great Ajax Corp.
Great Ajax Corp. is a Maryland corporation that focuses primarily on acquiring, investing in and managing mortgage loans secured by single-family residences and, to a lesser extent, single-family properties themselves.  We also invest in loans secured by multi-family residential and smaller commercial mixed use retail/residential properties, as well as in the properties directly.  We are externally managed by Thetis Asset Management LLC, a recently formed Aspen Capital-affiliated entity.  Our mortgage loans and other real estate assets are serviced by Gregory Funding LLC, an Aspen Capital-affiliated entity.  We expect to qualify and elect to be taxed as a real estate investment trust under the Internal Revenue Code for the year ended December 31, 2014.
Forward-Looking Statements
This press release contains certain forward-looking statements, including statements with regard to Great Ajax's proposed securities offering.  Words such as "believes," "intends," "expects," "projects," "anticipates," and "future" or similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements.  These forward-looking statements are subject to the inherent uncertainties in predicting future results and conditions and no assurance can be given that the proposed securities offering discussed above will be consummated on the terms described or at all.  Completion of the proposed securities offering and the terms thereof are subject to numerous factors, many of which are beyond the control of Great Ajax, including, without limitation, market conditions, failure of customary closing conditions and the risk factors and other matters set forth in Great Ajax's registration statement on Form S-11 filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  Great Ajax undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required by law.

Great Ajax Corp is an externally managed real estate investment 
trust (REIT) that acquires, invests and manages a portfolio of mortgage loans secured 
by single- family residences and single-family properties. We also invest in loans 
secured by multi-family residential and commercial mixed use retail/residential 
properties. In addition, we hold real-estate owned (REO) properties acquired upon 
the foreclosure, other settlement of our owned non-performing loans, or that we 
acquire in the market. These are principally single-family homes, although we also 
own smaller commercial properties. We opportunistically determine whether to sell 
any REO asset, sometimes offering mortgage financing to the purchaser, or to hold 
the REO as a rental property. We believe that our tailored approach to each asset 
we acquire will generate attractive risk-adjusted returns for our stockholders over 
the long term through dividends and capital appreciation. 

We were incorporated in Maryland on January 30, 2014. We conduct substantially all 
of our business through our operating partnership, Great Ajax Operating Partnership 
LP, a wholly owned Delaware limited partnership, and its subsidiaries. We are the 
sole general partner of the operating partnership. We elect to be taxed as a REIT 
for federal income tax purposes, beginning with our taxable year ending December 
31, 2014. Our qualification as a REIT will depend upon our ability to meet, on a 
continuing basis, various complex requirements under the Internal Revenue Code relating 
to, among other things, the sources of our gross income, the composition and values 
of our assets, our distribution levels and the diversity of ownership of our capital 
stock. News ReleasesDateTitle7/26/2017Great Ajax Corp. Schedules Its Second Quarter 2017 Financial Results Release For Tuesday, August 1, 20175/02/2017Great Ajax Corp.

Zacks Rank:



                                                 3-Hold     3     




Style Scores:



D Value | F Growth | B Momentum | F VGM                


The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.


Value Score
A


Growth Score
A


Momentum Score
A


VGM Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.
