    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million
Updated: June 9, 2013
Data Format: CSV
License: CC-BY

2 GB gzip8 GB uncompressed

Download



The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

Exclusive: Interview with Adidas CEO Herbert Hainer

Darren Rovell													| @darrenrovell

Thomas Langer | Bongarts | Getty Images
Herbert Hainer, CEO of Adidas smiles during a press conference on in Herzogenaurach, Germany.


I recently sat down with Adidas CEO Herbert Hainerto talk to him about the re-energizing of the Reebokbrand, the licensing business and the state of the sports and shoe apparel business.
Darren:You’ve spent a good deal of money on the NBA license. Reebok bought the NFL license before you bought them. What do you think about the licensing business in general.
Hainer:I think you have to, as a brand owner, have different ways to communicate to consumers to advertise. You advertise digitally, at retail, you use brand ambassadors who are individual players and you have licensing agreements with teams and leagues. Our NBA license is good because it connects our passion for basketball with fans of teams and the league. We just extended our deal with the MLS because we do believe that soccer in the country is gaining. Twenty five million people watched the World Cup final. Reebok hasn’t done as much as it could have done with the NFL before we came along.

Darren:The NFL license is up at the end of next year, but we’re supposed to find out before the end of this year who the apparel partner will be. Are you bidding as Adidas or Reebok?
Hainer:I can’t say which brand, but I can say that we have participated in the NFL’s open bidding process. We decided how much we were willing to pay. We think it’s reasonable and our intention is to try to keep the NFL as a property. But if somebody bids higher than us then we’ll accept that. We expect to hear by the end of October. We have very strong league relationships. So if we lose the NFL, it won’t make or break our company.
Darren:According to some market share numbers, Li-Ning has passed you as the number two company in China behind Nike. What happened?
Hainer:I saw numbers three weeks ago that reflected that our market share is still number two. We did have our issues in China. We had too much inventory and there were select retailers that we trusted that weren’t the best to be with. We have cleaned everything up, we’ll do more than $1 billion in sales and we continue to believe that China will be a growth engine for Adidas.”

Darren:You recently said that you believe that you will grow in the next year. Is that possible in a non-World Cup/Olympics year?
Hainer:Yes it is possible and we’ll do it first and foremost by continuing to bring product concepts to life. Our business is sold six months in advance, so I know how we’re doing and it’s quite encouraging. If you look back in our history, 2003, 2005, 2007 — the in-between years when there isn’t a World Cup or Olympics — we’ve focused on product concepts and technologies more in those years and it has driven market share. So I have no doubt that 2011 is a growth year.
Darren:How good was the World Cup for you?
Hainer: We felt like we obviously were the most visible brand out there with our Jubilani ball and the fact that we had more teams, 12, than anyone. Nike’scampaign was “Write the Future,” but most of their players disappeared and our team (Spain) won. And we were proud of our F50 boot since most goals were scored by players wearing them. Our football (soccer) business is now a $2 billion business.”




"We have very strong league relationships. So if               we lose the NFL, it won’t make or break our               company."                                                           "
-CEO, Adidas, Herbert Hainer                              


Darren:You are a big player in the toning market, which has hit $1 billion this year. What’s the future of this market?
Hainer:I do believe that the toning market is a category that will continue. What the right size is, is it $1 billion, $800 million, $2 billion, I don’t know. But we’ve sold huge quantities of these shoes. The summer has been a little bit slower and there has been some pricing activities, but all our market research suggests that the sell through is good and this is a stable business that will continue. Some of our competitors that went into this market are now gone and it’s now us and Skechers in this space. We’ll be rolling out more EasyTone shoes and also a whole new line of toning apparel is coming, so we think this category will last.
Darren:A lot of people thought that the EasyTones would be a one-hit wonder for Reebok and then you followed it up with the ZigTech shoes, which have also been a success. What’s the next in that line?



"THE NEXT GENERATION"


Hainer:Retailers and consumers have been very positive about the Zig. We have the next generation coming, which is Nanozig, which has the same pattern, but is smaller. We’re excited about our ZigTech basketball shoe and we love having John Wall as our ambassador for that.
Darren:You obviously have the Reebok and TaylorMade brands. Are there any smaller companies that you have your eyes on acquiring?
Hainer:Not at the moment. We think Reebok has huge potential and adidas is obviously all over the world, so we think our best strategy right now is to focus on our existing brands.

Tiger Woods


Darren:Many people have suggested that with what has happened with Tiger Woods and LeBron James that brands are going to steer away from using athletes as much as they have in the past, do you believe that?
Hainer:We have always believed that we need to have a healthy mix of communication tools. There is traditional sports marketing on television and in magazines, digital and PR. As far as using players, people like heroes. At the same time, it’s hard for a whole team to get caught with steroids. I went to Gillette Stadium to see a Patriots game and the stadium doesn’t inspire emotions like a celebrity like George Clooney does. So what Tiger or Michael Vick has done hasn’t necessarily changed how we feel about athletes. It’s part of the mix, which includes sponsoring the event, sponsoring the athletes and sponsoring the teams.
Darren:It’s been a relatively rough go for the golf business with the economic crisis, at least here in the US. What’s your read on TaylorMade?
Hainer:Iam very proud of TaylorMade and us becoming the biggest golf company in the world. In the US, rounds are still pretty much flat. But I give a lot of credit to (TaylorMade CEO) Mark King on continuing to push innovation with our new drivers, the movable weight system we have, the Penta ball. We’ve provided people with measurable reasons why they should buy our product.
Darren:In the mid-90’s, the sports and apparel companies spent a lot of money doing licensing deals with college teams. You have teams like Notre Dame, Nebraska, Tennessee and you recently did deals with Michigan and Wisconsin. For the most part though, it seems like you’re not in the business of acquiring more and more teams.
Hainer:We determined that adding colleges just to add them does not work for our business. The schools we have, we are obviously very happy with. But what we found to be a more effective spend is on the high school kid. It’s the perfect age that a consumer gets attached to our brand so we’ve chosen to spend money in that space from a grassroots standpoint and activate in tennis, football and soccer.
Darren:How do you feel about the shoe and apparel industry right now?
Hainer:I feel very fortunate to be in this industry. Companies like adidas and Nike have a big advantage over companies in other industries. The bottom line is people want to stay fit and look sporty. People are retiring at an earlier age and have 15 years or more after they retire to live. So this gives them a longer time to pursue active leisure activities. And we’ve been very creative as an industry to keep our categories growing.

Outgoing Adidas CEO Herbert Hainer Says the Company Is in Good Hands | Fortune.comRetailSearchSearchTelecommunicationsSprint Seeks Merger with Charter Communications: ReportFoxconnEnvironmental Regulations Would Be Waived For Planned Foxconn PlantCOMPARECARDSSPONSOREDGovernmentHours After North Korea Missile Launch, Trump Reassigns Homeland Security ChiefAdidas Chief Executive Herbert Hainer Photograph by Alexander Hassenstein — Getty ImagesAdidasAdidas’ Outgoing CEO Says the Company Is in Good HandsReutersAug 04, 2016Adidas Chief Executive Herbert Hainer said on Thursday he was confident that the German sportswear group could keep growing fast and improve profitability as he prepares to hand over to former Henkel boss Kasper Rorsted.The sportswear group on Thursday reported its highest second quarter sales growth in a decade, led by its fashion ranges but with soccer and running growing fast too. It also achieved a big improvement in operating margins in its U.S. business."The company is in very good hands with Kasper," Hainer told journalists.Some investors have expressed concerns that Rorsted might find it difficult to maintain growth at Adidas, driven of late by lifestyle trends that could prove transient, rather than the sports performance gear rival Nike (nke) focuses on.Adidas shares have risen 61% this year to make them the top performing German blue-chip."Fantastic results, but that is in the current price," said Equinet Bank analyst Mark Josefson as he cut his rating on the stock to "sell" from "neutral".Rorsted, a 54-year-old Dane who boosted profits at Henkel by cutting costs, started a two-month handover period at Adidas this week with Hainer, CEO since 2001.Adidas recorded its strongest growth in the quarter at the Originals fashion business, which saw sales soar 50% as consumers snapped up shoes like retro Superstars and "Yeezy Boost" sneakers designed by rapper Kanye West.But Hainer said sports performance was growing just as strongly as fashion in the key U.S. market, particularly in running and football, with U.S. shoppers buying over 16,000 pairs of $180 UltraBoost Uncaged sneakers in 24 hours.Finance chief Robin Stalker said a big improvement in the profitability of the U.S. business should be sustainable and even increase as Adidas sells products at higher prices and has to discount less stock.Adidas also reported a rise in sales and margins at the golf business it is trying to sell. Hainer said Adidas was in talks with several parties interested in the business.Adidas said in May it would sell TaylorMade and Adams, which sell golf clubs and other equipment, as well as the Ashworth golf shoes and clothing brand.Nike said this week it would stop selling golf equipment, including clubs, golf balls and bags, and focus instead on innovation in its golf footwear and apparel business and on partnering with more golfers.After peaking around 2000, when Nike endorser Tiger Woods was in his prime, the number of people playing golf in the United States has fallen sharply as fewer young people take it up and as busy professionals switch to cycling or running.Customer ServiceSite MapPrivacy PolicyAdvertisingAd ChoicesTerms of UseYour California Privacy RightsCareers© 2017 Time Inc.

        Please enter all fields marked and provide valid input.Herzogenaurach, 4.March 2014 – At its meeting today, the adidas AG Supervisory Board extended Herbert Hainer’s contract and also his mandate as CEO of adidas AG by another two years beyond 2015 until March 2017. Herbert Hainer has been CEO of adidas AG since March 2001."Under Herbert Hainer’s leadership, the adidas Group has developed exceptionally well in the past 13 years. Since his appointment as CEO in March 2001, the value of the company has increased more than fivefold. I am delighted that Herbert Hainer has extended his contract as CEO of the adidas Group. In light of his extremely successful performance we would have liked to tie him to the company for an even longer period. We are convinced that Herbert Hainer will continue to drive the company‘s success on its growth path," commented Igor Landau, Chairman of the Supervisory Board of adidas AG“At the same time, today’s decision gives us sufficient time to ensure a smooth transition at the helm of the adidas Group and to optimally facilitate the process of succession for the company. In the coming years, together with Herbert Hainer, we will continue to pursue the generation change which has already been initiated within the Group’s management team, thus preparing the company for the next era of success.
