The Plexus Story




Plexus Worldwide® is committed to providing our Ambassadors with life-changing products and a unique and rewarding business opportunity. The combination of our products and opportunity help open the door to personal success and financial freedom.
In early 2011 Plexus Worldwide® launched the synergistic product combination of Plexus Slim® and Accelerator. The initial results were extremely impressive and sales have grown dramatically month over month.


Our core beliefs are simple: Be Trustworthy, Be Honest, Be Reliable, and Be Responsible.
These beliefs encompass all that we do. You can have confidence in the quality of our products, the commitment to our Ambassadors, and the support we will provide to help you succeed.








Executives










Tarl Robinson
Chief Executive Officer
On behalf of our Ambassadors and Employees we thank you for taking your time to get to know Plexus. You have our commitment to quality and excellence in each and every product we offer. We think you will agree that our products, along with the opportunity to become an Ambassador, have the potential to provide great benefits and even life changing results. Our wish for you is health, hope and prosperity. Best Wishes!



Alec Clark
President
Real People, Real Results. That’s who we are. Hundreds of thousands of lives are being affected by Plexus Worldwide® in a positive way every day. For many this means better health, for others life changing weight loss success. For some the ability to breathe again financially and others the magic of true time freedom. If you want to experience life in a better way, don’t delay. Start your journey today. Live healthy, love life, and be Plexus.





Steve Howard
Chief Financial Officer
Plexus is defined in the dictionary as “an interwoven combination of parts or elements in a structure or system.” It seems to describe very well the way our people, products, culture and rewards intersect to promote health, wealth and personal development. And the result has been enormous growth and progress for Plexus, but it doesn’t end here. As we aim toward even greater heights in the future, we remember the words of Benjamin Franklin that “without continual growth and progress, such words as improvement, achievement and success have no meaning.”



Keith Jackson
Chief Operations Officer
We at Plexus are so proud of our products and our Ambassadors – such a positive impact in so many ways. The many testimonials we have attest to the products and the business opportunity are a key part of what makes Plexus great.





MaryAnn Luciano
VP of Ambassador Education
There are three essential components to successful training: education, motivation, and inspiration. That certainly applies to Plexus as we are a company whose Ambassadors truly shine in all three. We start by introducing potential customers to our wonderful products and educating them about the importance of taking better care of their health. As happy satisfied customers they are motivated to share their personal success stories which inspire others to join the Plexus family. We are so proud that we are changing lives.

Specific Return Policy:
SOFTWARE / VIDEO:  Opened Software and Videos
    may be exchanged within 30 days of your product's shipping date, for the same item
    only. No refunds are available for these items, if opened.

  Jeppesen chart subscriptions that are cancelled after the first set has been 
  shipped will receive a pro-rated refund based on the time remaining.

Calculating Your Refund
When the item is returned in
its original condition with all original packaging, your credit card will be credited for the price of the
purchase and any taxes, excluding shipping costs and re-stocking fees. If the return is due to a  MyPilotStore error, the return shipping charges will be waived. 
Many times we charge a 
discounted shipping cost for the original shipment.  If you return an item 
and the outbound shipping cost was greater than you paid, the difference will 
be deducted from your return.  For example, if we charged you $4.95 for 
shipping and our actual shipping cost was $8.50 we will deduct $3.55 ($8.50 
minus $4.95) from the value of the return.

If you need clarification on 
this return policy, please
email us at service@MyPilotStore.com.

What is Plexus Slim®? 
Plexus Slim is the delicious way to promote overall health and lose weight. Slim supports healthy glucose metabolism and helps good microbes thrive which keeps your gut microbiome healthy.*
When is the best time to drink Plexus Slim®?
If you want to lose weight, drink Slim 30 minutes before a meal. If you want to support your gut microbiome, enjoy Slim at any time of the day! Simply pour one packet of Slim into a glass of water or water bottle, mix, and enjoy!
How many Plexus Slims can I drink per day?
You can enjoy Slim up to two times a day.
How much water should I use with Plexus Slim?
Each packet of Slim can be mixed into 12-20 ounces of water.
Should Slim be added to hot or cold water?
Slim is meant to be a refreshing drink, and its best added to cold water. We don’t recommend adding Slim to hot water, as hot water could affect the stability of Slim’s green coffee extract, making it less effective.
Can you tell me about the new study that was done on Plexus Slim?
We wanted to see what Slim can really do, so we put it through rigorous, testing procedures. In a highly advanced, in vitro study created to mimic the human gastrointestinal system, Slim’s powerful microbiome activating formula was tested, which produced astounding results. ◊*
Here’s what the scientists found:

Increases friendly microbes called Akkermansia– a remarkable microbe, which positively impacts disrupted metabolism associated with being overweight by 250 times. ◊*
Increases Lactobacillus by 365 times and Bifidobacterium by 290 times- microbes that contribute to your overall health. ◊*
Increases Butyrate by up to 58% and Propionate by up to 29%- Short-chain fatty acids that help regulate your metabolism. ◊*

What is the prebiotic in Plexus Slim and how is it beneficial to me? 
Xylooligosaccharides (XOS), Slim’s incredible prebiotic, is a fiber that friendly microbes love to eat. XOS has been clinically shown to improve intestinal microflora for enhanced health and well-being. In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study conducted by researchers at the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA), daily doses of XOS (as low as 1 gram) were found to significantly improve gut microbiota balance, promoting growth of more species of good gut microbes, while reducing bad microbes, thereby, promoting intestinal health.*
What is a prebiotic? How does it work?
Your gut is full of microbes. Some of them are good; some of them are bad. Prebiotics are non-digestible fibers that make their way through our digestive system and help good microbes grow and flourish. Prebiotics are non-absorbable fibers like fructo-, xylo- and oligo-saccharides, and inulin, which can be found naturally occurring in whole grains, chicory root, onions, leeks, fruits and legumes. Prebiotics act as a fertilizer, selectively feeding good microbes in the gut and assisting in their growth. This leads to benefits for your overall well-being and health. Nearly everyone needs prebiotics to experience optimal health, particularly those who don’t get enough from their diet.*
Have we enhanced the high quality of ingredients in Plexus Slim?
Absolutely. The ingredients in the new Slim were specifically qualified by our in-house Quality Assurance department using world-class quality standards. Each material is rigorously tested for purity and potency by Plexus Worldwide® before ever being selected for use. The difference in this hands-on approach and dedication to ingredient quality ensures that you can feel confident in the purity and potency of Slim’s quality ingredients.
Do I need to keep taking Plexus Slim to keep the microbiome benefits? 
If you stop drinking Plexus Slim every day, the improvements in your gut can start to disappear in as little as a week. So it’s best to take Slim every day.
Will I experience any side effects when I start drinking Plexus Slim? 
Experiencing side effects of prebiotic supplementation in Slim is very unusual. However, in certain people, supplementing with prebiotics could cause temporary gas and bloating. One way to avoid this is to begin by taking only a small amount of prebiotic (e.g., a half pack of Slim) and then gradually increasing your intake over 1 to 3 weeks. Your gut microbes should adapt to prebiotic supplementation over time, which will help relieve any discomfort.*
Is there a clinical study on Plexus Slim for weight loss?
Yes! Plexus Slim has been scientifically demonstrated to promote weight loss. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study of 175 subjects, Slim helped study participants lose weight.1*
What is the difference between the original Slim and the new Slim?
As much as we loved the original Slim, we love the new Slim even more. We have developed a new world-class standard for ingredient and supplier qualification that ensures that the new Slim ingredients are better than ever!  We’ve also added a unique and powerful prebiotic, so your gut will be healthier while still enjoying those great weight loss benefits. Also, it has a new, delicious flavor we can’t get enough of (raspberry, lemon, watermelon for the win!). It’s more soluble, so it dissolves more easily in your water bottle (you can enjoy it sooner). Gut health, weight loss, and great taste—what more could you want?*
Why does the new Slim stick feel lighter? Is there less good stuff in Slim?
We have formulated Slim to be even more potent and efficacious than ever. Each ingredient was carefully designed to be the most concentrated and efficacious form possible with minimal fillers and other ingredients that you don’t want or need. We are still delivering the same great levels of our bioactives, but with even fewer calories than before. Slim now has only 5 calories, not 10!
If I’m not trying to lose weight, will I still benefit from taking Plexus Slim?
Absolutely! Plexus Slim is a delicious health drink with amazing microbiome benefits. Even if you are not looking to lose weight, Slim delivers prebiotics that promotes the growth of good gut microbes and supports a healthy glucose metabolism. You are drinking your way to a healthier and happier gut!*
Is Plexus Slim safe?
Yes, Plexus Slim is safe to drink.
Is it safe to drink Plexus Slim while pregnant or breastfeeding?
If pregnant or nursing, consult your physician prior to use.
Can Slim be used by children under the age of 18?
Slim is not recommended for use by children under 18.
What flavor is the Plexus Slim?
Plexus Slim is a delicious raspberry, lemon, watermelon flavor.
Does Plexus Slim contain any allergens (Dairy, Egg, Peanut, Soy, Shellfish, Tree-Nut, and Wheat)? 
No.
Is Plexus Slim Gluten free, 100% vegetarian, and Non-GMO?
Yes.
Is there caffeine or any other stimulants in Plexus Slim?
The Chlorogenic acid in Slim is extracted from green coffee bean, and it contains less than 2% natural caffeine, which is negligible.
Can I take Plexus Slim with other Plexus products?
Absolutely! Slim is a great addition to any Plexus regimen. We highly recommend using it with ProBio 5 and Bio Cleanse in our TriPlex combo. The effects of this combination are very beneficial to your overall health, and helps you lose weight.*
Is Akkermansia in the new Slim or already in your gut? 
Akkermansia is a beneficial bacterium that is already present in your gut. Plexus Slim’s new formula with XOS helps feed good microbes and has been shown to increase Akkermansia levels by up to 250 times.◊*
Is the mulberry extract mixed with the raspberry, lemon, and watermelon to create the flavor profile?
While mulberry extract is not part of the flavor profile, it is in both the original and new Slim. Mulberry extract is considered a superfood and is a potent antioxidant.
What are the natural flavors in Plexus Slim?
The natural flavors in Plexus Slim are raspberry, lemon, and watermelon.
If I’m allergic to raspberry, lemon, and watermelon can I still drink Plexus Slim?
Plexus uses flavors that are extracted from actual fruit. Typically, the proteins that could cause an allergic reaction would be removed during extraction. The possibility of an allergic reaction is very small; however, we recommend that if you have an allergy to any of these fruits, please consult your physician prior to use.
What is the fruit and vegetable concentrate for color in Plexus Slim? 
The fruit and vegetable concentrate in Plexus Slim for color is the following-

Beetroot extract (Beta vulgaris)
Sweet potato concentrate (Ipomoea batatas L.)
Radish concentrate (Raphanus sativus)
Cherry concentrate (Prunus avium)
Apple concentrate (Malus domestica)

What is the exact source with the XOS in Plexus Slim?
The XOS in Plexus Slim is derived from Non-GMO corn.
Is there a corn derived ingredient in Plexus Slim?
XOS is derived from Non-GMO corn. If you’re allergic to corn please consult your physician prior to use.
What are the clinical studies done on the XOS in Plexus Slim®?

Plexus Worldwide Inc 7/30/14
  Department of Health and Human ServicesPublic Health ServiceFood and Drug Administration Los Angeles DistrictPacific Region19701 FairchildIrvine, CA 92612 Telephone:      949-608-2900FAX:    949-608-4415 WARNING LETTER  VIA UNITED PARCEL SERVICE                                                                      SIGNATURE REQUIRED July 30, 2014                                                                                                      WL # 28-14Tarl Robinson, Chief Executive OfficerPlexus Worldwide, Inc.15649 N. Greenway Hayden LoopScottsdale, AZ 91356 Dear Mr. Robinson: This is to advise you that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed your website at the Internet address www.plexusworldwide.com in April and July 2014 and has determined that you take orders there for the products Fast Relief, ProBio5 and BioCleanse, which the website promotes for conditions that cause these products to be drugs under section 201(g)(1)(B) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the Act) [21 U.S.C. § 321(g)(1)(B)]. The therapeutic claims on your website establish that your products are drugs because they are intended for use in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce for such uses violates the Act. You may find the Act and FDA regulations through links on FDA’s home page at www.fda.gov. Examples of some of the website claims that provide evidence that your products are intended for use as drugs include:  Fast Relief “Nerve damage is present to some degree in most cases of chronic pain, especially neck and back pain. Nerve damage can occur due to trauma, medication side effects, or other metabolic issues.” “Features & Benefits…[m]ay reduce the associated symptoms from nerve damage of pain, numbness, tingling, ‘pins and needles’ sensations, and weakness.” ProBio5 ProBio5 will typically provide the following results…jock itch, migraine headaches, recurring cystitis/vaginal infections…” Bio Cleanse “Why do you need Plexus Bio-Cleanse? Many people are in a low oxygen/toxic state….[v]iruses, bacteria, fungi, and other pathogenic microbes thrive in this condition, and can lead to disease such as flu, Candida, chronic fatigue, etc.   Plexus Bio-Cleanse can increase the oxygen levels around these microbes, causing them to die due to their high-oxygenated environment.” Your Fast Relief, ProBio5 and BioCleanse are not generally recognized as safe and effective for the above referenced uses and, therefore, the products are “new drugs” under section 201(p) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(p)]. New drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from FDA, as described in section 505(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 355(a)]; see also section 301(d) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 331(d)]. The FDA approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data submitted by a drug sponsor to demonstrate that the drug is safe and effective. Furthermore, your Fast Relief, ProBio5 and BioCleanse are offered for conditions that are not amenable to self-diagnosis and treatment by individuals who are not medical practitioners; therefore, adequate directions for use cannot be written so that a layperson can use these drugs safely for their intended purposes. Thus, these drugs are misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 352(f)(1)] in that their labeling fails to bear adequate directions for use. The introduction of a misbranded drug into interstate commerce is a violation of section 301(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 331(a)]. The violations cited in this letter are not intended to be an all-inclusive list of violations that exist in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of the violations identified above and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that all products marketed by your firm comply with all requirements of federal law and FDA regulations. You should take prompt action to correct the violations cited in this letter. Failure to promptly correct these violations may result in legal action without further notice, including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.  Within fifteen (15) working days of receipt of this letter, please notify this office in writing of the specific steps that you have taken to correct violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. If you cannot complete corrective action within fifteen working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will complete the correction.  Please submit your response to: Nancy Schmidt, Acting DirectorCompliance BranchFood and Drug AdministrationLos Angeles District19701 FairchildIrvine, CA 92612 Include Special Identifier FEI #3010151057 on all correspondence. If you have any questions please contact Dr. Raymond W. Brullo at (949) 608-2918. Sincerely,/S/Alonza E. Cruse, DirectorLos Angeles District  Cc:  Harlan Loui, Acting ChiefCalifornia Department of Public HealthFood and Drug Branch1500 Capitol Avenue, MS-7602P.O.
