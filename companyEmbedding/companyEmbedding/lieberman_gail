Gail Lieberman


Obituary
Condolences




























Gail M. Lieberman CHATHAM - Gail M. Lieberman of Chatham died Sunday afternoon, December 5th at her home with her husband of 41 years Len Lieberman, her daughter Miriam Sloanstein, her son-in-law Chris Sloanstein, and family friends. Born in Chicago to David and Annette Weinstein in 1947, Mrs. Lieberman was a Springfield area resident since 1971, an administrator at the State Board of Education and Educational Advisor to Governor Thompson. She also was active in national and local associations and non-profit organizations, including being the Chairman of the National Association of State Directors of Special Education, Springfield Jewish Federation President and Campaign Chairman, President of Springfield's ORT Chapter, and very active in the Congregation Temple Israel Sisterhood. She was known for professional excellence, mentoring other managers and professional staff, and chairing efforts on difficult projects such as Illinois' position on the initial implementation of the federal No Child Left Behind initiative. During the past year, Len and Gail Lieberman traveled the world in response to Gail Lieberman's terminal pancreatic cancer diagnosis, often with Miriam and Chris Slonestein. Her funeral will be held at Bisch Funeral Home West, 2931 South Koke Mill Road in Springfield at 11:30 a.m. on Wednesday, December 8th. Rabbi Barry Marks will officiate. Burial will follow in Oak Ridge Cemetery. Visitation will occur between 9:30 and 11:30 a.m. the same morning at the same location. Memorial services will be held that evening and each evening other than Shabbat through Monday, December 13th at the Lieberman residence, 321 Garvey Lane in Chatham.  In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to the Springfield Jewish Federation, 1045 Outer Park Drive, Springfield IL 62704 or Congregation Temple Israel at 1140 West Governor, Springfield IL 62704 in her memory. Please visit the online "Life Remembered Story" at www.bischfuneralhomewest.com where tributes and condolences may be left for the family.
