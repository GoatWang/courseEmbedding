		Hi everybody. I just bought Patrician 4 from the department store but I can't play it because I can't locate the product key! I've never had this problem with any game. There was no manual that came with the game, just a CD with the manual on it. However, there seems to be no key contained anywhere within the manual's content. Also, the key isn't anywhere inside the game's CD case. It's just a black case with no markings. I've emailed the tech support but haven't gotten an answer yet. 

So my question is whether anyone else has had this problem and even if you haven't, where was the product key located in your copy of the game?

Thanks for any and all help.

		retail version it is on the back cover of the printed paper manual it came with. You are speaking about an electronic PDF form of the manual. The retail version does come with a real physical manual with key on the back. If you do not have it, then you got a Fake DVD version form SE Asia. or someone pulled a fast one on you stealing it out of the retail box/DVD case it comes in.

Thank you, I thought as much. But I called the store (London Drugs) and asked and the guy seemed to think that was normal that it didn't have a manual. So ... that wasn't helpful, lol. Come to think of it, though ... I think the product was wrapped in cellophane so either someone forgot to put a manual in it or it was ripped off from the inside. I guess someone stole it ror forgot to put it in in the first place. 

Thanks again, I know it seems like a stupid question.

		Same problem here...

I just rec'd my copy from Amazon.ca (unopened, wrapped in plastic).  There is no physical manual (just soft cd pdf).  I can absolutely find no product key for registration, therefore cannot play game.  Please help as I feel I just wasted my $40.00

I ordered this Dec 10 and paid extra to have it expedited for delivery today, Dec 13.  I cannot play this game without product key.  Why am I being punished for buying a legitimate copy of your product?  Heck, I could've downloaded a cracked version last week and I could've been playing already for several days now.  Why not punish the "pirates" instead of your loyal supporters?  I am absolutely livid..

		Apparently Kalypso has this issue with their other games (ie Tropico3, Disciples, Grand Ages...)

I am still waiting to use the product I paid for in full 5 days ago (generally it seems people need to wait on average a week before the 24/7 support gets issue resolved)...  Oh what a lucrative business I could have by selling products that do not work immediately upon the customer receiving the goods and making them wait with no indication of timeframe...  Maybe this is a type of business I could request on my wishlist for Patrician?

		My brother had this happen once with a game, i think it was the F1 manager "Pole Position 2010 or Tropico 3" can't remember now but when he took the game back they said its not their problem the game was sealed, no one could remove the book without breaking the seal. So when ever i purchase a game i alway's ask the store to open the case before i will purchase it lol.

		I just bought the game from Amazon.Com and there was no paper manual and no Product Key.  Of course I can not return the item to Amazon.Com since they do not allow you to return software once the box is opened.  I send Kalypso support an email telling them I bought the item new from Amazon.com and even enclose the shipping information Amazon.Com sent and they respond with an email asking me if I bought the game used.  I then reiterate that the game was new and that everything worked fine up to the point that I realized there was no product key in package.  They tell me to return the game to the store... 

What kind of Customer support is that?

		There were two CD's inside, one had the game and a copy of the manual while the other had copies of the manual for Patrician 4 and a couple other Kalypso games.  That was it, no paper manual and no product key.

		take a look at a review here: http://www.amazon.com/Patrician-IV-Pc/pr...M9FCGGEHUA
Quote:This is very possibly a pirated copy (that is evidently why it sells for a fifth of the real game). It is worthless as it does not include a code that is required to install the game.
not sure if that is your product
but if somebody sells software without a code that should be an issue for the marketplace and the publisher

Product Description▼▲
Many people know only bits and pieces of the Bible, such as indiviual stories or verses, and they do not understand how these pieces fit together. This book brings together these "bits and pieces" of Bible knowledge by showing their relation to each other and to a common theme that runs throughout the Word. The reader encounters the theme time and again while studying the insights and events found in each book of the Bible. This journey "through the Bible" reveals the unfolding of God's plan and provides a panoramic view for excellent understanding of the Word.Designed to be used in conjunction with the Bible Study book (SKU: 271312)

            I don't think you need the workbook and the study guide. The study guide has more info and the workbook is just a shorter version with questions to answer. I would recommend adding questions to the study guide and there would be no need for the workbook

            I have always wanted to have the Bible more clearly explained, I'm only a couple chapter into the study, but already it is clearer to me then it has ever been before.


There really is too much information for each chapter to be a week long study, for me anyway!  So I have had to stretch it out a bit longer.


The only thing I would change is a "cheat sheet" for the study book.  Because sometimes, I cannot come up with the answers myself.  Maybe I'm just not articulate enough though.

            This workbook is like no other workbook. It is one that will leave you digging in "God's Word". It's not like many workbooks that ask a question and provide you the answer. To get a deeper and clearer understanding, one should have to dig. This workbook is a must... I could go on and on.. A seasoned Christian, or even a new believer.. this workbook has your name on it..
