	On March 5, 2012, United Rentals, Inc. (the Company or United Rentals) and certain of the Companys subsidiaries entered into an incremental assumption agreement (the Incremental Assumption Agreement) with Bank of America, N.A., as agent, and Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch pursuant to which Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch agreed to provide an increase in the U.S. revolving credit commitment of $100 million (the  ABL Commitment Increase) under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of October 14, 2011, as amended as of December 16, 2011 (the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement), among the Company, United Rentals (North America), Inc.

Pursuant to the ABL Commitment Increase, the aggregate amount available under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreements senior secured asset-based loan facility (the ABL Facility) was increased to $1,900 million (subject to availability under a borrowing base), a portion of which is available for borrowing in Canadian Dollars.

	The ABL Facility matures on October 13, 2016.  Upon effectiveness of the ABL Commitment Increase, approximately $


	907


	million was drawn under the ABL Facility and approximately $


	993


	million was available for additional borrowings under the ABL Facility, subject to borrowing base limitations, as reduced by outstanding letters of credit.
