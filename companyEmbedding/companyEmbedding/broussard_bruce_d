  "Throughout his career        – which includes executive-level experience in accounting, finance, and        informatics across many health-related industries – he has shown an        ability to grow businesses profitably and maintain strong relationships        with customers and partners." 



LOUISVILLE, Ky.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Humana Inc. (NYSE: HUM) announced today that, as the next step in the        company’s long-term succession planning process, Bruce D. Broussard has        been named President of the company, effective in December 2011. The        company’s succession plan anticipates that Chairman of the Board and        Chief Executive Officer Mike McCallister will retire as CEO in the next        12 to 18 months and that Broussard would become CEO at that time.             “As part of Humana’s long-term succession planning process, this step        has been under consideration by the Board of Directors for more than a        year,” McCallister said. “Bruce Broussard brings significant CEO        experience in the health industry to Humana along with superb        operational and financial leadership skills. I’m confident he will prove        to be a leader that continues and enhances the success we’ve had over        the past decade.”             Broussard, 49, was Chief Executive Officer of McKesson Specialty Health,        a $9 billion subsidiary of McKesson, Inc., formed from the merger of        McKesson Specialty and US Oncology in December 2010. He was Chairman of        the Board and CEO of US Oncology, Inc., as a stand-alone organization        prior to the McKesson purchase.             He has a wide range of executive leadership experience in publicly        traded and private organizations within a variety of healthcare sectors        including oncology, pharmaceuticals, assisted living/senior housing,        home care, physician practice management, surgical centers and dental        networks.             “As CEO of US Oncology, Bruce worked closely with the Centers for        Medicare and Medicaid Services, which is invaluable given Humana’s        significant Medicare business,” McCallister said. “Throughout his career        – which includes executive-level experience in accounting, finance, and        informatics across many health-related industries – he has shown an        ability to grow businesses profitably and maintain strong relationships        with customers and partners.”             “I’m grateful for the opportunity to join Humana and serve on the        company’s leadership team,” Broussard said. “Humana has an amazing track        record over the past decade as a consumer-focused innovator, and I look        forward to contributing meaningfully to the company’s future growth.”             McCallister, 59, will mark his 12th year as CEO in 2012 and        his 38th as a Humana associate. He was elected Chairman of        the Board in August 2010.             “Mike’s leadership has been extraordinary,” said Kurt Hilzinger, the        lead independent director on Humana’s Board. “During his tenure as CEO,        Humana’s revenues have quadrupled and net income has increased more than        six-fold. The company’s most recent fiscal year was the strongest in its        50-year history as measured by revenues, net income, and health-plan        membership. We are pleased that Mike’s energy, skill, and visionary        thinking will be with the company as CEO during a thoughtful transition        period.”             The company also announced that Chief Operating Officer James E. Murray        is being promoted to Executive Vice President and Chief Operating        Officer. In December he will join McCallister and Broussard in the        Office of the Chairman, which McCallister is creating to guide the        company in key strategic areas and ensure a smooth leadership transition.             “Jim has been an absolutely stellar creator and steward of Humana’s        growth over the past two decades,” McCallister said. “He and Bruce bring        complementary skills and unmatched experience to the Office of the        Chairman. We will work collaboratively on issues of long-term importance        to our stakeholders, including our associates, customers, shareholders,        and the communities we serve.”             Murray, 57, joined Humana in 1989 as Vice President of Finance. He        served in increasingly responsible financial and operational positions        before being appointed Chief Operating Officer in 2006.             “Humana has never been better positioned for continued growth,” Murray        said. “I look forward to working closely with Mike and Bruce on        strategies that will enable us to pursue our dream of helping people        achieve lifelong well-being.”       About Humana         Humana Inc., headquartered in Louisville, Kentucky, is a leading health        care company that offers a wide range of insurance products and health        and wellness services that incorporate an integrated approach to        lifelong well-being.

Bruce D. Broussard - Wikipedia





















 






Bruce D. Broussard

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

Bruce D. Broussard (born 1962) is a businessman in the healthcare industry. He is currently Chief Executive Officer and President at Humana Inc.[1] As of March 2016 he is negotiating the merger of the company with Aetna. If the federal government approves the merger between the two rivals, Broussard will receive $40.2 million if he resigns or is let go. The "golden parachute" compensation package includes a $6 million severance payout with most of the remaining money coming from cashing out stock, regulatory disclosures reveal. The potential payout is one of the largest golden parachutes in the health insurance industry.
Education[edit]
He has a Bachelor of Business Arts from Texas A&M and a Masters in Business Administration from the University of Houston.[2]

New Humana President in Line for CEO
Bruce D. Broussard, who had been CEO of McKesson Specialty Health, has been appointed president and is expected to become Humana’s CEO when the current chief, Mike McCallister, retires in 12-18 months.

Nov 07, 2011

Humana Inc. announced Nov. 4 that Bruce D. Broussard, 49, has been appointed to the post of president, placing him in line to be the Louisville, Ky.-based health care company's next CEO. Broussard was CEO of McKesson Specialty Health; he is expected to become Humana's CEO when the current chief executive, Mike McCallister, retires in 12-18 months.











Among Humana's many units is Concentra, which is based in Addison, Texas, and provides occupational medical care, urgent care, physical therapy, and wellness services to workers and the general public via 317 medical centers in 40 states.
"As part of Humana's long-term succession planning process, this step has been under consideration by the board of directors for more than a year," McCallister said. "Bruce Broussard brings significant CEO experience in the health industry to Humana, along with superb operational and financial leadership skills. I'm confident he will prove to be a leader that continues and enhances the success we've had over the past decade.
"As CEO of US Oncology, Bruce worked closely with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which is invaluable given Humana's significant Medicare business," McCallister said. "Throughout his career -- which includes executive-level experience in accounting, finance, and informatics across many health-related industries -- he has shown an ability to grow businesses profitably and maintain strong relationships with customers and partners."
"I'm grateful for the opportunity to join Humana and serve on the company's leadership team," Broussard said. "Humana has an amazing track record over the past decade as a consumer-focused innovator, and I look forward to contributing meaningfully to the company's future growth."
