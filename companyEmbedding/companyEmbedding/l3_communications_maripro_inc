Cable Burial










L3 MariPro's cable burial trencher is a self-propelled water-jet subsea tool designed to provide cost efficient and reliable cable burial to 2.0 meters in water depths to 50 meters (165 ft.). The cable trencher's depressor can be modified to handle a wide range of cable diameters (including split pipe) at varying burial depths on a single pass in cooperative soils.


Cabial Burial Trencher 
Diesel-driven water pump for Trencher


The system can be operated from a small support barge which houses the system's water pump and diesel engine power supply. The pump provides the water pressure for cutting the burial trench and system propulsion. With the aid of onboard cameras and instrumentation, the sled's forward progress, cable-feed configuration and cable burial trencher attitude may be continuously monitored from the surface. The cable is captured at the lead-in chute at the front and is guided along the leading edge of the stinger to assure full burial of the cable. Because the cable burial sled is self-propelled by the water jets, risk of damage to the cable is minimized should an anomaly develop anywhere along the cable path. L3 MariPro has successfully buried over 100 kilometers of cable worldwide.

Cable Fault Localization










Fiber Splicer and OTDRExternal aggression on submarine cable remains the primary cause of cable faults. Activity such as fishing, anchoring, geological events, abrasion and dredging make up most external aggression categories. Most faults continue to occur in less than 200 m of water depth. High-performance fault location techniques are key to achieving economical submarine cable repairs.
Cable faults can typically be classified into the following categories: cable break, open fault, shunt fault or optical fiber fault. Depending on the cable fault category, the method of cable fault localization will vary.
L3 MariPro engineers are trained in various methods of fault locating techniques, such as single end DC measurements, single-end capacitance measurements, current-balance method or optical path methods.
State-of-the-art fiber optic and metallic cable fault localization utilizing long-range optical and metallic time domain reflectometers (OTDR & MTRD) are used by experienced L3 MariPro engineers. Cable faults can be precisely located and characterized in preparation for repair operation scenarios. Post cable installation and repair certification can also be performed.

Cable Landings










L3 MariPro has been responsible for landing of cable systems using a variety of technologies. These range from standard trenched approaches with heavy armor or split-pipe to innovative use of drill-pipe or existing oil or gas lines, and horizontal directional drilling.
Cable Crossings 
L3 MariPro developed the procedures and performed 123 cable crossings of pipelines and cables during the installation of 850 kilometers of fiber optic telecommunication cables linking 7 oil platforms in the Gulf of Mexico.  In order to protect and separate the cables from the pipelines, a very high density polyurethane segmented covering was applied to the fiber optic cables as they were deployed over the pipelines. L3 MariPro has also successfully performed both cable and pipeline crossings for numerous other customers at worldwide locations.
Shore Landings 
  L3 MariPro pioneered the application of split-pipe on the system cable aboard the installation vessel while deploying cable and floating it to shore. This methodology precludes the need for a near-shore joint or splice; decreasing installation time, risk and cost. L3 MariPro has also successfully utilized reconditioned oil drill-pipe assembled on shipboard or shore side and pulled or floated into position for a number of installations. Further, L3 MariPro has installed cables in abandoned gas pipelines. On the first such project 16 km of cable was successfully installed in two different pipelines (8 km per pipe).

Horizontal Directional Drilling 
                Horizontal Directional Drilling (HDD), or directional boring, provides a trenchless method of installing conduits from shore to off-shore. The system cable is then pulled through the conduit to shore for connection to the system's on-shore equipment. HDD is used when trenching or excavation is not practical or environmentally desirable. HDD is often the preferred method for landing submarine cables onto shore.
L3 MariPro often works with our customers and qualified HDD suppliers to oversee the shore landing process to insure overall marine installation and project success of the cabled undersea sensor system.

Offshore Platform Cable J-Tube & I-Tube Risers
                L3 MariPro has experience in offshore platform cable landings in water depths from 60 to 300 meters. L3 MariPro has developed a unique offshore platform cable landing procedure that conforms to API standards utilizing standard platform cable landing hardware such as riser clamps and J-Tube or I-Tube cable riser systems combined with novel underwater cable storage bins and shipboard deployment rigging. L3 MariPro has completed the installation of nine J-Tube or I-Tube risers for both power and fiber optic cables on nine separate oil field platform structures. As on previous similar programs L3 MariPro also designed and manufactured the I tubes and clamps in addition to performing cable installation, including pull-in and testing.

Hydroacoustic Monitoring










Hydroacoustic Monitoring ConceptThese systems are designed for monitoring of nuclear events. A nuclear explosion generates a very strong source of underwater sound, also known as hydro acoustic waves. The physical characteristics of the oceans form a sound axis channel known acoustically as the Sound Fixing and Ranging (SOFAR) Channel which allows these waves to travel for extremely long distances with little energy loss. For this reason it is possible to monitor the broad ocean areas of the world with only a small number of hydroacoustic stations. A hydroacoustic monitoring system can detect these hydroacoustic waves from remote locations.
 Hydroacoustic monitoring systems utilize omni-directional low-frequency hydrophones at the center of the low-loss ocean SOFAR channel. The hydrophone stations monitor at the low frequencies suitable for recording explosions at large distances. The hydroacoustic monitoring system is particularly effective at discriminating between explosions in the ocean and earthquakes, which are the prime source of detected events. Fiber optic cables bring the signal back to a shore station and transmit this information in near-real-time to a centralized data processing center.
These long-life systems utilize design elements common to our undersea defense and ocean science cabled sensor systems. Highly reliable sensors, riser cables, electronics modules, fiber optic transmission modules, pressure vessels, backbone cables, cable sealing and termination technology and deployment packaging are       integrated for worldwide complex in-water installations.
 The hydroacoustic monitoring systems are deployed in groups of three sensor nodes for redundancy and to measure the direction of the event. System installation is performed at remote sites around the globe, requiring careful attention to logistical planning for successful implementations.

Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in California:













Does L 3 Communications Maripro Inc carry a valid contracting license?



In California, any remodeling or construction project that exceeds $500 (labor and materials), requires a contractor to have an active license with the California Contractor State License Board (CSLB).
L 3 Communications Maripro Inc currently holds license 961893 (General Engineering Contractor), which was Active when we last checked.











How important is contractor licensing in California?



The CSLB is one of the highest rated licensing boards in the US. Applicants are required to pass a written board exam and prove at least four years of prior, relevant work experience. In addition, the CSLB requires all license holders to maintain at least $2,500 in operating capital and provides you with a range of other consumer protections.











Your liability risk when hiring L 3 Communications Maripro Inc



Contractors in California are required to carry workers' compensation insurance if they have employees and proof of liability insurance with the cumulative limit of $1 million for licensees with five or fewer persons, and an additional 100,000 for each additional member over five, not to exceed $5 million total.











Financial recourse when hiring L 3 Communications Maripro Inc



All licensed contractors in California are required to maintain a bond, which provides you with financial recourse in case they perform defective work or violate license regulations. If you feel as though you have been taken advantage of, you should leave feedback on the contractor's BuildZoom profile and file a complaint with the CSLB.
L 3 Communications Maripro Inc has a $12,500 bond with Hartford Fire Insurance Company. 











What else should I know before hiring L 3 Communications Maripro Inc



California contractors are required to submit their fingerprints to the board, which are then checked against criminal records held by the California Department of Justice (DOJ) and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) prior to obtaining a valid contracting license.











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



The California State License Board recommends getting at least three written bids before hiring a contractor. Do not automatically accept the lowest bid - an abnormally low bid may indicate the contractor made a mistake and is not including the same work quoted by their competitors. We've made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.
