There are 329 glyphs contained in this font, including OpenType variants accessible via OpenType applications.


Desktop Licence

                This is the most common type of font license, allowing you to install a font on your desktop computer 
                or laptop for use in all major desktop software pages such as InDesign, Word, Illustrator, and 
                Photoshop, in both Mac and Windows. You can then use your fonts for making and printing documents, and 
                also in images that contain the font as a graphic. You need to register the font for every computer 
                where it will be used, so be sure to purchase the correct number of computer users.
View Desktop Licence Agreement ›

Webfont Licence

                This gives you the permission to use a font on your website, allowing it to be properly displayed in 
                any web browser. By selecting the webfont license you will receive fonts with the CSS rule @font-face 
                only. Webfonts can’t be installed for use in design, layout, illustration, word-processing or other 
                programs on your computer, they are for online usage only as you will also need a Desktop license for 
                that type of usage. Webfonts are licensed for a monthly number of page views, and also for the number 
                of domains where they are used. See our webfont FAQ section for more detailed information on this.
View Webfont Licence Agreement ›

eBook Licence

                Our eBook license provides you with the rights for the font to appear in any format that uses embedded 
                e-text, such as any digital book, magazine, or publication. Our eBook fonts are licensed for the total 
                number of published titles.
View eBook Licence Agreement ›

Application Licence

                This gives you permission to use a font in iOS, Android, Google, or Windows Phone applications on 
                hand-held devices. Our application fonts are unlimited, so once you’ve licensed the font you can 
                install it in as many applications as you like.
View Application Licence Agreement ›

Server Licence

                This allows fonts to be used in online applications where the user creates personalized products 
                containing fonts that aren’t licensed to them personally. This includes posters, gift cards,  
                clothing, mugs, business cards, stickers, wedding invitations, device cases, and other personalised 
                gifts. This is a one-year license that needs to be renewed, and the cost is based on the number of 
                servers where the font is installed, hence the name.
View Server Licence Agreement ›

Gaming Licence

                Our gaming license allows you to install fonts within video games on any platform or device. It also 
                allows the installation of fonts within gambling devices, portable or kiosk-style, as well as any 
                online, tablet, or mobile related gaming device. Usage is granted according to the total number of 
                devices specified on purchase. So… if you’re looking to launch your game on three platforms, for 
                example PS4, iOS, and Android, then you’ll need three gaming licenses.

About this font
Fitzgerald was inspired by the carved and gilded lettering seen over the entrance of a bar in Dublin.  The result is a lovely piece of neo-Victorian fun that brings back the joy of 19th century shop-signs and flamboyant design ethos.  Fitzgerald is ideal for poster work and signage, or anywhere that you want to bring back the joy of high Victorian design ethos.
