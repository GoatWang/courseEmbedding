Mr. Raisbeck was a director of CarVal, a distressed asset management company owned by Cargill, and of Black River Asset Management, a hedge fund owned by Cargill, until 2009, and was during the last five years a member of the Boards of Directors of Cardinal Health, Inc., Canadian Pacific Railway Company and Canadian Pacific Railway Limited. Mr. Raisbeck is 67.
 
Mr. Raisbeck's depth of experience in the areas of trading and risks related to commodities and raw materials, which are significant components of our operations and the manufacturing of our products, is a valuable addition to our Board and its Finance Committee. Given his professional experience managing trading businesses and other risk-based, finance-related transactions, we believe Mr. Raisbeck has unique capabilities and insight with respect to the managing of risk exposure and execution of financing transactions. His substantial experience serving on the boards of directors of other companies and his varied corporate management experience allows us to leverage his experiences with respect to, among other things, appropriate oversight and related actions utilized in the board environment, including corporate governance matters as Chair of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, and as a member of the Compensation and Management Development Committee, the Health, Safety, Environmental, and Security Committee, and the Finance Committee.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/23/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

As with all your investments through Fidelity, you must make your own determination whether an investment is appropriate for you.  Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.  Foreign securities are subject to interest-rate, currency-exchange-rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.  Illiquidity is an inherent risk associated with investing in real estate and REITs.  There is no guarantee the issuer of a REIT will maintain the secondary market for its shares and redemptions may be at a price which is more or less than the original price paid.  Closed-end funds can trade at a discount to their NAV.  Shareholders of Master Limited Partnerships may be treated as partners for tax purposes.  Partnerships issue a Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) rather than a Form 1099 form for tax purposes. It lists the partner's share of income, deductions, credits, etc.  Speak with your tax advisor to determine how this may affect you.  A royalty trust is a type of corporation, mostly in the United States or Canada, usually involved in oil and gas production or mining.
