Trivago.com, billed as the world's largest hotel search site, named Newport, R.I., among its Top 50 Best Ranked Cities for Hotels. The City by the Sea came in at No.17 (Boston was No. 10). Trivago's Reputation Ranking Index, as they call it, combines and averages hotel ratings for every city in America that have at least 50 hotel properties, and aggregates hotel ratings from 31 websites. In all, more than 140 million hotel ratings taken from those sites were used to calculate the findings.Addtionally, Fodor's Travel has released data around visitors' most common queries on fodors.com, which set a record in 2014 with 20 million page views in a single month. Newport saw the biggest increase in page views over the year, making it the top U.S. destination on the rise.

Expedia®+ Voyager Credit Card Review: How Does it Stack Up? 
























































































Expedia®+ Voyager Credit Card Review: How Does it Stack Up Against Other Travel Cards?








Simon Zhen




Jun 02, 2017 |
            Be First to Comment!

























If you're like me, you probably make it a habit of booking trips through online travel sites. They're great tools for finding deals on flight, hotels, and more. Some even offer their own credit cards to help you save more money on travel -- a great way to get rewarded for your loyalty.
I took a look at the four major online travel sites that offer credit cards -- Priceline, Travelocity, Expedia, and Orbitz -- and compared their cards to determine the best online travel site card.
Here's what I looked at when reviewing the Priceline Rewards™ Visa® Card, Travelocity® Rewards American Express® Card, Expedia®+ Voyager, and Orbitz Rewards Visa® cards:
Travel Site Cards - Rewards rates



Card
Bonus rewards
Base rewards




Priceline Rewards Visa
5 points per dollar on priceline.com purchases
1 point per dollar on all other purchases


Travelocity Rewards American Express
3 points per dollar on eligible Travelocity purchases
1 point per dollar on all other purchases


Expedia+ Voyager
4 Expedia+ points per dollar on eligible Expedia purchases and 2 Expedia+ points per dollar on dining & entertainment
1 Expedia+ point per dollar on all other purchases


Orbitz Rewards Visa
10% Orbucks back on eligible hotels booked via mobile app (8% through desktop/web) and 7% Orbucks back on flight booked via mobile app (6% through desktop/web)
2% Orbucks on all other purchases



You want to earn points fast, so you can get those free flights and hotel stays. So, it makes sense to first look at how quickly these online travel site credit cards can make that happen.
Orbitz Rewards Visa ®Takes First Place
Based on the numbers alone, you can see that the Orbitz Rewards Visa® card stands out with its amazing rewards rates on travel purchases made through the Orbitz website. The caveat to Orbitz is that you'll have to deal with their rather confusing Orbucks program. But once you have that figured out, great rewards follow.
For example, you can get 10% back on eligible hotels booked through the Orbitz mobile app. You can also use the mobile app to get 7% back on flights.
If you're not an app person, you can still get good rewards on desktop, but it's important to know that they differ. Either way, Orbitz rewards are highly competitive with travel credit cards.
Priceline and Travelocity Take Second Place
But, Priceline Rewards™ Visa® Card and Travelocity® Rewards American Express® Card have simple rewards programs. You get bonus points on travel purchases made through their sites and a flat 1 point per dollar for everything else.
Such a simple program stresses one thing: you’ll get value from these cards only if you use them for travel purchases. Otherwise, any other rewards card would be better.
Priceline Rewards™ Visa® Card gives more points per dollar on bonus travel but Travelocity® Rewards American Express® Card picks up the slack with a stellar redemption option.
Expedia®+ Voyager Takes Third Place
The Expedia®+ Voyager card has a rewards program that aims to convince cardholders to always keep the card in their wallets.
You’ll get bonus points for booking travel through Expedia — which is usually done online. But to get bonus points for restaurants and entertainment, you’ll have to carry the Expedia®+ Voyager card in your wallet.
To encourage more spending, the card gives you 5,000 bonus Expedia+ points. This happens when you spend $10,000 in the prior year (a 0.05% point bonus on $10,000 spent).
After our Review of the Expedia®+ Voyager Card we realized that while the rewards rate is decent and the bonus is nice, that's not enough to differentiate Expedia from the pack.
WINNER (Rewards rate): Orbitz Rewards Visa® Credit Card
Travel Site Cards - Redemption



Card
Priceline Rewards Visa
Travelocity Rewards American Express
Expedia+ Voyager
Orbitz Rewards Visa




Bonus rewards
5 points per dollar on priceline.com purchases
3 points per dollar on eligible Travelocity purchases
4 Expedia+ points per dollar on eligible Expedia purchases and 2 Expedia+ points per dollar on dining & entertainment
10% Orbucks back on eligible hotels booked via mobile app (8% through desktop/web) and 7% Orbucks back on flight booked via mobile app (6% through desktop/web)


Base rewards
1 point per dollar on all other purchases
1 point per dollar on all other purchases
1 Expedia+ point per dollar on all other purchases
2% Orbucks on all other purchases


Redemption options
Statement credit toward any purchase
Statement credit toward any Travelocity purchase in the past 90 days
Flights and hotel stays booked through Expedia
Qualifying hotel booking through Orbitz


Redemption value
1 point per cent, starting at $25
Increments of 5,000 points for $50, 7,500 points for $75 or 20,000 points for the cost of an airline ticket or flight + hotel package up to maximum credit of $400
Varies based on travel reward
$1 Orbuck per $1



The Orbitz Rewards Visa® Credit Card may help you rack up points the fastest, but the value of those points may not be as great as they initially seem. With the accumulated Orbucks, you can only redeem for bookings at qualifying hotels through Orbitz. That can be restrictive when you're missing the other major aspect of travel: flights.
The Expedia®+ Voyager card also forces you to use your points toward travel booked through Expedia, but at least you can use the points for flights and hotels. These redemptions are not as limiting. They are great if you happen to always find the best prices on Expedia.
Meanwhile, the two remaining cards only offer statement credits, which mean your balance is being erased by however much you earn back. I feel statement credits are the best reward options -- think of it as receiving a refund on a past purchase -- very convenient.
The Travelocity® Rewards American Express® Card has one noteworthy highlight. It lets you redeem a statement credit for up to $400 on flights or eligible hotels and vacation packages with no blackout dates, booked through Travelocity for just 20,000 points (2 cents of value per 1 point). That’s an incentive for you to save up those points instead of redeeming at the lower denominations. The Priceline Rewards™ Visa® Card, however, is very attractive because of its extremely flexible redemption options. You can pretty much “erase” any purchase with your accumulated points. (Reminds me of the popular Barclaycard Arrival Plus™ World Elite MasterCard®.)

The optimal redemption on the Travelocity® Rewards American Express® Card is the $400 statement credit for 20,000 points, which can be earned with $6,667 in Travelocity purchases (3 points/$). Meanwhile, to redeem $400 on the Priceline Rewards™ Visa® Card, you’ll need 40,000 points, which can be earned with $8,000 in Priceline purchases (5 points/$).
So, you’ll get slightly better redemption values with the Travelocity® Rewards American Express® Card, but you’ll have more flexible redemption options with the Priceline Rewards™ Visa® Card. There’s no proper way to evaluate the two advantages so I’m calling it a tie between the two.
WINNER (Redemptions): Tie (Priceline Rewards™ Visa® Card and Travelocity® Rewards American Express® Card)
Annual Fee

Priceline Rewards™ Visa® Card: $0
Travelocity® Rewards American Express® Card: $0
Expedia®+ Voyager: $95
Orbitz Rewards Visa® Credit Card: $0

Travel credit cards are notorious for having annual fees -- often because they have various travel perks that justify such fees (e.g., free checked bags, complimentary lounge passes and companion tickets).
None of the online travel agency credit cards have any ties to specific airlines or hotel chains, so they don’t really have any of these standout travel benefits that would warrant an annual fee.
Of the four cards, only Expedia®+ Voyager has an annual fee. At $95 per year, it’s a quite a lot for anyone who doesn't like annual fees. But, the card has a set of great travel benefits -- particularly its $100 statement -- to make up for that fee.
However, when strictly speaking about the cost of the annual fee, it’s a three-way tie between the Priceline Rewards™ Visa® Card, Travelocity® Rewards American Express® Card, and Orbitz Rewards Visa® Credit Cards.
WINNER (Annual fee): Tie (Priceline Rewards™ Visa® Card, Travelocity® Rewards American Express® Card, and Orbitz Rewards Visa® Credit Card)
Interest Rates

Priceline Rewards™ Visa® Card: 14.99-21.99% APR
Travelocity® Rewards American Express® Card: 14.99-24.99% APR
Expedia®+ Voyager: 14.24-22.24% APR
Orbitz Rewards Visa® Credit Card: 15.99-24.99% APR

It’s never a good idea to pay interest on a credit card, especially a rewards credit card. Also, rewards credit cards tend to have higher interest rates, which is the case for all four online travel agency credit cards.
Their APRs are relatively similar but the one with lowest average APR is Expedia®+ Voyager. Meanwhile, the Orbitz Rewards Visa® Credit Card has the highest average APR -- probably because it has such high rewards rates.
Even though Expedia®+ Voyager takes the cake for interest rates, (again) I don’t ever suggest that you pay interest on any rewards credit card. The value of your rewards will be wiped out by those interest charges.
WINNER (Interest rate): Expedia®+ Voyager
Card Coverages
Did your flight get delayed for a long time? You might be compensated for lodging, food, and more as you wait for the next flight. This is just one example of how card coverages can be useful. Every credit card comes with its own suite of card coverages that you should take into account.
Below is a table that lists out the protection and coverages offered by each card:
A Barclaycard spokesperson did not reply to me with a full guide of benefits for the Priceline Rewards Visa and Travelocity Rewards Amex cards. The information below is based on standard Visa benefits (for Priceline) and on the latest Travelocity Rewards Amex benefits guide I could find online.

With the exception of the Travelocity® Rewards American Express® Card, all of the online travel agency cards provide a decent set of card coverages that encompass regular retail purchases to travel. You’ll notice that, for the Priceline Rewards™ Visa® Card and Orbitz Rewards Visa® Credit Card, I highlight certain coverages that are available only to Visa Signature cards.
Visa Signature is the upper tier version of Visa Platinum -- they offer different benefits. Priceline and Orbitz will give out different versions depending on your credit. Essentially, you want the Visa Signature version because of its extended list of coverages.
Again, looking at the chart, I’d say that the Visa Signature versions of the Priceline Rewards™ Visa® Card and Orbitz Rewards Visa® Credit Card offer the best card coverages in the group. Expedia®+ Voyager was almost able to keep up with these two cards but it fell out of the contest because it doesn’t offer travel services and assistance (I spoke with a Citi customer service rep to confirm this).
WINNER (Card coverages): Tie (Priceline Rewards™ Visa® Card andOrbitz Rewards Visa® Credit Card)
Travel Site Cards - Travel Benefits



Card
Travel benefits




Priceline Rewards Visa
No pre-set spending limit and personal concierge; travel upgrades and discounts at select Visa partners (Visa Signature)


Travelocity Rewards American Express
None


Expedia+ Voyager
$100 annual statement credit for airline incidentals on qualified airlines or Wi-Fi carries or for the Global Entry fee; no foreign transaction fees and free personal concierge


Orbitz Rewards Visa
No pre-set spending limit and personal concierge; travel upgrades and discounts at select Visa partners (Visa Signature) plus no foreign transaction fees



We’re talking about online travel agency credit cards here, so we have to look at the travel perks that these cards offer (if any).
Right off the bat, Travelocity® Rewards American Express® Card is looking bad due to a lack of any noteworthy travel benefits. So, lets focus on the other cards.
Given that Priceline Rewards™ Visa® Card and Orbitz Rewards Visa® Credit Card are capable of being Visa Signature cards, you can receive free nights and discounts through Visa’s hotel and car rental partners. However, the Orbitz Rewards Visa® Credit Card stands taller with the waived foreign transaction fees, which means you’re not going to pay currency exchange fees when swiping your card abroad.
However, the card with the best travel perk is definitely Expedia®+ Voyager. The $100 statement credit can be used for a basket of things including checked bags, in-flight meals, Wi-Fi access, lounge passes on 10 major airlines (AirTran Airways, Alaska Airlines, American Airlines, Delta Airlines, Frontier Airlines, JetBlue Airways, Southwest Airlines, United/Continental Airlines, US Airways and Virgin America Airlines) and the $100 Global Entry application fee. The Global Entry program allows pre-approved travelers to receive expedited clearance upon entry into the U.S.
Expedia®+ Voyager card has a $95 annual fee because of the $100 statement credit. If you can maximize this $100 statement credit, you’ll more than recoup the annual fee. Top this perk off with the rest of the card’s travel benefits and you’ve got a solid travel companion.
WINNER (Travel benefits): Expedia®+ Voyager
Verdict: Priceline Rewards™ Visa® Card
Oddly, the Priceline Rewards™ Visa® Card and Orbitz Rewards Visa® Credit Card actually tied with three winning categories each. So, why did I give the crown to thePriceline Rewards™ Visa® Card?
Firstly, the hotel-only redemption option on the Orbitz card stood out as a major restriction to how you can spend your points. And, it carries the highest average APR of the group. These two aspects led me to favor the Priceline Rewards™ Visa® Card.
Winners and Losers, You Decide
Ultimately, you know what's best for your needs and preferences. This rundown is meant to give you as much information as possible, but you know yourself better than anyone else.
Your credit cards should help you enjoy and get the most out of your experience, but they are not the experience. Choose your destination, choose your credit card, and be present in the moment.

The Best Travel Apps of 2015


More





Kayak 

Free
Travel search website Kayak.com is one of my favorite sites for finding the best deals on flights, especially when I'm picky about the details: what time to leave, number of layovers, and which airlines I can use. In its early days, Kayak only handled search (although it was one of the best at that end of the game), but now you can prepay for flights, hotel reservations, and even car rentals. Additionally, Kayak includes in its searches other aggregation services, like Orbitz and Priceline, to truly make sure you find the best deal.
Available on: Android, iOS, Kindle Fire, Windows Phone, Web

  

Maps.Me
Free
The Maps.Me mobile app lets you browse around the globe, zoom in on any region or city, and download a detailed map of that area to use offline. You'll see an option to download just the map or the map with directions enabled to get you from point A to B without an Internet connection. What I like about Maps.Me is the great level of detail on maps for lesser traveled places, such as Freetown, Sierra Leone (shown), which isn't well mapped by Google Maps. It's a must-have travel app for those who wander off the beaten path.
 Available on: Android, Amazon Fire, BlackBerry, iOS

  

MenuPages
Free
When on road trips, you can often find restaurants nearby using Google Maps or Yelp, but you can't always see how much the food costs or what's on the menu. MenuPages fills in those gaps, telling you whether a cup of coffee is going to run you a dollar or an arm and a leg. Even when menus are rotating, MenuPages gives you a sample menu from a previous day. It's a great travel tool, currently covering New York City, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Boston, Chicago, South Florida, and Washington, D.C.
Available on: Android, iOS, Web

  

OpenTable
Free
Snag a dinner reservation in less than a minute with the OpenTable app. OpenTable is pretty widely used in major cities in the U.S. and Canada, as well as in London. It lets you find restaurants that meet your criteria, see opening times, read reviews, and make reservations online at no charge. It's a great restaurant resource when you're in any city, but especially while traveling.
Available on: Android, Amazon Fire, BlackBerry, iOS, Web, Windows Phone

  

Orbitz Flights, Hotels, Cars

Free
Orbitz Flights, Hotels, Cars searches for the best travel deals, lets you book them, and offers a price guarantee if another user books the same travel as you for less.

Available on: Android, iOS, Kindle Fire, Web

  

Packing Pro

$2.99
Packing Pro is a mobile app made for list makers. It helps you remember what to pack and can also serve as evidence of what you packed if your luggage were ever lost. It has plenty of sample lists of items to pack for different types of travel, or you can create your own and tick off items as they go into your luggage. The $3 app may seem like overkill to those who have packing down to a science already, but it can be an excellent tool for parents who are packing for multiple family members before leaving on vacation.
Available on: iOS

  

Roadtrippers
Free
Tell Roadtrippers your starting location and destination, dates of travel, and what kinds of things you're interested in finding along the way, and this app will plot your journey for you. Roadtrippers can find offbeat attractions, restaurants, museums, amusement parks, camp sites, and more. When you find a site you like, just add it to your trip, and Roadtrippers will redraw your travel map accordingly.
Available on: Android, iOS, Web

  

Roomer Travel
Free
We all know we can save a good deal of money by booking hotels in advance. The problem, especially on road trips, is that we don't always get to the destination in time for the reservation, and if you've paid ahead, you're out of luck. Not so if you use Roomer. This app and website (roomertravel.com) helps travelers sell their prepaid reservations to people who can use them to recoup some of that otherwise lost cost. If you need a hotel in a pinch, you can also see if anyone on Roomer is trying to offload a hotel room in your desired location. Everyone wins.
Available on: Android, iOS, Web

  

SkyScanner
SkyScanner's mobile app has such a Free
wonderful search interface for finding cheap flights. I love that you can look for a flight on certain dates from your home airport to anywhere in the world based on where it might be inexpensive to fly during that time. You can then adjust your search using a wonderfully intuitive and interactive graph to find the cheapest surrounding dates to travel. SkyScanner partners with a site called ebookers.com for the actual sale, and note that SkyScanner's prices appeared for me in U.S. dollars while ebookers' showed up in GBP. The company makes separate apps for hotel and car rentals.
Available on: Android, BlackBerry, iOS, Windows 8, Windows Phone, Web

  

TripAdvisor
Free
TripAdvisor is one of the most best online sources for travelers, particularly because it has in-depth reviews of hotels, restaurants, and sites to see. Photos uploaded by other users are also helpful for getting a glimpse of a place from an unbiased point of view. TripAdvisor is one of the richest resources you'll find because it has a huge and active community.
Available on: Android, iOS, Nokia, Windows Phone, Web

  

TripCase

Free
TripCase is a free app that helps you organize your itineraries. You use the app by forwarding confirmation emails from travel services to a special address. TripCase then pulls the most important information from those confirmation emails and arranges them into a day-by-day or even hour-by-hour summary of your trip. It's very similar to the next app in this list (TripIt), except that TripIt pulls information directly from your email account while TripCase relies on you sending it along.
Available on: Android, iOS, Web

  

TripIt

Free
TripIt is a mobile app for Android and iPhone that connects to your email accounts and automatically compiles your travel information based on confirmation emails you receive. TripIt finds the important details for flights, hotels, rental car reservations, and even restaurant bookings, then collates them in order into an itinerary. If you worry about not having all your details in one place, TripIt is a wonderful travel organizer.
Available on: Android, BlackBerry, iOS, Windows Phone

  

Tripomatic

Free
Tripomatic helps you plan what to do and see on your next trip, and on which days. You can use it in advance of your trip to put together a daily agenda, or use it on the spot to find sites to see, a cafe to have coffee, or restaurant in which to eat. Tripomatic has more than thousands of attractions listed in hundreds of destinations. The app syncs with the website Tripomatic.com, so you can tinker with your itineraries on a full sized screen if you prefer. Many of the top destinations have offline content, such as maps, photos, and visitors guides.
Available: Android, iOS

  

Triposo
Free
Driving through the desert or deep into mountains, you can't be sure you'll have Internet access. Triposo puts offline maps and travel guides onto your phone so you can use them even in dead zones. Before you download maps and guides for any destination, Triposo tells you how much space they will take up on your phone, too. When you pull up a destination on Triposo, it offers top sightseeing suggestions, a weather forecast, and more ways to explore the destination.
Available on: Android, iOS

  

TV Food Maps
Free
A friend turned me onto TV Food Maps after she raved about its value on her last big U.S. road trip. This interactive app and website finds restaurants and eateries that have appeared on various television food shows, such as Bizarre Foods American, Top Chef, $40 a Day, Restaurant Impossible and (groan) Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives. What could be more American than eating your way through a road trip?
 Available on: Android, iOS, Web

  

Uber
Free
Getting around a foreign city can be a royal pain, especially if you don't speak the language, don't have any currency, or don't know the etiquette rules for tipping or haggling. Uber eases all these pains and others. With this car service app, you can request a car and tell the driver where to pick you up by dropping a pin on a map. The app gives you a fare estimate for a ride to your destination, and the driver can see it on the map, too. When your ride is over, Uber charges your credit card the right amount, and you don't have to tip. Uber is worldwide, with service more than 50 countries.
Available on: Android, iOS, Web (mobile browser required)

  

 Viator
Free
Looking to save some money but still do some interesting site-seeing? Viator shows you deals and discounts either nearby or in the place you're going to visit next--provided that location is in Viator's list of potential cities, regions, and countries. It's great for ideas of what to see and do, especially when you're feeling clueless, although the quantity and quality of the deals varies dramatically by place.
Available on: Android, iOS

  

Wanderu
Free
If you don't drive but want to take a road trip, try Wanderu. This app and website is a search aggregator and price comparison tool for bus and train tickets. Enter the dates you want to travel, plus your beginning and ending point, and Wanderu will look for fares on Amtrak, Greyhound, MegaBus, Bolt Bus, TrailwaysNY, BestBus, and other bus and train carriers.
 Available on: Android, iOS, Web

  

Waze
Free
Waze is a community-driven app for traffic and other information about the road, including police speed traps, potholes, and accidents. While Google Maps tells you about major reported road problems, Waze knows the nitty-gritty. You can even see the speeds at which cars are traveling in congestion. In cities, it's popular among taxi and car service drivers, but it's equally useful on highways. Beware, though: Waze needs to use your location information all the time, even in the background, which will take a toll on your battery.
Available on: Android, iOS, Windows Phone

  

Yelp

Free
The beauty of Yelp, an app that offers user-generated recommendations for businesses, is that it's used widely by a lot of people. If you show up at a destination and want to find a decent cup of coffee within walking distance, Yelp will probably do the best job. While some other travel apps have plenty of recommendations from other travelers, Yelp is more likely to be used by locals. It's especially good with restaurants, but Yelp can also help you find auto repair shops, health clinics, and other places you might need to visit unexpectedly while on a trip.
Available on: Android, BlackBerry, iOS, Web, Windows Phone

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
