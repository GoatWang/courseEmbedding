overview/highlights.xsloverview/strategy.xslFund StrategyThe Fund seeks high current income by actively managing a diversified portfolio of U.S. and international high yield and investment-grade debt securities. It selects sector concentrations driven by evaluation of capital markets. The Fund actively adjusts a blend of fixed-income securities to manage risk, seek enhanced yield, and offer total return potential.Diversification does not assure a profit or protect against loss.overview/mngmt.xslPortfolio ManagementKenneth J. Taubes, Portfolio ManagerMr. Taubes, an executive vice president and Chief Investment Officer of U.S. Investment Management, joined Amundi Pioneer in 1998 and has been an investment professional since 1983.Andrew Feltus, CFA, Portfolio ManagerMr. Feltus, a senior vice president and Director of High Yield and Bank Loans, joined Amundi Pioneer in 1994 and has been an investment professional since 1991.Charles Melchreit, Portfolio ManagerMr. Melchreit, a senior vice president and Director of Investment Grade, joined Amundi Pioneer in 2006 and has been an investment professional since 1986.Portfolio Management Perspective"In-depth, bottom-up research, timely asset allocation, and well-diversified bond asset classes are the foundation of our portfolio construction and security selection process. We believe this approach allows higher yields and higher returns than a core bond strategy alone allows without increased risk."overview/footnotes.xslA WORD ABOUT RISKInvestments in high yield or lower-rated securities are subject to greater-than-average price volatility, illiquidity and possibility of default. When interest rates rise, the prices of fixed-income securities in the Fund will generally fall. Conversely, when interest rates fall, the prices of fixed-income securities in the Fund will generally rise. Investments in the fund are subject to possible loss due to the financial failure of issuers of underlying securities and their inability to meet their debt obligations. Prepayment risk is the chance that an issuer may exercise its right to prepay its security, if falling interest rates prompt the issuer to do so. Forced to reinvest the unanticipated proceeds at lower interest rates, the fund would experience a decline in income and lose the opportunity for additional price appreciation. The securities issued by U.S. Government sponsored entities (i.e., FNMA, Freddie Mac) are neither guaranteed nor issued by the U.S. Government. The portfolio may invest in mortgage-backed securities, which during times of fluctuating interest rates may increase or decrease more than other fixed-income securities. Mortgage-backed securities are also subject to pre-payments. Investing in foreign and/or emerging market securities involves risks relating to interest rates, currency exchange rates, economic, and political conditions. At times, the Fund's investments may represent industries or industry sectors that are interrelated or have common risks, making it more susceptible to any economic, political, or regulatory developments or other risks affecting those industries and sectors. These risks may increase share price volatility.overview/bankbox.xslNot FDIC insuredMay lose valueNo bank guarantee						Before investing, consider the product's investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses.

The Overall Morningstar RatingTM is based on a weighted average of the star ratings assigned to a fund's three, five, and ten year (as applicable) time periods.  The Morningstar Category identifies funds based on their underlying portfolio holdings. Classifications are based on portfolio statistics and compositions over the past three years. For funds less than three years old, category classifications are based on life of the fund. Pioneer Strategic Income Fund was rated exclusively against U.S.-domiciled multisector bond funds as follows: 4, 3 and 4 stars among 233, 190 and 103 funds for the three-, five-, and 10-year periods ended 6/30/17, respectively.  The Morningstar Rating is for Class A Shares only. Ratings may vary among share classes.Ratings are based on past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Star ratings do not reflect the effect of any applicable sales load. The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.

Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted.  The performance data quoted represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate, and shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. All results are historical and assume the reinvestment of dividends and capital gains.Performance results reflect any applicable expense waivers in effect during the periods shown. Without such waivers, fund performance would be lower. Waivers may not be in effect for all funds. Certain fee waivers are contractual through a specified period.

If you paid a 1% sales charge, your returns would be lower than shown above. Class C Shares held for less than one year are subject to a 1% contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC).The performance of Class K shares for the period prior to the commencement of operations of Class K shares on December 20, 2012 is the net asset value performance of the fund's Class A shares, which has not been restated to reflect any differences in expenses, including 12b-1 fees applicable to Class A shares. Since fees for Class A shares generally are higher than those of Class K shares, the performance of Class K shares prior to their inception would have been higher than the performance shown. For the period beginning December 20, 2012, the actual performance of Class K shares is reflected. Class K shares are not subject to sales charges and are available for limited groups of eligible investors, including institutional investors.Class R Return if Redeemed: The performance of Class R shares for the period prior to the commencement of operations of Class R shares on 4/1/03 is based on the performance of Class A shares, reduced to reflect the higher distribution and service fees of Class R shares. For the period after April 1, 2003, the actual performance of Class R shares is reflected, which performance may be influenced by the smaller asset size of Class R shares compared to Class A shares. The performance of Class R shares does not reflect the 1% CDSC that was in effect prior to July 1, 2004.Performance for periods prior to the inception of Class Y Shares on 9/9/04 reflects the NAV performance of the Fund's Class A Shares. The performance does not reflect differences in expenses, including the 12b-1 fees applicable to Class A Shares. Since fees for Class A Shares are generally higher than those of Class Y, the performance shown for the Class Y Shares prior to their inception would have been higher. Class Y shares are not subject to sales charges and are available for limited groups of investors, including institutional investors.NAV results represent the percent change in net asset value per share. Returns would have been lower had sales charges been reflected. The Bloomberg Barclays (BBG Barc) U.S. Universal Index (benchmark) is the union of the U.S. Aggregate Index, the U.S. High Yield Corporate Index, the 144A Index, the Eurodollar Index, the Emerging Markets Index, the non-ERISA portion of the CMBS Index, and the CMBS High Yield Index. Municipal debt, private placements and non-dollar-denominated issues are excluded. The Lipper Multi-Sector Income Funds Average represents the average annual returns for all Multi-Sector Income Funds for the respective time periods. Indices are unmanaged and their returns assume reinvestment of dividends and, unlike fund returns, do not reflect any fees or expenses. You cannot invest directly in an index. Periods less than one year are actual, not annualized.perf/bankbox.xslNot FDIC insuredMay lose valueNo bank guarantee						Before investing, consider the product's investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses.

The Overall Morningstar RatingTM is based on a weighted average of the star ratings assigned to a fund's three, five, and ten year (as applicable) time periods.  The Morningstar Category identifies funds based on their underlying portfolio holdings. Classifications are based on portfolio statistics and compositions over the past three years. For funds less than three years old, category classifications are based on life of the fund. Pioneer Strategic Income Fund was rated exclusively against U.S.-domiciled multisector bond funds as follows: 4, 3 and 4 stars among 233, 190 and 103 funds for the three-, five-, and 10-year periods ended 6/30/17, respectively.  The Morningstar Rating is for Class A Shares only. Ratings may vary among share classes.Ratings are based on past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Star ratings do not reflect the effect of any applicable sales load. The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.

All results are historical and assume the reinvestment of dividends and capital gains.Performance results reflect any applicable expense waivers in effect during the periods shown. Without such waivers, fund performance would be lower. Waivers may not be in effect for all funds. Certain fee waivers are contractual through a specified period. Otherwise, fee waivers can be rescinded at any time. See the prospectus and financial statements for more information.The Average Maturity of certain funds might not be a useful measure if they contain securities with principal paydowns, such as mortgage passthroughs. Instead, market participants calculate Average Life, which reflects the average time to receipt of principal payments (scheduled principal payments and projected prepayments).

Overview


				Pioneer Funds - Strategic Income is a multi-sector bond fund that invests across a broad range of global fixed income sectors, including core U.S. investment grade, non-investment grade, non-U.S. country, currency and floating rate asset classes. The Fund’s benchmark is the Barclays Capital U.S. Universal Index.

    










Philosophy


The Portfolio adheres to three core investment tenets: value, diversification[1] and protection against downside risk.
 
Value-Driven: The Portfolio seeks to invest in sectors that offer attractive relative value, based on fundamentals and on spread relationships to long-term averages. Value investing seeks to capitalise on the benefits of rebalancing through dynamic allocation, which can make a significant contribution to portfolio returns over time.
 
Broad Diversification: The Portfolio’s diversification level seeks to benefit from incorporating a broad range of factors and sectors, which helps it pursue attractive risk-adjusted returns. Diversification available from asset classes with lower correlation to core sectors can help reduce volatility and downside risk.
 
Protection Against Downside Risk: The Portfolio has historically been successful in limiting downside risk and avoiding permanent impairment of capital has reflected its disciplined approach to limiting issuer concentrations combined with strong fundamental credit research, avoiding at-risk sectors and avoiding market value loss in rising interest rate environments. 
 
[1] Diversification does not ensure a profit or protect against a loss











Integrated Investment Process


				The Portfolio’s active, value-driven investment process combines top-down and bottom-up research with the insights and tools of quantitative and qualitative analysts to assess potential buy and sell candidates for the portfolio.

1 Downside risk is the risk of the actual return being below the expected return.
2 Diversification does not assure a profit or protect against loss.
3 Correlation is the degree to which assets or asset class prices have moved in relation to one another. Correlation ranges from -1 (always moving in opposite directions) through 0 (absolutely independent) to 1 (always move together).

Ratings and rankings are based on past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Star ratings do not reflect the effect of any applicable sales load. The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods. Rankings are based on average annual total returns for listed periods and do not reflect any applicable sales load.

A Word About Risk:
Investments in high yield or lower-rated securities are subject to greater-than-average price volatility, illiquidity and possibility of default. When interest rates rise, the prices of fixed income securities in the Fund will generally fall. Conversely, when interest rates fall, the prices of fixed income securities in the Fund will generally rise. Investments in the Fund are subject to possible loss due to the financial failure of issuers of underlying securities and their inability to meet their debt obligations. Prepayment risk is the chance that an issuer may exercise its right to prepay its security, if falling interest rates prompt the issuer to do so. Forced to reinvest the unanticipated proceeds at lower interest rates, the Fund would experience a decline in income and lose the opportunity for additional price appreciation. The securities issued by US government-sponsored entities (e.g., FNMA, Freddie Mac) are neither guaranteed nor issued by the US Government. The portfolio may invest in mortgage-backed securities, which during times of fluctuating interest rates may increase or decrease more than other fixed income securities. Mortgage-backed securities are also subject to pre-payments. Investing in foreign and/or emerging markets securities involves risks relating to interest rates, currency exchange rates, economic and political conditions. At times, the Fund's investments may represent industries or sectors that are interrelated or have common risks, making them more susceptible to any economic, political, or regulatory developments or other risks affecting those industries and sectors. These risks may increase share price volatility.   















This material is not intended to replace the advice of a qualified attorney, tax advisor, investment professional or insurance agent. Before making any financial commitment regarding the issues discussed here, consult with the appropriate professional advisor. Mutual fund investing carries risks. Investment return and principal values fluctuate, and shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.

Fund Facts


Objective
High current income
 
Approach
The Fund seeks to enhance total return and significantly outperform its index, while delivering benchmark-like volatility and managing downside risk1 , through dynamic investment across a diversified2 range of global fixed income asset classes and currencies. This strategy can serve as an investor’s core fixed income allocation, while offering the potential for higher returns with its increased opportunity set. The Fund strives to achieve volatility similar to that of a core bond portfolio, due to the diversification benefits of lower-correlated asset classes. Pioneer Strategic Income Fund pursues an active, value-driven investment approach, seeking to add value primarily through dynamic asset allocation and security selection.

Neither Morningstar nor its content providers are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information. Fidelity does not review the Morningstar data and, for fund performance, you should check the fund's current prospectus or other product materials for the most up-to-date information concerning applicable loads, fees and expenses.



1. No Transaction Fee funds are available without paying a transaction fee. No Transaction Fee funds will also be offered without a load or on a load waived basis. However, the fund may charge a short term trading fee or a redemption fee. Other fees and expenses, including those which apply to a continued investment in the fund, are described in the fund's current prospectus. Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC ("FBS"), or its affiliates, receives compensation in connection with (i) access to, purchase or redemption of, and/or maintenance of positions in mutual funds and other investment products ("funds"), (ii) infrastructure needed to support such funds as well as additional compensation for shareholder services, start-up fees, infrastructure support and maintenance, and other programs and/or (iii) a fund's attendance at events for FBS's clients and/or representatives, and opportunities for the fund to promote its products and services. This compensation may take the form of sales loads and 12b-1 fees described in the prospectus and/or additional compensation paid by the fund, its investment adviser or an affiliate. Additional information about the source(s) and amount(s) of this compensation as well as any other remuneration received by FBS or its affiliates will be furnished upon request.
2. Any holdings, asset allocation, diversification breakdowns or other composition data shown are as of the date indicated and are subject to change at any time. They may not be representative of the fund's current or future investments. Some breakdowns may be intentionally limited to a particular asset class or other subset of the fund's entire portfolio, particularly in multi-asset class funds where the attributes of the equity and fixed income portions are different. Under the asset allocation section, international (or foreign) assets may be reported differently depending on how an investment options reports its holdings.  Some do not report international (or foreign) holdings here, but instead report them in a "Regional Diversification" section.  Some report them in this section as an to the equity, bond and other allocation shown.  Others report international (or foreign) holding as a subset of the equity and bond allocations shown.  If the allocation without the foreign component (or round to) 100%, then international (or foreign) is a subset of the equity and bond percentage shown.
3. A standard yield calculation developed by the Securities and Exchange Commission for bond funds. The yield is calculated by dividing the net investment income per share earned during the 30-day period by the maximum offering price per share on the last day of the period. The yield figure reflects the dividends and interest earned during the 30-day period, after the deduction of the fund's expenses. It is sometimes referred to as "SEC 30-Day Yield" or "standardized yield".
4. Fixed Income StyleMap� StyleMap� depictions of mutual fund characteristics are produced using data and calculations provided by Morningstar, Inc. StyleMapsSM estimate characteristics of a fund's fixed income holdings over two dimensions: credit quality and interest rate sensitivity.  Current StyleMap characteristics are calculated each time Morningstar receives updated portfolio holdings from a fund and are denoted with a dot. Historical StyleMap characteristics are calculated for the shorter of either the past 3 years or the life of the fund, and are represented by the shading of the box(es) previously occupied by the dot. StyleMap characteristics represent an approximate profile of the fund's holdings, are based on historical data, and are not predictive of the fund's future investments. Although the data are gathered from reliable sources, accuracy and completeness cannot be guaranteed.


Generally, data on Fidelity mutual funds is provided by FMR, LLC, Morningstar ratings and data on non-Fidelity mutual funds is provided by Morningstar, Inc. and data on non-mutual fund products is provided by the product's investment manager, trustee or issuer or the plan sponsor whose plan is offering the product to  participants.  Although Fidelity believes the data gathered from these third-party sources is reliable, it does not review such information and cannot warrant it to be accurate, complete or timely.  Fidelity is not responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this third-party information.

Before investing, consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the fund or annuity and its investment options. Contact Fidelity for a free prospectus and, if available, summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.
