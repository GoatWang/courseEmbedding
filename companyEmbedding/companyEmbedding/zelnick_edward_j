From the Court: Jury Verdicts & Settlements
              $5.7 million awarded in med mal case



May 
              1, 2006 By Review Staff & Verdict Search

              Linda AlleyCase: Alex Palanza, Mary Jane Palanza and Michael Palanza 
              v. Eric Freling, M.D., Edward J. Zelnick, M.D., and Corina J. Waldman, 
              M.D.

              Case no.: 96-04961(13), Broward Circuit Court

              Description: Medical malpractice

              Filing date: April 11, 1996

              Trial date: March 13, 2006

              Judge: Thomas M. Lynch IV

              Plaintiff attorneys: Linda Alley and Valerie Conzo, Law Office of 
              Sheldon Schlesinger in Fort Lauderdale

              Defense attorney: Liana Silsby, George Hartz Lundeen Fulmer Johnstone 
              King & Stevens in Fort Lauderdale

              Details: On April 26, 1994, Mary Jane Palanza, who was 32 weeks 
              pregnant, had her water break. She called her OB/GYN's office, where 
              she spoke with the surgeon on duty. He told her to go to Hollywood 
              Memorial Hospital to be seen. Palanza's pregnancy was considered 
              a high risk due to complications she encountered with a previous 
              pregnancy. At 12 weeks, her doctors put a cerclage - a stitch - 
              in place to close her cervix. When she arrived at the hospital, 
              she was seen by Dr. Zelnick, a partner of her prenatal OB/GYN, Dr. 
              Waldman. Zelnick examined her and saw that the stitch was still 
              in place. He tested for infection around the stitch, since its presence 
              increased the risk. Results of the test were not obtained for three 
              days, at which point they came back positive for infection. Zelnick 
              gave Palanza drugs to hold off labor and steroids to mature the 
              baby's lungs. On the third day of her hospital stay, after two days 
              of contractions, Palanza gave birth to a boy, Alex. Freling was 
              the doctor in the delivery room. He had examined Palanza earlier 
              in the day and had told Palanza to try to hold in the baby because 
              he was too small to deliver. Alex was born with a Grade 2 (on a 
              scale of 4) brain hemorrhage and cerebral palsy, which has affected 
              three of his limbs. Alex has had to have subsequent surgery to loosen 
              his leg muscles to allow him to walk. He currently can walk with 
              pronounced gait and balance problems, Alley said. She said he will 
              be OK cognitively but will have to work harder in school to keep 
              up.

              Plaintiffs' case: Alley and Conzo argued that negligence on the 
              part of Zelnick, Freling and Waldman led to Alex's disabilities. 
              No one checked Palanza's cervix the day she went into labor, Alley 
              said, and therefore no one knew she was almost fully dilated and 
              the baby ready to be born the morning of April 28, 1994. The build-up 
              of pressure combined with the uterine infection and the premature 
              birth caused Alex's brain hemorrhage, Alley said. She argued that 
              the doctors examining Palanza needed to take out the cerclage in 
              order to relieve the pressure on Alex and that Palanza's doctors 
              should have started her on antibiotics when she arrived at the hospital. 
              Experts also testified, Alley said, that because of her previous 
              pregnancy complications Palanza should have been put on bed rest.

              Defense case: Silsby argued the doctors did everything appropriately 
              and the reason for the hemorrhage was Alex's premature birth. "The 
              doctors followed all appropriate care," she said.

              Outcome: After a five-week trial and 2 1/2 days of deliberations, 
              the jury decided that Freling was 60 percent responsible for Alex's 
              disability, Zelnick was 40 percent responsible and there was no 
              negligence on the part of Waldman. The jury awarded $556,000 for 
              Alex's medical expenses, $250,000 for his lost earning ability, 
              $1 million for his past pain and suffering and $3.5 million for 
              future pain and suffering. The award totaled $5.3 million. The jury 
              also awarded $450,000 to Mary Jane and Michael Palanza for Alex's 
              past and future medical expenses.

              Post-trial: Silsby said the case is not yet over. She said there 
              will be a hearing, tentatively set for May 9, to rule on modifications 
              to the final judgment. These may include offsets for settlements 
              with other defendants. There is also a pending defense motion for 
              a new trial.

              Comments: Alley said she thinks the jury decided Freling was most 
              responsible for what happened to Alex because Palanza was clearly 
              in labor the morning of the April 28, 1994, and instead of delivering 
              the baby, he "gave her a lecture about not complaining" 
              and ignored the comments her nurse was relaying about Palanza's 
              pain.
