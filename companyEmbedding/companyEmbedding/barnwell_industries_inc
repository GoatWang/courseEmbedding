Barnwell Industries swings to profit





By Howard Dicus - bio | emailHONOLULU (HawaiiNewsNow) - Barnwell Industries, which has holdings on the Big Island and in Canada, has posted a $1.5 million quarterly profit.
Honolulu-based Barnwell (NYSE: BRN) owns land around Hualalai Resort and has oil and natural gas leases in Alberta.
The company lost $17 million in the same quarter last year, but most of it was a "paper loss" caused by a regulatory requirement to book assets differently.
Barnwell also noted that oil prices doubled from the same quarter last year.

Cautionary 
    Statement Relevant To Forward-Looking Information For The Purpose Of "Safe 
    Harbor" Provisions Of The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act Of 
    1995
This 
    web site, and the documents incorporated herein by reference, contain "forward-looking 
    statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform 
    Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 
    21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. A forward-looking 
    statement is one which is based on current expectations of future events or 
    conditions and does not relate to historical or current facts. These statements 
    include various estimates, forecasts, projections of Barnwell's future performance, 
    statements of Barnwell's plans and objectives, and other similar statements. 
    Forward-looking statements include phrases such as "expects," "anticipates," 
    "intends," "plans," "believes," "predicts," 
    "estimates," "assumes," "projects," "may," 
    "will," "will be," "should," or similar expressions. 
    Although Barnwell believes that its current expectations are based on reasonable 
    assumptions, it cannot assure that the expectations contained in such forward-looking 
    statements will be achieved. Forward-looking statements involve risks, uncertainties 
    and assumptions which could cause actual results to differ materially from 
    those contained in such statements. The risks, uncertainties and other factors 
    that might cause actual results to differ materially from Barnwell's expectations 
    are set forth in the "Forward-Looking Statements," "Risk 
    Factors" and other sections of Barnwell's annual report on Form 10-K for the last fiscal year and Barnwell's other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Investors should not place undue reliance on these 
    forward-looking statements, as they speak only as of the date of filing and Barnwell expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking 
    to publicly release any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements 
    contained herein.
