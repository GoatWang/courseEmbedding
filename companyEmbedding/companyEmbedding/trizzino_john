ID Biomedical (IDBE) Announces The Appointment Of John Trizzino To Senior Vice President, Business Development











Tweet








10/19/2005 5:08:57 PM



VANCOUVER, July 7  /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- ID Biomedical announced today that it has appointed John Trizzino as its new Senior Vice President of Business Development. Mr. Trizzino was formerly Vice President of Business Development for the Henry Schein Medical Group and previously Vice President and General Manager of Henry Schein's General Injectables and Vaccines (GIV) specialty distributor division.
Mr. Trizzino comes to ID Biomedical with over 23 years of broad corporate experience. He has wide spread and expert knowledge of the US vaccine market with a focus on influenza vaccine in the private and public sectors. Mr. Trizzino has worked closely and has established solid relationships with all parties in the influenza business from the CDC and manufacturers to distribution and the provider community. Mr. Trizzino has established himself as a leader in the vaccine community by his significant accomplishments at Henry Schein, his work with the CDC and Influenza Summit and his work as a Healthcare Distribution Management Association (HDMA) Board member.
"We are very excited about John joining our management team," said Todd Patrick, President of ID Biomedical. "His experience and knowledge of the vaccine market has significant value to ID Biomedical. Additionally, as we approach the close of ID Biomedical's purchase of the Shire vaccine division, John's experience and the respect he has earned throughout the vaccine community will be further leveraged. John's initial focus will be on advancing our partnership discussions in Europe and other international markets outside of North America."
"I look forward with great anticipation to my work at ID Biomedical; with the addition of the Shire vaccine division, this company, in my opinion, offers the most significant product portfolio and pipeline in the vaccine marketplace worldwide" said John Trizzino. "I have known the senior management team for several years and I am excited to be working with them. There is much to be gained by the work already done by Tony, Todd and Staph and I am anxious to complement their work and contribute to the future success of this company."
About ID Biomedical
ID Biomedical is a biotechnology company focused on the development of proprietary subunit vaccine products, including those based on its Proteosome(TM) platform intranasal adjuvant/delivery technology.
ID Biomedical is developing non-live, subunit vaccines for the prevention of a number of different diseases, as well as vaccines against biological warfare agents. The Company's lead products in clinical development are the FluINsure(TM) intranasal influenza (flu) vaccine and the StreptAvax(TM) group A streptococcal vaccine. Additionally, the Company has several vaccines in preclinical development.
The information in this news release contains so-called "forward-looking" statements. These include statements about ID Biomedical's expectations, beliefs, intentions or strategies for the future, which may be indicated by words or phrases such as "anticipate", "expect", "intend", "plan", "will", "we believe", "ID Biomedical believes", "management believes", and similar language. All forward-looking statements are based on ID Biomedical's current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties and to assumptions made. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements include: (i) the possibility that the transaction currently proposed between Shire Pharmaceuticals Group plc and ID Biomedical will take longer than expected to complete; (ii) the possibility that some or all of the conditions of closing for such transaction will not be satisfied or waived and that such transaction will, therefore, be terminated before it is completed; (iii) the possibility that the terms of such transaction will be altered prior to completion thereof, including as may be required to satisfy conditions of required regulatory consents; (iv) the ability to successfully complete preclinical and clinical development of its products; (v) the ability to obtain and enforce timely patent and intellectual property protection for its technology and products; (vi) the ability to avoid, either by product design, licensing arrangement or otherwise, infringement of third parties' intellectual property; (vii) decisions, and the timing of decisions, made by the health regulatory agencies regarding approval of its products for human testing; (viii) the ability to complete and maintain corporate alliances relating to the development and commercialization of its technology and products; (ix) market acceptance of its technology and product; and (x) the competitive environment and impact of technological change. There is no guarantee that the development path from Phase I to Phase II to Phase III and so on will be either linear or successful. ID Biomedical bases its forward-looking statements on information currently available to it, and assumes no obligation to update them.

Novavax, Inc.
Novavax Appoints John J. Trizzino as Senior Vic...
Novavax Appoints John J. Trizzino as Senior Vice President, Commercial OperationsGAITHERSBURG, Md., March 10, 2014 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Novavax, Inc. (Nasdaq:NVAX), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of recombinant nanoparticle vaccines and adjuvants, today announced the appointment of John J. Trizzino to the position of Senior Vice President, Commercial Operations, effective March 10, 2014. Mr. Trizzino will be responsible for developing and implementing the commercialization strategy in support of the company's product candidates, including its RSV F, quadrivalent seasonal and pandemic influenza vaccine candidates.Mr. Trizzino previously served as Novavax' Senior Vice President of International and Government Alliances beginning in 2009 and its Senior Vice President of Business Development from 2010 to 2011. In these roles, Mr. Trizzino played a key role in negotiating the company's $179 million contract with HHS BARDA. Mr. Trizzino brings the depth and breadth of vaccine industry knowledge, along with extensive experience with the global influenza and RSV markets, required for this position. Most recently he was the CEO of Immunovaccine, and prior to his time at Novavax, served as Vice President of the Vaccine Franchise at MedImmune LLC, Senior Vice President of Business Development at ID Biomedical and Vice President of Business Development at Henry Schein, Inc., all the while having commercial responsibility within the pediatric and adult infectious disease vaccine market."With our success in product development in the clinic, and our expectations around future development plans, we recognize the need to maximize the value of our vaccine candidates through a fully developed commercialization strategy. John's knowledge of the vaccine industry, with specific experience in vaccine commercialization, distribution and reimbursement, provide us with the insight needed to develop that commercialization strategy," said Stan Erck, President and CEO of Novavax. "We are very excited to have John return to the team and look forward to his contributions to our success.""Novavax is at an important milestone in the development of its RSV, seasonal influenza and pandemic influenza vaccines. As these vaccine candidates move into the later stages of clinical development it is the right time to develop a commercialization strategy to ensure a successful path to market. Novavax' RSV vaccine has the opportunity to be the first vaccine to address the significant burden of this disease in both the very old and the very young. The cost of treating RSV illness, hospitalization and preventing loss of life is a multibillion dollar global market opportunity. I am looking forward to working with the Novavax team again in pursuit of these and the other vaccine candidates in its pipeline."About NovavaxNovavax, Inc. (Nasdaq:NVAX) is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company creating novel vaccines and vaccine adjuvants to address a broad range of infectious diseases worldwide. Using innovative proprietary recombinant protein nanoparticle vaccine technology, the company produces vaccine candidates to efficiently and effectively respond to both known and newly emergent diseases.
