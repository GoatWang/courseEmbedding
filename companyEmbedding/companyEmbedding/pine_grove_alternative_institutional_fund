NEW YORK, Jan. 22, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- Pine Grove Asset Management LLC (PGAM) today announced the launch of the Pine Grove Alternative Institutional Fund (Alt Instl Fund), its first registered closed-end fund under the Investment Company Act of 1940.
The Alt Instl Fund adds to the well-established fund-of-funds offerings at PGAM, which was founded in 1994 and is one of the oldest, independent firms in the hedge fund industry. The Alt Instl Fund will provide accredited investors with streamlined access to relative value and event driven hedge fund strategies with a core focus on credit investing.
With the launch of the Alt Instl Fund, PGAM took deliberate steps to convert a private, unregistered fund into a registered '40 Act fund format. The investment goals, strategies and limitations of the registered fund are substantially similar to those of its predecessor unregistered fund, unlike most other registered offerings.  
"Continuing to invest in our underlying managers' flagship portfolios was extremely important to us when we constructed this vehicle," said Matthew Stadtmauer, PGAM President. "Since the new Alt Instl Fund acquired the assets of its predecessor fund, it will be one of the only '40 Act funds that benefits from a 16-year performance history."
One means of accessing Pine Grove's new registered closed-end fund will be through CAIS, the leading financial product platform servicing the independent wealth management community. "CAIS provides advisors with turnkey access to funds and, with the recent Fidelity–CAIS strategic alliance, CAIS brings broad coverage of the registered investment advisor and broker-dealer community," Stadtmauer continued.
The Alt Inst Fund invests into hedge funds that employ a variety of investment strategies, including, but not limited to, distressed credit investing, hedged credit, convertible arbitrage and long/short equity (low net exposure).
"By focusing on credit strategies, we are offering investors exposure to managers who exploit market inefficiencies that most traditional long-only funds are not capturing," said Tom Williams, PGAM CIO. "Our portfolio construction is positioned to handle a potential rise in interest rates as the managers we allocate to usually display negative correlation to high quality bonds."

IMPORTANT DISCLOSURES
This closed-end Fund seeks long-term capital appreciation. Actual performance and results may vary substantially from the stated objectives with respect to risks. Investments in the Fund are speculative and are meant for sophisticated investors. Investors may lose all or a substantial part of their investment. There are no secondary markets for interests/shares in the Funds and none are expected to develop. There are also substantial restrictions on liquidity and transfers, so an investor may not have access to capital when it is needed and may have to bear the risk of an investment longer than anticipated.
Certain of the Fund's managers may employ leverage or short selling, may purchase or sell options or derivatives and may invest in speculative or illiquid securities. It should be noted that fund of funds have multiple layers of fees and expenses that may offset profits. An investment in the Fund is also subject to distressed securities risk, interest rate risk, high yield securities risk, convertible securities risk, other asset back security and collateralized loan obligation risk, non-U.S. securities and government securities risk, foreign and currency risk, non- diversification risk and small and medium capitalization risk. All of which will impact an investment in the Fund. Finally, it should be noted that this is a brief summary of the investment risks.
Investors should consider the investment objectives, risks, fees and expenses carefully before investing. For a prospectus with this and other information about the Fund, please call (855) 699-3103. Read the prospectus carefully before investing. Distributed by Foreside Fund Services, LLC.

Pine Grove Refashions Credit Strat. As Mutual Fund Of Hedge Funds
Jan 24 2014  |  12:01pm ET

Fund of hedge funds Pine Grove Asset Management has transformed its credit vehicle into a mutual-fund structure.
The Pine Grove Alternative Institutional Fund is a closed-end fund offering access to relative-value and event-driven managers, focused on credit.
"Continuing to invest in our underlying managers' flagship portfolios was extremely important to us when we constructed this vehicle," Pine Grove President Matthew Stadtmauer told HedgeWeek. "Since the new Alt Instl Fund acquired the assets of its predecessor fund, it will be one of the only '40 Act funds that benefits from a 16-year performance history."
"By focusing on credit strategies, we are offering investors exposure to managers who exploit market inefficiencies that most traditional long-only funds are not capturing," Pine Grove chief investment officer Tom Williams added. "Our portfolio construction is positioned to handle a potential rise in interest rates as the managers we allocate to usually display negative correlation to high-quality bonds."

 Beyond the tear sheet: War stories from the front lines of hedge fund due diligence 
 Investing in private partnership structures such as hedge funds, private equity and private real estate can be a fruitful and exciting endeavor, especially when venturing into asset classes that lack competition and efficiency. An important qualification to remember when beginning due diligence on a partnership is that no investment is perfect. Each one has its own risks, however esoteric or idiosyncratic, and risks change over time, as do the operations and other intricacies of investment management.

Liquid alts offer FoHF industry new avenues for branding and asset growth


					December 05, 2014

					 
                    
				

					Investor choice widens as fund of hedge funds firms continue to launch retail-focused RIC and ’40 Act product offerings, enabling them to access new pools of investment capital

    liquidity, liquidity'

By Siobhán Hallissey



 



 





    Open-ended liquid alternatives have overshadowed their
    closed-end siblings over the last few years as the liquid
    alternatives industry continues to grow both in terms of assets
    and number. This is not a surprise as a growing majority in the
    hedge fund industry see the rise of mutual fund offerings as a
    trend that is still in its infancy. 

    

For a growing number of retail shoppers, the daily liquidity
    fund of hedge funds (FoHF) industry now comprises 32 funds,
    which manage close to $10 billion compared to the eight funds
    that managed just over $3 billion this time last year.
The majority of the firms that have entered the open-ended
    market so far are Billion Dollar Club firms, with Permal Asset
    Management, Abbey Capital and Rothschild and Larch Lane among
    the new entrants over the course of the last 12 months (
    click here for table).
However closed-end RICs registered with the SEC under the
    1940 Act, which are generally aimed at the high-net worth
    market, have also experienced growth. The industry grew by 24%
    in the 12-month period to 31 March 2014 to manage $23 billion,
    as funds of hedge funds continued to deploy hedge fund
    strategies within a regulated framework in order to reach a
    broader investor base. When combined, open-ended and closed-end
    RICs total $33 billion (see table, right).
The 24% growth and median return of 7.78% over the same
    12-month period suggest that the industry is continuing to gain
    momentum and that the landscape is still developing in terms of
    breadth and diversification.
However, the total asset growth rate does not appear to be
    representative of the entire industry, as the divergence
    between the individual RICs’ asset growth ranged
    from 216% on the positive side to -52% at the other end of the
    spectrum. All of the RICs achieved positive returns over the
    period, but 40% of the funds saw outflows – despite
    making high returns in a number of cases. The median growth
    rate of the industry was 4.70%, compared to -7.45% in the
    previous year, and this figure provides an alternative
    indication of the growth of the closed-end 1940 Act FoHFs.
The industry grew despite the total number of RICs falling
    to 88 compared to 93 in the previous year. Existing RICs were
    the main contributors to the growth rate and the funds with the
    largest asset growth grew by over 100%.



 



 
Ray Nolte



    There were five new master funds launched over the 12-month
    period, including the second offering from SkyBridge Capital,
    and the first products from Steben & Co and Pine Grove
    Asset Management. Of the 88 RICs listed in the 
    table of SEC registered FoHFs, 51 are master funds while
    the remaining 37 are feeder funds that differ from the master
    fund in terms of fees and tax structures depending on the
    investor. Tax-exempt investors in the US for example, would
    utilise a tax-exempt feeder such as a TEI fund that feeds into
    the master fund. The underlying hedge fund portfolios of the
    feeder funds are managed at the master fund level and, as such,
    the total asset figure includes the assets of the master funds
    only to avoid double counting. The expenses and return of the
    feeder funds are included in the table to present the
    differences that occur across the master and feeder tranches. 

    

SkyBridge Capital manages the largest of the closed-end RICs
    and half of its total assets invested in hedge funds –
    which stood at $11 billion at the mid-year point, according to
    the InvestHedge Billion Dollar Club survey – are
    invested via these structures.
The largest of the RICs, SkyBridge Multi-Adviser Hedge Fund
    Portfolios, had $5.58 billion in assets to the end of March,
    following a growth rate of 57% over the 12-month period
    compared to the fund’s return of 12%. The fund is
    also one of the oldest RICs, with an official launch date of
    2002, under the Citi brand. The 2010 deal with Citi brought in
    the RIC offering and an investment team led by Ray Nolte.
Perhaps helping to further boost the brand is the
    star-studded SkyBridge Alternatives (SALT) conference held
    annually in Las Vegas since 2009. Also as an independent firm,
    SkyBridge has historically had access to multiple distribution
    platforms including Merrill Lynch, UBS, Wells Fargo and Raymond
    James among others (
    InvestHedge, October 2013).
"The growth in the asset flow has come from a very broad
    base, both from the individual side and institutions," explains
    Nolte, managing partner and chief investment officer at
    SkyBridge. "The biggest positive of the RICs structure comes
    when dealing with individual investors such as accredited and
    high-net worth investors, as it allows for 1099 tax reporting.
    This makes it simple for our clients to report their taxes in
    time for the April deadline and we set up RICs to ensure we
    could offer that."
He adds: "The registered nature of the product has also been
    helpful in the growth of the fund, as there is a greater
    comfort level for both individuals and institutions as we
    report the fund’s positions and holdings with the
    SEC every quarter."
SkyBridge launched its second RIC, the SkyBridge G II Fund
    in January of this year largely to meet investor demands, which
    came from US Registered Investment Advisors (RIAs) in
    particular. RIAs generally manage their client’s
    entire portfolio that would most likely include equities, bonds
    and alternatives.
Nolte says: "Investors liked all the attributes of a
    registered 1099 product but required a more diversified product
    than the SkyBridge Multi-Adviser Hedge Fund Portfolios.
    Investors were saying 'We really like the fund and the
    tactical, dynamic and high conviction nature of how you
    allocate to your chosen themes, can we get the process in
    slightly more diversified fashion?’ Therefore the
    SkyBridge G II Fund offers more diversification at the strategy
    and manager level and we tilt the portfolio based on our
    thematic point of view."
The new fund had $26.5 million in assets as of March 2014
    invested across three categories that include event driven
    (55%), directional equity (16%) and relative value (28%). By
    comparison SkyBridge Multi-Adviser Hedge Fund Portfolios
    allocation to event driven was much higher at 67% and the
    allocation to equity was much lower at 5%, while relative value
    was slightly lower at 25%. Overlapping names in both SkyBridge
    portfolios includes the Jana Nirvana Fund, with a little over
    6% allocation in each programme. The Trian Partners Fund,
    Paulson Recovery Fund and the York Select Fund also feature in
    the event-driven section of both portfolios.
While the SkyBridge offerings are the largest in our survey,
    the AllianceBernstein Multi-Manager Alternative Fund was the
    master RIC with the highest growth rate at 216%. The fund
    launched in October 2012 and during the reporting period
    surpassed its first year anniversary, which can often result in
    a pick-up in assets as potential investors often like to see at
    least a 12-month track record. The assets grew from $311
    million in March 2013 to $981 million by March 2014.
The AllianceBernstein fund was up by 8.04% for the period,
    investing in five strategies that included allocations to
    long/short equity, event driven, credit and distressed, global
    macro and emerging markets. The manager with the largest
    allocation was the Canyon Balanced Fund at 3.2%, while Fir Tree
    International Value Fund followed with 3.1%. The strong growth
    has continued over the course of 2014 and as of 30 September,
    the fund’s assets stood at $1.23 billion.
Asset inflows uneven, focused on brand names
All of the funds that saw inflows of over 100% had
    accumulated either a one or two-year track record during the
    reporting period and may have benefited from being able to
    present this to potential investors.
In terms of growth rate, Blackstone Alternative Asset
    Management followed closely behind AllianceBernstein, which
    launched its closed-end RIC the Blackstone Alternative Alpha
    Master Fund six months earlier in April 2012.
Recently, Blackstone signed a letter of intent with mutual
    fund shop Columbia Management to research and develop
    investment solutions that leverage Columbia’s
    asset management capabilities and Blackstone’s
    hedge fund solutions business. The addition of
    Blackstone’s alternative investment proficiency as
    captured through existing registered fund solutions will
    further enhance Columbia’s capability set,
    according to officials.
The Blackstone Alternative Alpha Master Fund grew by 172%
    with assets totalling $533 million at the end of March with a
    return of 8.98%. The Blackstone portfolio invests in Pershing
    Square, Jana Nirvana Fund, Tudor BVI Global Fund and Elliott
    International.
The Ironwood Institutional Multi-Strategy Fund and the JP
    Morgan Access Multi-Strategy Fund II both grew by over 100%
    over the course of the year. Common names among both RICs
    included DE Shaw Composite International Fund, OZ Overseas Fund
    and Perry Partners International.
The Ironwood Institutional Multi-Strategy Fund has seen its
    assets grow substantially since its January 2011 launch. The
    assets grew by 254% in its first full year, and by 243% in its
    second year with a further 163% growth rate over the 12 month
    period to April 2014. The portfolio turnover was 17.74%
    compared to 8.67% in the previous year and the new additions to
    the portfolio were mainly managers that offered greater
    liquidity. In the relative value multi-strategy category a
    manager that offered annual liquidity was redeemed while a new
    allocation was made to the Citadel Kensington Global Strategies
    Fund that offers quarterly liquidity. Furthermore in the
    market-neutral and hedged equity category, two managers with
    quarter liquidity terms were removed while the new manager
    offered monthly liquidity. The fund returned 9% during the
    reporting period compared to 10% in the previous year.
Of the master RICs listed in the table, more than half (59%)
    saw inflows and the assets of 85% of those funds increased by
    over 10%, outweighing the returns for the majority of the
    funds.
The 10 master RICs with the highest growth rate all grew by
    over 50% and four of the RICs saw inflows of over 100%. A
    minority of RICs were either flat or experienced outflows.
    Close to a third of the master RICs saw outflows of over 10%,
    highlighting the discrepancies that have occurred in the asset
    growth of the industry.
Examples include the ACP Strategic Opportunities Fund that
    saw outflows of close to 39% despite returning 13% over the 12
    months to December 2013. The firm, which recently approved a
    proposed investment advisory relationship with Barlow Partners,
    focuses on smaller and more flexible hedge fund managers
    – with the underlying managers including Consector
    Partners and Cooper Creek Partners. Likewise the SCS Hedged
    Opportunities Fund was up by over 10% but saw its assets drop
    by over 16%.
RIC returns average 8.17%, equity
    dominates
    RICs outperformed the InvestHedge Composite Index on both a
    median and average basis for the 12-month period to March 2014.
    While the composite gained 5.90% on a median basis and 5.61% on
    an average basis, the median RICs performance was 7.78% and
    average performance was 8.17%. The RICs also outperformed the
    HedgeFund Intelligence Composite, which represents the
    performance of single-manager hedge funds globally, on both a
    median and a mean average basis.
All of the RICs achieved positive returns of over 1.4%,
    while more than a quarter achieved double-digit returns. Morgan
    Creek Capital Management’s Global Equity/Long
    Short Master Fund was the leading performer with a return of
    25%. The $69 million fund has adopted a multi-asset investment
    portfolio with 18% of the assets invested directly in
    securities, which may account for the high return, and 70%
    invested in underlying portfolio funds.
The fund also had one of the highest portfolio turnovers at
    72% and overall 10 funds were removed from the portfolio,
    including both of the emerging markets managers, which
    accounted for 4.6% of the portfolio in March 2013 and included
    an allocation to The Russian Prosperity Fund.
A number of the high performers had large allocations to
    equity hedged strategies, which helped to drive the returns.
    Equity strategies were strong performers over the time period,
    and the S&P 500 was up by 22% while the HedgeFund
    Intelligence Equity Index was also up by over 12%. The A&Q
    Long/Short Strategies fund – formerly named
    O’Connor Fund of Funds: Long/Short Strategies
    – returned 16.87% for the 12-month period to December
    2013, although the assets fell by 6.40% despite the high
    return.
Compared to the other RICs the A&Q Long/Short Strategies
    Fund had a relatively low portfolio turnover at 5.34%, Brevan
    Howard and Meditor European Hedge Fund were two of the four
    funds in the portfolio that offered monthly liquidity but both
    funds have been redeemed since December 2012, along with
    Anthion Partners and Pershing Square. Two of the
    funds’ underlying funds now provide monthly
    liquidity with the remainder offering quarterly or semi-annual
    liquidity.
Another of UBS Alternative & Quantitative
    Investments’ RICs was a high performer –
    the A&Q Technology fund, which returned 16.76% –
    while the Morgan Stanley Global Long/Short Fund A followed
    closely behind with a return of 16.44% for the period to the
    December. The Visium Balanced Fund was one underlying manager
    listed in both RICs portfolios, being one of the largest of the
    A&Q Technology Fund’s holdings at 10.89%.
The Aetos Capital Distressed Investment Strategies Fund was
    up by 12% for the year ending January 2014, outperforming the
    InvestHedge Distressed Index by 3%. Due to the less liquid
    nature of the strategy the majority of the underlying funds
    offer annual or semi-annual liquidity. The Morgan Stanley
    Institutional Fund of Hedge Funds, Alternative Investment
    Partners Absolute Return Fund and Mellon Optima L/S Strategy
    Fund were also up by over 10%.
New RIC launches broaden the
    landscape
    Altogether there were five new RICs launched over the reporting
    period that contributed $256 million to the overall asset
    total.
The A&Q Master Fund, formerly named
    O’Connor Funds of Funds Master, launched on 1 July
    2013, UBS Alternative & Quantitative Investments renamed
    all of their RICs over the course of 2014 from
    O’Connor Funds of Funds to A&Q. The A&Q
    Master Fund classified its investments into three categories
    including equity hedged, an 85% slice of the assets at the end
    of March 2014, with the largest allocation to Viking Global
    Equities III at 7.1%, while Bronson Point Partners and Pennant
    Windward Fund both made up 7.01% of the $107 million fund.
The Steben Select Multi-Strategy Master Fund launched in
    August 2013 and had the strongest return of the new entrants,
    up by 9% to the end of March. The portfolio was employed across
    five strategies, and like the A&Q Masters fund allocated
    the largest slice to equity long/short, which stood at 36% of
    the total investment portfolio, followed by global macro with
    21%, equity market-neutral at 18%, fixed-income relative value
    at 15% and multi-strategy at 10%.
Pine Grove Asset Management, which was acquired by Man Group
    earlier this year, also entered the closed-end space with the
    launch of the Pine Grove Alternative Institutional Fund in
    January. Pine Grove took deliberate steps to convert a private
    unregistered fund into a registered ’40 Act fund
    format.
"Since the Pine Grove Alternative Institutional Fund
    acquired the assets of its predecessor fund, it will be one of
    the only ’40 Act funds that benefits from a
    16-year performance history," explains Matthew Stadtmauer,
    president of Pine Grove Asset Management.
The portfolio’s largest allocations were to
    credit and distressed strategies, hedged credit accounted for
    29% of the $58 million assets in the fund, with the largest
    allocations going to Anchorage Capital Partners and Fir Tree
    Capital Opportunity Fund. "Our portfolio construction is
    positioned to handle a potential rise in interest rates as the
    managers we allocate to usually display negative correlation to
    high quality bonds," explains Tom Williams, chief investment
    officer of Pine Grove Asset Management.
Other brand-name multi-manager firms actively launching
    offerings include Permal. The Permal Hedge Strategies Portfolio
    was launched on 12 June 2013 and Permal Hedge Fund Strategies
    I, which launched in February 2012, began investing as a feeder
    fund in Permal Hedge Strategies Portfolio along with Permal
    Hedge Strategies Fund II that launched on the 28 June 2013.
Similar to the SkyBridge portfolios, the Permal Hedge
    Strategies Portfolio invests in Trian Partners as well as funds
    managed by York Capital Management and Paulson & Co, with
    allocations to the Paulson Credit Opportunities and York
    Investments funds. The fund invests the majority of the assets
    in fixed-income hedge strategies, which stood at 31% at the end
    of March and the strategy was the leading contributor to the
    year-over-year performance. The Permal Hedge Strategies
    Portfolio returned 5% between June 2013 and March 2014 while
    the Permal Hedge Fund Strategies I was up by 9% for the full
    year.
A newer launch that missed the cut-off in our earlier survey
    is the Evanston Alternative Opportunities Fund, which launched
    over the summer and has gathered an additional $27 million for
    Evanston Capital Management. Evanston was founded in 2002 by
    David Wagner, who was formerly the vice president and chief
    investment officer at Northwestern University in Evanston,
    Illinois.
Overall number of RICs falls, fund turnover
    rises
    The total number of RICs fell as 16 funds left the rankings
    including two of the oldest RICs, the Advantage Advisers
    Whistler Fund advised by Oppenheimer Asset Management that
    launched in July 1999 and the Lazard Alternative Strategies
    Fund, which launched in September 2001.
In November 2013, the board of managers approved a plan of
    liquidation for the Advantage Advisers Whistler Fund to
    terminate its operations and liquidate at the end of 2013. At
    the same time the Lazard Alternative Strategies Fund was
    reorganised into the Lazard Alternative Strategies 1099
    Fund.
As a result of the reorganisation, the Lazard Alternative
    Strategies 1099 Fund acquired all the net assets of the Lazard
    Alternative Strategies Fund, accounting for the 99.89% growth
    rate of the Lazard Alternative Strategies 1099 Fund, which had
    $99 million in assets at the end of March 2014 compared to $50
    million in March 2013.
The Blue Rock Market Neutral Fund, Old Field Master Fund,
    Cantor Opportunistic Alternatives Fund, Multi-Manager Master
    Portfolio advised by GenSpring Family Offices and the BlackRock
    Alternatives Allocation Master Portfolio are the other funds
    that are no longer listed in the table as a result of
    liquidations and mergers.
The GMAM Absolute Return Strategies Fund I, managed by
    General Motors Investment Management, is also no longer listed
    in the table. The $5 billion RIC, which was previously listed
    in the rankings, grew by 10.05% in the year to March 2014 but
    has been removed from this year’s table as 
    the company uses the RIC structure to manage the pension
    fund’s hedge fund allocation and does not accept
    outside investment. The total RIC asset figure for March 2013
    has been readjusted to reflect this so as to ensure that the
    correct asset growth has been calculated.
The portfolio turnover of the RICs was higher than in the
    previous two years on both an average and median basis. The
    average portfolio turnover was 57% for the period to March 2014
    compared to 24% the previous year; however the 170% turnover
    figure for the Gottex Multi-Asset Endowment Master Fund, which
    invests in common stocks, ETFs and mutual funds as well as
    hedge funds, was the main contributor to this high figure. The
    median figure portfolio turnover was 20.58%, only slightly
    above the median portfolio turnover of 20.04% in the previous
    year.
The A&Q Multi-Strategy Fund had the second highest
    portfolio turnover at 74% as the equity hedged allocation was
    increased from 25% in the previous year to 37% to March 2014.
    The largest allocations in the equity hedged category went to
    two new managers, the Tiger Eye Fund and Shellback Offshore
    Fund. The portfolio turnover of the CPG JPMorgan Alternative
    Strategies Fund was also over 50%, despite only having seven
    underlying managers. Davidson Kempner and Double Black Diamond
    were redeemed over the period and were replaced by Atlas Global
    and Citadel Kensington Global Strategies Fund.
The RICs offer an insight into the investing trends of FoHFs
    as they share a number of common holdings and it is interesting
    to see the disparity in the categorisation of the funds across
    the different advisers. For instance King Street Capital,
    Silver Point Capital and Anchorage Capital Partners were among
    the most featured funds, but all three funds were categorised
    across the distressed, credit or event-driven allocations
    depending on the RIC portfolio. All three of these funds were
    listed in the portfolios of the $511 million Aetos Capital
    Distressed Investment Strategies Fund, the $503 million
    Grosvenor Registered Multi-Strategy Master Fund and the new
    Pine Grove Alternative Institutional Fund.
Likewise with Eton Park, the fund is listed as a manager in
    a number of the RICs but the fund’s categorisation
    in the various portfolios ranges across multi-strategy, event
    driven and arbitrage.
Pelham Long/Short features in the equity allocations of nine
    of the portfolios, while Blue Trend is listed in either the
    managed futures or macro allocations of eight RICs. Both hedge
    funds featured in the $461 million Morgan Stanley Institutional
    Fund of Hedge Funds RIC and offered monthly liquidity.
Another manager in the Morgan Stanley Institutional Fund of
    Hedge Funds RIC is the Magnetar Capital Fund, which appears in
    seven of the RIC portfolios including the $600 million
    Alternative Investment Partners Absolute Return Fund.
Other Magnetar funds that contributed to the 11% return of
    the Alternative Investment Partners Absolute Return Fund
    portfolio include the Magnetar Equity Opportunities Fund and
    the Magnetar Global Event Driven Fund.
Luxor Capital Partners, Tybourne Equity, Trient Global Macro
    and Monarch Debt Recovery Fund all featured in six of the RIC
    portfolios, and all the funds were listed among the underlying
    managers of the $78 million ASGI Aurora Opportunities Fund.
    Corvex Partners and Senator Global Opportunity Fund also had
    investments from over six of the RICs. Both funds contributed
    to the 10% return of the $482 million NT Alpha Strategies Fund,
    along with the Trient Global Macro Fund.
Wide range of fees and fee structures
Fee structure is an important differentiating factor
    between hedge funds and mutual funds. The total expense ratio
    is the figure that investors need to consider in the mutual
    fund industry, compared to the management and performance fees
    that are generally utilised by the hedge fund industry. The
    expense ratio of the RICs in the table ranges from 2.82% at the
    highest end of the spectrum to 0.10% at the lowest, with the
    median expense ratio figure at 1.99%.
Of those master RICs that have an associated feeder fund,
    the feeder funds generally have higher expense ratios as these
    facilitate certain investor types. The TEI feeder funds appear
    to have the highest expense ratios as the Hatteras Core
    Alternatives TEI Institutional Fund, The Endowment TEI Fund and
    the Rochdale High Yield Alternative Strategies Fund TEI all
    have expense ratios of over 2%.
Hatteras Core Alternatives TEI Institutional
    Fund’s expense ratio was 2.73%, more than double
    the 1.32% of the Hatteras Master Fund. On the other hand the
    difference between the Rochdale High Yield Alternative
    Strategies Fund TEI expense ratio of 2.25% and the Master Fund
    at 2.14% is significantly lower.
The expense ratio of the Arden Sage Multi-Strategy TEI
    Institutional Fund is the lowest of the TEI feeder funds at
    1.32%, with a return of 9%. Arden’s RIC, was
    invested across seven strategies including equity event,
    multi-event driven and credit event. The largest holding was to
    Lakewood Capital Partners, which accounted for 9% of
    members’ capital.
The lowest fee among the RICs is with one of the feeder
    funds offered by Blackstone Alternative Asset Management, which
    with nearly $60 billion in overall assets is the largest fund
    of hedge funds group in the world. The latest RIC fund in the
    Blackstone stable was launched in 2013 and has approximately $9
    million in assets and charges 0.1% to underlying investors, who
    have seen an annualised gain of 7.59%.
As investors look to alternatives to diversify their
    portfolios, the hedge fund investing industry is continuing to
    look at ways of diversifying the investor base by offering
    products in differing structures.
Looking at the registration filings, EnTrust Partners
    appears to be ready to enter this market by offering a
    registered product for their investors without constraints.
The closed-end RIC remains a useful tool to achieve those
    business development aims. Unlike their open-ended
    counterparts, the closed-end RIC structure allows FoHFs to
    access a much wider investor base without compromising
    returns.

iShares Europe ETF (IEV) – (Cash) – Daily
Near Term Trend: Bullish / NeutralFriday’s Close: 45.24 (- 0.59%)UPDATE: Last week, I suggested holding shorts until IEV approached $42.65 and covering / buying there. I suggested shorting if IEV bounced to $44.90.European stocks rallied past the $44.90 projected resistance – indicating the door is open to more upside. I’m thinking there will be a test of recent high near $46 and then a drop to $43.85.Short up near $46 and try buying near $43.85. Upside target will be $48 for buys made at $43.85.

PINE GROVE ALTERNATIVE INSTITUTIONAL FUND
NOTES TO SCHEDULE OF INVESTMENTS (Unaudited)


JUNE 30, 2014







 
Note 1. Organization
 
Pine Grove Alternative Institutional Fund (the “Master Fund”) is a Delaware statutory trust registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, as a non-diversified, closed end management investment company (the “Trust”), formed on June 21, 2013.  The Master Fund is offering on a continuous basis up to 200,000 shares of beneficial interest at net asset value per share.  Pine Grove Alternative Fund (the “Feeder Fund”) invests substantially all of its assets in the Master Fund.  As of June 30, 2014, the Feeder Fund represented 4.6% of the Master Fund’s net assets. The Master Fund’s investment objective is to seek long-term capital appreciation.  On October 9, 2013, the Fund was initially seeded through the sale of 100 shares for $100,000.  The
Master Fund commenced operations on January 1, 2014, after it acquired the net assets of Pine Grove Institutional Partners II Ltd. (the “Partnership”), in exchange for Master Fund shares in the amount of $44,760,197.
 
The investment adviser of the Master and the Feeder Fund is Pine Grove Asset Management LLC (the “Investment Adviser), a registered investment adviser with the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and a registered commodity pool operator with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”).  The Board of Trustees (the “Board” and each member a “Trustee”) of the Master and the Feeder Fund supervises the conduct of the Master Fund’s and Feeder Fund’s affairs and pursuant to an investment advisory agreement, has engaged the Investment Adviser to manage the Master Fund’s and Feeder Fund’s day-to-day investment activities.
 
Capitalized terms used, but not defined herein, shall have the meaning assigned to them in the Prospectus of the Master Fund.
 
Note 2. Fair Value Hierarchy
 
The Master Fund has a three-tier fair value hierarchy. The basis of the tiers is dependent upon the various “inputs” used to determine the value of the Master Fund’s investments. These inputs are summarized in the three broad levels listed below:


Level 1 — quoted prices in active markets for identical assets


Level 2 — Inputs are quoted prices for similar assets in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets in markets that are not active, and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable (such as models or other valuation methodologies). The Master Fund’s investments in Private Investment Funds which are generally included in this category include investments in Private Investment Funds where the Master Fund has the ability to withdraw at the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) at June 30, 2014 or within three months thereafter, under normal market conditions, and there are no other potential liquidity restrictions, such as redemption gates or suspensions.
 

Level 3 – Inputs are unobservable for the asset and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset as of the measurement date.  Investments in Private Investment Funds that are currently subject to liquidity restrictions that will not be lifted within three months of the measurement date will be considered level 3.

PINE GROVE ALTERNATIVE INSTITUTIONAL FUND
NOTES TO SCHEDULE OF INVESTMENTS (Unaudited)


JUNE 30, 2014














(a)


Convertible Arbitrage: Convertible Arbitrage is a strategy that entails purchasing convertible securities (convertible bonds or preferred stock) and hedging the equity risk by shorting the underlying common stock. Some managers attempt to hedge other risks associated with Convertible Arbitrage, such as interest rate risk and credit risk. One of the main risks in this strategy is the possibility of losses in the portfolio of long (or short) positions that are not offset by corresponding gains in the portfolio of short (or long) positions.
 



(b)


Distressed – Corporate: Distressed Corporate managers typically invest in the senior, secured, and/or liquidating debt of companies in financial distress and/or those entering or exiting bankruptcy. These investments can result in substantial or total loss due to business and financial risks but this is often mitigated by collateral coverage. Distressed investing is often associated with relative illiquidity, reduced transparency, and valuation involving significant management judgment.
 


 



(c)


Distressed – Structured Products: Distressed Structured Products managers buy pools of assets that have been securitized (bonds backed by the cashflows from these assets). Often this includes pools of mortgages that are not guaranteed by the government. It may also include pools of leveraged loans, commercial real estate, student loans and other kinds of assets. Usually the pools were once rated investment grade but the assets turned out to be of worse quality than the first investors originally thought they would be. Some managers may also buy agency derivatives. One of the main risks in this strategy is the possibility of losses in the portfolio of long positions if the manager assumptions regarding prepayments, defaults, recovery, etc. prove to be too aggressive. Also, agency derivatives in particular are very sensitive to borrower prepayment rates as well as the level of short term interest rates.
 



(d)


Hedged Credit: Hedged Credit managers typically take long and short positions in fixed income instruments of companies across the credit spectrum. Some also buy Structured Products. These managers may also buy equities, usually in companies that have some issue (e.g., they just came out of bankruptcy) or are otherwise difficult to understand. These managers hedge by shorting stocks and bonds that they think have a lot more downside than upside, even if only during a crisis. One of the main risks in this strategy is the possibility of losses in the portfolio of long (or short) positions that are not offset by corresponding gains in the portfolio of short (or long) positions due to incorrect analysis of idiosyncratic factors.
 



(e)


Long/Short Equity: Long/Short Equity managers attempt to buy undervalued equities and short overvalued equities. Managers selected for investment by the Investment Manager typically attempt to be either market neutral or have low net exposure to the equity markets. In this way, the manager is not relying on the market going up or down to make money. One of the main risks in this strategy is the possibility of losses in the portfolio of long (or short) positions that are not offset by corresponding gains in the portfolio of short (or long) positions. Short selling creates additional risk of limited upside and unlimited downside.
 



(f)


Other: Other represents investments in private investment funds for which the Master Fund expects to receive the redemption proceeds upon sale of the underlying investments. The Master Fund has redeemed from these private investment funds and has received a majority of the redemption proceeds. The current portfolio of underlying investments held by such private investment companies is illiquid in nature and is not necessarily indicative of the active investment strategies of such private investment funds.

The change in unrealized appreciation/(depreciation) also represents the change in unrealized appreciation/(depreciation) for investments still held at June 30, 2014.





There were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 for the period ended June 30, 2014. Transfers in and transfers out are generally due to the change in liquidity terms of Private Investment Funds and are recognized as of the end of the reporting period.
