Established in 1946 by James Harrison Gray, a New Englander who moved to Southwest Georgia, he formed Gray Communications Systems (now Gray Television) which has grown since 1993 into a modern-day, successful television group based out of Atlanta, Georgia through a series of acquisitions ranging from 1993-2014.

History[edit]
James H. Gray started his communication business with the purchase of The Albany Herald in 1946 after he returned from World War II. Gray launced WALB-TV in 1954 and was the second station in the state. In the 1960s additional stations were purchased in Louisiana and Florida. First in 1960, the Florida station was WJHG-TV in Panama City. While in the late 1960s, KTVE was the Louisiana station.[3]
In 1986, Gray died leaving his 50.% share of the stock in a trust for his children with stipulation that they run the business together, sell their stock each other or sell out together. This caused difficulties as two of the three wanted to sell with the third unable to purchases. In 1991 to break the stalemate, the board of directors had the company purchased 25% of their shares.[3]

The company was then taken public on NASDAQ's small-cap market in the 2nd quarter 1992. The price per share drop to $8. The company put itself or any part up for sale by the end of 1992. While the board of director received about 40 offer, Bull Run Corporation purchased the remaining shares of the Gray siblings, who as part of the deal resigned from the board.[3]
New management were put in place at all three units. Bull Run Corporation, primarily owned by J. Mack Robinson, decided make Gray a Southeast regional media company. Gray's first purchase were two TV stations (WKYT-TV and WYMT) from the failed and government seized Kentucky Central Life Insurance Co. in September 1994 after a court challenge to the sale by Kentucky Central builder Garvie Kincaid.[3]
In 1994 and 1995, Gray purchased two newspaper group with two newspapers, the Rockdale Citizen (acquired May 31, 1994) and Gwinnett Post-Tribune (acquired January 1995; quickly renamed Gwinnett Daily Post) and seven advertising weeklies. In 1995, the company moved its stock listing to the New York Stock Exchange. By this time, Robinson, directly or through Bull Run, owned 44% of the company's stock. Gray had started to focus on its TV station segment over the newspaper holding while TV produced more income and the newspapers' income were declining. Just months after doubling the Daily Post's staff, one third were laid off and a quarter of The Albany Herald's staff followed in January 1996. Newspaper leaders resigned during this period from the corporate president in late 1995 to Citizens' editor and publisher.[3]
In 1996, Gray added additional TV stations while entering additional communication industry segments. The company was considered in 1996 by Fortune magazine as the 81st fastest growing company having a 48% percent growth rate. WRDW-TV was purchased in January 1996. In September 1996 a basket purchase from First American Media, Inc., Gray got two TV stations (WCTV-TV and WVLT-TV), Satellite and Production Business Services, which was renamed Lynqx Communications and PortaPhone paging business.[3]
In August and September 1996, Gray raised additional operating funds by various means. On August 20, KTVE was sold for cash and accounts receivable. The company issued and sold Class B common stock (through a public offering), senior subordinated notes and preferred stock in September. Also, a new bank credit facility was arranged. This brought the company total $534.5 million in available funds with $409.5 million directly available.[3]
Also in September 1996, Ralph Gabbard, the newly named president and CEO, died from a heart attack at age 50. Robinson, Bull Run chair, took over as interim CEO and president with Rull Run CEO Robert Prather as interim executive vice-president, acquisitions.[3]
With its additional funds, Gray continued purchasing in 1997 with two announcements in January and February. The company bought Gulflink Communications, Inc., a transportable satellite uplink business based in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, in April 1997 to go along with Lynqx. With Raycom Media acquiring a station from AFLAC Broadcast Group, Inc. forcing them to sell WITN-TV to Gray, which was finalized on August 1, 1997. Gwinnett Daily Post increased circulation in 1997 through a deal with Genesis Cable Communications to provide the paper to its metro Atlanta subscribers at Genesis's expense.[3]
In 1998, Gray started to expand beyond its Southeast region. As the company agreed to purchase the Busse Broadcasting Corporation, which owned KOLN, KGIN-TV and WEAU. Gray's ownership of a newspaper and TV station in Albany, Georgia while grandfather was examined under Media cross-ownership in the United States rule of FCC due to this potential purchase.[3] WALB was thus was sold to Liberty Corp's Cosmos Broadcasting in August 1998.[4]
In 2002, Robinson became Chairman and CEO, his son-in-law Hilton Howell vice chairman, Prather president/COO and Jim Ryan senior vice president. They had Gray purchase 14 Benedek Broadcasting station while that company was in bankruptcy.[5]
Gray Television[edit]
In 2006, the company spun off its five daily newspapers and wireless messaging business into the newly formed Triple Crown Media,[6] later in 2010 is renamed Southern Community Newspapers.[7] A new strategy of purchasing station in college towns or capitals was put into place.[5]
The company had overpaid for a pair of stations. The station was over leveraged like many other station groups entering the Great Recession. Advertising revenues dropped. The twin problems caused its shares to trade at its lowest at 16 cents in 2008, thus the NYSE indicate they might delist the company. Loan covenants could have forced the company into default.[5] Robinson stepped down with Howell replacing him in 2008.[5]
On July 30, 2009, Gray was awarded a contract to manage seven Young Broadcasting-owned stations. Through December 31, 2012, Gray would earn $2.2 million and an opportunity to earn additional specified incentive fees if certain performance targets were exceeded.[8][9][10]
Prather left the company in 2013 and Howell took over the president title.[5] On November 4, 2013, Gray Television announced that it would purchase Yellowstone Holdings for $23 million, adding local stations: KGNS-TV, KGWN, KCWY, and KCHY-LP.[11] Three weeks later, on November 20, Gray announced it would purchase Hoak Media and Parker Broadcasting for $335 million, and North Dakota's Fox affiliate KNDX/KXND for $7.5 million. As part of the deal, stations KAQY, KHAS-TV, and KXJB, were proposed to be sold to Excalibur Broadcasting and operated by Gray under a "local marketing agreements".[12] On December 19, it was announced that stations KREX-TV and WMBB would be sold to Nexstar Broadcasting Group, while KFQX would be sold to Mission Broadcasting.[13] On March 25, 2014, Prime Cities Broadcasting, owner of KNDX/KXND, requested that the FCC dismiss the sale of KNDX/KXND to Excalibur.[14]
The sale was completed on June 13, 2014. However, some stations were forced to go off the air and their programming was moved to a multicast stream on adjacent channels, due to some stations unable to receive regulatory approval, after FCC recent ruling on joint sales agreements. Those silent stations would then be sold off to minority interest, pending FCC approval.[15][16]
On July 24, 2014, SJL Broadcasting announced that it would sell WJRT-TV, WTVG and WT05 to Gray, for $128 million.[17][18] The sale was completed on September 15.[19]
In September 2015, Gray announced that it would acquire the television and radio stations of Schurz Communications for $442.5 million.[20][21] It also purchased KCRG-TV in Cedar Rapids, Iowa from the locally owned Gazette Company, who owned the station from its sign-on in 1953.[22][23]
By January 20, 2016, Gray had set up their Washington News Bureau.[24]
On May 13, 2016, Gray announced that it would acquire WDTV and WVFX in Clarksburg, West Virginia from Withers Broadcasting for $26.5 million.[25] On June 3, 2016, it was announced that Gray would acquire two stations that were spun-off from the Nexstar-Media General merger; KWQC-TV in Davenport, Iowa and WBAY-TV in Green Bay, Wisconsin for $270 million.[26][27] On February 16, 2017, Gray announced that it will acquire WABI-TV in Bangor, Maine and WCJB-TV in Gainesville, Florida from Diversified Communications for $85 million.[28] On May 4, 2017, Gray announced its intent to acquire WCAX-TV in Burlington, Vermont from Mount Mansfield Television for $29 million.[29][30]

Management of Young Broadcasting stations[edit]
On July 22, 2009, a New York bankruptcy judge approved a plan transferring ownership of Young Broadcasting and its stations to the company's secured lenders. The plan included Gray Television coming in as an outside party and advise on operations of Young-owned stations in seven markets through December 2012. (The new Young Broadcasting still has final word on the stations' operations, including programming and personnel.)[8][10]
The Young-owned stations managed by Gray Television include:

WKRN-TV in Nashville, Tennessee
WTEN in Albany, New York and translator WCDC-TV in Adams, Massachusetts and a SSA with WXXA
WRIC-TV in Richmond, Virginia
WBAY-TV in Green Bay, Wisconsin
KWQC-TV in Davenport, Iowa
KELO-TV in Sioux Falls, South Dakota and its translators throughout South Dakota
KLFY in Lafayette, Louisiana

Young Broadcasting would retain ownership of all of its stations, including three stations that Gray would not operate: KRON-TV in San Francisco, California, WATE-TV in Knoxville, Tennessee, and WLNS-TV in Lansing, Michigan, the latter two due to Gray already owning stations in those markets. Gray considered the possibility of purchasing the Young stations if they go on the market.[31]
The agreement ended without any further extensions on December 31, 2012, and Young agreed to a merger with Media General in mid-2013. Gray would eventually buy KWQC and WBAY when Nexstar Broadcasting Group acquired Media General in 2017.[26][27]
Washington News Bureau[edit]
By January 20, 2016, Gray had set up their Washington News Bureau by Jacqueline Policastro to enable stations to get interviews with US Senators and Representatives serving their communities. The bureau cooperates with Lilly News DC Bureau, previously started by Policastro, and is located at the NBC News Capitol Hill Bureau, 400 N Capitol Street.[24]

History[edit]
James H. Gray started his communication business with the purchase of The Albany Herald in 1946 after he returned from World War II. Gray launced WALB-TV in 1954 and was the second station in the state. In the 1960s additional stations were purchased in Louisiana and Florida. First in 1960, the Florida station was WJHG-TV in Panama City. While in the late 1960s, KTVE was the Louisiana station.[3]
In 1986, Gray died leaving his 50.% share of the stock in a trust for his children with stipulation that they run the business together, sell their stock each other or sell out together. This caused difficulties as two of the three wanted to sell with the third unable to purchases. In 1991 to break the stalemate, the board of directors had the company purchased 25% of their shares.[3]

The company was then taken public on NASDAQ's small-cap market in the 2nd quarter 1992. The price per share drop to $8. The company put itself or any part up for sale by the end of 1992. While the board of director received about 40 offer, Bull Run Corporation purchased the remaining shares of the Gray siblings, who as part of the deal resigned from the board.[3]
New management were put in place at all three units. Bull Run Corporation, primarily owned by J. Mack Robinson, decided make Gray a Southeast regional media company. Gray's first purchase were two TV stations (WKYT-TV and WYMT) from the failed and government seized Kentucky Central Life Insurance Co. in September 1994 after a court challenge to the sale by Kentucky Central builder Garvie Kincaid.[3]
In 1994 and 1995, Gray purchased two newspaper group with two newspapers, the Rockdale Citizen (acquired May 31, 1994) and Gwinnett Post-Tribune (acquired January 1995; quickly renamed Gwinnett Daily Post) and seven advertising weeklies. In 1995, the company moved its stock listing to the New York Stock Exchange. By this time, Robinson, directly or through Bull Run, owned 44% of the company's stock. Gray had started to focus on its TV station segment over the newspaper holding while TV produced more income and the newspapers' income were declining. Just months after doubling the Daily Post's staff, one third were laid off and a quarter of The Albany Herald's staff followed in January 1996. Newspaper leaders resigned during this period from the corporate president in late 1995 to Citizens' editor and publisher.[3]
In 1996, Gray added additional TV stations while entering additional communication industry segments. The company was considered in 1996 by Fortune magazine as the 81st fastest growing company having a 48% percent growth rate. WRDW-TV was purchased in January 1996. In September 1996 a basket purchase from First American Media, Inc., Gray got two TV stations (WCTV-TV and WVLT-TV), Satellite and Production Business Services, which was renamed Lynqx Communications and PortaPhone paging business.[3]
In August and September 1996, Gray raised additional operating funds by various means. On August 20, KTVE was sold for cash and accounts receivable. The company issued and sold Class B common stock (through a public offering), senior subordinated notes and preferred stock in September. Also, a new bank credit facility was arranged. This brought the company total $534.5 million in available funds with $409.5 million directly available.[3]
Also in September 1996, Ralph Gabbard, the newly named president and CEO, died from a heart attack at age 50. Robinson, Bull Run chair, took over as interim CEO and president with Rull Run CEO Robert Prather as interim executive vice-president, acquisitions.[3]
With its additional funds, Gray continued purchasing in 1997 with two announcements in January and February. The company bought Gulflink Communications, Inc., a transportable satellite uplink business based in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, in April 1997 to go along with Lynqx. With Raycom Media acquiring a station from AFLAC Broadcast Group, Inc. forcing them to sell WITN-TV to Gray, which was finalized on August 1, 1997. Gwinnett Daily Post increased circulation in 1997 through a deal with Genesis Cable Communications to provide the paper to its metro Atlanta subscribers at Genesis's expense.[3]
In 1998, Gray started to expand beyond its Southeast region. As the company agreed to purchase the Busse Broadcasting Corporation, which owned KOLN, KGIN-TV and WEAU. Gray's ownership of a newspaper and TV station in Albany, Georgia while grandfather was examined under Media cross-ownership in the United States rule of FCC due to this potential purchase.[3] WALB was thus was sold to Liberty Corp's Cosmos Broadcasting in August 1998.[4]
In 2002, Robinson became Chairman and CEO, his son-in-law Hilton Howell vice chairman, Prather president/COO and Jim Ryan senior vice president. They had Gray purchase 14 Benedek Broadcasting station while that company was in bankruptcy.[5]
Gray Television[edit]
In 2006, the company spun off its five daily newspapers and wireless messaging business into the newly formed Triple Crown Media,[6] later in 2010 is renamed Southern Community Newspapers.[7] A new strategy of purchasing station in college towns or capitals was put into place.[5]
The company had overpaid for a pair of stations. The station was over leveraged like many other station groups entering the Great Recession. Advertising revenues dropped. The twin problems caused its shares to trade at its lowest at 16 cents in 2008, thus the NYSE indicate they might delist the company. Loan covenants could have forced the company into default.[5] Robinson stepped down with Howell replacing him in 2008.[5]
On July 30, 2009, Gray was awarded a contract to manage seven Young Broadcasting-owned stations. Through December 31, 2012, Gray would earn $2.2 million and an opportunity to earn additional specified incentive fees if certain performance targets were exceeded.[8][9][10]
Prather left the company in 2013 and Howell took over the president title.[5] On November 4, 2013, Gray Television announced that it would purchase Yellowstone Holdings for $23 million, adding local stations: KGNS-TV, KGWN, KCWY, and KCHY-LP.[11] Three weeks later, on November 20, Gray announced it would purchase Hoak Media and Parker Broadcasting for $335 million, and North Dakota's Fox affiliate KNDX/KXND for $7.5 million. As part of the deal, stations KAQY, KHAS-TV, and KXJB, were proposed to be sold to Excalibur Broadcasting and operated by Gray under a "local marketing agreements".[12] On December 19, it was announced that stations KREX-TV and WMBB would be sold to Nexstar Broadcasting Group, while KFQX would be sold to Mission Broadcasting.[13] On March 25, 2014, Prime Cities Broadcasting, owner of KNDX/KXND, requested that the FCC dismiss the sale of KNDX/KXND to Excalibur.[14]
The sale was completed on June 13, 2014. However, some stations were forced to go off the air and their programming was moved to a multicast stream on adjacent channels, due to some stations unable to receive regulatory approval, after FCC recent ruling on joint sales agreements. Those silent stations would then be sold off to minority interest, pending FCC approval.[15][16]
On July 24, 2014, SJL Broadcasting announced that it would sell WJRT-TV, WTVG and WT05 to Gray, for $128 million.[17][18] The sale was completed on September 15.[19]
In September 2015, Gray announced that it would acquire the television and radio stations of Schurz Communications for $442.5 million.[20][21] It also purchased KCRG-TV in Cedar Rapids, Iowa from the locally owned Gazette Company, who owned the station from its sign-on in 1953.[22][23]
By January 20, 2016, Gray had set up their Washington News Bureau.[24]
On May 13, 2016, Gray announced that it would acquire WDTV and WVFX in Clarksburg, West Virginia from Withers Broadcasting for $26.5 million.[25] On June 3, 2016, it was announced that Gray would acquire two stations that were spun-off from the Nexstar-Media General merger; KWQC-TV in Davenport, Iowa and WBAY-TV in Green Bay, Wisconsin for $270 million.[26][27] On February 16, 2017, Gray announced that it will acquire WABI-TV in Bangor, Maine and WCJB-TV in Gainesville, Florida from Diversified Communications for $85 million.[28] On May 4, 2017, Gray announced its intent to acquire WCAX-TV in Burlington, Vermont from Mount Mansfield Television for $29 million.[29][30]

The channel was also simulcasted on WHSV-DT3.

Management of Young Broadcasting stations[edit]
On July 22, 2009, a New York bankruptcy judge approved a plan transferring ownership of Young Broadcasting and its stations to the company's secured lenders. The plan included Gray Television coming in as an outside party and advise on operations of Young-owned stations in seven markets through December 2012. (The new Young Broadcasting still has final word on the stations' operations, including programming and personnel.)[8][10]
The Young-owned stations managed by Gray Television include:

WKRN-TV in Nashville, Tennessee
WTEN in Albany, New York and translator WCDC-TV in Adams, Massachusetts and a SSA with WXXA
WRIC-TV in Richmond, Virginia
WBAY-TV in Green Bay, Wisconsin
KWQC-TV in Davenport, Iowa
KELO-TV in Sioux Falls, South Dakota and its translators throughout South Dakota
KLFY in Lafayette, Louisiana

Young Broadcasting would retain ownership of all of its stations, including three stations that Gray would not operate: KRON-TV in San Francisco, California, WATE-TV in Knoxville, Tennessee, and WLNS-TV in Lansing, Michigan, the latter two due to Gray already owning stations in those markets. Gray considered the possibility of purchasing the Young stations if they go on the market.[31]
The agreement ended without any further extensions on December 31, 2012, and Young agreed to a merger with Media General in mid-2013. Gray would eventually buy KWQC and WBAY when Nexstar Broadcasting Group acquired Media General in 2017.[26][27]
Washington News Bureau[edit]
By January 20, 2016, Gray had set up their Washington News Bureau by Jacqueline Policastro to enable stations to get interviews with US Senators and Representatives serving their communities. The bureau cooperates with Lilly News DC Bureau, previously started by Policastro, and is located at the NBC News Capitol Hill Bureau, 400 N Capitol Street.[24]

History[edit]
James H. Gray started his communication business with the purchase of The Albany Herald in 1946 after he returned from World War II. Gray launced WALB-TV in 1954 and was the second station in the state. In the 1960s additional stations were purchased in Louisiana and Florida. First in 1960, the Florida station was WJHG-TV in Panama City. While in the late 1960s, KTVE was the Louisiana station.[3]
In 1986, Gray died leaving his 50.% share of the stock in a trust for his children with stipulation that they run the business together, sell their stock each other or sell out together. This caused difficulties as two of the three wanted to sell with the third unable to purchases. In 1991 to break the stalemate, the board of directors had the company purchased 25% of their shares.[3]

The company was then taken public on NASDAQ's small-cap market in the 2nd quarter 1992. The price per share drop to $8. The company put itself or any part up for sale by the end of 1992. While the board of director received about 40 offer, Bull Run Corporation purchased the remaining shares of the Gray siblings, who as part of the deal resigned from the board.[3]
New management were put in place at all three units. Bull Run Corporation, primarily owned by J. Mack Robinson, decided make Gray a Southeast regional media company. Gray's first purchase were two TV stations (WKYT-TV and WYMT) from the failed and government seized Kentucky Central Life Insurance Co. in September 1994 after a court challenge to the sale by Kentucky Central builder Garvie Kincaid.[3]
In 1994 and 1995, Gray purchased two newspaper group with two newspapers, the Rockdale Citizen (acquired May 31, 1994) and Gwinnett Post-Tribune (acquired January 1995; quickly renamed Gwinnett Daily Post) and seven advertising weeklies. In 1995, the company moved its stock listing to the New York Stock Exchange. By this time, Robinson, directly or through Bull Run, owned 44% of the company's stock. Gray had started to focus on its TV station segment over the newspaper holding while TV produced more income and the newspapers' income were declining. Just months after doubling the Daily Post's staff, one third were laid off and a quarter of The Albany Herald's staff followed in January 1996. Newspaper leaders resigned during this period from the corporate president in late 1995 to Citizens' editor and publisher.[3]
In 1996, Gray added additional TV stations while entering additional communication industry segments. The company was considered in 1996 by Fortune magazine as the 81st fastest growing company having a 48% percent growth rate. WRDW-TV was purchased in January 1996. In September 1996 a basket purchase from First American Media, Inc., Gray got two TV stations (WCTV-TV and WVLT-TV), Satellite and Production Business Services, which was renamed Lynqx Communications and PortaPhone paging business.[3]
In August and September 1996, Gray raised additional operating funds by various means. On August 20, KTVE was sold for cash and accounts receivable. The company issued and sold Class B common stock (through a public offering), senior subordinated notes and preferred stock in September. Also, a new bank credit facility was arranged. This brought the company total $534.5 million in available funds with $409.5 million directly available.[3]
Also in September 1996, Ralph Gabbard, the newly named president and CEO, died from a heart attack at age 50. Robinson, Bull Run chair, took over as interim CEO and president with Rull Run CEO Robert Prather as interim executive vice-president, acquisitions.[3]
With its additional funds, Gray continued purchasing in 1997 with two announcements in January and February. The company bought Gulflink Communications, Inc., a transportable satellite uplink business based in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, in April 1997 to go along with Lynqx. With Raycom Media acquiring a station from AFLAC Broadcast Group, Inc. forcing them to sell WITN-TV to Gray, which was finalized on August 1, 1997. Gwinnett Daily Post increased circulation in 1997 through a deal with Genesis Cable Communications to provide the paper to its metro Atlanta subscribers at Genesis's expense.[3]
In 1998, Gray started to expand beyond its Southeast region. As the company agreed to purchase the Busse Broadcasting Corporation, which owned KOLN, KGIN-TV and WEAU. Gray's ownership of a newspaper and TV station in Albany, Georgia while grandfather was examined under Media cross-ownership in the United States rule of FCC due to this potential purchase.[3] WALB was thus was sold to Liberty Corp's Cosmos Broadcasting in August 1998.[4]
In 2002, Robinson became Chairman and CEO, his son-in-law Hilton Howell vice chairman, Prather president/COO and Jim Ryan senior vice president. They had Gray purchase 14 Benedek Broadcasting station while that company was in bankruptcy.[5]
Gray Television[edit]
In 2006, the company spun off its five daily newspapers and wireless messaging business into the newly formed Triple Crown Media,[6] later in 2010 is renamed Southern Community Newspapers.[7] A new strategy of purchasing station in college towns or capitals was put into place.[5]
The company had overpaid for a pair of stations. The station was over leveraged like many other station groups entering the Great Recession. Advertising revenues dropped. The twin problems caused its shares to trade at its lowest at 16 cents in 2008, thus the NYSE indicate they might delist the company. Loan covenants could have forced the company into default.[5] Robinson stepped down with Howell replacing him in 2008.[5]
On July 30, 2009, Gray was awarded a contract to manage seven Young Broadcasting-owned stations. Through December 31, 2012, Gray would earn $2.2 million and an opportunity to earn additional specified incentive fees if certain performance targets were exceeded.[8][9][10]
Prather left the company in 2013 and Howell took over the president title.[5] On November 4, 2013, Gray Television announced that it would purchase Yellowstone Holdings for $23 million, adding local stations: KGNS-TV, KGWN, KCWY, and KCHY-LP.[11] Three weeks later, on November 20, Gray announced it would purchase Hoak Media and Parker Broadcasting for $335 million, and North Dakota's Fox affiliate KNDX/KXND for $7.5 million. As part of the deal, stations KAQY, KHAS-TV, and KXJB, were proposed to be sold to Excalibur Broadcasting and operated by Gray under a "local marketing agreements".[12] On December 19, it was announced that stations KREX-TV and WMBB would be sold to Nexstar Broadcasting Group, while KFQX would be sold to Mission Broadcasting.[13] On March 25, 2014, Prime Cities Broadcasting, owner of KNDX/KXND, requested that the FCC dismiss the sale of KNDX/KXND to Excalibur.[14]
The sale was completed on June 13, 2014. However, some stations were forced to go off the air and their programming was moved to a multicast stream on adjacent channels, due to some stations unable to receive regulatory approval, after FCC recent ruling on joint sales agreements. Those silent stations would then be sold off to minority interest, pending FCC approval.[15][16]
On July 24, 2014, SJL Broadcasting announced that it would sell WJRT-TV, WTVG and WT05 to Gray, for $128 million.[17][18] The sale was completed on September 15.[19]
In September 2015, Gray announced that it would acquire the television and radio stations of Schurz Communications for $442.5 million.[20][21] It also purchased KCRG-TV in Cedar Rapids, Iowa from the locally owned Gazette Company, who owned the station from its sign-on in 1953.[22][23]
By January 20, 2016, Gray had set up their Washington News Bureau.[24]
On May 13, 2016, Gray announced that it would acquire WDTV and WVFX in Clarksburg, West Virginia from Withers Broadcasting for $26.5 million.[25] On June 3, 2016, it was announced that Gray would acquire two stations that were spun-off from the Nexstar-Media General merger; KWQC-TV in Davenport, Iowa and WBAY-TV in Green Bay, Wisconsin for $270 million.[26][27] On February 16, 2017, Gray announced that it will acquire WABI-TV in Bangor, Maine and WCJB-TV in Gainesville, Florida from Diversified Communications for $85 million.[28] On May 4, 2017, Gray announced its intent to acquire WCAX-TV in Burlington, Vermont from Mount Mansfield Television for $29 million.[29][30]

Management of Young Broadcasting stations[edit]
On July 22, 2009, a New York bankruptcy judge approved a plan transferring ownership of Young Broadcasting and its stations to the company's secured lenders. The plan included Gray Television coming in as an outside party and advise on operations of Young-owned stations in seven markets through December 2012. (The new Young Broadcasting still has final word on the stations' operations, including programming and personnel.)[8][10]
The Young-owned stations managed by Gray Television include:

WKRN-TV in Nashville, Tennessee
WTEN in Albany, New York and translator WCDC-TV in Adams, Massachusetts and a SSA with WXXA
WRIC-TV in Richmond, Virginia
WBAY-TV in Green Bay, Wisconsin
KWQC-TV in Davenport, Iowa
KELO-TV in Sioux Falls, South Dakota and its translators throughout South Dakota
KLFY in Lafayette, Louisiana

Young Broadcasting would retain ownership of all of its stations, including three stations that Gray would not operate: KRON-TV in San Francisco, California, WATE-TV in Knoxville, Tennessee, and WLNS-TV in Lansing, Michigan, the latter two due to Gray already owning stations in those markets. Gray considered the possibility of purchasing the Young stations if they go on the market.[31]
The agreement ended without any further extensions on December 31, 2012, and Young agreed to a merger with Media General in mid-2013. Gray would eventually buy KWQC and WBAY when Nexstar Broadcasting Group acquired Media General in 2017.[26][27]
Washington News Bureau[edit]
By January 20, 2016, Gray had set up their Washington News Bureau by Jacqueline Policastro to enable stations to get interviews with US Senators and Representatives serving their communities. The bureau cooperates with Lilly News DC Bureau, previously started by Policastro, and is located at the NBC News Capitol Hill Bureau, 400 N Capitol Street.[24]

History[edit]
James H. Gray started his communication business with the purchase of The Albany Herald in 1946 after he returned from World War II. Gray launced WALB-TV in 1954 and was the second station in the state. In the 1960s additional stations were purchased in Louisiana and Florida. First in 1960, the Florida station was WJHG-TV in Panama City. While in the late 1960s, KTVE was the Louisiana station.[3]
In 1986, Gray died leaving his 50.% share of the stock in a trust for his children with stipulation that they run the business together, sell their stock each other or sell out together. This caused difficulties as two of the three wanted to sell with the third unable to purchases. In 1991 to break the stalemate, the board of directors had the company purchased 25% of their shares.[3]

The company was then taken public on NASDAQ's small-cap market in the 2nd quarter 1992. The price per share drop to $8. The company put itself or any part up for sale by the end of 1992. While the board of director received about 40 offer, Bull Run Corporation purchased the remaining shares of the Gray siblings, who as part of the deal resigned from the board.[3]
New management were put in place at all three units. Bull Run Corporation, primarily owned by J. Mack Robinson, decided make Gray a Southeast regional media company. Gray's first purchase were two TV stations (WKYT-TV and WYMT) from the failed and government seized Kentucky Central Life Insurance Co. in September 1994 after a court challenge to the sale by Kentucky Central builder Garvie Kincaid.[3]
In 1994 and 1995, Gray purchased two newspaper group with two newspapers, the Rockdale Citizen (acquired May 31, 1994) and Gwinnett Post-Tribune (acquired January 1995; quickly renamed Gwinnett Daily Post) and seven advertising weeklies. In 1995, the company moved its stock listing to the New York Stock Exchange. By this time, Robinson, directly or through Bull Run, owned 44% of the company's stock. Gray had started to focus on its TV station segment over the newspaper holding while TV produced more income and the newspapers' income were declining. Just months after doubling the Daily Post's staff, one third were laid off and a quarter of The Albany Herald's staff followed in January 1996. Newspaper leaders resigned during this period from the corporate president in late 1995 to Citizens' editor and publisher.[3]
In 1996, Gray added additional TV stations while entering additional communication industry segments. The company was considered in 1996 by Fortune magazine as the 81st fastest growing company having a 48% percent growth rate. WRDW-TV was purchased in January 1996. In September 1996 a basket purchase from First American Media, Inc., Gray got two TV stations (WCTV-TV and WVLT-TV), Satellite and Production Business Services, which was renamed Lynqx Communications and PortaPhone paging business.[3]
In August and September 1996, Gray raised additional operating funds by various means. On August 20, KTVE was sold for cash and accounts receivable. The company issued and sold Class B common stock (through a public offering), senior subordinated notes and preferred stock in September. Also, a new bank credit facility was arranged. This brought the company total $534.5 million in available funds with $409.5 million directly available.[3]
Also in September 1996, Ralph Gabbard, the newly named president and CEO, died from a heart attack at age 50. Robinson, Bull Run chair, took over as interim CEO and president with Rull Run CEO Robert Prather as interim executive vice-president, acquisitions.[3]
With its additional funds, Gray continued purchasing in 1997 with two announcements in January and February. The company bought Gulflink Communications, Inc., a transportable satellite uplink business based in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, in April 1997 to go along with Lynqx. With Raycom Media acquiring a station from AFLAC Broadcast Group, Inc. forcing them to sell WITN-TV to Gray, which was finalized on August 1, 1997. Gwinnett Daily Post increased circulation in 1997 through a deal with Genesis Cable Communications to provide the paper to its metro Atlanta subscribers at Genesis's expense.[3]
In 1998, Gray started to expand beyond its Southeast region. As the company agreed to purchase the Busse Broadcasting Corporation, which owned KOLN, KGIN-TV and WEAU. Gray's ownership of a newspaper and TV station in Albany, Georgia while grandfather was examined under Media cross-ownership in the United States rule of FCC due to this potential purchase.[3] WALB was thus was sold to Liberty Corp's Cosmos Broadcasting in August 1998.[4]
In 2002, Robinson became Chairman and CEO, his son-in-law Hilton Howell vice chairman, Prather president/COO and Jim Ryan senior vice president. They had Gray purchase 14 Benedek Broadcasting station while that company was in bankruptcy.[5]
Gray Television[edit]
In 2006, the company spun off its five daily newspapers and wireless messaging business into the newly formed Triple Crown Media,[6] later in 2010 is renamed Southern Community Newspapers.[7] A new strategy of purchasing station in college towns or capitals was put into place.[5]
The company had overpaid for a pair of stations. The station was over leveraged like many other station groups entering the Great Recession. Advertising revenues dropped. The twin problems caused its shares to trade at its lowest at 16 cents in 2008, thus the NYSE indicate they might delist the company. Loan covenants could have forced the company into default.[5] Robinson stepped down with Howell replacing him in 2008.[5]
On July 30, 2009, Gray was awarded a contract to manage seven Young Broadcasting-owned stations. Through December 31, 2012, Gray would earn $2.2 million and an opportunity to earn additional specified incentive fees if certain performance targets were exceeded.[8][9][10]
Prather left the company in 2013 and Howell took over the president title.[5] On November 4, 2013, Gray Television announced that it would purchase Yellowstone Holdings for $23 million, adding local stations: KGNS-TV, KGWN, KCWY, and KCHY-LP.[11] Three weeks later, on November 20, Gray announced it would purchase Hoak Media and Parker Broadcasting for $335 million, and North Dakota's Fox affiliate KNDX/KXND for $7.5 million. As part of the deal, stations KAQY, KHAS-TV, and KXJB, were proposed to be sold to Excalibur Broadcasting and operated by Gray under a "local marketing agreements".[12] On December 19, it was announced that stations KREX-TV and WMBB would be sold to Nexstar Broadcasting Group, while KFQX would be sold to Mission Broadcasting.[13] On March 25, 2014, Prime Cities Broadcasting, owner of KNDX/KXND, requested that the FCC dismiss the sale of KNDX/KXND to Excalibur.[14]
The sale was completed on June 13, 2014. However, some stations were forced to go off the air and their programming was moved to a multicast stream on adjacent channels, due to some stations unable to receive regulatory approval, after FCC recent ruling on joint sales agreements. Those silent stations would then be sold off to minority interest, pending FCC approval.[15][16]
On July 24, 2014, SJL Broadcasting announced that it would sell WJRT-TV, WTVG and WT05 to Gray, for $128 million.[17][18] The sale was completed on September 15.[19]
In September 2015, Gray announced that it would acquire the television and radio stations of Schurz Communications for $442.5 million.[20][21] It also purchased KCRG-TV in Cedar Rapids, Iowa from the locally owned Gazette Company, who owned the station from its sign-on in 1953.[22][23]
By January 20, 2016, Gray had set up their Washington News Bureau.[24]
On May 13, 2016, Gray announced that it would acquire WDTV and WVFX in Clarksburg, West Virginia from Withers Broadcasting for $26.5 million.[25] On June 3, 2016, it was announced that Gray would acquire two stations that were spun-off from the Nexstar-Media General merger; KWQC-TV in Davenport, Iowa and WBAY-TV in Green Bay, Wisconsin for $270 million.[26][27] On February 16, 2017, Gray announced that it will acquire WABI-TV in Bangor, Maine and WCJB-TV in Gainesville, Florida from Diversified Communications for $85 million.[28] On May 4, 2017, Gray announced its intent to acquire WCAX-TV in Burlington, Vermont from Mount Mansfield Television for $29 million.[29][30]

Management of Young Broadcasting stations[edit]
On July 22, 2009, a New York bankruptcy judge approved a plan transferring ownership of Young Broadcasting and its stations to the company's secured lenders. The plan included Gray Television coming in as an outside party and advise on operations of Young-owned stations in seven markets through December 2012. (The new Young Broadcasting still has final word on the stations' operations, including programming and personnel.)[8][10]
The Young-owned stations managed by Gray Television include:

WKRN-TV in Nashville, Tennessee
WTEN in Albany, New York and translator WCDC-TV in Adams, Massachusetts and a SSA with WXXA
WRIC-TV in Richmond, Virginia
WBAY-TV in Green Bay, Wisconsin
KWQC-TV in Davenport, Iowa
KELO-TV in Sioux Falls, South Dakota and its translators throughout South Dakota
KLFY in Lafayette, Louisiana

Young Broadcasting would retain ownership of all of its stations, including three stations that Gray would not operate: KRON-TV in San Francisco, California, WATE-TV in Knoxville, Tennessee, and WLNS-TV in Lansing, Michigan, the latter two due to Gray already owning stations in those markets. Gray considered the possibility of purchasing the Young stations if they go on the market.[31]
The agreement ended without any further extensions on December 31, 2012, and Young agreed to a merger with Media General in mid-2013. Gray would eventually buy KWQC and WBAY when Nexstar Broadcasting Group acquired Media General in 2017.[26][27]
Washington News Bureau[edit]
By January 20, 2016, Gray had set up their Washington News Bureau by Jacqueline Policastro to enable stations to get interviews with US Senators and Representatives serving their communities. The bureau cooperates with Lilly News DC Bureau, previously started by Policastro, and is located at the NBC News Capitol Hill Bureau, 400 N Capitol Street.[24]

Gray Television, Inc. Terms of Use Agreement




Posted: Wed 8:30 AM, Jun 20, 2012
&nbsp|&nbsp

Updated: Thu 3:09 PM, May 11, 2017 

















This Terms of Use Agreement (“TOU”) has been updated to make it easier to read, to include new features, services and technology, and enhance several sections.  If you continue to use our Services, you are bound by this revised TOU. 
In addition to the terms and conditions set forth in this TOU, content submitted by users on our websites (commonly called “Web Channels”), or other services, using the "MyCapture" service are also subject to MyCapture's Terms of Use.  Please see the separate Terms of Use for this service on the MyCapture homepage.
Introduction
This TOU governs your use of the various Web Channels, mobile services and applications (“Apps”) and any other service that is owned, operated or provided by Gray Television, Inc. ("GTI") or our television stations (“Stations”) (collectively, “we,” us,” and “our”) that includes an authorized link to this TOU (collectively, “Services”).  (For a list of Web Channels and Stations, CLICK HERE.)  The Services are offered to users conditioned on your acceptance, without modification, of the terms, conditions and notices contained in this Agreement.  Your use of the Services constitutes your binding consent to all such terms, conditions and notices.  



PLEASE REVIEW THIS TOU CAREFULLY.  IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TOU, DO NOT USE OUR SERVICES.
This TOU will remain in full force and effect as long as you are a user of the Services and in the event of termination of any membership, service or feature, you will still be bound by certain obligations under this TOU; please see Section 19 for details.  The GTI Privacy Policy and GTI Copyright Complaint Procedures are hereby incorporated in this TOU by reference. 
1.	Changes to TOU: We may change this TOU on occasion without advance notice to you.  Therefore, please review this TOU periodically.  When we change the TOU, we will post the Effective Date and notice of such changes on our designated Services.  If you do not accept the changes, your only recourse is to stop using the Services and terminate your account(s) or membership(s) immediately.  If you continue to use the Services after we change the TOU, you accept all changes. 



2.	Additional Terms: We may provide additional terms, such as rules for certain activities and Services including, but not without limitation, contests, sweepstakes, subscription email/text clubs and other interactive features and services (“Additional Terms”).  To the extent that there is a conflict between this TOU and the Additional Terms, the Additional Terms shall govern.
3.	Intellectual Property Rights: All text, images, photographs, graphics, logos, trade, product or program names, titles, packaging, user interfaces, audio and/or video content and any other content provided on or through the Services by GTI, Stations, third-party licensors (including users that submit their own content, commonly called user generated content (“UGC”)), vendors and suppliers that provide internal support to our Services (collectively “Operational Service Providers”), and advertisers, sponsors or promotional partners (collectively, “Advertisers”), including the selection, coordination, and arrangement of any such content (collectively, “GTI Content”), are owned by or licensed to GTI, Stations, Advertisers, Operational Service Providers and/or our third-party licensors.  GTI Content is protected under U.S. and/or international copyright, trademark, patent, or other relevant intellectual property laws.  Nothing stated or implied on the Services confers on you any additional license or right under any copyright, trademark, patent or other intellectual property right of GTI or any third party unless explicitly provided in this TOU.  
Unless such use is expressly prohibited by GTI, you may view, reproduce, transmit, link, cache GTI Content for your own personal and non-commercial use, including posting on your personal Facebook page or other personal social networking platforms, provided you do not delete, change or obscure any of the GTI Content (including any copyright, trademark or proprietary notices), and do not misrepresent that GTI Content is your own.  You may not (and you may not permit or encourage anyone else to) make derivative works, publicly perform, reproduce, distribute, transmit or link to GTI Content in or on any other third party website, digital service or via any vehicle in any manner that is likely or intended to cause confusion about the owner or origin of GTI Content, or is misleading, disparaging, harmful, or a detriment to GTI in our sole discretion.  Except where permitted by law or expressly authorized by GTI, GTI Content may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, linked, cached or otherwise used for any commercial purposes unless you have the prior written permission of GTI.  You may only use our Services and our GTI Content as expressly permitted in this TOU and for no other purpose.  We may revoke permission to use GTI Content at any time and for any reason.  GTI, Stations, Advertisers, Operational Service Providers and/or licensors retain exclusive rights in any GTI Content that are not expressly provided in this TOU.

4.	Notice of Copyright Infringement: If you believe that your material has been posted on our Services and is accessible in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, you must notify us according to the DMCA Designated Agent notification instructions in our Copyright Complaint Procedures.  If you are the subject of a DMCA “take down” request, your appeal process is also provided in our Copyright Complaint Procedures.
5.	Links to Third-Party Services or Websites: The Services may contain links to external websites or services owned, operated, or managed by third parties (collectively referred to as “Linked Websites") such as “MyCapture.”  Although a Linked Website may feature a GTI or Station logo or identification, or a Linked Website is “framed” by a Web Channel, such third party websites are not under the control of GTI or Stations.  Nor is GTI or Stations responsible for the contents, operations, business practices or privacy policies of any Linked Website.  We provide Linked Websites to you only as a convenience, and the inclusion of such links is not necessarily an endorsement by GTI or any of Stations in favor of any person offering any content, services, or products on the Linked Websites.  If you decide to access and use Linked Websites, you understand, acknowledge and agree that you do so at your own risk. 
6.	Advertisers: The inclusion of Advertisers’ statements, messages, offers, advice, or promotional materials on or through the Service is not an endorsement by GTI or any Stations in favor of same.  Your correspondence and business dealings directly with, or participation in the promotions of Advertisers found on or through the Service, including payment and delivery of your purchase of goods or services, and any other terms, conditions, warranties or representations associated with such dealings, are solely between you and the Advertiser.  You understand, acknowledge and agree that GTI and Stations are not responsible or liable for any loss or damage of any sort incurred as a result of any such dealings or due to the presence of Advertisers on the Service. 
7.	 Shopping and E-Commerce: Our Services may offer various goods and services for sale (collectively, “Products”), or direct or link to other websites that sell Products.  We have no responsibility or liability whatsoever for any Products you may obtain from or through other websites or web pages, even if you were directed or linked to such a website or page through our Services.  If a Product offered directly by GTI is listed at an incorrect price or with incorrect information, we reserve the right to refuse or cancel orders placed for that Product, whether or not the order has been confirmed and even if your credit or debt card account has been charged (in which event we will issue a credit to your account for your order).  
The creation or transmission of confirmation for an order does not mean final acceptance of your order, nor does it create a binding confirmation of an offer to sell any Product.  We reserve the right to accept or decline your order for any reason up until the time the Product is actually shipped to you.  We may also, without prior notice, limit or reduce the quantity you ordered of any Product and we will notify you if we change your order.    Products directly sold by our Services are prohibited from commercial resale.  We do not knowingly accept orders from dealers, exporters, wholesalers, distributors, resellers or other similar persons or companies, and reserve the right to refuse, cancel or seek the return of any Products that are purchased in violation of the foregoing restrictions.  
Classified Ads: Our Services may offer a Classified Ad service for the sale of goods and services (“Classified Ads”).  Sellers must certify that their Product is not on our Prohibited Items List.  Fees charged to post listings with special features or premium listings are non-refundable if the Product is on the Prohibited Items List.  We reserve the right to reject or remove any Classified Ad, even those that are not included on the Prohibited Items List.  We may, at our discretion, deactivate the accounts of users who submit multiple advertisements we deem inappropriate.  Sellers are entirely responsible for the content of their advertisements, interactions with buyers and the delivery of all orders.  We merely provide the forum and we are not involved in the actual transaction between buyers and sellers.  We have no control over the quality, safety or legality of advertised Products, nor any matters relating to the transaction.  You understand, acknowledge and agree that we are not responsible or liable for any loss or damage of any kind arising out of or in connection with your use of Classified Ads.   
8.	Prohibited Uses Generally: You are required to comply with all applicable law in connection with your use of the Services.  We may provide additional requirements in Additional Terms or posted on our Services.  As a condition of your use of the Services, you represent and warrant that you will not use the Services for any purpose that is unlawful or prohibited by this TOU.  You further agree not to: 
(a) Use any incomplete, false or inaccurate biographical information or other information, or impersonating any person or otherwise misrepresent your relationship or affiliation for purposes of using the Services, or for registering for any activity, feature, and/or promotion;
(b) Delete or revise any material, GTI Content or other information on these Services; 
(c) Take any action that imposes an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on the Services’ infrastructure or operating systems;

(e) Harvest or otherwise collect information about users, including but not limited to, email addresses, IP addresses, unique device IDs, usage, transaction or search history using systematic, electronic methods, or any other means to create or compile (directly or indirectly) a profile, compilation, database or directory without prior written permission from GTI;
(f) Use or attempt to use any engine, software, tool, agent or other device or mechanism (including without limitation browsers, spiders, robots, avatar's or intelligent agents) to navigate or search the Services other than the search engine and search agents available from GTI and other than generally available third-party web browsers (e.g., Microsoft Internet Explorer, Mozilla, Firefox, or Google Chrome); 
(g) Attempt to decipher, decompile, disassemble or reverse engineer any of the software comprising or in any way making up a part of the Services;  
(h) Link to the Services or GTI Content, frame the Services, exhibit or display the Services in association or connection with an unauthorized logo, name, or mark; or do anything that could falsely suggest a relationship between GTI, Stations, GTI Affiliates and any non-affiliated third party, or do anything that could potentially deprive us of revenue or user activity (including but not limited to revenue or activity generated from promotions, advertising, or sale of Products);
(i) Engage in any other conduct that restricts or inhibits any other person from using or enjoying the Services, or which, in our sole judgment, exposes us or any of our users, Operational Service Providers, or Advertisers to any liability or detriment of any type.  
You also are prohibited from violating or attempting to violate the security of the Services, including, without limitation: 
(A) Accessing data not intended for you or logging into a server or account that you are not authorized to access; 
(B) Attempting to probe, scan or test the vulnerability of a system or network or to breach security or authentication measures without proper authorization; 
(C) Attempting to interfere with the service to any user, host or network, including, without limitation, by way of submitting a virus to, or overloading, "flooding," "spamming," "mailbombing," or "crashing" the Service; 
(D) Sending unsolicited e-mail, texts, IM, or any other communications to a computer or a wireless device, including promotions and/or advertising of Products, an entity or an individual person; or 
(E) Forging any TCP/IP packet header or any part of the header information in any e-mail, mobile message, or posting.  
Violations of any system, network, or security measures related to our Services may result in civil and/or criminal liability.

You will continue to own any UGC submitted to us.  However, by your submission of UGC on, to or through the Services, email, postal mail, or any other manner, you grant GTI, Stations and our successors and assigns a world-wide, royalty free, perpetual,  irrevocable and non-exclusive right (including any moral right) and fully sub-licensable license to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, create derivative works from, distribute, perform and display such UGC anywhere, for any purpose, and in any form, media or technology now known or later developed.

Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
