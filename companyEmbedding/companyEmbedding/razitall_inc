Income


Government Income
                        We have not found government income sources for Razitall Inc.

Outgoings

Business Rates/Property Tax
                        No properties were found where Razitall Inc is liable for the business rates / property tax. This could be for a number of reasons. The council hasnt published the data We havent found or been able to process the councils data The company is part of a group of companies and another company in the group is liable for business rates The registered office may be a residential address which does not have a commercial designation. If the business is run from home then it won't be a commercial property and hence won't be liable for business rates. Serviced offices are increasingly popular and therefore a business may not be paying business rates directly - the building owner is and this is incorporated in the office rental charge. 




Government Grants / Awards

Technology Strategy Board Awards
                        The Technology Strategy Board has not awarded Razitall Inc any grants or awards. Grants from the TSB are an indicator that the company is investing in new technologies or IPR
