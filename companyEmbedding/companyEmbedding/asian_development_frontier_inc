	FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

	October 31, 2016 and January 31, 2016

	(Stated in US
	Dollars)

	(Unaudited)




	1. NATURE OF BUSINESS



	The Company was incorporated in the State of Nevada on February
	2, 2005. The Company was previously in the business of developing fuel cell
	products in China. During fiscal 2008, the Company suspended the development of
	their fuel cell products due to the inability to raise sufficient additional
	financing. Management is currently focusing on identifying, evaluating and
	negotiating new business opportunities. On July 31, 2012, the Company through a
	merger with a wholly-owned subsidiary changed its name from Intervia Inc. to
	Blue Sky Petroleum Inc. Effective July 9, 2015, the Company through a merger
	with a wholly-owned subsidiary changed its name from Blue Sky Petroleum Inc. to
	Asian Development Frontier Inc. (the Company).


	The Company has not generated any revenues from operations. The
	Company will obtain additional funding by borrowing funds from its director and
	officer, or by private placement of common stock. There can be no assurance that
	the Company will be successful in its efforts to raise additional financing or
	if financing is available, that it will be on terms that are acceptable to the
	Company.



	2. GOING CONCERN



	The Companys financial statements are prepared using generally
	accepted accounting principles in the United States of America applicable to a
	going concern which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of
	liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has not yet
	established an ongoing source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating
	costs and allow it to continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company to
	continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company obtaining adequate
	capital to fund operating losses until it becomes profitable. If the Company is
	unable to obtain adequate capital, it could be forced to cease operations.


	Managements plan to support the Company in its operations and
	to maintain its business strategy is to raise funds through public offerings and
	to rely on officers and directors to perform essential functions with minimal
	compensation. If the Company does not raise all of the money it needs from
	public offerings, it will have to find alternative sources, such as a second
	public offering, a private placement of securities, or loans from its officers,
	directors or others. If the Company requires additional cash and is unable to
	raise it, it will either have to suspend operations until the cash is raised, or
	cease business entirely.


	The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is
	dependent upon its ability to successfully accomplish the plans described in the
	preceding paragraph and eventually secure other sources of financing and attain
	profitable operations. The accompanying financial statements do not include any
	adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a
	going concern.

	likely-than-not to be realized from future operations. The Company has chosen to
	provide a full valuation allowance against all available income tax loss carry
	forwards, regardless of their time of expiry.


	The Company has not filed income tax returns since inception.
	Tax authorities prescribe penalties for failing to file certain tax returns and
	supplemental disclosures. Upon filing there could be penalties and interest
	assessed. Such penalties vary by jurisdiction and by assessing practices and
	authorities. As the Company has incurred losses since inception there would be
	no known or anticipated exposure to penalties for income tax liability. However,
	certain jurisdictions may assess penalties for failing to file returns and other
	disclosures and for failing to file other supplementary information associated
	with foreign ownership, activities, debt and equity positions. Management has
	considered the likelihood and significance of possible penalties associated with
	its current and intended filing positions and has determined, based on their
	assessment, that such penalties, if any, would not be expected to be material.
	Managements assessment is subject to uncertainty. All tax years from inception
	are open to examination by the Internal Revenue Service.


	No provision for income taxes has been provided in these
	financial statements due to the net loss for the periods ended October 31, 2016
	and 2015. At October 31, 2016 the Company has net operating loss carried forward
	of $865,898, which expire commencing in 2033. The potential tax benefit of these
	losses may be limited due to certain change in ownership provisions under
	Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (IRS) and similar state
	provisions.




	IRS Section 382 places a limitation (the Section 382
	Limitation) on the amount of taxable income which can be offset by net
	operating loss carryforwards after a change in control (generally greater than a
	50% change in ownership) of a loss corporation. Generally, after a control
	change, a loss corporation cannot deduct operating loss carryforwards in excess
	of the Section 382 Limitation. Due to these change in ownership provisions,
	utilization of the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be
	subject to an annual limitation regarding their utilization against taxable
	income in future periods. The Company has not concluded its analysis of Section
	382 through January 31, 2016, but believes that the provisions will not limit
	the availability of losses to offset future income.



	7. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS



	The Company has evaluated subsequent events through the date
	which the financial statements were issued, and no material recognizable
	subsequent events were identified.

	Our unaudited financial statements are stated in United States
	Dollars (US$) and are prepared in accordance with United States Generally
	Accepted Accounting Principles. The following discussion should be read in

	differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed below and elsewhere
	in this quarterly report.


	Unless otherwise specified in this quarterly report, all dollar
	amounts are expressed in United States dollars and all references to common
	stock refer to shares of our common stock.


	As used in this quarterly report, the terms we, us, our
	and our company mean Asian Development Frontier Inc., unless otherwise
	indicated. We have no subsidiaries.



	Corporate Overview



	We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on February 2,
	2005. Our original business plan was to develop fuel cell technology and produce
	fuel cells in China for indoor forklifts, scooters, underwater equipment (e.g.
	shallow underwater sightseeing submarines) that require a small size, longevity
	of use and silent operation. During fiscal 2008 we suspended the development of
	our products and business plan until we were able to raise sufficient additional
	financing.


	Since the suspension of our original business plan, our
	management has been analyzing various alternatives available to our company to
	ensure our survival and to preserve our shareholders' investment in our common
	shares.


	On July 31, 2012, we filed Articles of Merger with the Nevada
	Secretary of State to change the name of the company from Intervia Inc. to
	Blue Sky Petroleum Inc., by way of a merger with our wholly-owned subsidiary
	Blue Sky Petroleum Inc., which was created solely for the name change.


	Also on July 31, 2012, we filed a Certificate of Change with
	the Nevada Secretary of State to give effect to a forward split of our
	authorized and issued and outstanding shares of common stock on a 3 new for 1
	old basis and, consequently, our authorized capital increased from 75,000,000 to
	225,000,000 shares and correspondingly, our issued and outstanding shares of
	common stock increased from 15,740,000 to 47,220,000 shares of common stock, all
	with a par value of $0.001. These amendments became effective on August 7, 2012
	upon approval from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA).


	5






	Effective September 19, 2012, our stock symbol changed from
	ITVA to BSKY to better reflect the new name of our company. The symbol
	change became effective with the OTC Markets at the opening of trading on
	September 19, 2012.


	On June 10, 2015, our board of directors approved an agreement
	and plan of merger to merge with our wholly-owned subsidiary Asian Development
	Frontier Inc., a Nevada corporation, to effect a name change from Blue Sky
	Petroleum Inc. to Asian Development Frontier Inc. Asian Development Frontier
	Inc. was formed solely for the change of name.


	Articles of Merger to effect the merger and change of name were
	filed and became effective with the Nevada Secretary of State on July 9, 2015.
	The name change became effective with the OTC Markets at the opening of trading
	on July 9, 2015 under the symbol "ADFI". Our CUSIP number is 04521W101.


	The address of our principal executive office is 65/10-12 Floor
	1, Chamnan Phenjati Business Center Building. Rama IX Rd, Huai Khwang, Bangkok,
	Thailand. Our telephone number is 852-3106-3133.



	Our Current Business



	During our last two fiscal years, we have been a company with
	no operations.


	On July 15, 2010, we entered into an option agreement to
	purchase a 100% undivided right, title and interest in the Proteus property
	located near Cobalt, Ontario, an area known historically for the mining of
	silver ore. The Proteus Property consists of three mineral claims comprised of
	nine units covering approximately 360 acres located in the Larder Lake Mining
	Division in Ontario, Canada. In order to acquire the Proteus Property pursuant
	to the agreement, our company was to make the cash payments and incur amounts on
	exploration and development.


	We have been unsuccessful in raising additional capital for
	this exploration project and therefore do not have sufficient funds to make the
	required option payments. Consequently, effective August 13, 2012, we entered
	into an assignment agreement among Timber Wolf Gold Inc., a Nevada corporation
	and Gino Chitaroni, wherein we have assigned all of our rights, title and
	interest in and to the option agreement for the Proteus Property to Timber Wolf,
	with no further obligations to our company.


	We continue to look for properties and opportunities. However,
	at this time we have not yet been successful in finding a transaction that has
	warranted pursuing.



	Research and Development



	We do not currently have a formal research and development
	effort. We did not spend any funds on research and development during the last
	two fiscal years.



	Purchase of Significant Equipment



	We do not intend to purchase any significant equipment over the
	twelve months ending October 31, 2017.



	Employees



	Currently, we do not have any employees. Additionally, we have
	not entered into any consulting or employment agreements with our president,
	chief executive officer, treasurer, secretary or chief financial officer. Our
	directors, executive officers and certain contracted individuals play an
	important role in the running of our company. We do not expect any material
	changes in the number of employees over the next 12 month period. We do and will
	continue to outsource contract employment as needed.


	6






	We engage contractors from time to time to consult with us on
	specific corporate affairs or to perform specific tasks in connection with our
	programs.



	Plan of Operation



	You should read the following discussion of our financial
	condition and results of operations together with our unaudited financial
	statements and the notes to those unaudited financial statements included
	elsewhere in this filing prepared in accordance with accounting principles
	generally accepted in the United States. This discussion contains
	forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our
	actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these
	forward-looking statements.





	Anticipated Cash Requirements



	Based on our net loss of $59,536 incurred during the nine month
	period ended October 31, 2016, our monthly usage rate is approximately $6,600.
	We estimate our operating expenses and working capital requirements for the
	twelve month period beginning November 1, 2016 to be as follows:







	Estimated
	Expenses For the Twelve Month Period ending November 31, 2017




	 


	 


	 




	Professional fees

	 60,000

	$


	 150,000


	 





	Total




	$




	 210,000



	 






	We had $Nil in cash as of October 31, 2016, and a working
	capital deficit of $268,104. Until we complete another transaction, acquisition
	or business combination, our cash requirements will be in regards to maintaining
	our corporate existence, and ensuring compliance with our Securities and
	Exchange Commission continuous disclosure obligations, including our financial
	reporting requirements. In addition, we will require additional capital in order
	to investigate and conclude any future transaction, acquisition or business
	combination. In order to improve our liquidity, we plan to pursue additional
	equity financing from private investors or possibly a registered public
	offering. We do not currently have any definitive arrangements in place for the
	completion of any further private placement financings and there is no assurance
	that we will be successful in completing any further private placement
	financings. If we are unable to achieve the necessary additional financing, then
	we plan to reduce the amounts that we spend on our business activities and
	administrative expenses in order to be within the amount of capital resources
	that are available to us.

	Revenue



	We have not had any revenues from operations since inception
	(February 2, 2005). We do not anticipate that we will earn any revenues from
	operations unless and until we acquire and operate a profitable business. This
	might never happen and we can offer no assurance that even if we acquire a
	business that we will ever be profitable.

	Operating Activities



	Net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended
	October 31, 2016 was $82,315 compared with $13,560 for the nine months ended
	October 31, 2015. Our management believes that we will need additional funding
	in order to meet our operating expenses.



	Financing Activities



	Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months
	ended October 31, 2016 was $82,315 compared with $12,477 for the nine months
	ended October 31, 2015.




	We have suffered recurring losses from operations. The
	continuation of our company is dependent upon our company attaining and
	maintaining profitable operations and raising additional capital as needed.



	Future Financings



	We will require additional funds to implement our growth
	strategy in our new business. These funds may be raised through equity
	financing, debt financing, or other sources, which may result in further
	dilution in the equity ownership of our shares.


	There can be no assurance that additional financing will be
	available to us when needed or, if available, that it can be obtained on
	commercially reasonable terms. If we are not able to obtain the additional
	financing on a timely basis should it be required, or generate significant
	material revenues from operations, we will not be able to meet our other
	obligations as they become due and we will be forced to scale down or perhaps
	even cease our operations.



	Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements



	We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are
	reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition,
	changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations,
	liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to
	stockholders.

	Critical Accounting Policies



	The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and
	results of operations are based upon our financial statements, which have been
	prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
	United States of America. Preparing financial statements requires management to
	make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets,
	liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected
	by managements application of accounting policies. We believe that
	understanding the basis and nature of the estimates and assumptions involved
	with the following aspects of our financial statements is critical to an
	understanding of our financial statements.


	The accompanying unaudited interim financial statements have
	been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for
	interim financial information and the rules and regulations of the Securities
	and Exchange Commission. They do not include all information and footnotes
	required by United States generally accepted accounting principles for complete
	financial statements. However, except as disclosed herein, there have been no
	material changes in the information disclosed in the notes to the financial
	statements for the year ended January 31, 2016 included in our companys Form
	10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The unaudited interim
	financial statements should be read in conjunction with those financial
	statements included in the Form 10-K. In the opinion of management, all
	adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation, consisting solely of
	normal recurring adjustments, have been made. Operating results for the nine
	months ended October 31, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that
	may be expected for the full year.

	Item
	4.           
	 Controls and Procedures




	Managements Report on Disclosure Controls and Procedures



	We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are
	designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports
	filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded,
	processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
	Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms, and that such information
	is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our president and
	chief financial officer (our principal executive officer, principal financial
	officer and principal accounting officer) to allow for timely decisions
	regarding required disclosure.


	As of the end of our quarter covered by this report, we carried
	out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our
	president and chief financial officer (our principal executive officer,
	principal financial officer and principal accounting officer), of the
	effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and
	procedures. Based on the foregoing, our president and chief financial officer
	(our principal executive officer, principal financial officer and principal
	accounting officer) concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were

	control over financial reporting; and





	5.        The registrant's
	other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed, based on our most recent
	evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant's
	auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's board of directors (or

	(a)



	All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in
	the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which
	are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to
	record, process, summarize and report financial information; and





	 


	 


	 




	 


	(b)
