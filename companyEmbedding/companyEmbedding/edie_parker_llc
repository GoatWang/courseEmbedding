In the annals of downtown New York, a certain mystique surrounds Barneys' erstwhile 17th Street location. Opened in 1986 and called Barneys New York, it became a hub for a bygone Chelsea demimonde, triangulated between the department store, the church-cum-club Limelight, and bohemian artist haven the Chelsea Hotel. A subway ride—and a world—away from uptown stalwarts Saks and Bergdorf Goodman, the then family-owned firm (which began as a neighborhood shop specializing in men's suits, founded by Barney Pressman in 1923) consolidated a series of row houses east of its Seventh Avenue building to form a 70,000-square-foot, six-floor luxury fashion emporium, equipped with a majestic Art Deco spiral staircase and Peter Marino-designed interiors and filled with a mix of established and emerging labels. Chanel jackets rubbed shoulders with Vivienne Westwood mini- crinis and Prada backpacks. "Barneys has an incredible history of discovering some of the world's best fashion talent," says COO and top merchant Daniella Vitale. It has also attracted some of the world's best—and sometimes wackiest—creative minds. Perhaps the most well known of these is window dresser emeritus and creative ambassador-at-large Simon Doonan. Coming on board the year the 17th Street store opened, Doonan "established a culture of daring, risk-taking, and pushing social boundaries that very much defines who we are today," Vitale says.





Courtesy of Barneys New YorkAdvertisement - Continue Reading BelowPeople flocked to see Doonan's outrageous and instantly iconic celebrity caricature window displays (S&M Margaret Thatcher, Sex-era Madonna covered only by black "censored" boxes) that aimed not just to sell product but to connect with culture, and they stayed for the groundbreaking fashion. "It was the ultimate sort of groovy scene," Doonan says. "The kind of place where you might see a top brain surgeon browsing a rack alongside Alice Cooper, not just a bunch of trendy people sucking in their cheeks."

Female Rock Climbers Share Fitness Secrets
But as times and people—and perhaps most of all, New York City—changed, Barneys joined the glossy ranks on NYC's Madison Avenue in 1993 and rolled out seven more flagships and 18 other stores and outlets from Boston to Beverly Hills. Perhaps due to such rapid expansion, the Pressmans found themselves in financial distress and shuttered the Chelsea branch in 1997. Following the company's acquisition by hedge fund manager Richard Perry (husband of designer Lisa) in 2012, Barneys is once again feeling flush and will reopen a flagship this month in the very building where the magic started. Steven Harris Architects has been commissioned to create yet another grand staircase, this one supermodern and wrapped in custom glass.




Scott FrancesLike any department store in 2016, Barneys is hyperconscious of how to compete in an era of click-to-buy convenience and drone-delivered insta-goods. To that end, the store is equipped with iBeacon technology: Customers with the Barneys app on their phones will receive pop-up notifications with multimedia content, such as videos and designer interviews, as they browse the store. Salespeople will carry mobile point-of-sale devices equipped with Apple Pay to get shoppers in and out in a matter of minutes. Though they'll probably want to stick around for the windows: Current creative director Dennis Friedman—who in recent years has elevated the store's uptown window displays to the level of public art by partnering with a Rolodex of creatives, from Baz Luhrmann to artist Alex Katz to Jay Z on steampunk-inspired Christmas wonderlands and kinetic Pop Art installations—will translate Barneys' Bruce Weber-lensed spring ad campaign (featuring a cast of current NYC characters including Cyndi Lauper, female FDNY chief Rocky Jones, nightlife icon Ladyfag, and transgender actress Mya Taylor) for those 17th Street-facing vitrines. "Barneys is a unique crossroads of fashion, pop culture, and creativity, with the most talented designers, photographers, and other creative professionals. It's always moving forward and never dull," CEO Mark  Lee says. "Just like New York itself!"This article originally appears in the March 2016 issue of ELLE.More from ELLE:
