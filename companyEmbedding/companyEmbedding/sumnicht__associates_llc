Licensing









                        Licensing information is provided in the BBB Business Profiles to inform the public about industries that may require professional licensing, bonding, or registration.

Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.

Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo

  Identifying, constructing and monitoring complex investment portfolios
  requires a significant amount of time, insight and resources. Sumnicht &
  Associates Separately Managed Accounts Program through Envestnet offers a
  dedicated investment team to facilitate creation of customized portfolio
  solutions for our high-net-worth clients.

  Our investment officers follow a detailed Four Step process in creating
  portfolios:

Step 1: Identifying
  Investor Needs and Objectives
  Working with Envestnet, Sumnicht & Associates profiles investors based on
  their investment time horizon, liquidity needs, desired rate of return and
  tolerance for risk. The result is a complete understanding of objectives and
  investment horizon, an understanding of tax status, an analysis of liquidity
  and portfolio concentration, determination of any asset class or security
  preferences, and an analysis of investment attitude and aversion to risk.

Step 2: Determine
  Asset Allocation Policy
  We execute a two-step asset allocation strategy for every portfolio. First,
  we create a Strategic Asset Allocation to establish parameters among asset
  classes. Next, a Tactical Asset Allocation is created which aims to optimize
  the long-term return of the portfolio while keeping the risk level constant.
  This tactical allocation is achieved by fully evaluating the chosen asset
  classes and appropriating the portfolio among select sub-asset classes.
  Combined, this process delivers a detailed blueprint for the investment plan.

Step 3: Recommend
  Premier Asset Managers and Implement Portfolio Strategy
  Selecting asset managers wisely is critical, but it is the blending of these
  managers into a portfolio that maximizes return and minimizes risk that is
  the essence of portfolio management. This is accomplished through a thorough
  understanding of the unique attributes of each manager. Without this insight,
  the philosophy of active management is only partly achieved.

  The available asset managers represent portfolio management strategies across
  all asset classes and styles, and have been selected following a rigorous and
  ongoing due diligence process. Our team works to develop a portfolio that
  creates the appropriate solution as an integrated whole rather than in parts.
  Managers are selected for the portfolio that blend well together and fit into
  the determined asset allocation strategy. After we have selected the asset
  managers for the portfolio, we create a fully customized, comprehensive
  portfolio proposal.

Step 4: Ongoing
  Portfolio Management and Monitoring
  Once the portfolio strategy has been implemented, we begin a multi-tiered
  review process to ensure the portfolio continues to meet its objectives. We
  continually monitor the chosen managers to ensure they adhere to the
  philosophy and investment style for which they were selected. Ongoing due
  diligence of the managers in our program ensures consistency and relevance.
  Our team will also monitor portfolios for imbalances that arise as the market
  shifts to favor a style or asset class. We will rebalance portfolios as
  necessary to conform to the established asset allocation plan.
