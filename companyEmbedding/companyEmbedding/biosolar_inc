BioSolar is developing a breakthrough technology to double the storage capacity, lower the cost and extend the life of lithium-ion batteries. A battery contains two major parts, a cathode and an anode, that function together as the positive and negative sides. Today's state-of-the-art lithium-ion battery is limited by the storage capacity of its cathode, while the anode can store much more.

            BioBacksheet®
            


A Low Cost High Performance Green Backsheet for Solar Panels
  BioSolar is the leading commercial provider of bio-based solar panel backsheets. A backsheet is a required insulating film in all solar photovoltaic panels. Its primary purpose is to protect the solar panel components, specifically the solar cells and wires from environmental elements such as stress or moisture, which can degrade the 20+ year life of solar panels. Most backsheets are made from petroleum-based plastics. BioBacksheet is made from plant based renewable materials.
	                
BioSolar�s BioBackSheet is the only commercially available Underwriters Laboratory (UL) certified bio-based backsheet. BioBacksheet has features and benefits that are unmatched by traditional backsheets from the largest supplier.  
			



Features
Benefits



Bio-Based Green Materials
BioBacksheet is lower cost than conventional backsheets by using plant based materials, which are not subject to the rising price of petroleum.  BioBacksheet makes solar panels more sustainable and renewable.


High Thermal Conductivity
BioBacksheet can increase the power output of solar panels by quickly transferring heat away from solar cells, which lowers the operating temperature and improves solar conversion efficiency and power output.


Monolayer Construction
Conventional backsheets are made by laminating multiple layers of materials to provide combined functionality.  These layers often delaminate and degrade the life of the solar panel.  BioBacksheet employs a breakthrough monolithic (single layer) construction that does not exhibit inter-layer delamination.



Certifications


BioBacksheet is the only solar panel backsheet certified as Biobased Product under the USDA BioPreferred� program, where federal agencies and its contractors are required by law to purchase products that are biobased. 


BioBacksheet is the only biobased backsheet with UL material certification. Complete solar panels incorporating BioBacksheet have also been UL certified at the panel level. 



							Fully integrated solar panels incorporating BioBacksheet have been IEC certified at the panel level.

            MARKET
            



Energy Storage Market To Hit $50 Billion By 2020
With a modern world running on electricity, the need for battery storage has never been greater. The ability to store energy, take it on the go, and use it later, has opened up a new world of "Killer Apps" such as long range electric vehicles, iPhones, and storage of renewable wind and solar energy for later use. The key to enabling these Killer Apps is better and lower cost batteries.
            
             According to a 2014 report from Lux Research, the global energy storage market will rise to $50 billion by the year 2020, with a compound annual growth rate of 8%. Much of the growth will be in electric vehicles, which will rise to $21 billion, followed by the incumbent consumer electronics segment such as iPhones, which will rise to $27 billion, with a reminder of $2.8 billion in stationary applications such as solar, back up power, and grid storage.
          
GTM Research and the Energy Storage Association predict that the energy storage market in the United States will triple in 2015, and will grow from $128 million in 2014 to $1.5 billion by 2019.  Over 70% of installed energy storage capacity uses lithium-ion batteries, as the technology is proven and bankable.
High Growth Markets


Electric Vehicles
 Transportation is the fastest growing segment of the battery industry and is one of the biggest users of energy storage. For example, with a modest sale of 440,000 units, electric vehicles will use $6.3 billion worth of batteries. This represents only a tiny sliver of the worldwide market of over 70 million cars per year. A low cost, fast charging, and long-range battery will enable the mass adoption and affordability of clean-energy electric vehicles to replace fossil fuel vehicles. 



Solar Energy Storage
One hour of solar energy can power the entire world for a day. While cost-effective and efficient solar panels have allowed us to convert solar energy into useful electricity, the problem remains that the Sun does not shine at night. Cost effective battery solutions can fundamentally change the face of solar energy from a daytime-only power source to a full-time power source. As of 2014, nearly 90% of U.S. energy storage is deployed by the power companies.  But, GTM Research and the Energy Storage Association predict that the fastest market will be deployments by end-users such as residential, commercial and industrial users, and is expected to be 45% of the overall market by 2019. Solar integration and demand charge management will primarily drive this growth.



Consumer Electronics
Consumer electronics include everything from mobile phones, laptops, power tools, to flashlights, will continue to be a huge segment of the market. Lux Research estimates this to be a $27 billion market by 2020. Higher energy capacity and rapid charge will enable mobile lifestyles where we don't have to worry about running out of battery, or be attached to wall outlets of airport terminals waiting for that extra charge.

BioSolar is developing a breakthrough technology to double the storage capacity, lower the cost and extend the life of lithium-ion batteries. A battery contains two major parts, a cathode and an anode, that function together as the positive and negative sides. Today`s state-of-the-art lithium-ion battery is limited by the storage capacity of its cathode, while the anode can store much more. BioSolar initially focused its development effort on high capacity cathode materials since most of today`s Li-ion batteries are `cathode limited.` With the goal of creating the company`s next generation super battery technology, BioSolar is currently investigating high capacity anode materials recognizing the fact that the overall battery capacity is determined by combination of both cathode and anode.

BioSolar, producer of innovative bio-based solar energy products, is currently developing a breakthrough supercapacitor technology for reducing the cost of storing the energy of the sun. Existing battery technologies, such as lithium-ion batteries, are good for longer-term energy storage, but cannot be charged or discharged rapidly. This limits the use of batteries to power backup applications. Inspired by nature, BioSolar is developing a low cost polymer-based supercapacitor that can be charged and discharged hundreds of times faster than batteries, and will complement batteries for the storage of solar energy. By integrating BioSolar supercapacitors, as the high power frontend to battery banks, daytime solar energy can be quickly and cost-effectively stored for nighttime use. This potentially game-changing technology will allow users of solar energy systems to reduce their dependence or go completely off the electric utility power grid.

BioSolar, Inc. announced that the Company has executed a joint development agreement with Top Battery Co. Ltd. This agreement follows the Company’s previous announcement that it had successfully completed the laboratory phase of its silicon alloy nanocomposite anode material development with data suggesting its technology can achieve significantly higher capacity with lowered costs. The Company has also recently commenced the engineering phase that focuses on designing and testing the electrodes based on the Company’s anode material, as well as full cell design and evaluation with commercially available high capacity cathodes. BioSolar, with its proprietary technology relating to silicon alloy nanocomposite anode material for lithium-ion batteries, believes Top Battery is a natural fit as a developmental partner. Top Battery possesses experience in incorporating technologies such as BioSolar’s anode material, and in designing and manufacturing lithium-ion electrodes, cells and battery systems for customers. BioSolar and Top Battery have agreed to ongoing, collaborative efforts to assess, develop, manufacture, and/or market high power high energy lithium-ion batteries integrating BioSolar technology and Top Battery technology.


BioSolar, Inc. Bags $500 million Supply Deal from Energizer Holdings, Inc. for High Energy Anode Material
Feb 8 17
BioSolar, Inc. announced it has entered into a $500 million deal to supply, high-energy anode material for lithium-ion batteries to Energizer Holdings, Inc. The deal will catapult BioSolar on top in the battery industry in 2017, giving fillip to its global expansion. The company aims to develop very high capacity, super batteries that will allow electrical devices to work for longer durations, or electrical cars to run double their current range.


BioSolar, Inc. Reports Progress on its High-Energy Anode Material for Lithium Ion Batteries
Jan 24 17
BioSolar, Inc. provided a progress report on the development of its high-energy anode material for next generation lithium batteries. The company recently completed the initial test of its silicon-metal (Si-M) anode material for lithium-ion batteries. During this test, a recent batch of the company’s Si-M anode material was evaluated against a benchmark silicon-carbon anode material, known as one of the best silicon anode materials commercially available. During the test, both silicon materials were prepared to reach the energy storage capacity of over 620mAh/g at the electrode level, and evaluated at full cell configuration with lithium nickel cobalt aluminum oxide (LiNiCoAlO2) cathode electrodes. One of the significant parameters that can project battery performance is the capacity retention after 200 charging and discharging cycles. At identical loading, prototype batteries with the company's Si-M anode retained 78.1% of the original capacity whereas the benchmark silicon anode retained just 76.6% of its original capacity.

The customer’s PV panels feature lightweight, high-power-to-weight ratio, highly durable, customizable shapes, sizes and colors.


Dr. David Lee, the company’s CEO commented, “This first commercial order marks an important event in the history of our company. In spite of recent turmoil in the solar market, we have found success. Customers are attracted to the unique product features of BioBacksheet, including single layer composition, reliability, efficiency and cost competitiveness. Though the sales cycle for specialty PV panels can be shorter than mainstream PV panels, it is important to note that the durability requirements in this market segment are much more stringent than what is normally expected from standard PV components.”


“The length of time it takes for mainstream PV customers to complete the full purchase cycle is long, but it also creates a barrier of entry for the competition,” Lee added. “BioSolar is now in position to expand sales into mainstream PV market as we have completed successful internal testing, qualification, and UL material certification. Our sales and support efforts during the past 12 months have resulted in certain large customers obtaining panel level UL or IEC certifications. We look forward to achieving our next major milestone which is receiving purchase commitments from large scale solar manufacturers.”


Dr. Lee concluded, “Solar is one of the fastest growing markets in the world and BioSolar is very well positioned to benefit from the surge in demand. Our patent pending BioBacksheet is the world’s first and only UL certified solar panel backsheet made from renewable materials and features two distinct benefits that are unmatched by existing backsheets. First, BioBacksheet’s high thermal conductivity rapidly draws heat away from the solar cells, which can increase the power output of the entire solar panel and also improve long term durability by decreasing temperature fluctuations. Second, BioBacksheet’s USDA BioPreferred Certification allows solar panels to be marketed as more sustainable and socially responsible, and preferred by U.S. government agencies.”

Its name was changed to BioSolar, Inc. on June 8, 2006. The Company is developing a technology to produce bio-based materials from renewable plant sources that would reduce the cost per watt of Photovoltaic solar modules. It is introducing a new dimension of cost reduction by replacing petroleum-based plastic solar cell components with durable bio-based components. The process for producing electricity from sunlight is known as Photovoltaics. Photovoltaic is the science of capturing and converting sun light into electricity. The Company is focusing on producing bio-based components that meet the thermal and durability requirements of current solar cell manufacturing processes for conventional crystalline cell designs as well as thin film PV devices. It also focuses on bio-based backsheets, substrates, superstrates, module and panel components. The solar industry relies on two … distinctly different solar energy technologies. Solar energy could be converted directly into electricity using photovoltaic devices or into heat by solar thermal devices. Photovoltaics is derived from the words photo, meaning light and voltaic, meaning voltage producing. Its product development focus is based on photovoltaic technology, thus the Company is a part of the photovoltaic segment of the industry. The Company competes with manufacturing backsheet and other plastic components for PV devices companies, such as Madico, Inc.
