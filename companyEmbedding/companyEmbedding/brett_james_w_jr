Background

		Mr. James W. Brett, Jr., also known as Jim, has been Chief Executive Officer & Director at J. Crew Group, Inc., since July 2017. Mr. Brett served as the President of West ELM Brand at Williams-Sonoma, Inc. from January 2010 to June 5, 2017. He oversaw all aspects of the fastest growing brand in the Williams-Sonoma Inc. portfolio. He developed an influential new look and feel for the brand's products and marketing and an innovative strategy to engage new and core customers ... in the stores, catalog, online and through social media. In 2012, he oversaw the launch of West Elm Market, a collection of products in the kitchen, garden, care & repair and personal care categories, with a focus on functional design, local production, entrepreneurship and community connections. An advocate for global handicraft, product provenance and the scaling of small production goods, he has expanded West Elm's product range by collaborating with craft workers and artisan communities around the world. He led the brand's cross-channel and first of its kind partnership with Etsy.com. In 2013, he initiated the brand's Clinton Global Initiative Commitment to Action: a two-year, $35 million handcraft purchasing plan supplemented by a transparency pledge around the making and sourcing of those products. Mr. Brett joined West Elm from Urban Outfitters, in 2010 with more than 19 years of retail experience. Prior to West Elm, Mr. Brett was the Chief Merchandising Officer for the Urban Outfitters Division of Urban Outfitters, Inc. He oversaw all categories of the popular lifestyle brand and led the development of exclusive and private label products, brand collaborations and a redefined brand portfolio. He has also served in various merchandising roles at other retailers including Anthropologie, the J.C. Penney Company, Inc. and May Department Stores Company. Prior to Urban Outfitters, Mr. Brett developed a passion for home goods as the Merchandise Manager for the Anthropologie Home brand, traveling extensively to source products and inspiration from around the world. He has also served in various merchandising roles with leading retailers including the J.C. Penny Corporation, Inc. and May Company Department Stores. He has been Director at Cole Haan LLC since January 2016. He is active in the Dumbo Improvement District, revitalization advocacy for one of New York's earliest industrial neighborhoods and the "It Gets Better Project," an international anti-bullying movement in support of LGBT youth. Mr. Brett holds a Bachelor's degree from Boston University.Read Full Background
