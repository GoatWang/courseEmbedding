EDR-108 Pow'R Back'R
Double your SAFETY
Double your FUN
No Hassles!




	The EDR-108 Pow'R Back'R uses two 6V Battery Packs and two 
	Heavy-Duty Double-Pole Switches to provide Dual-Redundant security 
	to your airborne system, just like in full-size aircraft.
	
	With the EDR-108 Pow'R Back'R, you can tolerate a single failure 
	(open-circuit, short-circuit, low voltage) in either battery pack, 
	or switch, or battery wiring, without losing radio control.

	The EDR-108 Pow'R Back'R continually monitors both battery packs and 
    switches for the one with the higher voltage, and routes that to your Rx and 
    servos.
    
    You may combine different size packs. In practice, with two good 
    packs, the EDR-108 draws power equally from both packs, adding their 
    individual capacities.
    I.e., if Battery #1 is a 6V/600mAH pack, and Battery 
    #2 is a 6V/1200mAH pack, you will have an 1800mAH power supply onboard, with 
    at least 600mAH to fly on, in case of a failure.
	 



Tech Note:
Our EDR-108 Pow'R Back'R is 
    STILL the ONLY Redundant Battery system currently on the market that 
    offers TRUE "ground isolation" between the two batteries. 
    
This means that you can safely use any 
    multi-output charger, or, two DC field chargers connected to the same 12V 
    field box battery, to charge your two redundant batteries thru the switch 
    harnesses, hassle-free.  


    Without this feature exclusive to the EDR-108, your chargers may become 
    confused by the "common ground" between the batteries, and the batteries may 
    end up being improperly charged.  We all know what THAT means!
Without our EDR-108?  The only safe 
    way to charge those two batteries is to unplug one of them from the switch 
    harness...  or, use two separate, single-output AC chargers.
     What a hassle!
FAQs: 

How much current can the EDR-108 handle?

The EDR-108 is capable of handling up to 
    6 Amps 
    continuous DC, and 20 Amps pulse (20ms ON / 40ms OFF).  That's more 
    than RC system wiring and connectors can handle.  RC connectors are 
    rated to handle a max. of 3 Amps.

Doesn't the single output of the EDR-108 
    limit its maximum current?

Most RC receivers have only one battery port, so 
    the standard EDR-108 has one output cable.  This does limit the total 
    current that the RC system (receiver/servos) can handle.  If is 
    possible, in most receivers, to supply power thru more than one port, e.g., 
    thru the battery port plus an unused servo channel, since 
    battery power in the receiver is internally routed (paralleled) to all servo 
    outputs. 
To take advantage of this, by popular request, 
    we now offer a dual-output option, our EDR-108T, in all our packages, which 
    allows the Pow'R Back'R to supply a full 6 Amps to the receiver/servos.
Just select Dual-Output 
    EDR-108T in the ordering options below:

			ElectroDynamics, Inc. started out in 1991, in my basement (whose basement?), with a staff of part-timers and my trusty old 386 computer doing the design and CAD work.



			Twenty years later, ElectroDynamics is now located in an 2500 sq. 
            ft. manufacturing facility and walk-in store, with fulltime technical and 
            administrative staff.

			We have grown from our first hand-built conventional circuit boards



			to our present state-of-the-art SMT (Surface Mount Technology) 
			









			and high-tech battery assembly equipment. 


			We now run 
			several multimedia computers on a local area network, doing order processing, accounting, payroll, engineering, design, CAD/CAM and desktop publishing for our ads!
			
			In addition, we do custom engineering design and development work for the 
			aerospace industry:

Meet the Pres...

    First, my professional life: 



	I graduated from the University of Singapore in 1977 with a Bachelor's in Electronic Engineering.  After that, I worked for 10 years as an Electronics and Control Systems designer in industrial automation.  In 1987, I went back to school and graduated from the University of Michigan with a Master's in Aerospace Engineering.  After that, I worked in the automotive industry, in electronic engine controls.  
	





In 1991, I decided to venture out on my own, and combine my love of engineering and my love of aviation.  I started ElectroDynamics, 
Inc. armed only with my dreams and some personal savings.





 







Next, my "hobby" life (can you still call it a hobby if you 
            work at it for a living?



			I started aero modeling "for real" in 1967 in high school, with my first Cox PT-19 U-control trainer.  Why "for real"?  Every one who's got aviation in their blood, must have had a childhood punctuated with plastic airplane kits and the odd chuck glider and rubber-powered ship.
			





			I later progressed in CL (U-control was also called Control Line), culminating in competition in CL Racing, Stunt and Combat.  1969, and still actively flying CL, saw me saving a whole year's lunch money for my first Single Channel Proportional RC set.  











It was a "Hinode" Single-Channel unit, with rudimentary Analog Encoding, rather than today's Digital Encoding.  In 1971 I got my first Digital Proportional 4-channel Futaba radio (at that time sold as MRC).  Haven't looked back since.  I'm now active in all aspects of the RC sport:  Pylon Racing, Pattern, Helicopters, IMAA Giant-Size, Gliders, Ducted Fans, 
    		Turbines.
