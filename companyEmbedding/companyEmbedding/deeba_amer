Acknowledging the market leading position of cc:Mail and the significance of e-mail in corporate environments, Lotus acquired the company in 1991.

						Amer Deeba Joins Qualys As Vice President of Marketing
					

ePayments and Security Veteran will spearhead global marketing of proactive network security defense

Sunnyvale, Calif. — October 16, 2001 — Qualys, Inc., a leading provider of enterprise network vulnerability assessment and monitoring solutions, today announced that Amer Deeba has joined the company as Vice President of Marketing. Mr. Deeba will spearhead Qualys’ global marketing at a time of mounting interest in proactive network security measures due to the proliferation of such network security exposures as Code Red and Nimda.  
With a track record of driving company growth in emerging technology fields, Mr. Deeba was most recently acting as General Manager of VeriSign’s Payment Services Division where he helped establish VeriSign as a leader in secure online payments.  
“Amer Deeba joins us at a time when an increasing number of companies are embracing online network vulnerability scanning, a technology pioneered by Qualys,” said Philippe Courtot, Chairman and CEO of Qualys. “His expertise in secure online technologies and experience in building and packaging Internet services will benefit both Qualys and our partners and resellers as we continue to establish online scanning as a ‘must-have’ network security tool.”  
Qualys-powered online vulnerability scanning services enable any-sized business to audit its networks remotely via the Internet in order to detect security vulnerabilities, assess risks, and receive advice on fixes. Numerous high-profile security companies, including VeriSign and Mercury Interactive, have made Qualys scanning part of their total security offerings.  
“Code Red and Nimda are just the tip of the iceberg of today’s escalating network security exposures,” said Deeba. “Qualys has built a powerful infrastructure that allows companies to proactively scan and safeguard their networks against these and other vulnerabilities as they emerge and are identified, all without having to install and maintain any software or hardware.”  
Prior to VeriSign, Mr. Deeba was Director of Product Marketing for online payments-pioneer Signio, which was subsequently acquired by VeriSign. He has also held a variety of technical and management positions at Adobe, Verity and Amdahl. He holds a degree in Electrical Engineering, and a Masters in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science.  
About Qualys
With more than 2,000 subscribers ranging from small businesses to multinational corporations, Qualys has become the leader in on demand vulnerability management and policy compliance. The company allows security managers to strengthen the security of their networks effectively, conduct automated security audits and ensure compliance with internal policies and external regulations. Qualys’ on demand technology offers customers significant economic advantages, requiring no capital outlay or infrastructure to deploy and manage. Its distributed scanning capabilities and unprecedented scalability make it ideal for large, distributed organisations. Hundreds of large companies have deployed Qualys on a global scale, including AXA, DuPont, Hershey Foods, ICI Ltd, Novartis, Sodexho, Standard Chartered Bank and many others. Qualys is headquartered in Redwood City, California, with European offices in France, Germany and the U.K., and Asian representatives in Japan, Singapore, Australia, Korea and the Republic of China.

As with all your investments through Fidelity, you must make your own determination whether an investment is appropriate for you.  Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.  Foreign securities are subject to interest-rate, currency-exchange-rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.  Illiquidity is an inherent risk associated with investing in real estate and REITs.

Closed-end funds can trade at a discount to their NAV.  Shareholders of Master Limited Partnerships may be treated as partners for tax purposes.  Partnerships issue a Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) rather than a Form 1099 form for tax purposes.
