Student Transportation Inc., doing business as Student Transportation of America (STA) and Student Transportation of Canada (STC), is a New Jersey-based school bus contractor that focuses on rural and suburban areas. It is the third-largest school bus transportation services provider in North America, with over 11,500 vehicles that transport students in more than 225 school districts.[2]
History[edit]
Student Transportation of America was founded in 1997 by Denis J. Gallagher, who is the chairman and CEO of the company.[2] With roots that can be traced to New Jersey’s Coast Cities Bus Service established in 1922 by Gallagher’s grandfather, STA successfully completed an initial public offering and its income participating securities (IPS) began trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange in December 2004.[2]
In November 2009, the company changed its name from Student Transportation of America, Ltd., to Student Transportation Inc. It continues to use the trade names Student Transportation of America and Student Transportation of Canada.[3]
Student Transportation has grown considerably through its "A‑B‑C-D" (Acquisition, Bid, Conversion, and Direct-to-Parent) growth strategy.[4][5][6] Among STA's customers is the Los Angeles Unified School District, which is the second largest school district in the United States.
Student Transportation, although based in New Jersey, is publicly traded on both the Toronto Stock Exchange and Nasdaq.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

Student Transportation Inc., doing business as Student Transportation of America (STA) and Student Transportation of Canada (STC), is a New Jersey-based school bus contractor that focuses on rural and suburban areas. It is the third-largest school bus transportation services provider in North America, with over 11,500 vehicles that transport students in more than 225 school districts.[2]
History[edit]
Student Transportation of America was founded in 1997 by Denis J. Gallagher, who is the chairman and CEO of the company.[2] With roots that can be traced to New Jersey’s Coast Cities Bus Service established in 1922 by Gallagher’s grandfather, STA successfully completed an initial public offering and its income participating securities (IPS) began trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange in December 2004.[2]
In November 2009, the company changed its name from Student Transportation of America, Ltd., to Student Transportation Inc. It continues to use the trade names Student Transportation of America and Student Transportation of Canada.[3]
Student Transportation has grown considerably through its "A‑B‑C-D" (Acquisition, Bid, Conversion, and Direct-to-Parent) growth strategy.[4][5][6] Among STA's customers is the Los Angeles Unified School District, which is the second largest school district in the United States.
Student Transportation, although based in New Jersey, is publicly traded on both the Toronto Stock Exchange and Nasdaq.

Student Transportation Inc., doing business as Student Transportation of America (STA) and Student Transportation of Canada (STC), is a New Jersey-based school bus contractor that focuses on rural and suburban areas. It is the third-largest school bus transportation services provider in North America, with over 11,500 vehicles that transport students in more than 225 school districts.[2]
History[edit]
Student Transportation of America was founded in 1997 by Denis J. Gallagher, who is the chairman and CEO of the company.[2] With roots that can be traced to New Jersey’s Coast Cities Bus Service established in 1922 by Gallagher’s grandfather, STA successfully completed an initial public offering and its income participating securities (IPS) began trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange in December 2004.[2]
In November 2009, the company changed its name from Student Transportation of America, Ltd., to Student Transportation Inc. It continues to use the trade names Student Transportation of America and Student Transportation of Canada.[3]
Student Transportation has grown considerably through its "A‑B‑C-D" (Acquisition, Bid, Conversion, and Direct-to-Parent) growth strategy.[4][5][6] Among STA's customers is the Los Angeles Unified School District, which is the second largest school district in the United States.
Student Transportation, although based in New Jersey, is publicly traded on both the Toronto Stock Exchange and Nasdaq.
