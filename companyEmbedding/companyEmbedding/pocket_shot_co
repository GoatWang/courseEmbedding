        				Custom Pocket Shots
        			






























The Pocket Shot  is the evolution of the slingshot.  Our patented circular design allows users to load and shoot different projectiles at two to three times the rate of a regular slingshot. Perfect for hunters and recreational use as its tiny size allows you to keep it in your pocket, tackle box, or backpack while storing ammo in its watertight compartment.  Up to 350 feet per second, the Pocket Shot is not a toy.   Created and built in the USA, our team takes pride in our invention and hopes you enjoy it as much as we do.







When the Pocket Shot is in use, it measures 5 inches long but the Pocket Shot measures only 2.3 inches by 1.3 inches when it is closed.     

 






 









We recommend to use 1/4 inch up to 5/16 inch steel slugs, marbles, small paintballs around .4 cal, and airsoft for the Pocketshot.  We DO NOT recommend Bb's as they will tear the pouch and may be dangerous.

 






 


























 
Our pouch molds with power fins (patent pending) have been specially designed to maximize power and accuracy.    Each pouch is dipped in the highest quality latex and hand rolled to perfection.  All pouches go through an inspection process to insure quality.  
Our Pocket Shot base ring, locking ring, and cap have all been CNC'd in steel to ensure every unit is identical.  The material used to make the pocket shot is a high impact polycarbonate composite that can be found in some top of the line knife and gun handles.

Q & A







DeSantis Pocket Shot™ Holster






A unique and effective way to conceal a small semiautomatic pistol. This all-leather holster disguises itself as a wallet, but it can be brought into action instantly without removing the pistol, and it won’t interfere with magazine release or safety operation. Ambidextrous. Made in USA.

                    Product description
                    
                 


The inventors of the Pocket-Shot took over the basic function of the slingshot and rejected the classical design to replace it with a more powerful mechanic. Through this revolutionary approach they could improve virtually all performance aspects   of a conventional slingshot. That gives the Pocket-Shot an outstanding performance which makes it almost not comparable to other slingshots: The Pocket-Shot will reach up to 300 fps with the black pouch and up to 350 fps with the blue pro pouch. 350 fps match 350 km / h. This gives the bullet a stable trajectory as well as maximum penetration power. A bullet Pocket-Shot Ammo made of hardened carbon steel fired with the Blue Pro Pouch will reach an energy level of about 12 joules. This equals up to six times the penetration power of a conventional slingshot. This makes the Pocket-Shot much stronger than almost all Airsoft- , Paintball- and Air-Rifles that are restricted to 7,5 Joules and have much smaller projectiles. The Pocket-Shot is literary made to fit into your pocket so you will be able to carry it around all day. It weighs only 55 grams and can be compactly stowed on 6 x 2 cm. So this gives you an extremely powerful slingshot, but also one that you can carry always and everywhere in your pocket. We recommend original Pocket-Shot Ammo of hardened carbon steel. In addition to precise trajectory and high impact strength, they are cheap and easy to carry within the Pocket-Shot. Next also conventional ball bearings, paintball bullets of all calibers, Airsoft ammunition, ceramic balls, marbles, roundish stones, up to various sweets (z. B. Drops like M&M's) or bait for fishing can be fired by the Pocket-Shot. The Pocket-Shot also allows to fire the Pocket-Arrow, an take down arrow made of carbonfibre. The Pocket-Arrow as well as the original Pocket-Shot Ammo can be found in our amazon shop and ordered in addition to optimize shipping costs.

Rarely even get near to hitting them, plus isn't designed for acorns.  But I wouldn't want to use steel ball bearings, as recommended, on squirrels, pigeons, stray cats, foxes and occasional rat.  But I expect ball bearings would be more accurate.Read more0Comment|

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse1.0 out of 5 starsCheap and nastyByAmazon Customeron 17 May 2017Verified PurchaseSo astounded when I unboxed this thing and found the quality of the bands to be absolutely horrible, you can see from the photo if you get the full sized full quality version that the exterior of the sock looks like someone left dripping paint to dry! The interior is no better and is full of little pockmark flaws which really are not the kind of thing I'd expect from paying a premium price, I only conceded to buy this thing cos gamekeeper john gave it the thumbs up, but they sent him his version and clearly keep the good stuff for those that might spread the word! shall edit this review after a couple of weeks or maybes hours if other reviews are to be believed to see how it goes, have to say I'm not expecting great things though since it feels more like vulcanised rubber than natural latex! Anyway check the photos I've added of the blue sock ( the black being admittedly a bit better ). I'm going to improvise a pouch using a reshaped puncture repair patch and suggest that pocketshot follow suit because the marks on my black pouch are after 3 shots with 9mm steel,the inertia of which are shock stretching the elastic. Meaning these things really are going to break without modification, simple as thatRead more

The Pocket Shot 









homeabout usprivacy policysend emailsite mapview cartAll CategoriesHome > Special Deals! > The Pocket Shot - FREE SHIPPINGThe Pocket Shot - FREE SHIPPINGItem# PS-100$27.00This item is currently out of stock!Product DescriptionMUST BE 18+ TO PURCHASE THIS ITEM.  Buyer assumes full responsibility when purchasing this item if injury occurs.  The Pocket Shot is NOT a toy and should be used responsibly.  Safety and Liability DisclaimerOrder during this promotion and get a Free Patch of your choice.The Pocket Shot  is the evolution of the slingshot.  Our patented circular design allows users to load and shoot different projectiles at two to three times the rate of a regular slingshot. Perfect for hunters and recreational use as its tiny size allows you to keep it in your pocket, tackle box, or backpack while storing ammo in its watertight compartment.  Up to 350 feet per second, the Pocket Shot is not a toy.   Created and built in the USA, our team takes pride in our invention and hopes you enjoy it as much as we do.When the Pocket Shot is in use, it measures 5 inches long but the Pocket Shot measures only 2.3 inches by 1.3 inches when it is closed.Pocket Shot includes one standard pouch and one pro-pouch. Our cap and rings are made of noryl resins.  Strong and durable for your outdoor needs.We recommend to use 1/4 inch up to 5/16 inch steel slugs, marbles, small paintballs around .4 cal, and airsoft for the Pocketshot.  We DO NOT recommend Bb's as they will tear the pouch and may be dangerous.Our aluminum pouch molds with power fins (patent pending) have been specially designed to maximize power and accuracy.    Each pouch is dipped in the highest quality latex and hand rolled to perfection.  All pouches go through an inspection process to insure quality.Our Pocket Shot base ring, locking ring, and cap have all been CNC'd in steel to ensure every unit is identical.  The material used to make the pocket shot is a fiber reinforced composite that can be found in some top of the line knife and gun handles.Sign up to receive coupons, special offers and new product announcements.  Your Email Address:Special Deals!ApparelPatchesStickersIntrepid SoapHousewaresGear from Friends of TSPThe Survival PodcastPatch AddictsJoin us on Facebook!Linkshome | about us | privacy policy | send email | site map | view cartCopyright Š 2015 Antpack Inc.

The Pocket Shot is the evolution of the slingshot. Our patented circular design allows users to load and shoot different projectiles at two to three times the rate of a regular slingshot. Perfect for hunters and recreational use as its tiny size allows you to keep it in your pocket, tackle box, or backpack while storing ammo in its watertight compartment. Up to 350 feet per second, the Pocket Shot is not a toy. Created and built in the USA, our team takes pride in our invention and hopes you enjoy it as much as we do.

However after shooting it less than 100 times the standard pouch has a hole in it already, making it unusable. I am not sure if i just got a defective one or if this is standard. I only shot 1/4 inch ball bearings pulling back 8 to 10 inches. i really hope this isn't normal because it has potential to be an awesome product. I will email the company and update this after i hear from them.Read more22 comments|

Product Review: Pocket Shot, the World's Only Circular Slingshot           












Skip to main content        Toggle navigation       Open Search form  Search for:  Search    Product Review: Pocket Shot, the World’s Only Circular Slingshot Pocket Shot Posted by Daniel LeathersOctober 22, 2016   Not really a slingshot and not really a toy, the Pocket Shot is a versatile tool that’s fun to shoot and can be used for hunting as well. The Pocket Shot is also the world’s only circular slingshot. Everything from ball bearings to arrows and crossbow bolts can be shot through this uniquely designed little tool. There are a few things to consider before purchasing, but overall, it’s well worth it. Here’s the rundown.The Pocket Shot delivers various sizes of steel balls at up to 350 feet per second (fps) and can deliver a wallop with properly sized arrows. For the purpose of this review, I used 5/16″ Trumark Steel Ammo, which cost just under $5 for a package of 72.





Image courtesy of Daniel LeathersI also tried numerous arrows and lengths and found that the best arrow was a Victory VTAC Sport 500. I used a 2″ Blazer fletchings. However, The Pocket Shot company will be rolling out their own arrows mid-November, according to a company spokesman.The Pocket Shot comes standard with the ability to shoot strictly ball bearings, unless you purchase the arrow kit. Purchasing the basic Pocket Shot kit and then additional arrow pouches seems like the best value in terms of utility and enjoyment.The basic kit comes with two pouches, both of which are for use with steel ball ammo. The black one is your basic pouch and can hurl ammo around 300 fps while the blue one can get up to 350 fps. Either way, it’ll hurt if you get hit and can be used for hunting.The arrow kit is where it gets really interesting. You can purchase the nock covers to go on the ends of the arrows you use.Daniel LeathersThese covers are highly suggested by the company, and I will say you need to be sure to use them. They won’t last forever, as they tend to rub and wear thin themselves as seen below. However, during this testing period, I was able to continue using the same cover for well over 150 shots.Daniel LeathersThe decision not to use the covers is a foolish one. The arrow pouches are sturdy and will last a few hundred shots. Failure to use the cover will result (fairly quickly) in a hole being punched in the tip of the pouch. Learn from my mistake.Daniel LeathersI had a blast using and testing The Pocket Shot, and it works as well as, if not better than it advertises. It’s definitely a great addition to your bug-out bag, survival kit or toy box. Also, coming in at $25, it’s a great stocking-stuffer for Christmas.One of the big drawbacks—possibly the only one—is the instruction sheet. It is short and confusing. However, there are great tutorials on The Pocket Shot website. These tutorials walk you through assembly, aiming and general operations of The Pocket Shot.Daniel LeathersIf you decide to pick up The Pocket Shot, just skip the instruction sheet and go straight to their website. The other option is to just ask your local dealer if they have one you can shoot, and they can show you how to do everything. (Plus, you get to experience the fun before you take it home).NEXT: 8 NASTY DEER YOU WOULDN’T EAT FOR DINNER  you might also like         Product Review: Pocket Shot, the World’s Only Circular Slingshot              HomeHuntingDeerBowhuntingBig GameBird and Small GameWild Game RecipesNews And ResourcesFishingFreshwaterSaltwaterBaits, Lures & FliesWild Caught RecipesNews and ResourcesShootingGunsAmmoNews and ResourcesWildernessCampingSurvivalNature

  Jarrold Bachmann is not only the founder of Pocket Shot Spirits, but he’s also an avid big-game hunter. In fact, he’s made at least 40 hunting trips to Africa. On one visit to his farm in South Africa, he observed workers celebrating payday by drinking liquor from small sachets. He sensed an opportunity to fill an unmet need in the spirits market for a small, unbreakable, easy-carry, easy-open, pocket-sized flexible “bottle” that stands up on a bottom gusset.








Not only would a flask-like stand-up pack be unique for spirits, but it would also be suitable for the on-the-go lifestyles that were creating a growing demand for “single-serve” portions like Pocket Shot for many consumables. So, he decided to capitalize on this trend, identifying a target audience of travelers, golfers, and other sports and outdoor enthusiasts.

 


In 2006, the Evergreen, CO-based company introduced the Pocket Shot, a line of spirits packaged in the unbreakable 50-mL plastic packs that are now available in 11 flavors. Products are sold at retail, through spirits distribution channels, and online by some retailers, in about 27 different U.S. states, and in Europe, Canada, the Caribbean Islands, and Puerto Rico.
“Our tagline is that the Pocket Shot goes anywhere,” says Bachmann. The Pocket Shot single pack sells for $1.49 to $1.99, with price determined by the retailer. It’s also sold in what Bachmann calls “a stadium-type display box,” that contains 12 pouches, and at the distributor level in a “rainbow pack” that includes 10 boxes of 12 pouches.
Premade Pocket Shot pouches are a layer structure providing strength, sheen, and attractive graphics. Bachmann has sourced the pouches from different vendors over the years, but the primary supplier is Amcor Flexibles Europe & America. Pouches have been printed via both flexo and gravure printing methods over the years. The pack earned a Silver Award for Sustainability in the 2012 Flexible Packaging Assn.’s Annual Achievement Awards.
The pouch is an adhesive lamination of 48-ga (12 microns) oriented polyester/48-ga polyester coated with aluminum oxide/2.8-mil low-density polyethylene sealant layer that’s U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved for contact with alcohol.
Challenging pouch geometry
Each pack has an opening along the top edge that must be sealed once the package has been filled with product. The top contour of the Pocket Shot package simulates a bottle top with a shoulder and cap—presenting a complicated geometry to seal. To avoid potential leaks, the sealing process needs to seal through alcohol caused by splash back on the sealing surfaces that occurs during filling.
Adding complexity is that the seal process is temperature-sensitive, requiring Pocket Shot to avoid temperatures that might trigger the flash point of alcohol. Pocket Shot initially used a heat-seal process that first melted the plastic for joining, followed by a cold seal to prevent excess temperatures and smooth out voids and wrinkles created by the heat seal.





The sealing method was adequate to launch the product. But once production volume reached the necessary high-speed levels of 30+ packs/min, the hot-seal/cold-seal process resulted in frequent leaks, and lost productivity, which caused product recovery costs that threatened the viability of the product. Fortunately, few leakers actually made it to the retail level.
Through a personal relationship, Bachmann learned of Branson’s reputation in ultrasonic plastics joining and asked for a recommendation. Ultimately, Branson Ultrasonics, part of Emerson Industrial Automation, conducted a thorough analysis of Pocket Shot’s existing materials, package design and production requirements, and determined the proper pressures and ultrasonic specifications to create the necessary seal.
Branson designed a unique horn (through finite element analysis software) and anvil that perfectly matched the contoured sealing surfaces of the package top. When tested, prototype samples showed the ability of the ultrasonic sealing process to seal through the alcohol, producing a 100%-clean, clear, contaminant-free seal.
The ultrasonic action of the horn disperses the alcohol out of the seal area and allows the plastic to melt without the risk of triggering the flashpoint of alcohol. The prototypes also demonstrated the process could maintain the integrity of the seal under the high-volume cycle time of one seal every 2 seconds.
A bit of background
Since introducing the Pocket Shot, Bachmann has had the products filled by Frank-Lin Distillers Products, Ltd. The contract filler initially did not have the equipment for the pouch. Bachmann used personal connections and found equipment from Laudenberg—machinery, he says, that’s no longer made. [Entering Laudenberg.com redirects to SN] German Pouch-Pack Technology, whose website mentions the Laudenberg name.]
Pocket Shot Spirits owns the eight-station rotary filler and purchases the premade pouches and paperboard cartons. Frank-Lin handles filling, warehousing, and shipping. “They have been wonderful to work with because they took us on as a new project,” says Bachmann of Frank-Lin. “When they first started, we weren’t sure how well this was going to work. Since then, they have taken this kind of under their [wing], and have worked out any bumps in the road, including the high reject [rate] that we had from the previous sealing method.”
Premade, preprinted pouches arrive at Frank-Lin and are conveyed into the small-footprint Laudenberg machine. A thermal-transfer coder prints filling date, batch, and date-code information on the pouches. Suction cups help pull open the pouch from the shoulder area, assisted by a puff of air. Grippers hold the pouch while a plunger descends into the top of the pouch to open the gusset on the bottom. The next two stations fill the spirit into the pouch before the pouch rotates to the sealing station. After filling and sealing, the pouches are discharged for manual packing.
Turning to ultrasonic sealing
In reviewing the path he took to remedy the previous hot/cold-seal difficulties, Bachmann says he discussed the leakage problem with Branson, as well as another ultrasonic sealing company, with Frank-Lin, a group in Germany, and industry experts he respected.
“We didn’t have much leakage,” he says, “but that was the problem. We wanted something that was absolutely fool-proof and leak-proof. That’s why I talked to the Branson people. I have a very good friend who lives in Evergreen and has worked for Branson for probably 30 years.
“He ran some samples for me, and we would go out to lunch and talk about it. I went to trade shows and talked to his partners about the leakers. We never thought that the Branson sealer would fit on the filling machine because there is such a very small area that we have to work with on the pouch.”
Bachmann explains that Branson personnel decided to visit Frank-Lin to take a closer look at the facility and observe the equipment to see if they could get their unit in there on the machine. “They decided they could, so we ordered it. We took the old heat sealer and chill sealer off and installed this new one. Quite frankly, we didn’t know what we were getting into,” he admits.
The Branson machine began running on the older filling equipment in mid-2012. “Everything was heat seal before that,” Bachmann recalls. “If the product wasn’t in there just right and if you had any type of splash back or anything was wrong with the pouch, you might seal it with a heat sealer and it might have a little leak that could potentially be a problem.”
The good news was Pocket Shot Spirits had no consumer complaints. “One thing we wanted to make sure of was that we would handle the leakers as well as we possibly could,” says Bachmann. “I don’t think we had a lot of leakage on pouches actually going out on the market.”
Bachmann praises Branson Ultrasonics, noting, “I take my hat off to these people, who have gone way out of their way to make this fit and work. They have been very responsive. They have jumped through hoops for us.
“We feel very comfortable with this pouch and we are running probably about 35 pouches a minute now. Branson continues to look at ways to add parts to make sure that the machinery seals the pouches absolutely perfectly.”
Has the new sealing process reduced the amount of product waste or packaging waste? “Absolutely!” Bachmann states. “And we are very proud of it.”
Bachmann commends Branson for not only its technical ability to solve his problem, but also its responsiveness in meeting a challenging timeline to minimize his loss of production time. He expressed great relief knowing that, while his unique package presents a number of inherent challenges, he no longer has to be concerned about the integrity and strength of the seal. He’ll soon be expanding his production and distribution to serve new markets in the U.S. and Europe.

REVIEW: The Pocket Shot – This is not a toy!












Product review and photographs by Danielle Breteau
What is The Pocket Shot? Well, it is what I call a modern-day sling shot, but a little cooler, has an interesting design and is quite portable – but make no mistake, this is not a toy!

Let’s get the statistics out of the way first: The Pocket Shot is a closed pouch made of latex with a base and locking ring that compresses the latex ends. This design allows for a solid grip on the front end and a clear line of projection for your ammunition – in this case a steel slug.
Pocket Shot claims that it has a projection rate of 350 feet per second, and while we did not actually use a chronograph I can say that we had to seriously tone down the amount of pull force we were using, because this little thing is deceivingly powerful.
It is 100-percent made in the USA and comes with two latex pouches or bands as they call them: the black one, which is the thicker and slower velocity option and the super blue band that is lighter but quicker and can achieve higher velocities.
The recommended ammo choices run in the 1/4-, 5/16-, and 3/8-inch size ranges, and it is highly discouraged to use anything smaller than 1/4-inch.

Loading
Loading is easy and while the Pocket Shot comes with about 100 ball-bearing rounds, the imagination runs wild with other options: pebbles, confetti, darts, paint balls, pepper balls, etc. Noteworthy: Pocket Shot also makes an arrow-specific unit called The Pocket Shot Arrow. (Note to self – must get one of these!)
Just unscrew the cap, place the projectile into the pocket and voila! Loaded. Grasp the ring firmly with one hand, claps the ball bearing through the rubber pouch, pull back and aim.




Changing pouches/bands
Changing bands is ridiculously easy – If you know how to put your socks on, you should be good to go, however you must also understand that there are two rings at the mouth of the Pocket Shot, not just one bulky one – I will not go into depth on how long it took me to figure this out, but suffice it to say I saved you at least 30 minutes of precious time.
There is a locking ring that unscrews from the base ring. This releases the mouth of the pouch/band so you can readily change it out.
  
 
 
Aiming and accuracy
Just like anything that might require skill and accuracy, we found that there was a wide variety of marksmanship out of the box. Using only folks who had never fired the Pocket Shot before, but were all skilled shooters, we found that in some cases sight alignment and trigger control – if you will – worked great, but for others not so much. A shoot-from-the-hip approach worked best for them.
We started shooting from the 5-yard line and worked our way back as far the 15 yard line. For some, accuracy actually improved as the distance grew and for others, well, they should probably stick with barns and large open fields when using this little rocket.
Overall, there are numerous uses for the Pocket Shot and while practice is highly recommended, it is intensely fun. We even loaded as many as 8 ball bearings for a shot-gun effect, which worked brilliantly if you think a 5-foot spread at 5 yards is awesome! Great fun.
 

 
Safety
No kidding! This is not a toy and eye pro is a must. If you happen to miss your target, which would of course be somewhere located in a safe direction away from you and people you like to hang around with, and it ricochets off of a hard surface then you can be sure that “you will shoot your eye out” just like the Red Ryder. Not a toy – should be treated as a potentially serious weapon. Now doesn’t that make you just want one even more?
