Jeffrey Lewis - Outtakes LP - Soild Gold SG-00007












































Jeffrey Lewis was the poster boy for the Anti-Folk movement of the early 2000s, and is still going strong making smart, clever, outsider tinged pop songs. 
We, at PIAPTK and Soild Gold, have been HUGE fans of Jeffrey since long before either label existed, so it's an ENORMOUS honor for us to curate an outtakes compilation LP for Soild Gold. After years of begging him to do a release with us, he finally said (and I'm paraphrasing) "Well, I've got about 50 songs that I don't really like that you can hear.  I'm not a good judge of my own material, so you can give me some notes".  He sent over three CDs worth of amazing tunes in demo form.  I sent him a list of songs that I thought would go really well together on an LP.  He said (again paraphrasing), "I certainly wouldn't have chosen those tunes or running order, but I kind of like that it was curated by you and not me. Can you be sure that somewhere on the album it says that this wasn't my idea?".  So, in true Soild Gold fashioned we named the record "Jeffrey Lewis - Did Not Choose The Tracklisting or Sequence of This Record". 
Limited Edition of 200 Lps and 100 Cassette Tapes sold.
LPs on Goldenrod Vinyl and Cassettes on Gold tapes.
35 Gold with Red, yellow, and/or white Splatter vinyl will be sent to random purchasers.
Includes a JL Pinup poster.
TEST PRESSINGS: Do you like test pressings? We have 3 test pressings 
to be given away in a raffle. To enter the raffle, use the "pay what you 
want" option and enter a value (over $15) that includes change. Eric has 
chosen a number between .01 and .99, and the first three people to pay a value 
with that change amount, win the test pressing. For example, if Jeffrey chose $.02 
(hint: he didn't), and you paid $15.02, you win a test pressing. You have the 
same chance of winning whether you pay $15.02 or $250.02... However, if you 
throw in a little extra, it will be used to buy beers and hummus for the record 
packing party we hold when we receive each release from the pressing plant.
AND DON'T FORGET The Jeffrey Lewis Number Two Girl, CD-Record CD/Vinyl Hybrid disc.
New to Soild Gold? Pick up the cassette four pack with all 4 In-Print SG releases: Jeffrey Lewis, Grandaddy, Floating Action, and Eric Slick!

Collection Description
Special Notes
Tile Application



Jeffrey Court plays tribute to Mozart with the classic, micro mosaic stone designs found in Chapter 18 - Mozart's Mosaics. Classic in color, shape and design, this beautiful stone offering will add timeless elegance and sophistication to any interior. 

Elements within the Chapter 18 Motzart's Mosaics Collection, reflect the shade variations associated with natural stone. As with all natural stone tiles, we strongly recommend laying out and blending the tiles prior to installation. This step will ensure a proper color blend in order to achieve a classic look for your installation. Jeffrey Court highly recommends sealing all natural stone tiles with a high quality sealer prior to grouting to ensure an easy cleaning and as part of a maintenance regimen. Consult your sealer manufacturer for reapplication recommendations as part of an ongoing maintenance routine. All product shots are artistic interpretations of actual product. Due to the nature of the printing process, and/or screen color calibration we recommend obtaining physical samples of product for actual color representation. 

Natural stone mosaics add a level of design sophistication to each of Jeffrey Court's natural stone chapters. Among the natural stone mosaic designs are multicolored natural stone mosaic medleys, natural stone micro mosaics and exquisite natural stone mosaic patterns ranging from octagon to diamonds. Finishes are available in both rustic and polished and make the natural stone mosaics a perfect complement to any of the natural stone selections. Among the selections of natural stone mosaics are borders, corners and sheet mosaics with spectacular designs that are uniquely Jeffrey Court Natural Stone Tiles, in any space from urban loft to country estate. Jeffrey Court searches the world for distinctive Natural Stone Tiles that offer extraordinary quality and beautiful natural characteristics. Our variety of Natural Stone Tiles offer limitless design possibilities for any environment, and sets the standard for excellence and affordability. Explore the possibilities in each chapter and discover how Natural Stone Tiles can add warmth, character and sophistication to kitchens, baths, outdoor spaces, entryways and more. Natural Stone Tiles from Jeffrey Court--elegance that speaks for itself. Natural Stone Mosaic's are recommended for use in: Interior Walls, Interior Floors, Shower Floors, and Standard Shower Walls. Natural Stone Mosaic's are NOT recommended for use in: Exterior Applications, Wet Areas (submerged), and Steam Showers.

Every business winner has one thing in common: a YES! Attitude that’s powerful enough to help them achieve the impossible! When you’ve got a YES! Attitude, you assume everything will start with “YES!” …and you’ll find a way to “YES!” even when the first, second, and third answer you hear is “NO!” You say you weren’t born with a YES! Attitude? No problem!
Jeffrey Gitomer will give you all the tools you need to build one. As the world’s #1 expert in selling (and the author of the best-sellers Little Red Book of Selling and Little Red Book of Sales Answers) Gitomer knows more about attitude than anyone. Now he’s brought those lessons together in a book you can read in one sitting… a book that’ll change your life!
What makes this book unique? It’s not just “inspiration”: it’s a complete, step-by-step, fully-integrated game plan for understanding and mastering your attitude. You’ll learn 7.5 specific things you can do to maintain your intensity, drive, and commitment… discover 20.5 “attitude gems” that capture the value of thousands of dollars of books and courses… learn how to overcome the 10.5 most dangerous “attitude busters”… then learn how to maintain your YES! Attitude every day, for the rest of your life! Don’t just read this book once: study it, live it — and win.
 
















 
I am writing to thank you. Several months back, thanks to a Borders Gift Card, I picked up your book "Little Gold Book of Yes! Attitude" and since then, my life has been positively altered. 

I've always been a positive person but never to the degree discussed in your book. It became obvious to me that a change was necessary and having taken steps towards that change, life has been GREAT (note: life was always good, but now it's simply GREAT). 

My relationships have improved (work and personal), my work has improved, my outlook is clear and focused, and my success is inevitable. 

So, thank you from the bottom of my heart. Keep providing the means by which people can bring perspective to their lives. 

Best Regards, 
Dylan O.
