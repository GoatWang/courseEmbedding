Comfort Level - Are you comfortable telling the lawyer personal
information? Does the lawyer seem interested in solving your problem? 
Credentials - How long has the lawyer been in practice? Has
the lawyer worked on other cases similar to yours? 
Cost - How are the lawyer's fees structured - hourly or flat
fee? Can the lawyer estimate the cost of your case? 
City - Is the lawyer's office conveniently located?
Not sure what questions to ask a lawyer?Here are a few to get you started:

How long have you been in practice?
How many cases like mine have you handled?
How often do you settle cases out of court?
What are your fees and costs?
What are the next steps?

Respectable, informative biography, May 22, 2006


By William J. Higgins,III


This review is from: Caspar Collins: The Life and Exploits of an Indian Fighter of the 60s (Hardcover)

Agnes Wright Spring has done justice to Lieutenant Caspar Collins' short life with an insightful profile of this young man.Through the many letters of Lt. Collins, his father Colonel William Collins and his mother, we gain valuable understanding as to how life was during these turbulent times of the mid-1860's in central Wyoming.Indian depredations and butchery were everywhere during this time period, especially along the Emigrant Trail.  It was Lt. Collins' responsibility to protect emigrant wagon trains and telegraph stations along the Sweetwater River.  His letters are of utmost historical significance.  We read of Indian encounters, the fickled weather and harsh climate, availability of game, sacrifices and misfortunes of the military, conditions at the outposts, names of pioneers and military personnel, etc.Lt. Collins was killed at the famous Platte Bridge Battle in 1865, two months before his twenty-first birthday.  His namesake is carried on with the present day city of Casper, Wyoming (misspelling from years ago), Casper Mountain and Casper Creek.Well written.  An important read for both researcher and novice alike.

Trial Lawyers













Attorneys: A lawyer is a person who practices law, as an advocate, barrister, attorney, counselor or solicitor or chartered legal executive. Working as a lawyer involves the practical application of abstract legal theories and knowledge to solve specific individualized problems, or to advance the interests of those who hire lawyers to perform legal services. The role of the lawyer varies greatly across legal jurisdictions, and so it can be treated here in only the most general terms.


Construction Lawyers: Construction law is a branch of law that deals with matters relating to building construction, engineering and related fields. It is in essence an amalgam of contract law, commercial law, planning law, employment law and tort. Construction law covers a wide range of legal issues including contract, negligence, bonds and bonding, guarantees and sureties, liens and other security interests, tendering, construction claims, and related consultancy contracts. Construction law affects many participants in the construction industry, including financial institutions, surveyors, architects, builders, engineers, construction workers, and planners.


Consumer Protection Lawyers: Consumer protection is linked to the idea of consumer rights, and to the formation of consumer organizations, which help consumers make better choices in the marketplace and get help with consumer complaints. Other organizations that promote consumer protection include government organizations and self-regulating business organizations such as consumer protection agencies and organizations, ombudsmen, the Federal Trade Commission in America, and Better Business Bureaus in America and Canada, etc.
