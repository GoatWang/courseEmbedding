                                    In November 2004, Gen-Probe acquired from Qualigen an exclusive option to develop a point-of-use nucleic acid testing (NAT) instrument based on Qualigen's FDA-approved FastPack® immunoassay system.





Tosoh Corporation 
                               
                                    In December 2003, Gen-Probe entered into agreements with Tosoh Corporation to cross-license intellectual property covering certain NAT technologies. The licenses cover products in clinical diagnostics and other related fields.





Rebio Gen, Inc. 
                               
                                    In July 2001, Gen-Probe entered into a license agreement with Chugai Diagnostics Science Co., Ltd., which was later acquired by Fujirebio and re-named Rebio Gen, Inc. The agreement offers a non-exclusive license for Japan in the field of human clinical diagnostics to various of our proprietary technologies.

Gynecologic surgery








 At Hologic, we believe all women deserve to be free of debilitating gynecologic conditions that can rob them from enjoying life to its fullest. Delivering innovative, simple and efficient gynecologic surgical products that address these conditions is an important part of our mission.
In 2002, we introduced the first of these products – the NovaSure endometrial ablation system – for the rapid and effective treatment of abnormal uterine bleeding. To date, more than 2 million NovaSure procedures have been performed worldwide. For more than 90% of women undergoing this procedure, menstrual bleeding is dramatically reduced or eliminated altogether.
We continue to expand our family of GYN surgical products, offering a wide range of customized solutions that can help you dramatically improve the lives of your patients. One of the newest additions is the MyoSure tissue removal system, which enables you to quickly and conveniently remove intrauterine pathology under direct visualization. Together, we are reshaping the future of gynecologic health, so that patients no longer need to suffer in silence or alter their activities to accommodate emotionally stressful, painful – even life-altering – gynecologic medical conditions.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million
Updated: June 9, 2013
Data Format: CSV

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

Hologic Completes Acquisition of Cynosure
-- Transaction Provides Entry into Large, Fast-Growing Medical Aesthetics Market, Boosts Hologic's Growth Rate --





MARLBOROUGH, Mass., March 22, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Hologic, Inc. (Nasdaq: HOLX) announced today that it has completed the acquisition of Cynosure, Inc., a leader in medical aesthetics systems and technologies, for $66 per share in cash.
"We are pleased to complete our acquisition of Cynosure, and look forward to working with Michael Davin and the entire Cynosure team to achieve even greater success in the large, rapidly growing medical aesthetics market," said Steve MacMillan, Hologic's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer.  "Acquiring Cynosure, combined with divesting our blood screening business, fundamentally reshapes our business portfolio and makes us a stronger, faster-growing company."  
The tender offer by a subsidiary of Hologic for all the outstanding shares of Cynosure Class A Common Stock expired as scheduled at midnight ET on March 21, 2017.  A total of 17,047,830 shares of Cynosure Class A Common Stock, representing approximately 70.6% of Cynosure's outstanding shares, were validly tendered into and not validly withdrawn from the tender offer.  As a result, Hologic and its subsidiary have accepted for payment and will promptly pay for all shares that were validly tendered and not validly withdrawn.
Following its acceptance of the shares tendered, Hologic caused the merger of its subsidiary with and into Cynosure without a vote of Cynosure's other stockholders, pursuant to Section 251(h) of the Delaware General Corporation Law.  As a result of the completed merger, Cynosure became a wholly owned subsidiary of Hologic.  In connection with the merger, all eligible Cynosure shares not validly tendered into the tender offer have been canceled and converted into the right to receive $66 per share, the same price per share offered in the tender offer.  As a result of the acquisition, Cynosure shares will cease to be traded on NASDAQ.
Hologic intends to discuss the financial implications of the acquisition on Wednesday, May 10, when the company reports its financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2017 and provides updated financial guidance.
Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC is serving as financial adviser to Hologic.  Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz is serving as legal adviser. Leerink Partners LLC is serving as financial adviser to Cynosure.  Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP is serving as legal adviser. 
About Hologic
Hologic, Inc. is a leading developer, manufacturer and supplier of premium diagnostic products, medical imaging systems for breast and skeletal health, GYN surgical products, and medical aesthetic systems.  With a broad range of market-leading technologies and a robust research and development program, Hologic is dedicated to The Science of Sure.  For more information on Hologic, visit www.hologic.com.

Forward-Looking Statements
This news release contains forward-looking information that involves risks and uncertainties, including statements about Hologic's plans, objectives, expectations and intentions.  Such statements include, without limitation: financial or other information based upon or otherwise incorporating judgments or estimates relating to future performance, events or expectations; the company's strategies, positioning, resources, capabilities, and expectations for future performance; and financial and other guidance.  Any statements that are not statements of historical fact (including statements containing the words "believes," "plans," "anticipates," "expects," "estimates" and similar expressions) should also be considered to be forward‑looking statements.  These forward-looking statements are based upon assumptions made as of this date and are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated.  
Risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect the company's business and prospects, and otherwise cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated, include without limitation: the possibility that the anticipated benefits from the proposed transaction cannot be fully realized or may take longer to realize than expected; the possibility that costs or difficulties related to the integration of Cynosure's operations with those of Hologic will be greater than expected; the ability of the combined company to retain and hire key personnel; the effect of the continuing worldwide macroeconomic uncertainty, including the UK's decision to leave the European Union, on business and results of operations; the uncertainty of the impact of cost containment efforts and federal healthcare reform legislation on the company's business and results of operations; the impact to Hologic's results of operations from the disposal of its blood screening business to Grifols, and the operational challenges of separating this business unit from Hologic's molecular diagnostics business; the impact and anticipated benefits of completed acquisitions and acquisitions Hologic may complete in the future; the development of new competitive technologies and products; regulatory approvals and clearances for products; the anticipated development of markets in which products are sold into and the success of products in these markets; the anticipated performance and benefits of products; estimated asset and liability values; the impact and costs and expenses of any litigation the company may be subject to now or in the future; compliance with covenants contained in Hologic's debt agreements; and Hologic's capital resources and the adequacy thereof. 
The risks included above are not exhaustive.  Other factors that could adversely affect the company's business and prospects are described in the filings made with the SEC. Hologic expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any such statements presented herein to reflect any change in expectations or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statements are based.

Advanced Search

                There are 3 types of search. Please only use one option at a time.
                
1) Build a boolean search string.
Ensure that document matches include...

...all of these word(s):



...and optionally include these word(s):



...but do not have these word(s):




2) Search for a phrase:

Enter your phrase:




3) Search on part of a word:

Enter the first few characters of a word:




Submit



Information on how to use Search

                    There are 2 types of basic queries: Terms and Phrases.
                    A Term is a single word search.
                    A Phrase would wrap a string of words in quotes and find matches on the extact string.
                

Boolean Operators
You can combine basic queries with Boolean operators to form a more complex query. Boolean operators define the relationships between Terms or Phrases. Our search supports the following Boolean operators: AND, "+", OR, NOT and "-". Please note that Boolean operators must be all uppercase.
                

AND
example search: default AND document
                    This is the default operator. It will be used if there is no Boolean operator between two terms. For example:
                    default document is the same as default AND document. In this case both terms need to exist within a listing to find a match on that listing.The + character is synonymous with using AND.
                

OR
example search: default OR document
                    In this case just one of the terms needs to exist within a listing to find a match on that listing.
                

NOT
example search: default NOT "document type"
                    The NOT operator excludes documents that contain the term (or phrase) after NOT. So a listing match would have to include the word default but not the phrase "document type". The - character is synonymous with using NOT.
                

Wildcard/Prefix queries
You can perform "wildcard" or "prefix" queries using the '*' operator. Whereas all of the previous search found exact matches on the whole term or phrase, a wildcard search will find partial matches.
                    example search: ehr*
                    This query will match all documents containing words beginning with the prefix 'ehr' like the word Ehrlichia.

New Study Further Supports Screening with Pap+HPV Together™ as Best Way to Detect Cervical Cancer and Pre-Cancer
Co-testing with Pap+HPV Together™ results in significantly fewer false-negative results than either test used alone 1





MARLBOROUGH, Mass., May 3, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- A new cervical cancer screening study demonstrates that Pap+HPV Together™ (co-testing) remains the most effective strategy for detecting high-grade cervical lesions1,2, Hologic, Inc. (Nasdaq: HOLX) announced today. The study, published this month in Cancer Cytopathology, a peer-reviewed journal of the American Cancer Society, also showed no significant difference between the sensitivities of the Pap and HPV tests when either was used alone as a primary screening method.1 

Study details1: The authors, from Houston Methodist Hospital, evaluated a database with 130,648 Pap test results. Of these patients, 47,499 were screened with Pap+HPV Together and 1,654 underwent follow-up biopsies. The HPV test results were performed using the cobas® HPV test and cobas® 4800 System from Roche Diagnostics, while the Pap tests were performed with the ThinPrep® Pap test (a liquid-based test) from Hologic or the SurePath™ liquid-based Pap test from BD Diagnostics.Key takeaways1: The study confirmed that screening with Pap+HPV Together detected more cases of pre-cancer and cancer than either test used alone. Pap+HPV Together missed significantly fewer cases of high-grade cervicovaginal lesions – only 1.2 percent – compared to either the cobas HPV test (8.7 percent) or the Pap test (9.1 percent) when used alone. Further, when used alone as primary screening methods, sensitivity results for the cobas HPV test and the Pap tests were comparable, according to the study. 
The researchers concluded, "Our data strongly support the view that currently, cytology-HPV co-testing is the best strategy for screening women who are 30 years old or older."  
"With data continuing to mount that screening with Pap+HPV Together is more effective than screening with either HPV or Pap alone in women over 30, the clinical benefit of continuing the co-testing strategy is clear," said Edward Evantash, M.D., Medical Director and Vice President of Medical Affairs, Hologic. "This study underscores the value of real-world data in accurately reflecting test performance as compared to clinical trial results alone." 
The Pap test performance in the study aligned with the College of American Pathologists (CAP) benchmarking database, demonstrating that when cytology performance is on par with U.S. national averages, co-testing performance is optimized.  
The study further supports current consensus guidelines from multiple organizations, including the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, which recommends screening for cervical cancer with a Pap test and an HPV test together for women ages 30 to 65.3
"All women deserve the best possible protection against cervical cancer, which is once again proven to be the use of Pap and HPV tests together," said Evantash. "Offering HPV-alone screening would be a step backward and unnecessarily put women's lives at risk."
The new study corroborates previous research, including the largest retrospective cervical cancer screening study conducted in the United States, the 2015 Quest Study.2 The Quest Study found that Pap+HPV Together identified more cervical pre-cancer and cancer than either test used alone,2 and demonstrated that one in five cases of cervical cancer was missed with HPV-alone screening.2*

Hologic Completes Acquisition of Cynosure
-- Transaction Provides Entry into Large, Fast-Growing Medical Aesthetics Market, Boosts Hologic's Growth Rate --





MARLBOROUGH, Mass., March 22, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Hologic, Inc. (Nasdaq: HOLX) announced today that it has completed the acquisition of Cynosure, Inc., a leader in medical aesthetics systems and technologies, for $66 per share in cash.
"We are pleased to complete our acquisition of Cynosure, and look forward to working with Michael Davin and the entire Cynosure team to achieve even greater success in the large, rapidly growing medical aesthetics market," said Steve MacMillan, Hologic's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer.  "Acquiring Cynosure, combined with divesting our blood screening business, fundamentally reshapes our business portfolio and makes us a stronger, faster-growing company."  
The tender offer by a subsidiary of Hologic for all the outstanding shares of Cynosure Class A Common Stock expired as scheduled at midnight ET on March 21, 2017.  A total of 17,047,830 shares of Cynosure Class A Common Stock, representing approximately 70.6% of Cynosure's outstanding shares, were validly tendered into and not validly withdrawn from the tender offer.  As a result, Hologic and its subsidiary have accepted for payment and will promptly pay for all shares that were validly tendered and not validly withdrawn.
Following its acceptance of the shares tendered, Hologic caused the merger of its subsidiary with and into Cynosure without a vote of Cynosure's other stockholders, pursuant to Section 251(h) of the Delaware General Corporation Law.  As a result of the completed merger, Cynosure became a wholly owned subsidiary of Hologic.  In connection with the merger, all eligible Cynosure shares not validly tendered into the tender offer have been canceled and converted into the right to receive $66 per share, the same price per share offered in the tender offer.  As a result of the acquisition, Cynosure shares will cease to be traded on NASDAQ.
Hologic intends to discuss the financial implications of the acquisition on Wednesday, May 10, when the company reports its financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2017 and provides updated financial guidance.
Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC is serving as financial adviser to Hologic.  Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz is serving as legal adviser. Leerink Partners LLC is serving as financial adviser to Cynosure.  Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP is serving as legal adviser.

Hologic Announces FDA Clearance of Aptima® Assay to Detect Herpes Simplex Virus 1 & 2
-- Aptima HSV 1 & 2 Assay Now Available Alongside Women's Health, Virology Menu on the Fully Automated Panther System --













MARLBOROUGH, Mass. , June 20, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Hologic, Inc. (Nasdaq: HOLX) announced today that it has obtained FDA clearance to market the Aptima® Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) 1 & 2 molecular assay on the fully automated Panther® system. The test will be commercially available in the 50 United States, U.S. territories and Puerto Rico. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, infections with HSV-2, the herpes strain with more serious health implications, affect more than 24 million Americans.1



The Aptima HSV 1 & 2 assay can be used to qualitatively detect, and differentiate between, HSV-1 and HSV-2. Specimens collected in a broad range of transport media, including the Aptima specimen transport medium, can be tested with the assay.
"Helping our clinical lab customers consolidate testing on the Panther system enables them to be more efficient and productive," said Tom West, president of the Diagnostic Solutions Division at Hologic. "By partnering with our customers, we'll be better able to offer more people high-quality and faster testing results and improve detection of STIs like herpes. This new product clearance reflects our commitment to providing healthcare professionals and patients with greater certainty and peace of mind."
The HSV assay joins a growing list of molecular tests available on Hologic's Panther system, a market-leading, integrated platform that fully automates molecular testing for laboratories. The Panther system substantially reduces hands-on time for laboratories by providing random and continuous access with rapid turnaround time. Many U.S.-based laboratories today conduct HSV testing via live culture, which is both time-consuming, with additional manual steps, and slow, delivering results in days rather than hours. In addition, studies show that HSV molecular diagnostic tests are three to five times more sensitive than live culture samples.2 
Hologic estimates that tests run on the Panther system benefit more than 40 million people worldwide annually.3 These include assays for other sexually transmitted infections (such as Human papillomavirus, Chlamydia trachomatis/Neisseria gonorrhea, Trichomonas vaginalis) and a virology menu (including HIV-1 and Hepatitis C Viruses).
How the new assay works
The Aptima HSV 1 & 2 assay is a nucleic acid amplification test for the qualitative detection and differentiation of HSV types 1 and 2 in clinician-collected swab specimens from anogenital skin lesions. These samples can be collected using either the new Aptima Multitest Swab Specimen Collection Kit or commercially available viral transport media. The Aptima Multitest Swab Specimen Collection Kit offers healthcare providers greater versatility in sample collection.
The assay can be used to aid in the diagnosis of HSV-1 and/or HSV-2 infections in symptomatic women and men. It distinguishes between HSV 1 and 2, which is recommended in all patients with first-episode genital herpes.4 Patients with HSV-2 are at increased risk for contracting and transmitting HIV-1 (human immunodeficiency virus).5 Pregnant women infected with HSV-2 are at risk of transmitting the virus to their babies during birth, which can cause neurological complications.

New Study Further Supports Screening with Pap+HPV Together™ as Best Way to Detect Cervical Cancer and Pre-Cancer
Co-testing with Pap+HPV Together™ results in significantly fewer false-negative results than either test used alone 1





MARLBOROUGH, Mass., May 3, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- A new cervical cancer screening study demonstrates that Pap+HPV Together™ (co-testing) remains the most effective strategy for detecting high-grade cervical lesions1,2, Hologic, Inc. (Nasdaq: HOLX) announced today. The study, published this month in Cancer Cytopathology, a peer-reviewed journal of the American Cancer Society, also showed no significant difference between the sensitivities of the Pap and HPV tests when either was used alone as a primary screening method.1 

Study details1: The authors, from Houston Methodist Hospital, evaluated a database with 130,648 Pap test results. Of these patients, 47,499 were screened with Pap+HPV Together and 1,654 underwent follow-up biopsies. The HPV test results were performed using the cobas® HPV test and cobas® 4800 System from Roche Diagnostics, while the Pap tests were performed with the ThinPrep® Pap test (a liquid-based test) from Hologic or the SurePath™ liquid-based Pap test from BD Diagnostics.Key takeaways1: The study confirmed that screening with Pap+HPV Together detected more cases of pre-cancer and cancer than either test used alone. Pap+HPV Together missed significantly fewer cases of high-grade cervicovaginal lesions – only 1.2 percent – compared to either the cobas HPV test (8.7 percent) or the Pap test (9.1 percent) when used alone. Further, when used alone as primary screening methods, sensitivity results for the cobas HPV test and the Pap tests were comparable, according to the study. 
The researchers concluded, "Our data strongly support the view that currently, cytology-HPV co-testing is the best strategy for screening women who are 30 years old or older."  
"With data continuing to mount that screening with Pap+HPV Together is more effective than screening with either HPV or Pap alone in women over 30, the clinical benefit of continuing the co-testing strategy is clear," said Edward Evantash, M.D., Medical Director and Vice President of Medical Affairs, Hologic. "This study underscores the value of real-world data in accurately reflecting test performance as compared to clinical trial results alone." 
The Pap test performance in the study aligned with the College of American Pathologists (CAP) benchmarking database, demonstrating that when cytology performance is on par with U.S. national averages, co-testing performance is optimized.  
The study further supports current consensus guidelines from multiple organizations, including the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, which recommends screening for cervical cancer with a Pap test and an HPV test together for women ages 30 to 65.3
"All women deserve the best possible protection against cervical cancer, which is once again proven to be the use of Pap and HPV tests together," said Evantash. "Offering HPV-alone screening would be a step backward and unnecessarily put women's lives at risk."
The new study corroborates previous research, including the largest retrospective cervical cancer screening study conducted in the United States, the 2015 Quest Study.2 The Quest Study found that Pap+HPV Together identified more cervical pre-cancer and cancer than either test used alone,2 and demonstrated that one in five cases of cervical cancer was missed with HPV-alone screening.2*

Hologic's New Panther Fusion® System, Flu and Respiratory Assays Now CE Marked in Europe
-- New Panther Fusion® Module Expands Molecular Testing Capabilities, Increases Productivity and Flexibility for the Laboratory




















 


		Hologic Inc Panther Fusion
	






MARLBOROUGH, Mass., June 29, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Hologic, Inc. (Nasdaq: HOLX) has obtained a CE mark in Europe for its new Panther Fusion system and Panther Fusion assays for flu and respiratory testing, the Company announced today. The Fusion module system offers laboratories the ability to extend the testing capabilities of the existing Panther system.



The Panther Fusion module is an in-lab upgrade to the Panther® instrument. This addition adds the flexibility of PCR (polymerase chain reaction) to the proven performance of TMA (transcription-mediated amplification), which is used by the Panther system.  Offering labs multiple chemistries on a single platform enables further consolidation of their lab testing portfolio. The Panther Fusion system retains all the key benefits of the Panther platform, including fully automated sample-to-result automation, multiple tests from a single sample, random access sample processing, continuous loading, and STAT capabilities. 
Additional benefits include a higher throughput of up to 335 Panther Fusion tests in eight hours, or up to 500 Fusion and Aptima® tests. Flexibility is also improved with the addition of Open Access functionality to run laboratory-developed tests and protocols.  This new capability allows laboratories to concentrate on developing assays, while the Panther Fusion system automates workflow and reduces overall hands-on-time.
"The Panther Fusion system, the latest innovation from our Diagnostics division, creates an integrated workflow that provides our customers with enhanced flexibility and increased efficiency," said João Malagueira, VP Sales Diagnostics, EMEA. "The addition of the flu and respiratory assays to the broad menu of Aptima tests already available for the Panther instrument further extends the range of diagnostics tests that laboratories can run on one Hologic system. Hologic's flu and respiratory assays enable customers to run only the targets requested for a patient, allowing for personalized testing and helping them control costs within their laboratories."
The Panther Fusion respiratory panel assays include the Panther Fusion Flu A/B/RSV, Panther Fusion Paraflu, and Panther Fusion AdV/hMPV/RV tests.  The Panther Fusion respiratory assays offer a modular approach to syndromic testing via the ability to run one, two or all three assays from a single patient specimen depending on the needs of a given patient.
The new Panther Fusion PCR assays, combined with the Aptima TMA assays, make the Panther Fusion system the only instrument worldwide that combines TMA, real-time TMA and real-time PCR with full sample to result automation.
The Panther Fusion system and Panther Fusion assays have not been cleared for marketing by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and are not available for diagnostic use in the United States

Diagnostic product maker Gen-Probe Inc (GPRO) has received the European CE mark for its APTIMA assay for Trichomonas vaginalis, a sexually transmitted disease. Having achieved this milestone, the company can now market the assay in the European Union for this disease indication.
 
The APTIMA assay is yet to be cleared for marketing in the U.S. for Trichomonas vaginalis. Gen-Probe has completed clinical trials in the U.S. and is expected to submit a 510 (k) application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in late 2010.
 
Trichomonas, a sexually transmitted parasite, can cause inflammatory conditions such as vaginitis and urethritis and can make women susceptible to HIV infection. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, Trichomonas infection afflicts roughly 8 million people annually in North America, making it more prevalent than chlamydia and gonorrhea, the most common bacterial sexually transmitted diseases.   
 
Currently, screening for Trichomonas is limited, in part, due to the shortcomings of the existing testing methods such as culture and wet mount microscopy (microscopic examination of a sample). These traditional techniques are slow and less sensitive vis-à-vis molecular tests.  
 
The APTIMA Trichomonas assay leverages the same nucleic acid amplification technologies as Gen-Probe’s market leading chlamydia and gonorrhea test “APTIMA COMBO 2 assay. Based on the clinical study results, the company’s amplification technology offers greater sensitivity than the current test techniques.
 
Moreover, the APTIMA Trichomonas assay can be used with Gen-Probe’s TIGRIS system, the only fully automated testing system for molecular diagnostics, to test the same samples used with APTIMA COMBO 2. This will offer a convenient way for physicians and laboratories to provide fast and accurate detection of infectious diseases.
 
California-based Gen-Probe has been a pioneer in the commercial and scientific development of nucleic acid testing (“NAT) for the diagnosis of infectious diseases. It is a market leader in domestic gonorrhea and chlamydia testing with its PACE and APTIMA assay product lines. Gen-Probe competes with more established firms in the molecular diagnostic industry such as Roche (RHHBY  -  Free Report)	, Becton Dickinson (BDX  -  Free Report)	 and Abbott Labs (ABT  -  Free Report)	.
 
Gen-Probe is a leading pure-play molecular diagnostics company. The company’s molecular diagnostic tests and instruments are designed to improve results and increase laboratory operating efficiency. Gen-Probe’s clinical diagnostics business performed strongly in the last quarter with revenues growing nearly 30% year over year.
