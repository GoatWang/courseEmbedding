Bessette has served as President of the International Development Research Council (IDRC), now CoreNet Global. He is also Chairman of the Board of the MetroHartford Alliance and serves on the board of directors of the University of Connecticut Foundation.

Company Brief
The Travelers Companies, Inc. (www.travelers.com), offers a variety of property and casualty insurance products and services to businesses, organizations, and individuals in the United States and in select international markets. The company’s products are distributed primarily through 12,000 independent insurance agents and brokers throughout the United States. Travelers is number 93 on the Fortune 500 list of the largest publicly traded U.S. corporations.
Can you provide a brief overview of The Travelers Companies and the areas you’re specifically focused on?
We’re headquartered in Saint Paul, Minnesota, but we have significant operations in Hartford, as well as offices in the United Kingdom and Canada. We’re the second-largest writer of commercial U.S. property casualty insurance, and we’re the second-largest writer of personal insurance through independent agents. Our financial strength, wide range of products, and effective claims handling are just a few of our competitive advantages. We’ve grown over the past 20 years and have more than 33,000 employees worldwide, with more than 7,000 employees in Connecticut, 5,000 or so in the greater Hartford area, and we’ve been adding jobs at a significant pace over the past couple of years.
As Chief Administrative Officer, I’m responsible for human resources and administrative services, which includes facilities management, real estate, purchasing, security, food service, and aviation, as well as our foundation, which makes significant contributions nationwide and in the greater Hartford area.
Are the career opportunities within the industry, and at Travelers specifically, well understood, and how have you been so successful at retaining the talent?
Yes, our retention rates are excellent. We work very hard at providing mentoring and coaching for our employees, and we make sure that this is a place where people want to continue their careers. To do that, we have to give our employees opportunities for personal and professional growth. We’re proud that Travelers has been named one of Fortune’s “Most Admired Companies” and BusinessWeek’s “Best Places to Launch a Career,” as well as one of the “50 Best Internships.”
How important has it been for your workforce to mirror your client base, and how focused have you been on fostering a diverse culture and inclusiveness?
It’s very important that our workforce be reflective of our clients, who comprise a diverse community. Travelers has a very strong commitment to diversity. We talk about it, plan for it, and make sure that we’re actively involved in it through initiatives that include hiring a diverse workforce, fostering an inclusive environment, and providing learning and development opportunities. We have a program called the Travelers Education Access Initiative. We gave birth to the program about two years ago to get connected with young people from underrepresented communities, to provide the means for them to get to college and stay there through scholarships, part-time jobs, and internships. Once they get out of college, we give them the opportunity to come work for us. We’re putting millions of dollars into this program. It’s very important for our company, and it’s something we’re very focused on to help diversify our employee base.
How critical is corporate social responsibility to the organization?
We all want to give back to our communities and help other people – that’s human nature. Young people today are very interested in knowing what a company does for the community, and they are also very involved with green initiatives, which is part of my role here. Travelers is committed to being environmentally responsible. Our entire campus in Hartford and our entire campus in Saint Paul are Energy Star-compliant facilities. That’s huge for companies, because it’s a difficult achievement. In the area of community support, we give more than $5 million to the greater Hartford area alone in the areas of education, with things like the Travelers Education Access Initiative; community development, which is housing and economic development; and arts and culture.
You’ve also gravitated toward sports sponsorships, notably the Travelers Championship with the PGA TOUR. What made you feel that was the right fit?
Sponsoring the Travelers Championship was an easy decision because it’s good for our business, and it is good for the community because it benefits local charities. Our research found that golf is the number-one sport of our distribution network of agents and our customers. The tournament started in Hartford in 1952, but in 2006, it lost its place on the tour schedule. When a slot on the schedule unexpectedly opened up, we signed on as title sponsor and brought the tournament back to life as the Travelers Championship. The community really responded. Everywhere we go, we hear thanks and praise for saving the tournament. The two charities of the tournament are the Greater Hartford Jaycees, which does a lot of things in underserved communities around the greater Hartford region, and The Hole in the Wall Gang Camp, founded by Paul Newman in Ashford, which is a fabulous place for seriously ill children. Those relationships are important.

Andy Bessette: Former Olympian Brings Team Game to IDRC Presidency  - Site Selection Magazine - May 2000

Andy Bessette: Former Olympian Brings Team Game to IDRC Presidency 

b y     
J A C K
     
L Y N E




Leading the world's preeminent corporate real estate (CRE) association might seem an Olympian task. 

In fact, that's how 1980 U.S. Olympic team member Andy Bessette (right) views his upcoming stint as president of the International Development Research Council (IDRC). "Team," though, is the key word in the parallels between IDRC and the Olympics, where hammer thrower Bessette threw a 16-pound (7.2-kg.) ball on a four-foot (1.22-m.) wire more than 235 feet (72 m.) -- farther than most folks can fling a baseball. 

"A lot of people see hammer throwing as an individual sport, but it's a team sport as much as anything else," says Bessette, vice president of corporate real estate services for Travelers Property Casualty Corp. "I had a well-integrated team behind me: my coaches, people who helped me with sports psychology, my wife.

"And, yes, that's equally true with being IDRC president. I'm really proud to do it, but I'm just a cog in the wheel. What makes IDRC great is our team, our membership -- the most powerful thing we have. Our challenge as a team is to take IDRC and the profession to the next level." 


Extending IDRC's Integration 

"Only connect," wrote E.M. Forster. And that echoes how IDRC's incoming president operates. He's seemingly always searching for connections in words like "team" and "integration." 

Integration, in fact, is a recurrent theme in how Bessette envisions his 2000-2001 IDRC presidency, which will begin after IDRC's April 29-May 3 New York World Congress. That's certainly apropos, since IDRC has become a leader in Corporate Infrastructure Resource ManagementTM (CIR). 

Bessette, for example, wants to accelerate IDRC's integration of research, education and CRE certification. "And the Discovery and Leadership Forums (see pg. 368) are such great tools, with leadership at all levels visualizing the future in real time," he says. 
Bessette also sees huge potential payoffs in integrating with other groups, including NACORE, with whom IDRC is discussing an integration of organizations.

"In the corporate world, we explore integration all the time in mergers and acquisitions," he says. "We've done that year after year at the Travelers and now at Citigroup, and so many good things come out of it. And CIR integration occurs every day within our companies, adding value to the business process. 

"Similarly, exploring integrating with associations like NACORE, becoming more broad and encompassing, is so healthy and important. It forces you to think about exactly what you want your organization to be, and it will do nothing but strengthen IDRC. Personally, I love the idea of integrating the two organizations, which are so strong separately, with such great memberships." 


Mills Remains Mentor

Talking to Andy Bessette inevitably evokes two other integrative words: Wayne Mills -- who retired last year after a long, lauded career that included IDRC's 1991-92 presidency. 
Bessette spent his first four years at the Travelers in human relations and facilities. (Ironically, given today's integration push, those two functions were integrated then.) 
Then in 1984, Bessette joined Travelers' CRE, headed by Mills.

"He became my mentor, and he still is," Bessette says with obvious feeling. "I still see him all the time. I've never known anyone as passionate about the profession and yet so humble about all he's accomplished. He was a major force in one of the big industry transitions I've seen: from being more focused on transactions -- which are still very important -- to becoming much more integral in corporate strategy."

Mills, in fact, makes a Bessette dream team: "The three most important people who have had the most influence in my life have been my dad, my coach when I was trying to make the Olympics, and Wayne."

Andy Bessette extends that lineage, finding the important connections in his work and life.
Right now, for example, he's hurrying home for his daughter's birthday. The next day, he leaves for IDRC's Beijing World Congress.

The Olympian, it seems, is still going flat out.
