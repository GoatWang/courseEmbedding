Professor Renger Witkamp 


Professor Renger Witkamp studied Biology and Pharmacy at the Utrecht University (NL). He obtained his pharmacist degree in 1987 and started his career as pharmacist/lecturer at the Veterinary Faculty of the Utrecht University, which was combined with his Ph.D. training on experimental pharmacokinetics. After his Ph.D., he continued as an assistant professor, and later as an associate professor at the Utrecht University, until 1996. Subsequently, he moved to TNO, the Netherlands’ Organization for Applied Research.
At TNO, he held several scientific and managerial positions. In 2006, he became a professor in Nutrition and Pharmacology at Wageningen University, which at that time was a newly established academic chair. His group focuses on teaching and researching concepts and applications of the interface between food and pharma, including medical nutrition and drug-nutrient combinations. Research is predominantly directed at further elucidating the actions of plant cannabinoids and endocannabinoids on inflammatory processes and eating behavior. Practical applications of this program include muscle preservation during chronic disease and intestinal disorders.

Subsequently, Arno started his Ph.D., focused on the medicinal properties of the cannabis plant, and on the practical obstacles that stand between this plant and its development into a modern medicine. Arno was able to work closely with the official grower of medicinal cannabis in the Netherlands, Bedrocan BV, and was involved in numerous projects regarding the chemical analysis, quality control, and product development regarding medicinal cannabis. He was actively involved in setting up the medicinal cannabis program of the Dutch Health Ministry and became a strong advocate of a more science-based approach to the medicinal use of cannabis in the Netherlands and abroad.
After finishing his Ph.D., Arno continued to set up his own consultancy lab for analysis of medicinal plants while keeping a special interest in cannabis. As an independent researcher, Arno worked closely with government agencies, universities, and pharmaceutical companies. Some relevant experiences during this period (2005-2011) include his involvement in the early phase of Echo Pharmaceuticals (a Dutch pharmaceutical company developing a sublingual administration form of THC and other cannabinoids) and validation studies for the German company Storz & Bickel (e.g., the basis for the successful development of the Volcano Medic, a vaporizer device specifically designed for inhalation of medicinal cannabis).
Arno is considered an expert on standardized growing, quality control, and product development. He is an active traveler and medicinal cannabis advocate. In 2011, Arno became the head of Research and Development (R&D) of Bedrocan BV, where he currently works on the preparation of clinical trials with medicinal cannabis.

Medical Marijuana, Inc. owns appx. 45.5% of AXIM® Biotechnologies.




AXIM® Biotechnologies is an innovative biotechnology company focusing on the research, development, and production of cannabinoid-based pharmaceuticals and supplements with offices in New York City and The Netherlands. AXIM® Biotechnologies was created in November of 2010 with the goal of creating novel treatments for a number of medical conditions.
AXIM® owns the patent for chewing gum as a delivery method for cannabinoids, which it has developed into two separate products. Cannabidiol (CBD)-only Canchew® gum is marketed as a dietary supplement, legal to purchase wherever CBD hemp oil products are sold. In addition, AXIM® will soon start phase 3 clinical trials for their combination CBD/THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) gum, MedChew™ RX, for the treatment of pain and spasticity associated with multiple sclerosis. Once approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA), the gum will be offered across the European Union.




AXIM® Biotechnologies is an innovative biotechnology company focusing on the research, development, and production of cannabinoid-based pharmaceuticals and supplements.




More recently, AXIM® Biotechnologies has started trials for a new cannabigerol (CBG) based ointment for the treatment of psoriasis and atopic dermatitis, commonly known as eczema. Their patent pending AX-1602 proprietary ointment will be tested in a placebo controlled study to best judge its efficacy for these two dermatological indications.
AXIM® is also expanding its use of CBG in a new line of oral care products, Oraximax™, and a line of cosmetics, Renecann™. Designed for the daily user, these consumer product brands capitalize on hemp’s mix of phytocannabinoids and nutrients in their proprietary formulas.
As part of their future research and development, AXIM® is working on new extraction methods and delivery techniques for cannabinoids, as well as treatment options for ADHD, irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, ulcerative colitis, and Crohn’s disease. The company is also interested in further developing the antibacterial properties of CBG and the possible use of cannabinoids for smoking cessation in nicotine addicts.




AXIM® has already brought CanChew® Gum, a CBD infused chewing gum to market, and plans to expand with CBG oral care and skin care products.




AXIM® Biotechnologies believes in setting the standard for cannabinoid bioscience through the discovery and commercialization of new materials and technologies for healthy living. AXIM® Biotechnologies plans to complete construction in 2017 on a new state of the art manufacturing plant near the city of Almere, The Netherlands, that will allows them to take a competitive place in the cannabinoid-based marketplace. With several new drugs in clinical trials and many new products in the pipeline, AXIM® is strongly positioned for growth in cannabinoid-based treatments.

AXIM® Biotechnologies, Inc. Publishes Product Pipeline Chart For Pharmaceutical Clinical Trials Program In Cannabinoid R&D






GlobeNewswire



Nov 3, 2016 9:00 AM EDT













 




























































 NEW YORK, Nov. 03, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- AXIM ® Biotechnologies, Inc. (AXIM ® Biotech) (OTC:AXIM), a world leader in cannabinoid research and development, today announced that it has published a product pipeline chart on its website that highlights the timelines from pre-clinical to a new drug application (NDA) for its numerous intellectual property-protected cannabinoid-based products. The Company's product pipeline chart shows what stage of clinical trials each drug of AXIM® Biotech is in, the indication the drug is intended to treat and the expected date to receive an NDA from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and/or European Medicines Agency (EMA). The chart also shows the anticipated market introduction date of the Company's various functional food and nutraceutical products. "We wanted to provide our potential patients and investors with a clear snapshot of the numerous cannabinoid-based therapeutic products that we currently have undergoing clinical trials and when these products are anticipated to be on the market and approved by the FDA and EMA," said AXIM® Biotechnologies, Inc.'s Chief Executive Officer George E. Anastassov, MD, DDS, MBA. "Our company is continuing to develop cannabinoid-based drugs to find answers for health conditions with currently no known sustainable answers." View the product pipeline chart here. An AXIM ® Biotech breakthrough invention on pace to be fully registered by the EMA and FDA by the end of 2018 is the world's first patented cannabinoid controlled-release chewing gum: MedChew Rx™. Recently featured by Reuters global news agency, MedChew Rx™ will change the way that medicine is delivered to patients worldwide. Directly compared to a sublingually delivered cannabis-based product currently on the market for multiple sclerosis (MS) in the Reuters article, the potential economic impact for MedChew Rx™ is estimated at $4.8 billion USD - for spasticity and pain associated with MS.

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

AXIM Biotechnologies (OTCQB: AXIM) Takes on Opioid Epidemic with New Patent

 June 27th, 2017


 Feature Stories, News



AXIM is a major investment of Medical Marijuana, Inc. (OTC Pink: MJNA), the first publicly traded cannabis company.
More than 12.5 million people misuse prescription opioids, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, while two million people have been formally diagnosed with an addiction. These addictions cause $78.5 billion in economic damages each year and lead to more than 33,000 deaths from overdose each year. Despite these issues, physicians have few alternatives for prescribing opioids for pain management.
In this article, we will look at AXIM Biotechnologies Inc. (OTCQB: AXIM) and its recent patent on cannabinoid and opioid combinations in chewing gum.
New Patent Addition
AXIM Biotechnologies recently announced a patent on chewing gum with a controlled release of cannabinoids and opioid agonists and/or antagonists for addiction and/or dependence treatment. In addition, the same chewing gum formulation may be used for the treatment of chronic pain as an alternative to opioid-only treatment options, which could represent an enormous end market for future product lines.
“Opioid addiction is a serious global problem that affects the health, social, and economic welfare of all societies,” said AXIM Biotech CEO Dr. George E. Anastassov, MD, DDS, MBA. “Opioid addiction therapy depends on a variety of techniques. One of them is the replacement therapy, where an opioid is replaced with another less potent and less addictive opioid that curbs the cravings and reduces withdrawal symptoms.”
There is evidence that cannabinoids – and cannabidiol (CBD) in particular – may decrease cravings for narcotics. The company aims to provide these cannabinoids in microencapsulated form, which may improve its chewing gum’s taste, prevent binding with the gum’s base, control release during mastication (chewing), and further improve the bioavailability of the cannabinoids once entering the gastrointestinal tract.
Reuters, Fortune, CNBC, and others featured the story.
Breakthrough Product
Opioid addiction is often chemically treated using a combination of two approaches. First, agonists like methadone or buprenorphine activate opioid receptors in the brain to produce a substitute opioid effect with less potential for addiction. Second, antagonists like naltrexone and naloxone block opioids by attaching to the same opioid receptors without activating them, which reduces the side-effects of the agonists and reducing addiction over time.
The addition of cannabinoids to this treatment strategy could prove to be a breakthrough because cannabinoids may help with pain management. Often times, a large struggle with overcoming an opioid addiction is dealing with the resulting increase in pain from the reduction in opioid consumption. Cannabinoids can help fill the void in a way that avoids any addictive properties and enhances the overall patient well-being.
These same properties mean that cannabinoids may be able to act as an opioid substitute in first-line pain medications. For instance, a patient that would normally take 100% opioids may be able to take just 50% opioids and 50% cannabinoids, reducing the likelihood of an opioid addiction and the other negative side-effects associated with high levels of opioids. This may be particularly impactful in cases of chronic pain management.
Looking Ahead
AXIM Biotechnologies Inc.’s (OTCQB: AXIM) new patent on an opioid-cannabinoid combination would be extremely valuable when developed into a product. In addition to treating opioid addiction, the product could reinvent the way that opioids are delivered by pairing them with cannabinoids to reduce the side-effects and likelihood of addiction. Investors may want to keep a close eye on the stock given this development and its other clinical programs.
“This is another milestone achievement for AXIM Biotech,” added Dr. Anastassov. “We believe we are the first to file a patent application on using chewing gum as a delivery system for opioids and combinations of opioids and cannabinoids. With this filing, we are one step closer to entering the $100 billion market in pain management.”
The company’s other clinical programs include chewing gum formulations for prescription and over-the-counter indications, as well as topical applications, suppositories, and ophthalmic preparations. Its CanChew Plus® and AX-1602 represent its most advanced programs that are heading into POC Phase 2A clinical trials in Irritable Bowel Syndrome and Psoriasis – two multi-billion dollar markets that are ripe for innovation. 
The company has significant resources in the medical marijuana sector, and is a major investment of Medical Marijuana, Inc. (OTC Pink: MJNA), the first publicly traded cannabis company.

It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer. But what was once the fruit of a wild imagination is today a reality.
Rather than killing cancer cells directly with traditional approaches like radiation or chemotherapy, immunotherapy harnesses the immune system’s power to eliminate the cancer or slow its growth and ability to spread. Research shows immunotherapy is improving outcomes and survival rates for some patients, including kidney and lung cancer. In fact, research from the American Association for Cancer Research shows that for advanced-melanoma patients, survival rates are improving thanks in part to these new treatment options.
"It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer." Tweet
Biopharmaceutical researchers are urgently working to gain new insights into the complex interactions between patients’ immune systems and the cancer cells growing in their bodies with the goal of markedly improving outcomes in more tumor types.
With 836 medicines and vaccines in development for cancer, 80 percent of which have the potential to be first-in-class treatments, millions of Americans living with cancer have hope for a brighter future.
Welcome to the new era of medicine.
For all of us.

HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

















HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

Diabetes is a serious condition that effects more than 30 million Americans. While complications of the disease can be dire, there is hope. Biopharmaceutical researchers are helping patients manage the condition today and envision a bright outlook for future treatments.
Diabetes: the patient perspective
Diabetes is a general term for a chronic condition where there is too much glucose (sugar) in the blood. Normally, the pancreas makes insulin to help convert glucose into energy. With diabetes, the body either does not make enough insulin (type 1 diabetes) or does not use it properly (type 2 diabetes), leading to high blood glucose levels. Uncontrolled diabetes can lead to serious health complications, such as heart attack, lower-limb amputation, vision impairment and blindness.
Endocrinologist Dr. William "Bill" Chin has experience treating endocrine disorders, including diabetes. As chief medical officer at PhRMA, he works to ensure that patient voices are heard, drawing on his dual experience as a physician and as the parent of a child with diabetes. When Dr. Chin's son, Danny, was 15, he began experiencing telltale symptoms like excessive thirst. Dr. Chin diagnosed his son himself with type 1 diabetes.
He says, "I don’t think any parent is ever prepared to learn that one of our kids has developed a disease, particularly one that will be chronic. In many ways it’s forever, but the good news is we have great therapies that actually will allow a patient with diabetes to live a full and completely normal life if it’s well managed."
The changing landscape of diabetes treatment
The medications that Danny relies on have come a long way in the last ten years. A decade ago, a number of insulin options were available to patients, as well as oral and injected medications. Successful management of diabetes required constant and diligent monitoring of glucose levels. To control their glucose, patients needed multiple daily injections and/or multiple oral medicines.
In recent years, researchers have focused on making treatments much easier for patients, from fewer pills to less frequent injections. Careful monitoring and treatment are still needed, but current medicines in development offer a promising future.
There are 171 medicines currently in development for type 1 and type 2 diabetes and diabetes-related conditions. A new wave of treatments is offering patients better or more sustained control over their glucose levels. Other medicines in the pipeline may address diabetes-related complications that affect the kidneys, blood vessels and eyes. All of the medicines are in clinical trials or awaiting review by the FDA.
While these advances have improved patient quality of life and increased lifespans for type 1 diabetes, ongoing research remains critical. In fact, diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in the United States in 2013.
Dr. Chin says, "Collaboration is incredibly important in the understanding and development of new treatments for diabetes ... we are continually seeking to advance our understanding of the disease. This can only be achieved by having academic scientists and physician scientists working closely with scientists in the biopharmaceutical industry."

We cannot take progress for granted

















We cannot take progress for granted

We are in a new era of medical discovery and have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of costly and debilitating diseases. But we must not take this progress for granted.  To ensure medical innovation continues for the benefit of patients we need public policies that reward the investment and time it takes to develop life-saving treatments and cures.
In order to enhance competition and improve affordability for patients, our country must:
1)    Make medicines more affordable by rewarding value
 Today, America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies are partnering with health insurers to improve how we pay for medicines. Prices for medicines may vary based on how well an individual responds to treatment, or agreements may lower co-pays if patients achieve better health outcomes. While these partnerships will vary, they are helping to ensure we get the right medicine to the right patient at the right time – improving care and lowering costs across the health care system.
Yet, outdated regulations prevent wider use of these new payment arrangements.  Government rules and regulations should not prevent the private sector from developing better ways to pay for medicines. Rather, we must ensure health plans can cover more of the newest medicines and give patients more choices – improving care and lowering health care costs for Americans.
2)    Ensure patients get the best deal on medicines
America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies often negotiate large rebates for prescription medicines with insurers and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs). Those rebates are growing every year and now exceed $100 billion per year – helping to hold down health care costs for patients and taxpayers.
But we can do more to ensure patients benefit directly from these negotiated savings, and put an end to an unfair practice that requires patients to buy medicines at full price, even when their insurers get a rebate. In fact, patients with large deductibles can end up paying more than their insurer pays for their medicine.  That’s wrong. Health insurance companies should share with patients the discounts they receive. This could lower out-of-pocket costs for some patients by hundreds – if not thousands – of dollars every year.
3)    Make new breakthroughs accessible, and promote competition
We need to make it make it easier for patients to get access to breakthrough medicines. It simply takes too long to get new medicines approved – over 10 years and over one billion dollars, on average.  Outdated regulations and approaches for evaluating drugs can slow things down even more. To get medicines approved faster, while ensuring safety, we need to modernize the FDA with new technologies and expertise to keep up with 21st century science. Modernizing the FDA will bring down the time and cost of developing new medicines, which will bring medicines to patients faster, and enhance competition in the market.
We also need to reduce the backlog of applications for generic medicines at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  This will ensure that patients benefit as less expensive generic medicines replace higher cost treatments that have lost patent protection. 
At the same time, we must avoid policies that deter risk-taking or siphon funding away from the research and development of new medicines for patients. Learn more about our plan to build a sustainable, science-based health care system that harnesses today’s hopes to discover tomorrow’s cures here.
