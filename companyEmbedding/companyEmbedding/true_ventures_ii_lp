Priya Haji Fellowship 


WHAT IS THE PRIYA HAJI FELLOWSHIP?
True Ventures’ Priya Haji Fellowship is a program for new college graduates—particularly women—seeking their first full-time startup jobs. Fellows are paired with companies in the True Ventures portfolio in the San Francisco Bay Area, with whom they work for nine months. During their Fellowships, program participants will develop foundational skills to help them build careers in high-growth technology startups.
To complement their startup experience, the Fellows gather periodically as a group with us at True for dinner and conversation. We are reminded every day that it’s not just what you know that matters; it’s also who you know. So, we are excited to plug the Fellows into the True ecosystem to help them get to know Founders and other members of our network and begin to build their own professional networks.
WHY DOES THE FELLOWSHIP EXIST?
We created this program to help new college graduates kickstart their careers in the startup world. Additionally, we are proud to honor the program’s inspiration, Priya Haji. A four-time entrepreneur, Priya was committed to building companies that made the world a better place, including SaveUp, in which True was an investor from 2011 until its 2014 acquisition. We celebrate Priya’s legacy and share her commitment to mentorship and making a positive impact.
WHO IS THE FELLOWSHIP DESIGNED FOR?
The Fellowship is open to students completing their undergraduate studies in the spring of 2016 or 2017. We are looking for curious and enthusiastic graduates of all majors with a passion for technology and entrepreneurship. While the Fellowship will be open to all, we expect at least half of the participants to be female. We recognize our obligation to train the next generation of entrepreneurs and hope to help young women in particular who, like Priya, are inspired by technology’s potential to create change for good and could benefit from access to our network. Trans women, genderqueer, cisgender and non-binary applicants are welcome.
We do not accept applications from students who have yet to complete their undergraduate degrees, or those currently enrolled in graduate studies. Undergraduates we hope will consider our True Entrepreneur Corps fellowship, which has run every summer since 2009.
WHEN AND WHERE DOES THE FELLOWSHIP TAKE PLACE?
The Priya Haji Fellowship will run from the beginning of September 2017 to the end of May 2018. All Fellows are paired with True Ventures companies in the San Francisco Bay Area and will be expected to live and work in or near San Francisco.
HOW DO I BECOME A PRIYA HAJI FELLOW?
Please visit our application page, where you can find all instructions and application materials. If you have questions or comments about the program, please contact us at PHF [at] trueventures [dot] com.

Our Strategy – True Ventures

























 














Skip to content


True Ventures







Our Strategy 

True was founded to serve the needs of early stage entrepreneurs.
True was born in 2005 out of a simple vision: create a new kind of venture capital firm that focuses on supporting the earliest stage Founders and their teams. Our collective experience has taught us that the most important ingredient to a startup’s success is the entrepreneur.
“True” means alignment.
Truing a bicycle wheel brings everything into alignment. We named our firm “True” because we started with the ambition to realign the entire venture capital industry to be more focused on our customers: entrepreneurs. We believe our job as VCs is to magnify the creative power of entrepreneurs.
We believe in the power of community and education.
From the beginning, we committed to providing the Founders in our portfolio with resources to empower their employees, families and communities. We have developed a communication platform and several unique educational opportunities for our Founders and their teams.
We believe in capital efficiency.
More venture; less capital. We strive to take bolder risks earlier. Often, these don’t require “big” dollars, and in our experience, too much capital early on can constrain creativity. Our funds are designed to provide the appropriate first check and follow early success with significant follow-on investments. At True, we may start small, but we never think small.
Our strategy dictates our fund size.
We are focused on what we see as the most promising stage of entrepreneurial creativity and return potential: seed and Series A. With approximately $900 million under management, our four funds are small enough to invest at these levels, but big enough to support our companies throughout their entire lifecycle.
We target meaningful ownership positions.
We like to be the first institutional investor in our companies, and we target initial investments of $1-2 million. As a result, we are often the largest outside shareholder in the company until exit. Across all three of our active funds, our median initial investment is $1.4 million, and our median post-deal ownership is 20%.
Our relationships are everything.
Over the past 20 years, we have developed deep relationships with the Founders, CEOs and partners with whom we have had the privilege to work. This network of trusted friends and colleagues provides the source of the most promising opportunities and valuable insights. Nearly half of the opportunities we invest in are Founder-sourced.
Our business is based on mutual respect and trust.
We put the full weight of our resources, advisors and team behind our companies. We’re in it for the long haul.
