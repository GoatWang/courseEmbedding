James R. Thompson, Esq
Chief Executive Officer, President & General Counsel
Over the past 28 years, Jim has deftly managed a colorful spectrum of legal clients and situations. In the process he has helped many companies—both large and small—thrive. A master communicator with a history of long, valued client relationships, Jim approached each case with equal parts entrepreneurial spirit and business acumen, investing himself as if the venture in question was his own. And, this passion and proficiency didn’t go unnoticed.
One of his long-term clients, Joseph Fiore of Eat at Joe’s, Ltd., saw the opportunity to transform his business and immediately thought only of Jim for a leadership role. Now as CEO, President and General Counsel of SPYR, Inc., Jim welcomed the challenge to take the Company—and his career—in an entirely new direction. And, true to character, he got right down to business. Soon after joining the company, Jim was instrumental in the acquisition of Franklin Networks, Inc., a digital publishing company with eight online brands. This decision sparked a dramatic shift in the Company’s core focus and offerings—one that resulted in the rebirth of the Company as SPYR, Inc., a digital media holding company. Jim expects this to be the first of many great things on the horizon.
A native of Philadelphia, PA, Jim holds a JD from Rutgers University and a BSBA from the University of Denver. 



Jennifer Duettra, Esq
Executive Vice President, Secretary and Assistant General Counsel
Jennifer and Jim share a long and successful working history, and when given the opportunity to join the SPYR team with him, Jennifer couldn’t say no. Jennifer brings to the table not only a law degree from Harvard and 10 years of sophisticated legal experience, but also a great deal of knowledge in mobile gaming and pop culture; a combination you don’t run into every day. She was thrilled by the prospect to combine her law experience with a chance to be creative.
In her role as Executive Vice President, Secretary and Assistant General Counsel of SPYR, Jennifer has wide ranging responsibilities. From drafting and reviewing contracts and press releases, to evaluating business opportunities and brainstorming new ideas for the websites and games. In short, Jennifer does it all and does it well. She has high expectations about the future of SPYR and believes there is great opportunity in the areas of content expansion, mobile gaming and CATS! Did we mention Jennifer has a fantastic sense of humor, a keen interest in all things pop culture and a deep love for mobile games? Well, she does.
Jennifer was born and raised in Colorado receiving her Bachelor of Arts in Political Science and Speech Communication from Colorado State University. She ventured out of Colorado for law school, earning her Juris Doctor at Harvard. 



Barry Loveless
Chief Financial Officer
Barry brings 23+ years of accounting, auditing and tax experience to the SPYR management team. Since 1993, Barry, a certified public accountant, has worked for clients in a variety of industries such as restaurant/hospitality, pharmaceutical, wholesale, and precious metals/minerals. Barry also has substantial experience with mergers and acquisitions. He’s seen it all. But more importantly, he is intimately familiar with the inner workings of SPYR. After years of providing high quality service to the Company as its outside auditor and then outside accountant, Barry jumped at the opportunity to become SPYR’s Chief Financial Officer.
As CFO, Barry oversees three main areas including controllership, treasury and economic strategy/forecasting. His thumb is firmly on the pulse of SPYR’s past and present financial outlook, financial condition and capital structure. He is also responsible for identifying areas for SPYR to capitalize on, while also evaluating potential business opportunities, which is no small task. His strong work ethic and passion for technology drive his day-to-day work as he helps SPYR expand into the future.
Barry was born and raised in Salt Lake City, Utah, where he continues to live, work and raise his family. He received his Bachelors in Accounting and a Masters of Professional Accountancy from the University of Utah. He is a member of both the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and the Utah Association of Certified Public Accountants. 



Mike Turner
Vice President of Strategic Partnerships
An online games industry veteran, Mike has held leadership roles for companies such as Wargaming America, Inc. (the developer and publisher of World of Tanks), Big Collision Games and FASA Studios at Microsoft.  While at Wargaming, Turner drove partnership activities for Wargaming's own eSports organization in the Americas, the Wargaming.net League.
Mike has most recently worked for iDreamSky Technology as its VP of the West where he continued to grow his international network of contacts, particularly in Asia, where iDreamSky is based.  Mike was also the President of byDesign Interactive Corp., a company that provides game industry development and consulting services for companies like Microsoft, EA, Wild Tangent, Sky Digital Solutions and other game publishers and developers.

CBS Consumer Products Shows Confidence in SPYR's Pocket Starships with Licensing Deal for Star Trek IP


 Download as PDF

June 14, 2017

NEW YORK, NY -- (Marketwired) -- 06/14/17 --  SPYR, Inc. (OTCQB: SPYR) received what should be viewed as a vote of confidence from CBS Consumer Products in a recently announced licensing deal between the two companies. CBS is licensing its intellectual property (IP) from the long-running Star Trek television series: Star Trek: The Next Generation, Star Trek: Deep Space Nine and Star Trek: Voyager to SPYR, which can be taken as a vote of confidence by CBS Consumer Products in SPYR and the synergy between CBS's Star Trek IP and SPYR's flagship, free-to-play, MMO game Pocket Starships.
CBS Consumer Products manages worldwide licensing and merchandising for a diverse slate of television brands and series from CBS, CBS Television Studios and CBS Television Distribution, as well as from the company's extensive library of titles, Showtime and CBS Films.
In the deal, CBS Consumer Products will allow for the incorporation of certain Star Trek-based content into Pocket Starships. And given how well-known and popular the science fiction franchise is, a company like CBS is not going to ink a deal for its long-standing IP to just anyone. 
SPYR's management has a strong plan to not only use the IP effectively in Pocket Starships, but to market and advertise the game well into the future as well. By inking this deal with SPYR, CBS Consumer Products has shown it has confidence that SPYR can effectively integrate Star Trek characters and possibly even various fighting ships from the franchise into Pocket Starships.
SPYR is wasting no time developing the new content either. The company's development team is already working on expansions of Pocket Starships to include the Star Trek IP. Globally there are millions of "Trekkies" who seek out and buy up anything related to Star Trek, so this new Star Trek content should serve as a great marketing tool and revenue generator for SPYR as it continues to advertise and market Pocket Starships worldwide.
Pocket Starships is a true cross platform game, so players can enjoy the Star Trek content with their friends and fellow Trekkies no matter if they're on their PC or on their mobile device -- all at the same time. Imagine being a long-time fan of Star Trek and now being able to staff your ships in the game with your favorite characters from several of the television series. 
With updates on the way that will thrust Pocket Starships into the competitive and fast-growing electronic sports or "esports" arena, the Star Trek IP could very well attract lots of esports gamers to choose Pocket Starships. So, incorporating Star Trek content should also serve as a marketing and revenue winner for SPYR, given that Star Trek is a well-recognized science fiction brand to several generations.

SPYR, Inc., a Company always looking for new opportunities across variety of industries.
A native of Philadelphia, PA, Jim holds a JD from Rutgers University and a BSBA from the University of Denver.






Jennifer Duettra  / Executive Vice President, Secretary and Assistant General Counsel


Jennifer and Jim share a long and successful working history, and when given the opportunity to join the SPYR team
with him, Jennifer couldn’t say no. Jennifer brings to the table not only a law degree from Harvard and 10 years of
sophisticated legal experience, but also a great deal of knowledge in mobile gaming and pop culture; a combination you
don’t run into every day. She was thrilled by the prospect to combine her law experience with a chance to be creative.
In her role as Executive Vice President, Secretary and Assistant General Counsel of SPYR, Jennifer has wide ranging
responsibilities. From drafting and reviewing contracts and press releases, to evaluating business opportunities and
brainstorming new ideas for the websites and games. In short, Jennifer does it all and does it well. She has high
expectations about the future of SPYR and believes there is great opportunity in the areas of content expansion, mobile
gaming and CATS! Did we mention Jennifer has a fantastic sense of humor, a keen interest in all things pop culture and
a deep love for mobile games? Well, she does.
Jennifer was born and raised in Colorado receiving her Bachelor of Arts in Political Science and Speech Communication
from Colorado State University. She ventured out of Colorado for law school, earning her Juris Doctor at Harvard.






Barry D. Loveless, CPA  / Chief Financial Officer


Barry brings 23+ years of accounting, auditing and tax experience to the SPYR management team. Since 1993, Barry, a
certified public accountant, has worked for clients in a variety of industries such as restaurant/hospitality,
pharmaceutical, wholesale, and precious metals/minerals. Barry also has substantial experience with mergers and
acquisitions. He’s seen it all. But more importantly, he is intimately familiar with the inner workings of SPYR. After years
of providing high quality service to the Company as its outside auditor and then outside accountant, Barry jumped at the
opportunity to become SPYR’s Chief Financial Officer.
As CFO, Barry oversees three main areas including controllership, treasury and economic strategy/forecasting. His
thumb is firmly on the pulse of SPYR’s past and present financial outlook, financial condition and capital structure. He is
also responsible for identifying areas for SPYR to capitalize on, while also evaluating potential business opportunities,
which is no small task. His strong work ethic and passion for technology drive his day-to-day work as he helps SPYR
expand into the future.
Barry was born and raised in Salt Lake City, Utah, where he continues to live, work and raise his family. He received his
Bachelors in Accounting and a Masters of Professional Accountancy from the University of Utah. He is a member of both
the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and the Utah Association of Certified Public Accountants.

SPYR, Inc.'s New Agreement with CBS Consumer Products Could Potentially Attract Huge Star Trek(TM) Audience

BONITA, CA--(Marketwired - June 09, 2017) -  In a move that is sure to please Trekkies around the universe, SPYR, Inc. (OTCQB: SPYR) announced this week that it has signed a licensing agreement with CBS Consumer Products that will allow SPYR to incorporate intellectual property (IP) from various Star Trek television series in future updates to and expansions of the company's real time, true cross platform MMO game, Pocket Starships.SPYR has been making news lately for its release of a female centric mobile game to expand its gamer audience, as well as its commitment to the esports industry. The stock has reflected these pieces of news favorably, showing a 20 percent jump this week alone from Monday's low of the day, and news of the agreement to incorporate Star Trek IP into Pocket Starship's expansions is surely more good news for SPYR investors.Let's face it -- the Star Trek franchise remains extremely popular even decades after the show first aired on television, so this was a brilliant deal to make on SPYR's part, and a deal that should gain its flagship game, Pocket Starships, even more players. After SPYR released news of the agreement with CBS Consumer Products, the Star Trek website verified the news on its own website (www.startrek.com). Later in the day, Star Trek tweeted out the news to its more than 327,000 Twitter followers (https://twitter.com/StarTrek), and Star Trek: The Next Generation posted the news to its more than 1.5 million followers on Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/StarTrekTheNextGeneration). A quick search of the Internet yielded some interesting numbers relative to the Star Trek franchise. As of November 11, 2015, the entire Star Trek film franchise has grossed $1.24 billion at the box office domestically, $2.2 billion adjusted for inflation.The Star Trek Beyond edition, released in 2016 has grossed a worldwide box office of $336 million, and domestic video sales of $35 million. The appropriate question isn't, "How much has it grossed?" It's "How much is it worth?" According to CNBC in 2006 -- the most current numbers we found -- Star Trek was worth, at that time, approximately $4 billion dollars.Clearly these numbers indicate a vast audience of Star Trek fans, and combined with the growing market of mobile gaming, which is expected to cross the $130 billion threshold in the next three years, SPYR has likely created a winning combination in their partnership with CBS Consumer Products for licensing of the Star Trek intellectual property.The Pocket Starships development team is already working on expansions of Pocket Starships to include the Star Trek IP, which SPYR expects will be released by the end of October 2017.And according to the company, this means that in November players of Pocket Starships will be able to explore new sectors and engage in exciting battles with a certain assimilating Collective and will be able to staff their ships with their favorite Star Trek characters from the Star Trek TV series franchise (Star Trek: The Next Generation, Star Trek: Deep Space Nine and Star Trek: Voyager) through a trading card system expansion.In yesterday's press release from SPYR, James R. Thompson, SPYR's CEO and President said, "We are very excited to announce that we have obtained a license to use Star Trek IP in Pocket Starships. Pocket Starships and Star Trek are a perfect fit, with both Pocket Starships and Star Trek celebrating a spirit of exploration and cooperation. We think that, Star Trek fans will enthusiastically embrace the new Star Trek-based content we will be adding to Pocket Starships. We are confident that with Pocket Starship's real-time, cross-platform MMO gameplay, together, CBS Consumer Products and SPYR can take Pocket Starships and Star Trek mobile games where no one has gone before."Having recently restructured the company to focus exclusively on the mobile game development and production division, SPYR is clearly making solid business moves to increase the value of the Company. Management seems focused on their players and what is trending in the mobile gaming world, and is constantly striving to meet and exceed customer expectations.About SmallCap Network The SmallCap Network is one of the web's leading small cap stock trading communities.

SPYR, Inc.'s New Agreement with CBS Consumer Products Could Potentially Attract Huge Star Trek(TM) AudienceHomeMailFlickrTumblrNewsSportsFinanceCelebrityAnswersGroupsMobileMoreTry Yahoo Finance on Firefox »YahooSearchSearchSign inU.S. Markets close in 3 hrs 15 minsS&P 5002,469.66-5.76 (-0.23%)Dow 3021,795.77-0.78 (-0.00%)Nasdaq6,376.49-5.70 (-0.09%)SPYR, Inc.'s New Agreement with CBS Consumer Products Could Potentially Attract Huge Star Trek(TM) AudienceMarketwiredJune 9, 2017ReblogShareTweetShareBONITA, CA--(Marketwired - June 09, 2017) -  In a move that is sure to please Trekkies around the universe, SPYR, Inc. (SPYR) announced this week that it has signed a licensing agreement with CBS Consumer Products that will allow SPYR to incorporate intellectual property (IP) from various Star Trek television series in future updates to and expansions of the company's real time, true cross platform MMO game, Pocket Starships.SPYR has been making news lately for its release of a female centric mobile game to expand its gamer audience, as well as its commitment to the esports industry. The stock has reflected these pieces of news favorably, showing a 20 percent jump this week alone from Monday's low of the day, and news of the agreement to incorporate Star Trek IP into Pocket Starship's expansions is surely more good news for SPYR investors.Let's face it -- the Star Trek franchise remains extremely popular even decades after the show first aired on television, so this was a brilliant deal to make on SPYR's part, and a deal that should gain its flagship game, Pocket Starships, even more players. After SPYR released news of the agreement with CBS Consumer Products, the Star Trek website verified the news on its own website (www.startrek.com). Later in the day, Star Trek tweeted out the news to its more than 327,000 Twitter followers (https://twitter.com/StarTrek), and Star Trek: The Next Generation posted the news to its more than 1.5 million followers on Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/StarTrekTheNextGeneration).A quick search of the Internet yielded some interesting numbers relative to the Star Trek franchise. As of November 11, 2015, the entire Star Trek film franchise has grossed $1.24 billion at the box office domestically, $2.2 billion adjusted for inflation.The Star Trek Beyond edition, released in 2016 has grossed a worldwide box office of $336 million, and domestic video sales of $35 million. The appropriate question isn't, "How much has it grossed?" It's "How much is it worth?" According to CNBC in 2006 -- the most current numbers we found -- Star Trek was worth, at that time, approximately $4 billion dollars.Clearly these numbers indicate a vast audience of Star Trek fans, and combined with the growing market of mobile gaming, which is expected to cross the $130 billion threshold in the next three years, SPYR has likely created a winning combination in their partnership with CBS Consumer Products for licensing of the Star Trek intellectual property.The Pocket Starships development team is already working on expansions of Pocket Starships to include the Star Trek IP, which SPYR expects will be released by the end of October 2017.And according to the company, this means that in November players of Pocket Starships will be able to explore new sectors and engage in exciting battles with a certain assimilating Collective and will be able to staff their ships with their favorite Star Trek characters from the Star Trek TV series franchise (Star Trek: The Next Generation, Star Trek: Deep Space Nine and Star Trek: Voyager) through a trading card system expansion.In yesterday's press release from SPYR, James R. Thompson, SPYR's CEO and President said, "We are very excited to announce that we have obtained a license to use Star Trek IP in Pocket Starships. Pocket Starships and Star Trek are a perfect fit, with both Pocket Starships and Star Trek celebrating a spirit of exploration and cooperation. We think that, Star Trek fans will enthusiastically embrace the new Star Trek-based content we will be adding to Pocket Starships. We are confident that with Pocket Starship's real-time, cross-platform MMO gameplay, together, CBS Consumer Products and SPYR can take Pocket Starships and Star Trek mobile games where no one has gone before."Having recently restructured the company to focus exclusively on the mobile game development and production division, SPYR is clearly making solid business moves to increase the value of the Company. Management seems focused on their players and what is trending in the mobile gaming world, and is constantly striving to meet and exceed customer expectations.About SmallCap Network The SmallCap Network is one of the web's leading small cap stock trading communities.
