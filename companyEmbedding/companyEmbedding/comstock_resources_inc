ABOUT

OPERATIONS

Comstock Resources is based in Frisco, 
			Texas and is engaged in the acquisition, development, production and 
			exploration of oil and natural gas with operations concentrated in 
			Texas and Louisiana. Our common stock is listed and traded on the 
			New York Stock Exchange. At December 31, 2016 we owned interests 
			in 1,371 producing wells. Our oil and gas properties are estimated 
			to have proved reserves of 916 Bcfe which are 95% natural gas and 5% 
			oil. In 2015 we restarted development activity in East Texas and 
			North Louisiana where we have 78,437 (66,172 net) acres which are 
			prospective for natural gas in the Haynesville or Bossier shale 
			formations. We drilled 11 (7.8 net) horizontal natural gas wells on 
			our Haynesville shale properties in 2016. In 2016, almost all of the 
			$60 million of our drilling and completion expenditures were related 
			to natural gas projects. We are deferring work on our oil focused 
			properties until oil prices improve. Our Eagleville field includes 
			25,949 (19,046 net) acres located in the oil window of the Eagle 
			Ford shale in South Texas. Comstock offers potential investors 
			the opportunity to invest in a Company with strong growth potential 
			and a proven track record of successfully developing new shale 
			resource plays. During 2016 we took steps to protect and enhance our 
			liquidity. Beginning in 2015 and into 2016 we retired $237 million 
			of our senior notes generating annual interest savings of $21 
			million with total interest savings to maturity of $83 million. Most 
			importantly, we completed the exchange with our senior notes holders 
			which reduced our annual cash interest burden by $37 million and 
			allows Comstock to pay an additional $75 million of interest in-kind 
			in the future. The future conversion of the second-lien notes issued 
			in the exchange will de-lever our balance sheet and set us up to 
			refinance our remaining debt at lower interest costs in the future.
			In 2017, we are pursuing a natural gas drilling program in the 
			Haynesville shale based on enhanced recovery from longer laterals 
			and increased stimulation. The Company has over 700 operated 
			drilling locations on its Haynesville/Bossier shale acreage, where 
			the Company estimates to have over 6 Tcf of reserve potential. We 
			are currently budgeting $168 million to drill 22 (17.2 net to us) 
			long lateral natural gas wells in 2017. This program should provide 
			40% natural gas production growth in 2017 if we drill all of the 
			wells that we have budgeted. We entered into a new Haynesville 
			drilling joint venture with a utility in January 2017 which we can 
			use to acquire additional acreage and to grow our inventory of 
			drilling locations. We have one of the lowest overall cost 
			structures in the industry, and we expect to see further 
			improvements in our cost structure driven by our low cost 
			Haynesville shale program. We are protecting our natural gas focused 
			drilling program economics with an effective hedging program. We 
			have no debt maturities prior to 2019 and we continue to 
			conservatively manage our liquidity.

Drilling Program 


			  Our Haynesville shale horizontal well drilling program was the primary driver of our growth in natural gas production and proved reserves in 2016. Our successful Haynesville shale drilling program drove the annual increase in our total natural gas production of 13% and allowed us to grow proved oil and natural gas reserves by 47% in 2016.  In 2015 and 2016, we have drilled a total of 21 wells (17.4 net to us) in the Haynesville shale which used our latest well designs that incorporated both longer laterals and enhanced well completion programs.  These wells had an average initial production rate of 24 MMcf per day.  We spent $60 million for drilling activities in 2016, and when combined with the substantial growth in proved oil and natural gas reserves, we achieved an all-in finding cost of 14¢ per Mcf.

Drilling Program 


			  Our Haynesville shale horizontal well drilling program was the primary driver of our growth in natural gas production and proved reserves in 2016. Our successful Haynesville shale drilling program drove the annual increase in our total natural gas production of 13% and allowed us to grow proved oil and natural gas reserves by 47% in 2016.  In 2015 and 2016, we have drilled a total of 21 wells (17.4 net to us) in the Haynesville shale which used our latest well designs that incorporated both longer laterals and enhanced well completion programs.  These wells had an average initial production rate of 24 MMcf per day.  We spent $60 million for drilling activities in 2016, and when combined with the substantial growth in proved oil and natural gas reserves, we achieved an all-in finding cost of 14¢ per Mcf.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Common questions

What's the difference between a C corporation and an S corporation?
The IRS allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a "C corporation" or an "S corporation." Income from C corporations are subject to double taxation; that is, the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporation.S corporations have only one level of taxation. The shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation, but an S corporation does not pay taxes on its net income. While the S corporation is popular among small business owners, C corporations have greater tax planning flexibility.


How does a corporation protect my personal assets?
If a business operates as a corporation, the business owners, called shareholders, are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation. That's because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners. If a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity, then anyone seeking to collect a debt from, or enforce a claim against, a corporation, would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves. They would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation.


Why do many people choose to form their corporation in Delaware?
Delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations. However, the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public. Delaware's laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders, and Delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes. These benefits don't mean much to smaller corporations. Keep in mind that if a corporation forms in Delaware and does business in another state, the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork, and pay any taxes and/or fees required to do business in that state. Given those factors, many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business.


What is an EIN?
An employer identification number (EIN), also known as a federal tax identification number, is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes. It's like a Social Security number, but for a business. In general, most businesses need an EIN. The only reason a business would not get an EIN is if it has only one owner, elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes, and does not want to open a separate business bank account. In this case, the owner would use their Social Security number as the business identifier. However, there are disadvantages to this approach, namely the risk of liability.


How are LLCs taxed?
Unlike a corporation, LLCs have some flexibility in how they're taxed. Depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects, the LLC can be taxed as either a corporation, partnership or as part of the owner's personal tax return (called a "disregarded entity"). By default, an LLC with two or more members are taxed as a partnership, unless they file an IRS Form 8832 to elect to be treated as a corporation. If the LLC has only one owner, it will be taxed as a sole proprietor, unless the owner files Form 8832. It's not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed. You have up to 12 months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision.


What is a registered agent?
A registered agent (sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent) is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business. States require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity. While you can be your own registered agent, there are disadvantages. You have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record. If you miss a filing deadline, you risk being fined or shut down. Our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents, sort through junk mail and keep your information private.


Is a corporation right for me?
It depends on many factors. Get help deciding by answering a few questions here.

What business type is right for you?
When you're starting a new business, you want to determine the business structure that's right for you. What's the difference between a limited liability company (LLC) and a corporation (Inc.)? And how is a C corporation different from an S corporation? Use these charts to help decide what business type is best for your needs.








LLC vs. Corporation






Limited Liability Company (LLC)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my LLCCorporation (Inc)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my Corporation







What is an S corporation?
After you create a corporation or LLC, you also have the opportunity to decide how you'd like your business to be taxed.Single owner LLCs can be taxed either as a sole proprietorship or a corporation.  LLCs with more than one owner can be taxed either as a partnership or a corporation.  Income from LLCs treated as sole proprietorships or partnerships is reported directly on the owner’s individual tax returns.New corporations, as well as LLCs considering corporate taxation can choose between filing taxes as a C corporation ("C corp") or an S corporation ("S corp"). An S corp is considered a "pass-through entity," which means the business itself isn't taxed. Instead, income is reported on the owners' personal tax returns. Businesses taxed as C corporations are not pass through entities.  Income is taxed at the corporate level, and, if dividends are distributed, at the individual level as well.We can help you understand your options so you choose what's best for your business. Talk to one of our network of attorneys today.








C-corp or S-corp 






Here's a comparison of some key characteristics of businesses that choose to be treated as C corps and S corps.C DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensS DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensYou don't have to decide about S corp status right away. You have 75 days after the formation of your business to file with the IRS. If you're still not sure what to do, you may want to consult with one of our attorneys or tax specialists.





Step-by-Step Guide on Starting Your Business













Easy as 1-2-3




1. Select the business structure that's right for you and fill out a simple questionnaire.





2. We'll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state.





3. You'll receive your completed paperwork by mail.








Ask away. We have answers.



Common questions

Can I start a business without creating a corporation or LLC?
You don't need a corporation or LLC to go into business. Many business owners are in partnerships or are sole proprietors. But both a corporation and LLC canshield you from liability and may offer tax advantages.


What are the main differences between an LLC and a sole proprietorship?
You don't need to file any paperwork with your state to create a sole proprietorship (though you may still need business permits and licenses to operate lawfully). But an LLC protects you from personal liability  - a sole proprietorship doesn't.Also, LLCs provide more flexibility as you grow your business.


What are the main differences between an LLC and an S corporation?
An LLC has more flexibility and fewer corporate formalities than an S corporation. S corporations are required to have annual meetings of shareholders and directors, while meetings of LLC member and/or managers are not required..  Also,  LLCs can provide for a flexible management structure by members or managers, while corporations require management by a Board of Directors.Learn more.


Do I need a name or DBA for my business?
You only need a DBA ("doing business as") if you are operating a sole proprietorship or partnership and you want to use a fictitious name for the business. You don't need a DBA for an LLC or a corporation unless you are using a name other than your LLC or corporate name while doing business.Learn more.


Do I need any other licenses or permits to start my business? 
Some cities, counties, and states require businesses to obtain licenses and permits to operate lawfully. We can help you figure out what you need. Learn More.

Compare Business Structures – LLC vs. Corporation, S Corporation and C Corporation 

		 You’ve decided to start a business, but you’re not sure where to begin. You don’t know if you should form an LLC or corporation, and need guidance to help you choose the right business structure. Each business structure has its advantages and disadvantages that are important to understand because choosing the wrong business entity could result in legal and tax implications down the road. The information above will allow you to compare LLC vs. corporation, and learn the difference between an S corporation and C corporation. LLCs and corporations both offer personal liability protection, but the most significant difference between LLC and corporation is that corporations are preferred by outside investors. When comparing LLC vs S corp, there are a few important differences to be aware of which are outlined above. Once you determine which business structure you need, you can start a business with LegalZoom in just three easy steps. The process begins by filling out a simple questionnaire. We’ll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state, and you’ll receive your completed paperwork by mail. If you need help deciding which business structure is right for you, a LegalZoom legal plan attorney can explain how each business entity works and help you decide.
