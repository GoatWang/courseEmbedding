P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Total assets were $955.9 million at June 30, 2017 compared to $956.4 
      million at March 31, 2017 and $931.4 million at December 31, 2016. Net

      focus on delivering uncompromised service to our clients and the credit 
      for our success goes to our great employees. Our team has worked 
      incredibly hard over the past few years to deliver on our goal of 
      creating a dynamic community banking franchise in Central Florida.”


                                        








The Bank’s non-performing assets as of June 30, 2017 were $739,000 
      compared to $988,000 as of June 30, 2016. The Bank’s non-performing 
      assets to total assets ratio as of June 30, 2017 was 0.08% compared to 
      0.18% as of June 30, 2016. In addition, the allowance for loan losses 
      was 519.1% of non-performing loans at June 30, 2017.

      million during the second quarter of 2016. The net interest margin for 
      the six months ended June 30, 2017 was 3.76% compared to 3.57% for the 
      six months ended June 30, 2016. The net interest margin benefited from 
      the recent increases in the short-term interest rates, a decrease in the 
      use of borrowed funds, and an increase in loans as a percentage of 
      interest earning assets. The average loan yield has remained stable 
      decreasing five basis points to 4.73% for the six months ended June 30, 
      2017 and increasing eight basis points to 4.79% for the three months 
      ended June 30, 2017 from the comparable prior year period. Deposit costs 
      remained constant with the average cost of deposits at 0.30% for the six 
      months ended June 30, 2017 and 0.30% for the six months ended June 30, 
      2016.


                                        








Noninterest expenses for the second quarter 2017 totaled $6.4 million 
      compared to $6.1 million in the first quarter of 2017. Noninterest 
      expense remained stable during the second quarter 2017 with noninterest 
      expense to average assets of 2.7% annualized, compared to 2.6% 
      annualized in the first quarter 2017.
