Strategy & Benefits

Principal Investment Strategy
The investment strategy of the Direxion Indexed Commodity Strategy Fund includes:

A quantitative, strategic index-based approach to commodity investing
Exposure to 12 commodities that can individually be long or flat (if a short signal is triggered the position is moved to cash)
The ability to make position changes intra-month based on trends
Monthly rebalance based on risk reduction where the allocation of individual components is reduced if volatility exceeds certain predetermined risk levels
A “smart” contract roll approach1

1 Smart Contract Roll Approach – A futures contract roll approach designed to select cost effective futures contracts to roll into upon expiration of current contract.
Why Invest in the Fund?

The long/flat approach provides exposure to commodities that can individually be positioned long or flat (in cash) based upon price trends
Seeks to mitigate the downside risk and maximum declines relative to notable long-only commodity indices
Has the flexibility to make individual commodity position changes intra-month
Risk management controls designed to adjust exposure levels if volatility gets too high
Low- or non-correlation to stocks and bonds
Disciplined, quantitative, rules-based approach to commodity investing




Why Commodities?

Not just commodities – Long/Flat commodities.
Most traditional commodity funds provide long only exposure to commodities. This limits their potential to contribute to a portfolio’s long-term performance because they only benefit if commodity prices rise.
The Direxion Indexed Commodity Strategy Fund seeks to match the performance of the Auspice Broad Commodity ER Index (ABCERI), which provides exposure to 12 commodities that can individually be positioned long or flat (in cash) based upon price trends.
This long/flat index is potentially more adaptive to volatile commodity markets because it seeks to take advantage of individual commodities by going long when prices rise, and mitigate risk by going flat (to cash) when prices fall.
Why consider long/flat commodities?
Most traditional commodity funds can only benefit if commodity prices rise. However, these long-only commodity strategies have shown to be inconsistent over time because:

Commodity returns are typically cyclical and sporadic
Individual commodity sub-sectors tend to perform dissimilarly in different market environments
Significant draw-downs can be damaging to the long-term performance of a portfolio

Within the inherently volatile commodity markets, a long/flat approach is potentially more adaptive to whip-sawing market conditions.

Target Index

The Auspice Broad Commodity ER Index aims to capture upward trends in the commodity markets while minimizing risk during downward trends. The index uses a quantitative methodology to track either long or flat positions in a diversified portfolio of 12 commodity futures covering energy, metals, and agriculture. The index incorporates dynamic risk management and contract rolling methods.

The indexes are composite indexes of commodity sector returns representing unmanaged, unleveraged, long-only investment in commodity futures that are broadly diversified across the spectrum of commodities. 

S&P Goldman Sachs Commodity Index (S&P GSCI), a composite index of commodity sector returns representing an unleveraged, long-only investment in commodity futures that is broadly diversified across the spectrum of commodities;
Bloomberg Commodity Total Return Index (BCOM TR), a broadly diversified index that allows investors to track 19 commodity futures through a single, simple measure
Deutsche Banc Liquid Commodity Optimum Yield Index (DBC CI), an index composed of futures contracts on 14 of the most heavily-traded and important physical commodities in the world.

Standard Deviation is a measure of the dispersion of a set of data from its mean.
Correlation is a statistical measure of how two securities move in relation to each other.
Maximum Drawdown is the greatest percent decline from a previous high.

* The Net Expense Ratio includes management fees, other operating expenses and Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses. If Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses were excluded, the Net Expense Ratio would be 1.26% for DXCTX, 2.01% for DXSCX, and 1.01% for DXCIX.  The Fund’s Adviser, Rafferty Asset Management, LLC (“Rafferty”) has entered into an Operating Services Agreement with each Fund. Under this Operating Service Agreement, Rafferty has contractually agreed to pay all expenses of each Fund through September 1, 2018 other than the following: management fees, Rule 12b-1distribution and/or service fees, any front-end or contingent deferred sales loads, acquired fund fees and expenses, taxes, swap financing and related costs, dividends or interest on short positions, other interest expenses, brokerage commissions and extraordinary expenses such as litigation or other expenses outside the typical day-to-day operations of the Fund. If these expenses were included, the net expense ratio would be higher.
The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. For the most recent month-end performance please visit the funds website at direxioninvestments.com.
Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus.

  Addressing The Top Misconceptions About Alternative Investments    


Alternative strategies have the potential to be a viable way for investors, whether institutional or retail, to reduce risk in their investment portfolios.


  Alternatives? Too Many, or Not Enough?    


The key to risk-adjusted returns and diversification is not the number of securities – it’s their correlation – or, really, non-correlation – to each other, that’s paramount.


  A Correlation Misconception    


Some clients confuse negative correlation with low (or non-) correlation. They mistakenly believe that returns for investments with low correlation move in opposite directions from each other.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

Blended
Strategies Portfolio

  

Notes to
Unaudited 
 Consolidated Financial Statements

 

September
30, 2016

 

1.
Organization and Business

 

The
Blended Strategies Portfolio (the “Fund”) is a series
of Graham Alternative Investment Fund II LLC (“GAIF
II”), a Delaware Series Limited Liability Company established
through an amendment to the certificate of formation, effective
March 28, 2013. Prior to March 28, 2013, GAIF II was organized as a
Delaware Limited Liability Company which was formed on May 16, 2006
and commenced operations on August 1, 2006. GAIF II has one other
active series in addition to the Fund, the Systematic Strategies
Portfolio. GAIF II is registered as a commodity pool and as such is
subject to the oversight and jurisdiction of the U.S. Commodity
Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”).

 

As a
Series Limited Liability Company each series is legally segregated,
and the assets associated with each series are held separately and
accounted for in separate and distinct records from the assets of
any other series of GAIF II. The debts, liabilities, obligations
and expenses incurred, contracted for or otherwise existing with
respect to a particular series are enforceable against the assets
of such series only, and not against the assets of GAIF II
generally or any other series thereof. Further, none of the debts,
liabilities, obligations and expenses incurred, contracted for or
otherwise existing with respect to GAIF II are enforceable against
the assets of any other series.

 

The Fund
offers members Class 0 and Class 2 units. Graham Alternative
Investment Ltd. (“GAI”) is a British Virgin Islands
business company which was formed on June 1, 2006 and commenced
operations on August 1, 2006. The Fund invests all of its assets
dedicated to trading in Graham Alternative Investment Trading LLC
(“GAIT”), a Delaware Limited Liability Company which
was formed on May 18, 2006 and commenced operations on August 1,
2006, through an investment in GAI’s Blended Strategies
Portfolio. GAIT invests in various master trading vehicles
(“Master Funds”) and Graham Cash Asserts LLC
(“Cash Assets”), all of which are managed by Graham
Capital Management, L.P. (the “Advisor” or
“Manager”). The Fund is the sole owner of GAI’s
Blended Strategies Portfolio and GAI’s Blended Strategies
Portfolio invests all of its assets into GAIT. The Manager is the
director of GAI and the sole investment advisor of GAI, GAIT and
the Fund. The Manager is registered as a Commodity Pool Operator
and Commodity Trading Advisor with the U.S. CFTC and is a member of
the National Futures Association. The Manager is also registered
with the Securities and Exchange Commission as an investment
adviser. The Fund’s Units are registered under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934.

 

The
investment objective of the Fund is to achieve long-term capital
appreciation through professionally managed trading in both U.S.
and foreign markets primarily in futures contracts, forwards
contracts, spot currency contracts, and associated derivative
instruments, such as options and swaps, through its investment in
GAIT, which in turn invests in various Master Funds. The Master
Funds seek to profit from opportunities in the global financial
markets, including interest rate futures, foreign exchange, global
stock indices and energy, metals and agricultural futures, as
professionally managed multi-strategy investment vehicles. Each of
the investment programs consists of multiple trading strategies of
the Manager, which the Manager has combined in an effort to
diversify the Fund’s investment exposure and to make the
Fund’s performance returns less volatile and more
consistently profitable.

 

SEI Global
Services, Inc. (“SEI”) is the Fund’s independent
administrator and transfer agent. SEI is responsible for certain
matters pertaining to the administration of the Fund.

 

The Fund
will terminate on December 31, 2050 or at an earlier date if
certain conditions occur as outlined in the Limited Liability
Company Agreement (“LLC Agreement”).

Notes to
Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

 

1.
Organization and Business (continued)

 

The
performance of the Fund is directly affected by the performance of
GAIT; therefore these consolidated financial statements should be
read in conjunction with the attached financial statements of
GAIT.

 

Duties of
the Manager

 

Subject to
the terms and conditions of the LLC Agreement, the Manager has
complete and exclusive responsibility for managing and
administering the affairs of the Fund and for directing the
investment and reinvestment of the assets of the Fund, GAI, and
GAIT.

 

2. Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies

 

These
financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”)
and all amounts are stated in U.S. dollars. The Fund applies
specialized accounting guidance as outlined in Financial Accounting
Standards Board   (“FASB”) Accounting
Standards Codification Topic 946, Financial Services –
Investment Companies , and is an investment company within the
meaning of such guidance. The preparation of these consolidated
financial statements requires the Manager to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial
statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from
those estimates.

 

Principles
of Consolidation

 

The Fund
owns 100% of GAI’s Blended Strategies Portfolio and as such
these consolidated financial statements include all the accounts of
the Fund and GAI’s Blended Strategies Portfolio. Intercompany
transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.
Creditors of the Fund have recourse to all assets of the Fund for
amounts due to them, while creditors of GAI would have recourse
only to the assets of GAI.

 

Investment
in Graham Alternative Investment Trading LLC

 

The Fund
records its investment in GAIT at fair value based upon the
Fund’s proportionate share of GAIT’s reported net asset
value in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In determining its net asset
value, GAIT records its investments in Master Funds at fair value
based upon GAIT’s proportionate share of the Master
Funds’ reported net asset value. The Fund records its
proportionate share of GAIT’s investment income and loss,
expenses, fees, and realized and unrealized gains and losses on a
monthly basis and includes them in the consolidated statements of
operations. Purchases and sales of units in GAIT are recorded on a
trade date basis. The accounting policies of GAIT are described in
its attached financial statements.

 

GAIT
charges its investors, including the Fund, an advisory fee, sponsor
fee, and incentive allocation, all of which are described in detail
in Note 4. The Fund does not charge any additional fees; however
each investor in the Fund indirectly bears a portion of the
advisory fee, sponsor fee, and incentive allocation charged by
GAIT.

 

At
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Fund owned 42.40% and
46.73%, respectively of GAIT.

 

Fair
Value

 

The fair
value of the assets and liabilities of the Fund and GAIT, which
qualify as financial instruments under U.S. GAAP, approximates the
carrying amounts presented in the consolidated statements of
financial condition. Changes in these carrying amounts are included
in the consolidated statements of operations.

Notes to
Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

 

2. Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

 

Fair Value
(continued)

 

The Fund
follows U.S. GAAP for fair value measurements, which defines fair
value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and
requires certain disclosures about fair value measurements. The
Fund reports the fair value of its investment related assets and
liabilities in accordance with the hierarchy established under U.S.
GAAP. U.S. GAAP uses a three-level hierarchy for fair value
measurement based on the activeness of the market and the
transparency and independence of inputs used in the valuation of an
asset or liability as of the measurement date.

 

The fair
value hierarchy categorizes asset and liability positions into one
of three levels, as summarized below, based on the inputs and
assumptions used in deriving fair value.

 





 



·



Level 1
inputs are unadjusted closing or settlement prices for such assets
or liabilities as published by the primary exchange upon which they
are traded.






 



·



Level 2
inputs include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities
obtained from independent brokers and/or market makers in each
security.





 



·



Level 3
inputs are those which are considered unobservable and are
significant in arriving at fair value.




 

The
Fund’s investment in GAIT has been valued at net asset value
using the practical expedient. According to FASB  Accounting
Standards Update 2015-07 – Disclosures for Investment in
Certain Entities that Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or Its
Equivalent) (“ASU 2015-07”), these investments are
no longer categorized in the fair value hierarchy. There were no
Level 3 assets or liabilities held at any point during the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 or the year ended December 31, 2015
by the Fund, GAIT, or the Master Funds and there were no transfers
between levels during those periods. Transfers between levels, if
any, are recognized on the actual date of the event or change in
circumstances that cause the transfer.

 

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements

 

In August
2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2014-15 –
Presentation of Financial Statements – Going Concern
(Subtopic 205-40). The pronouncement determines management’s
responsibility regarding the assessment of the Fund’s ability
to continue as a going concern even if the Fund’s liquidation
is not imminent. Under this guidance, during each period in which
financial statements are prepared, management will need to evaluate
whether there are conditions or events that, in the aggregate,
raise substantial doubt about the Fund’s ability to continue
as a going concern within one year after the date the financial
statements are issued. Substantial doubt would exist if conditions
or events indicate that the Fund will be unable to meet its
obligations as they become due.   Accounting Standards Update
2014-15 is effective for annual periods ending after December 15,
2016, however early adoption is permitted. The Manager is currently
assessing the impact, if any, that this pronouncement will have on
the disclosures within the financial statements which is expected
to be minimal.

 

Indemnifications

 

In the
normal course of business, the Master Funds, GAIT, Cash Assets, and
the Fund enter into contracts that contain a variety of
indemnifications. Such contracts may include those by Cash Assets
and the Master Funds with their brokers and trading counterparties.
The Fund’s maximum exposure under these arrangements is
unknown; however, the Fund has not had prior claims or losses with
respect to such indemnifications and considers the risk of loss to
be remote. At September 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015, no accruals have been recorded by the
Fund for indemnifications.

3. Capital
Accounts

 

The Fund
offers two classes (each a “Class”) of Units
(collectively the “Units”), being Class 0 Units and
Class 2 Units. The Fund may issue additional Classes in the future
subject to different fees, expenses or other terms, or to invest in
other investment programs or combinations of investment programs
managed by the Manager.

 

A separate
capital account is maintained for each member with respect to each
member’s Class of Units. The initial balance of each
member’s capital account is equal to the initial contribution
to the Fund by such member with respect to the Class to which such
capital account relates. Each member’s capital account is
increased by any additional subscription, and decreased by any
redemption by such member of Units of such Class to which the
capital account relates. All income and expenses of the Fund are
allocated among the members’ capital accounts in proportion
to the balance that each capital account bears to the balance of
all capital as of the beginning of such fiscal period.

 

Subscriptions

 

Units may
be purchased at a price equal to the Net Asset Value per Unit of
the relevant Class as of the immediately preceding Valuation Day,
as defined in the LLC Agreement. The minimum initial subscription
from each investor in each Class is $10,000. Members may subscribe
for additional Units in a minimum amount of not less than
$5,000.

 

Units are
available for subscription as of the first business day of each
month upon written notice of at least three business days prior to
the last business day of the preceding month.

 

Redemption
of Units

 

Units are
not subject to any minimum holding period. Members may redeem Units
at the Net Asset Value thereof as of each Valuation Day, as defined
in the LLC Agreement, upon not less than three business days’
prior written notice to the administrator. A partial redemption
request for an amount less than $10,000 will not be accepted, nor
will a redemption request be accepted to the extent that it would
result in an investor owning less than $10,000. The redemption
proceeds will normally be remitted within 15 days after the
Valuation Day, without interest for the period from the Valuation
Day to the payment date.

 

Redemption
Fees

 

Class 2
Units are subject to a redemption fee equal to 2% of their Net
Asset Value if redeemed within six months  from their
subscription date and a redemption fee equal to 1% of their Net
Asset Value if redeemed more than six and less than twelve months
from their subscription date. Class 0 Units are not subject to a
redemption fee. Redemption fees are payable to the Manager upon
redemption of Units from the proceeds of such redemption. There
were $500 and $0 of redemption fees paid to the Manager for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively.

4. Fees
and Related Party Transactions

 

Advisory
Fees

 

For the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, each Class of GAIT
other than Class M paid the Manager an advisory fee (the
“Advisory Fee”) at an aggregate annual rate equal to
1.75% of the Net Asset Value of such Class. The Advisory Fee is
payable monthly in arrears calculated as of the last business day
of each month and any other date the Manager may permit, in its
sole and absolute discretion, as of   which any subscription
or redemption is effected with respect to Units of such Class
during the month.

  

Sponsor
Fees

 

For the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, each Class of GAIT
other than Class M paid the Manager a sponsor fee (the
“Sponsor Fee”) at an annual rate of the Net Asset Value
specified in the table below. The Sponsor Fee is payable monthly in
arrears calculated as of the last business day of each month in the
same manner as the Advisory Fee.

Incentive
Allocation

 

At the end
of each calendar quarter, Graham Capital LLC, an affiliate of the
Manager, will receive a special allocation of net profits (the
“Incentive Allocation”) in an amount equal to 20% of
the New High Net Trading Profits of each Class of GAIT, as defined
in the LLC Agreement. The Incentive Allocation is also accrued and
allocable on the date of redemption with respect to any Units that
are redeemed prior to the end of a calendar quarter. Additionally,
any loss carryforward attributable to any class of GAIT shall be
proportionately reduced, effective as of the date of any redemption
of any Units of such class, by multiplying the loss carryforward by
the ratio that the amount of assets redeemed from such class bears
to the net assets of such class immediately prior to such
redemption. The loss carryforward of a class must be recouped
before any subsequent Incentive Allocation can be made. The total
Incentive Allocation allocated to the Fund by GAIT for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $0 and $1,369,198,
respectively.

 

Administrator’s
Fee

 

For the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, GAIT paid SEI a
monthly administrator’s fee based on GAIT’s net asset
value, calculated as of the last business day of each month. In
addition, GAIT reimbursed SEI for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses
incurred on behalf of GAIT. The total administrator’s fees,
including out-of-pocket expenses, allocated to the Fund by GAIT for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $71,599 and
$85,218, respectively.

 

Any
portion of any of the above fees, including the Incentive
Allocation, may be paid by the Manager to third parties as
compensation for selling activities in connection with the
Fund.

5. Income
Taxes

 

No
provision for income taxes has been made in the accompanying
consolidated financial statements, as members are individually
responsible for reporting income or loss based upon their
respective share of the Fund’s revenues and expenses for
income tax purposes.

 

U.S. GAAP
provides guidance for how uncertain tax positions should be
recognized, measured, presented and disclosed in the financial
statements. U.S. GAAP requires the evaluation of tax positions
taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing the
Fund’s tax returns to determine whether the tax positions are
“more-likely-than-not” of being sustained by the
applicable tax authority. Tax positions not deemed to meet a
more-likely-than-not threshold would be recorded as a tax expense
in the current year and the Fund identifies its major tax
jurisdictions as U.S. Federal and Connecticut State. The Manager
has evaluated the Fund’s tax positions and has concluded that
there are no significant tax positions requiring recognition,
measurement or disclosure in the consolidated financial statements
for open tax years 2013 through 2015 or expected to be taken in the
Fund’s 2016 tax returns. The Manager is not aware of any tax
positions for which it is reasonably possible that the total
amounts of unrecognized tax expense will change materially in the
next twelve months. Tax years which are considered open by the
relevant jurisdiction are subject to potential
examination.

Total
return is calculated for Class 0 and Class 2 Units taken as a
whole. Total return is calculated as the change in total
members’ capital adjusted for subscriptions or redemptions
during the period. An individual member’s return may vary
from these returns based on the timing of capital transactions and
the applicability of Advisory Fees, Sponsor Fees,
Administrator’s Fees, and the Incentive Allocation. The net
investment loss and total expense ratios (including Incentive
Allocation) are calculated for Class 0 and Class 2 Units taken as a
whole and include net amounts allocated from GAIT. The computation
of such ratios is based on the amount of net investment loss,
expenses and Incentive Allocation. Net investment loss and total
expense ratios have not been annualized and are computed based upon
the weighted average of members’ capital for Class 0 and
Class 2 Units of the Fund for the three and nine months periods
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.

 

7.
Subsequent Events

 

The Fund
had subscriptions of approximately $7.2 million and redemptions of
approximately $0.4 million from October 1, 2016 through November
14, 2016, the date through which subsequent events were evaluated
by management. These amounts have not been included in the
financial statements.

  Notes
to Unaudited Financial Statements

 

September
30, 2016

 

1.
Organization and Business

 

Graham
Alternative Investment Trading LLC (“GAIT”) was formed
on May 18, 2006, commenced operations on August 1, 2006 and is
organized as a Delaware Limited Liability Company. Graham Capital
Management, L.P. (the “Managing Member” or
“Manager”) is the Managing Member and the sole
investment advisor. The Managing Member is registered as a
Commodity Pool Operator and Commodity Trading Advisor with the U.S.
Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) and is a
member of the National Futures Association. The Managing Member is
also registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission as an
investment adviser. GAIT is a commodity pool, and as such is
subject to the oversight and jurisdiction of the CFTC.

 

The
investment objective of GAIT is to achieve long-term capital
appreciation through professionally managed trading through its
investment in various master trading vehicles (“Master
Funds”). As more fully described in Notes 2 and 3, these
Master Funds invest in a broad range of derivative instruments such
as currency forward and futures contracts; bond, interest rate, and
index futures contracts; commodity forward and futures contracts,
and options and swaps thereon traded on U.S. and foreign exchanges,
as well as over-the-counter.

 

Graham
Alternative Investment Fund I LLC Blended Strategies Portfolio and
Graham Alternative Investment Fund II LLC Blended Strategies
Portfolio are the primary investors of GAIT.

 

SEI Global
Services, Inc. (“SEI”) is GAIT’s independent
administrator and transfer agent. SEI is responsible for certain
matters pertaining to the administration of GAIT.

 

GAIT will
terminate on December 31, 2050 or at an earlier date if certain
conditions occur as outlined in the Limited Liability Company
Agreement (“LLC Agreement”).

 

Duties of
the Managing Member

 

Subject to
the terms and conditions of the LLC Agreement, the Managing Member
has complete and exclusive responsibility for managing and
administering the affairs of GAIT and for directing the investment
and reinvestment of the assets of GAIT.

 

2. Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies

 

These
financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”)
and all amounts are stated in U.S. dollars. GAIT applies
specialized accounting guidance as outlined in Financial Accounting
Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards
Codification Topic 946, Financial Services – Investment
Companies , and is an investment company within the meaning of
such guidance. The preparation of these financial statements
requires the Manager to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying
notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

 

Investments
in Master Funds

 

GAIT
invests in various Master Funds which are managed by the Managing
Member. These investments are valued in the accompanying statements
of financial condition at fair value in accordance with U.S. GAAP
based upon GAIT’s proportionate share of the Master
Funds’ reported net asset values. Gains and losses are
allocated monthly by each Master Fund to GAIT based upon
GAIT’s proportionate share of the net asset value of each
Master Fund and are included in the statements of operations and
incentive allocation.

Notes to
Unaudited Financial Statements (continued)

 

2. Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

 

Due
from/to Brokers

 

Due
from/to brokers on the Master Funds’ and Graham Cash Assets
LLC’s (“Cash Assets”) financial statements
primarily consist of cash balances carried as margin deposits with
clearing brokers for the purpose of trading in futures contracts,
foreign currency contracts and other derivative instruments and
securities, and receivables/payables for unsettled transactions.
Substantially all of the Master Funds’ and Cash Assets’
cash and investments are held as collateral by its brokers to
secure derivative instruments and securities.

 

Revenue
Recognition

 

All
financial instruments are recorded on the trade date at fair value.
Net unrealized gain or loss on open derivative instruments is
included in the Master Funds’ statements of financial
condition as the difference between the original purchase price and
the current market value at the end of the period. Any change in
net unrealized gain or loss from the preceding period is reported
in the Master Funds’ statements of operations. Interest
income and expense are recorded on the accrual basis. Dividends are
recorded on the ex-dividend date and are net of related withholding
taxes. All other expenses are recorded on the accrual
basis.

 

Brokerage
Commissions and Fees

 

Brokerage
commissions and fees on the Master Funds’ financial
statements represent all brokerage commissions and other fees
incurred in connection with the Master Funds’ trading
activity and are recorded on the accrual basis.

 

Foreign
Currency Translation

 

Assets and
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using
the exchange rates at  September 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015. Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions
are calculated using daily exchange rates prevailing on the
transaction date. The Master Funds do not isolate the portion of
results of operations from changes in foreign exchange rates on
investments and cash from fluctuations arising from changes in
market prices held. Currency translation gains and losses are
included in the statement of operations within net realized gain
(loss) and net increase (decrease) in unrealized appreciation on
investments.

 

Fair
Value

 

The fair
value of GAIT’s assets and liabilities, which qualify as
financial instruments under U.S. GAAP, approximates the carrying
amounts presented in the statements of financial condition. Changes
in these carrying amounts are included in the statements of
operations and incentive allocation.

 

GAIT
follows U.S. GAAP for fair value measurements, which defines fair
value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and
requires certain disclosures about fair value measurements. GAIT
reports the fair value of its investment related assets and
liabilities in accordance with the hierarchy established under U.S.
GAAP. U.S. GAAP uses a three-level hierarchy for fair value
measurement based on the activeness of the market and the
transparency and independence of inputs used in the valuation of an
asset or liability as of the measurement date.

Notes to
Unaudited Financial Statements (continued)

 

2. Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

 

Fair Value
(continued)

 

The fair
value hierarchy categorizes asset and liability positions into one
of three levels, as summarized below, based on the inputs and
assumptions used in deriving fair value.

 





 



·



Level 1
inputs are unadjusted closing or settlement prices for such assets
or liabilities as published by the primary exchange upon which they
are traded.






 



·



Level 2
inputs include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities
obtained from independent brokers and/or market makers in each
security.






 



·



Level 3
inputs are those which are considered unobservable and are
significant in arriving at fair value.




 

GAIT’s
investments in Master Funds and Graham Cash Assets LLC (“Cash
Assets”) have been valued at net asset value using the
practical expedient. According to FASB Accounting Standards Update
2015-07 – Disclosures for Investment in Certain Entities
that Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or Its Equivalent)
(“ASU 2015-07”), these investments are no longer
categorized in the fair value hierarchy. GAIT’s investments
in Master Funds and Cash Assets are discussed in Notes 3 and 4.
There were no Level 3 assets or liabilities held at any point
during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 or the year ended
December 31, 2015 by GAIT, the Master Funds, or Cash Assets, and
there were no transfers between levels during those periods.
Transfers between levels, if any, are recognized on the actual date
of the event or change in circumstances that cause the
transfer.

 

Derivative
Instruments

 

In the
normal course of business, the Master Funds utilize derivative
financial instruments in connection with their trading activities.
Derivative instruments derive their value from underlying assets,
indices, reference rates or a combination of these factors.
Investments in derivative financial instruments are subject to
additional risks that can result in a loss of all or part of an
investment. The Master Funds’ derivative financial
instruments are classified by the following primary underlying
risks: interest rate, foreign currency exchange rate, commodity
price, and equity price risks. These risks can be in excess of the
amounts recognized in the statements of financial condition. In
addition, the Master Funds are also subject to additional
counterparty risk should their counterparties fail to meet the
terms of their contracts. Management of counterparty risk involves
a number of considerations, such as the financial profile of the
counterparty, specific terms and duration of the contractual
agreement, and the value of collateral held, if any. The Master
Funds have established initial credit approval, credit limits, and
collateral requirements and may reduce their exposure to any
counterparties they deem necessary. Trading in non-U.S. dollar
denominated derivative instruments may subject the value of, and
gains and losses associated with, such contracts to additional
risks related to adverse changes in the applicable exchange
rates.

 

Unrealized
gains and losses from derivative financial instruments are recorded
based on changes in their fair value. Realized gains and losses are
recorded when the positions are closed. All unrealized and realized
gains and losses related to derivative financial instruments are
included in net gain (loss) on investments in the Master
Funds’ statements of operations.

Derivative
Instruments (continued)

 

Futures
Contracts

 

The Master
Funds use futures contracts in an attempt to take advantage of
changes in the value of equities, commodities, interest rates,
bonds and foreign currencies. Futures contracts are valued based
upon the closing price as of the valuation date established by the
primary exchange upon which they are traded.

 

A futures
contract represents a commitment for the future purchase or sale of
an asset or cash settlement based on the value of an asset on a
specified date. The purchase and sale of futures contracts are
executed on an exchange which requires margin deposits with a
Futures Commission Merchant (“FCM”). Subsequent
payments are made or received by the Master Funds each day,
depending on the daily fluctuations in the value of the contract.
These changes in valuation are recorded for financial statement
purposes as unrealized gains or losses by the Master Funds.
Relative to over-the-counter derivative financial instruments,
futures contracts provide reduced counterparty risk to the Master
Funds since futures are exchange-traded and the exchanges’
clearing house guarantees the futures against default. However,
some non-U.S. exchanges are “principals’ markets”
in which no common clearing facility exists and the Master Funds
may look only to the clearing broker for performance of the
contract. The U.S. Commodity Exchange Act requires an FCM to
segregate all funds received from such FCM’s customers in
respect of regulated futures transactions. If the FCM were not to
do so to the full extent required by law, the assets of the Master
Funds might not be fully protected in the event of the bankruptcy
or insolvency of the FCM. In that case, the Master Funds would be
limited to recovering only a pro rata share of all available funds
segregated on behalf of the FCM’s combined customer accounts,
even though certain property specifically traceable to the Master
Funds was held by the FCM. In addition, in the event of bankruptcy
or insolvency of an exchange or an affiliated clearing house, the
Master Funds might experience a loss of funds deposited through its
FCM as margin with such exchange or affiliated clearing house, the
loss of unrealized profits on its open positions, and the loss of
funds owed to it as realized profits on closed
positions.

 

Forward
Contracts

 

The Master
Funds enter into foreign currency forward contracts in an attempt
to take advantage of changes in exchange rates. Forward currency
transactions are contracts or agreements for delivery of specific
currencies or the cash equivalent value at a specified future date
and an agreed upon price. Forward contracts are not guaranteed by
an exchange or clearing house and therefore the risks include the
inability of counterparties to meet their obligations under the
terms of the contracts as well as the risks associated with
movements in fair value.

 

Exchange
traded forward contracts are valued based upon the settlement
prices as of the valuation date, established by the primary
exchange upon which they are traded. All other forward contracts
are valued based upon a forward curve constructed using
independently quoted forward points. Changes in fair value of each
forward contract are recognized as unrealized gains or
losses.

Swap
Contracts

 

The Master
Funds may enter into various swap contracts in an attempt to take
advantage of changes in interest rates and asset values. Exchange
traded interest rate swap contracts are executed on an exchange
which requires margin deposits with a Central Clearing Counterparty
(“CCP”). Subsequent payments are made or received by
the Master Funds each day, depending on the daily fluctuations in
the value of the contract. These changes in valuation are recorded
for financial statement purposes as unrealized gains or losses by
the Master Funds. Relative to over-the-counter interest rate swap
contracts, exchange traded interest rate swap contracts provide
reduced counterparty risk since they are exchange-traded and the
exchange’s clearinghouse guarantees against default. The
Commodity Exchange Act requires a CCP to segregate all funds
received from such CCP’s customers in respect of exchange
traded interest rate swaps. If the CCP were not to do so to the
full extent required by law, the assets of the Master Funds might
not be fully protected in the event of the bankruptcy or insolvency
of the CCP. In that case, the Master Funds would be limited to
recovering only a pro rata share of all available funds segregated
on behalf of the CCP’s combined customer accounts, even
though certain property specifically traceable to the Master Funds
is held by the CCP. In addition, in the event of bankruptcy or
insolvency of an exchange or an affiliated clearing house, the
Master Funds could experience a loss of funds deposited through its
CCP as margin with such exchange or affiliated clearing house, the
loss of unrealized profits on its open positions, and the loss of
funds owed to it as realized profits on closed positions. All funds
deposited with both U.S. and non-U.S. CCPs are included in due from
brokers on the statements of financial condition. Over the counter
swap contracts are not guaranteed by an exchange or an affiliated
clearing house or regulated by any U.S. or foreign government
authorities. Failure of a counterparty to meet its obligation under
the terms of the swap contract could result in the loss of any
unrealized gains on open positions. It may not be possible to
dispose of or close out a swap position without the consent of the
counterparty, and the Master Funds may not be able to enter into an
offsetting contract in order to cover its risk.

 

An
interest rate swap contract is an agreement that obligates two
parties to exchange a series of cash flows at specified intervals
based upon or calculated by reference to changes in specified rates
for a specified notional amount of the underlying assets. The
payment flows are usually netted against each other, with the
difference being paid by one party to another. Interest rate swap
positions are generally valued as the present value of the net
future cash flows as estimated by the Advisor using a discount
curve constructed from independently obtained future interest rate
assumptions.

 

A total
return swap contract is an agreement that obligates two parties to
exchange cash flows calculated by reference to changes in specified
prices for a specified notional amount of the underlying assets.
The payment flows are usually netted against each other, with the
difference being paid by one party to another. Total return swaps
are generally valued based upon the value of the underlying
instruments as determined by the primary exchange on which they are
traded.

 

Exchange
traded swaps are valued based upon the last traded prices
established by the primary exchange upon which they are traded.
Changes in fair value of each swap are recognized as unrealized
gains or losses. The Master Funds record realized gains or losses
when a swap contract is terminated.

Derivative

Options

 

The Master
Funds may buy and sell covered and uncovered exchange traded and
over-the-counter options on futures, foreign currencies,
commodities, interest rates and equities to take advantage of the
price movements of the financial instrument underlying the option
or to hedge positions in the underlying assets. Option contracts
give one party the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell
within a limited time or on a specified date, a financial
instrument, commodity or currency at a contracted price. Options
may also be settled in cash, based on differentials between
specified indices or prices.

 

When
purchasing options, the Master Funds are exposed to counterparty
risk to the extent that a seller of an over-the-counter option does
not meet its obligations under the terms of the option contract.
The maximum risk of loss to the Master Funds is the unrealized
gains of the contracts and the premiums paid to purchase its open
option contracts. Relative to over-the-counter options, exchange
traded options provide reduced counterparty risk to the Master
Funds since the exchanges’ clearinghouse guarantees the
option against default.

 

Selling
uncovered options may subject the Master Funds to unlimited risk of
loss. As the writer of an option, the Master Funds bear the market
risk of an unfavorable change in the price of the underlying
instrument.

 

Exchange
traded options are valued based upon the settlement prices
published as of the valuation date by the principal exchange upon
which they are traded. In the absence of an exchange published
settlement price, the option will be valued using the last reported
sales price reported on the exchange for the valuation date.
Over-the-counter options and exchange traded options with no
reported sales price on the valuation date will generally be valued
at the average of last reported bid and offer quotes from
independent brokers or from the exchange, respectively.

 

Credit
Risk Related Contingent Features

 

OTC
Derivative Instruments are subject to ISDA Master Agreements which
generally require among other things, that the Master Funds
maintain a predetermined level of net assets or rate of return, and
provide limits with respect to any decline in value over 1-month,
3-month and 12-month periods. If the Master Funds were to violate
such provisions, the counterparty to these instruments could demand
liquidation of the outstanding positions. There were no events that
occurred throughout the nine months ended September 30, 2016 or for
the year ended December 31, 2015 which caused any counterparty to
demand liquidation of any outstanding positions. At September 30,
2016 and December 31, 2015, there were no Derivative Instruments
subject to credit risk related contingent features in a net
liability position for either of the Master Funds in which GAIT
invests except for Graham Commodity Strategies LLC. Graham
Commodity Strategies LLC had Derivative Instruments subject to
credit risk related contingent features in a net liability position
in the amount of $12,136,407 and $102,519 at
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015,
respectively.

New York
Mercantile Exchange Corporate Membership

 

Graham
Commodity Strategies LLC, a Master Fund in which GAIT invests, is a
member of the New York Mercantile Exchange (“NYMEX”).
As a result of its membership, Graham Commodity Strategies LLC owns
two NYMEX seats and 30,000 shares of the CME Group. Graham
Commodity Strategy LLC’s policy is to value the NYMEX
memberships and the shares of the CME Group at fair value. As of
September 30, 2016 and  December 31, 2015, the two NYMEX
memberships were valued at $382,000 and $305,000, respectively, and
the 30,000 shares of CME Group were valued at $3,135,600 and
$2,718,000, respectively, both of which are contained within
Exchange Memberships on Graham Commodity Strategies LLC’s
statements of financial condition. The NYMEX seats and shares are
considered Level 1 assets as described in the Fair Value section of
Note 2.

 

Chicago
Board of Trade Membership

 

Graham K4D
Trading Ltd., a Master Fund in which GAIT invests, is a member of
the Chicago Board of Trade (“CBOT”) under Rule 106.S
and owns two B-1/Full seats and one B-2/Associate seat. Graham K4D
Trading Ltd.’s policy is to value the CBOT memberships at
fair value. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the
B-1/Full memberships were valued at $404,000 and $455,000,
respectively, and the B-2/Associate memberships were valued at
$70,000 and $72,500, respectively, both of which are included in
CME Membership on the statements of financial condition.
Additionally, Graham K4D Trading Ltd. owns a Chicago Mercantile
Exchange seat valued at $214,500 and $224,500 at September 30, 2016
and December 31, 2015, respectively, which is also included in
Exchange Membership on the statements of financial condition. The
CBOT memberships and shares are considered Level 1 assets as
described in the Fair Value section of Note 2.

 

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements

 

In August
2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2014-15 –
Presentation of Financial Statements – Going Concern
(Subtopic 205-40). The pronouncement determines management’s
responsibility regarding the assessment of GAIT’s ability to
continue as a going concern even if GAIT’s liquidation is not
imminent. Under this guidance, during each period in which
financial statements are prepared, management will need to evaluate
whether there are conditions or events that, in the aggregate,
raise substantial doubt about GAIT’s ability to continue as a
going concern within one year after the date the financial
statements are issued. Substantial doubt would exist if conditions
or events indicate that GAIT will be unable to meet its obligations
as they become due.   Accounting Standards Update 2014-15 is
effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016,
however early adoption is permitted. The Manager is currently
assessing the impact, if any, that this pronouncement will have on
the disclosures within the financial statements. Any impact is
expected to be minimal.

 

Indemnifications

 

In the
normal course of business, the Master Funds, Cash Assets, and GAIT
enter into contracts that contain a variety of indemnifications.
Such contracts may include those by Cash Assets and the Master
Funds with their brokers and trading counterparties. GAIT’s
maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown; however, GAIT
has not had prior claims or losses with respect to such
indemnifications and considers the risk of loss to be remote. At
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, no accruals have been
recorded by GAIT for indemnifications.

Investments in Master Funds

 

As of
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, GAIT invested in various
Master Funds, all of which were managed by the Manager.
GAIT’s investments in these Master Funds, as well as the
investment objectives of each Master Fund, are summarized below.
Master Funds in which GAIT invested 5% or more of its
members’ capital are individually identified, while smaller
investments are aggregated under the caption “Other Global
Macro Funds,” if applicable. All of the Master Funds and GAIT
are related parties. The Master Funds do not charge management or
incentive fees and all offer monthly subscriptions and
redemptions.
