Janitorial and Breakroom Supplies: Essendant holds over 25,000 items in the following areas: Janitorial supplies (cleaners and cleaning accessories), breakroom items (food and beverage products), food service consumables (such as disposable cups, plates and utensils), safety and security items, and paper and packaging supplies.

Traditional Office Products: Essendant is one of the largest national wholesale distributors of a broad range of office supplies. It carries approximately 23,000 brand name and private label products such as filing and record storage products, business machines, presentation products, writing instruments, paper products, shipping and mailing supplies, calendars and general office accessories.
Industrial Supplies: Essendant carries approximately 100,000 industrial items including hand and power tools, safety and security supplies, janitorial equipment and supplies, various industrial MRO (maintenance, repair and operations) items, oil field and welding supplies, and automotive aftermarket tools and equipment.
Office Furniture: Essendant is one of the largest office furniture wholesale distributors in the U.S. It stocks approximately 4,000 products including desks, filing and storage solutions, seating and systems furniture, along with a variety of products for niche markets such as education, government, healthcare and professional services.
Customers[edit]
Essendant serves a diverse group of approximately 30,000 reseller customers. They include independent office products dealers, contract stationers, office products superstores, computer products resellers, office furniture dealers, mass merchandisers, mail order companies, sanitary supply, paper and food service distributors, drug and grocery store chains, healthcare distributors, e-commerce merchants, oil field, welding supply and industrial/MRO distributors, automotive aftermarket dealers and wholesalers and other independent distributors.
Marketing & Customer Support[edit]
Essendant provides value-added services designed to help their customers market their products and services while improving operating efficiencies and reducing costs.
The company provides comprehensive printed catalogs for easy shopping as well as reference guides to more promotional materials. Extensive digital content and capabilities are provided to better position resellers on the internet. This ranges from a content database digitized for e-commerce to advanced eBusiness capabilities, website development, analytics and digital promotional campaigns. Essendant produces the printed and digital assets on behalf of resellers and collects fees and/or advertising revenue from them in return.
Essendant also provides specific services that enable resellers to improve their business model. These include primary research efforts, brand strategy and development, campaign creation, customer segmentation, cost management and training programs designed to help resellers improve their sales and marketing techniques.
Distribution[edit]
Essendant's distribution network enables the company to ship most products overnight to more than 90% of the U.S. and next day delivery to major cities in Canada, with an average line fill rate of approximately 97%. Essendant's domestic operations generate approximately $5.1 billion of its approximate $5.3 billion in 2014 consolidated net sales, with its international operations contributing another $0.2 billion to 2014 net sales. Efficient order processing resulted in a 99.7% order accuracy rate for the year.
Essendant's network of 75 distribution centers is spread across the nation to facilitate delivery. It has a dedicated fleet of approximately 475 trucks. This enables the company to make direct deliveries to resellers from regional distribution centers and local distribution points.
The "Wrap and Label" program is another service provided to resellers. It gives resellers the option to receive individually packaged orders that are ready to be delivered to their end consumers. For example, when a reseller places orders for several individual consumers, Essendant can pick and pack the items separately, placing a label on each package with the consumer's name, ready for delivery by the reseller, to the end consumer. Resellers benefit from the "Wrap and Label" program because it eliminates the need to break down bulk shipments and repackage orders before delivering them to their end-consumer.
Competition[edit]
The markets in which Essendant participates are highly competitive. The company competes with other wholesale distributors as well as with the manufacturers of the products the company sells. In addition, the company competes with warehouse clubs, and the business-to-business sales divisions of national business products resellers.
Essendant competes primarily on the basis of breadth of product lines, availability of products, speed of delivery, order fill rates, net pricing to customers, and the quality of marketing and other value-added services.
Employees[edit]
As of February 13, 2015, Essendant employed approximately 6,500 people.
Officers[edit]
The current officers of the company include:[2]

Richard D. Phillips, interim President and Chief Executive Officer[3]
Janet Zelenka, Senior Vice President - Chief Financial Officer and Chief Information Officer
Eric A. Blanchard, Senior Vice President - General Counsel & Secretary
Ric Phillips, President of Industrial
Carole Tomko, Senior Vice President - Chief Human Resources Officer

History[edit]
Essendant was incorporated in 1922 under the name Utility Supply Company. During the early 1930s, the company published its first office products catalog. The concept was such a success that the business was further expanded with the opening of its first retail store in 1937. In the early 1950s, in addition to its catalog and retail operation, management recognized growing opportunities in the office products wholesale business. In 1970, the company opened its first state-of-the-art distribution center. As time passed, the company found it difficult to compete as both a retailer and wholesaler. So, in 1978, the retail operations were sold and the company began to operate exclusively as an office products wholesaler.
To provide the capital to further its growth, Essendant incorporated and then went public in 1981 as United Stationers Inc. (USTR) on the NASDAQ. In 1984, the company established MicroUnited to capitalize on the growth in the computer supplies sector. The company's MicroUnited division focused on the distribution of peripherals and supplies to computer products resellers. Essendant recognized that its marketing programs and distribution infrastructure would be attractive to customers within other industries.
In June 2002, the company announced that, as part of its succession plan, Richard W. Gochnauer, 52, would become the company's chief operating officer and a member of the board of directors, when he joined the company on July 22.[4]
In December 2010, the company announced that P. Cody Phipps, the company's Chief Operating Officer, would become president and CEO when Richard W. Gochnauer, CEO, retired at the annual shareholders’ meeting in May 2011.[5]
In April 2015, the company announced the departure of P. Cody Phipps, the company's Chief Executive Officer, and Director Robert Blaine Aiken Jr. would take over as interim CEO.
In early 2015, the company announced the re-branding of the company to Essendant from United Stationers. The new company name became effective in June 2015. The company's symbol on the NASDAQ Global Select Market changed from USTR to ESND.[6]
July 22, 2015 Essendant announced that its Board of Directors appointed Robert B. Aiken Jr., president and CEO effective immediately. Mr. Aiken, who was serving as interim president and CEO since May 2015, would also continue as an Essendant Board member.[3]

Mergers & Acquisitions[7][edit]
To expand their line of business, on October 31, 1996 the company acquired Lagasse Bros., Inc., a wholesaler of janitorial and sanitation supplies.
As competition in the late 1980s intensified within the office products industry, consolidation at all levels of the industry became commonplace. In June 1992, the company acquired Stationers Distributing Company, a $425 million office products wholesaler in Fort Worth, Texas. This transaction made the company a $1.5 billion wholesale distributor.
In March 1995, the company was acquired by Associated Stationers, a $475 million general line wholesaler.
On April 3, 1998, the company acquired Azerty, a $350 million wholesaler of computer consumables. Azerty was founded in April 1983 by Marvin Frackt as the US subsidiary of Inter City Papers Limited of Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Bill Dueger was the first manager of Azerty, reporting to Marvin Frackt. Subsequently, the company's MicroUnited division was merged into Azerty. In July 2000, Essendant increased its geographic penetration in Canada by purchasing Azerty Canada, a $115 million computer consumables business.
To broaden the Lagasse division's reach, the company completed the acquisition of Peerless Paper, a $75 million wholesaler in the janitorial/sanitation industry, in January 2001.[8]
In May 2005, Lagasse completed the purchase of Sweet Paper, a $250 million distributor of janitorial/sanitation, paper and food service products.[9] This acquisition expanded Lagasse's product line and enhanced its scale and infrastructure in key markets.
On March 31, 2006, the company decided to sell its Canadian division. In June 2006, it completed the sale of certain assets associated with its Canadian division.

Products[edit]
Essendant stocks over 160,000 products in these categories:
Janitorial and Breakroom Supplies: Essendant holds over 25,000 items in the following areas: Janitorial supplies (cleaners and cleaning accessories), breakroom items (food and beverage products), food service consumables (such as disposable cups, plates and utensils), safety and security items, and paper and packaging supplies.
Technology Products: Essendent stocks over 10,000 items including imaging supplies, data storage, digital cameras, computer accessories and computer hardware items including printers and other peripherals.
Traditional Office Products: Essendant is one of the largest national wholesale distributors of a broad range of office supplies. It carries approximately 23,000 brand name and private label products such as filing and record storage products, business machines, presentation products, writing instruments, paper products, shipping and mailing supplies, calendars and general office accessories.
Industrial Supplies: Essendant carries approximately 100,000 industrial items including hand and power tools, safety and security supplies, janitorial equipment and supplies, various industrial MRO (maintenance, repair and operations) items, oil field and welding supplies, and automotive aftermarket tools and equipment.
Office Furniture: Essendant is one of the largest office furniture wholesale distributors in the U.S. It stocks approximately 4,000 products including desks, filing and storage solutions, seating and systems furniture, along with a variety of products for niche markets such as education, government, healthcare and professional services.
Customers[edit]
Essendant serves a diverse group of approximately 30,000 reseller customers. They include independent office products dealers, contract stationers, office products superstores, computer products resellers, office furniture dealers, mass merchandisers, mail order companies, sanitary supply, paper and food service distributors, drug and grocery store chains, healthcare distributors, e-commerce merchants, oil field, welding supply and industrial/MRO distributors, automotive aftermarket dealers and wholesalers and other independent distributors.
Marketing & Customer Support[edit]
Essendant provides value-added services designed to help their customers market their products and services while improving operating efficiencies and reducing costs.
The company provides comprehensive printed catalogs for easy shopping as well as reference guides to more promotional materials. Extensive digital content and capabilities are provided to better position resellers on the internet. This ranges from a content database digitized for e-commerce to advanced eBusiness capabilities, website development, analytics and digital promotional campaigns. Essendant produces the printed and digital assets on behalf of resellers and collects fees and/or advertising revenue from them in return.
Essendant also provides specific services that enable resellers to improve their business model. These include primary research efforts, brand strategy and development, campaign creation, customer segmentation, cost management and training programs designed to help resellers improve their sales and marketing techniques.
Distribution[edit]
Essendant's distribution network enables the company to ship most products overnight to more than 90% of the U.S. and next day delivery to major cities in Canada, with an average line fill rate of approximately 97%. Essendant's domestic operations generate approximately $5.1 billion of its approximate $5.3 billion in 2014 consolidated net sales, with its international operations contributing another $0.2 billion to 2014 net sales. Efficient order processing resulted in a 99.7% order accuracy rate for the year.
Essendant's network of 75 distribution centers is spread across the nation to facilitate delivery. It has a dedicated fleet of approximately 475 trucks. This enables the company to make direct deliveries to resellers from regional distribution centers and local distribution points.
The "Wrap and Label" program is another service provided to resellers. It gives resellers the option to receive individually packaged orders that are ready to be delivered to their end consumers. For example, when a reseller places orders for several individual consumers, Essendant can pick and pack the items separately, placing a label on each package with the consumer's name, ready for delivery by the reseller, to the end consumer. Resellers benefit from the "Wrap and Label" program because it eliminates the need to break down bulk shipments and repackage orders before delivering them to their end-consumer.
Competition[edit]
The markets in which Essendant participates are highly competitive. The company competes with other wholesale distributors as well as with the manufacturers of the products the company sells. In addition, the company competes with warehouse clubs, and the business-to-business sales divisions of national business products resellers.
Essendant competes primarily on the basis of breadth of product lines, availability of products, speed of delivery, order fill rates, net pricing to customers, and the quality of marketing and other value-added services.
Employees[edit]
As of February 13, 2015, Essendant employed approximately 6,500 people.
Officers[edit]
The current officers of the company include:[2]

Richard D. Phillips, interim President and Chief Executive Officer[3]
Janet Zelenka, Senior Vice President - Chief Financial Officer and Chief Information Officer
Eric A. Blanchard, Senior Vice President - General Counsel & Secretary
Ric Phillips, President of Industrial
Carole Tomko, Senior Vice President - Chief Human Resources Officer

History[edit]
Essendant was incorporated in 1922 under the name Utility Supply Company. During the early 1930s, the company published its first office products catalog. The concept was such a success that the business was further expanded with the opening of its first retail store in 1937. In the early 1950s, in addition to its catalog and retail operation, management recognized growing opportunities in the office products wholesale business. In 1970, the company opened its first state-of-the-art distribution center. As time passed, the company found it difficult to compete as both a retailer and wholesaler. So, in 1978, the retail operations were sold and the company began to operate exclusively as an office products wholesaler.
To provide the capital to further its growth, Essendant incorporated and then went public in 1981 as United Stationers Inc. (USTR) on the NASDAQ. In 1984, the company established MicroUnited to capitalize on the growth in the computer supplies sector. The company's MicroUnited division focused on the distribution of peripherals and supplies to computer products resellers. Essendant recognized that its marketing programs and distribution infrastructure would be attractive to customers within other industries.
In June 2002, the company announced that, as part of its succession plan, Richard W. Gochnauer, 52, would become the company's chief operating officer and a member of the board of directors, when he joined the company on July 22.[4]
In December 2010, the company announced that P. Cody Phipps, the company's Chief Operating Officer, would become president and CEO when Richard W. Gochnauer, CEO, retired at the annual shareholders’ meeting in May 2011.[5]
In April 2015, the company announced the departure of P. Cody Phipps, the company's Chief Executive Officer, and Director Robert Blaine Aiken Jr. would take over as interim CEO.
In early 2015, the company announced the re-branding of the company to Essendant from United Stationers. The new company name became effective in June 2015. The company's symbol on the NASDAQ Global Select Market changed from USTR to ESND.[6]
July 22, 2015 Essendant announced that its Board of Directors appointed Robert B. Aiken Jr., president and CEO effective immediately. Mr. Aiken, who was serving as interim president and CEO since May 2015, would also continue as an Essendant Board member.[3]

Mergers & Acquisitions[7][edit]
To expand their line of business, on October 31, 1996 the company acquired Lagasse Bros., Inc., a wholesaler of janitorial and sanitation supplies.
As competition in the late 1980s intensified within the office products industry, consolidation at all levels of the industry became commonplace. In June 1992, the company acquired Stationers Distributing Company, a $425 million office products wholesaler in Fort Worth, Texas. This transaction made the company a $1.5 billion wholesale distributor.
In March 1995, the company was acquired by Associated Stationers, a $475 million general line wholesaler.
On April 3, 1998, the company acquired Azerty, a $350 million wholesaler of computer consumables. Azerty was founded in April 1983 by Marvin Frackt as the US subsidiary of Inter City Papers Limited of Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Bill Dueger was the first manager of Azerty, reporting to Marvin Frackt. Subsequently, the company's MicroUnited division was merged into Azerty. In July 2000, Essendant increased its geographic penetration in Canada by purchasing Azerty Canada, a $115 million computer consumables business.
To broaden the Lagasse division's reach, the company completed the acquisition of Peerless Paper, a $75 million wholesaler in the janitorial/sanitation industry, in January 2001.[8]
In May 2005, Lagasse completed the purchase of Sweet Paper, a $250 million distributor of janitorial/sanitation, paper and food service products.[9] This acquisition expanded Lagasse's product line and enhanced its scale and infrastructure in key markets.
On March 31, 2006, the company decided to sell its Canadian division. In June 2006, it completed the sale of certain assets associated with its Canadian division.
To diversify and expand its product and customer base, the company acquired ORS Nasco, a $285 million wholesale distributor of industrial supplies, on December 21, 2007.[10]
On March 1, 2010 the company acquired their first technology company, privately owned MBS Dev, a Colorado-based software provider.[11]
In November 2012, the company signed a stock purchase agreement to acquire 100% of the outstanding shares of O.K.I. Supply Co. (O.K.I.) for an all-cash purchase price of $90 million.[12]
On May 29, 2014, the company announced that its wholly owned subsidiary, United Stationers Supply Co., signed an agreement to acquire 100 percent of the outstanding shares of CPO Commerce, Inc., for an all-cash purchase price of $30 million, with up to an additional $10 million to be paid in three years based on performance.[13]
On October 31, 2014, the company completed the acquisition of Liberty Bell Equipment Corporation, a United States wholesaler of auto aftermarket tools and supplies, and its affiliates (collectively, "MEDCO") including G2S Equipment de Fabrication et d'Entretien ULC ("G2S"), a Canadian wholesaler.[14]
On December 17, 2014, the company announced the sale of MBSDev to ProjectAX.[15]
On August 3, 2015, The company completed the acquisition of Nestor Sales LLC., a wholesaler and distributor of tools, equipment and supplies to the transportation industry.[16]

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Janitorial and Breakroom Supplies: Essendant holds over 25,000 items in the following areas: Janitorial supplies (cleaners and cleaning accessories), breakroom items (food and beverage products), food service consumables (such as disposable cups, plates and utensils), safety and security items, and paper and packaging supplies.

Office Furniture: Essendant is one of the largest office furniture wholesale distributors in the U.S. It stocks approximately 4,000 products including desks, filing and storage solutions, seating and systems furniture, along with a variety of products for niche markets such as education, government, healthcare and professional services.
Customers[edit]
Essendant serves a diverse group of approximately 30,000 reseller customers. They include independent office products dealers, contract stationers, office products superstores, computer products resellers, office furniture dealers, mass merchandisers, mail order companies, sanitary supply, paper and food service distributors, drug and grocery store chains, healthcare distributors, e-commerce merchants, oil field, welding supply and industrial/MRO distributors, automotive aftermarket dealers and wholesalers and other independent distributors.
Marketing & Customer Support[edit]
Essendant provides value-added services designed to help their customers market their products and services while improving operating efficiencies and reducing costs.
The company provides comprehensive printed catalogs for easy shopping as well as reference guides to more promotional materials. Extensive digital content and capabilities are provided to better position resellers on the internet. This ranges from a content database digitized for e-commerce to advanced eBusiness capabilities, website development, analytics and digital promotional campaigns. Essendant produces the printed and digital assets on behalf of resellers and collects fees and/or advertising revenue from them in return.
Essendant also provides specific services that enable resellers to improve their business model. These include primary research efforts, brand strategy and development, campaign creation, customer segmentation, cost management and training programs designed to help resellers improve their sales and marketing techniques.
Distribution[edit]
Essendant's distribution network enables the company to ship most products overnight to more than 90% of the U.S. and next day delivery to major cities in Canada, with an average line fill rate of approximately 97%. Essendant's domestic operations generate approximately $5.1 billion of its approximate $5.3 billion in 2014 consolidated net sales, with its international operations contributing another $0.2 billion to 2014 net sales. Efficient order processing resulted in a 99.7% order accuracy rate for the year.
Essendant's network of 75 distribution centers is spread across the nation to facilitate delivery. It has a dedicated fleet of approximately 475 trucks. This enables the company to make direct deliveries to resellers from regional distribution centers and local distribution points.
The "Wrap and Label" program is another service provided to resellers. It gives resellers the option to receive individually packaged orders that are ready to be delivered to their end consumers. For example, when a reseller places orders for several individual consumers, Essendant can pick and pack the items separately, placing a label on each package with the consumer's name, ready for delivery by the reseller, to the end consumer. Resellers benefit from the "Wrap and Label" program because it eliminates the need to break down bulk shipments and repackage orders before delivering them to their end-consumer.
Competition[edit]
The markets in which Essendant participates are highly competitive. The company competes with other wholesale distributors as well as with the manufacturers of the products the company sells. In addition, the company competes with warehouse clubs, and the business-to-business sales divisions of national business products resellers.
Essendant competes primarily on the basis of breadth of product lines, availability of products, speed of delivery, order fill rates, net pricing to customers, and the quality of marketing and other value-added services.
Employees[edit]
As of February 13, 2015, Essendant employed approximately 6,500 people.
Officers[edit]
The current officers of the company include:[2]

Richard D. Phillips, interim President and Chief Executive Officer[3]
Janet Zelenka, Senior Vice President - Chief Financial Officer and Chief Information Officer
Eric A. Blanchard, Senior Vice President - General Counsel & Secretary
Ric Phillips, President of Industrial
Carole Tomko, Senior Vice President - Chief Human Resources Officer

History[edit]
Essendant was incorporated in 1922 under the name Utility Supply Company. During the early 1930s, the company published its first office products catalog. The concept was such a success that the business was further expanded with the opening of its first retail store in 1937. In the early 1950s, in addition to its catalog and retail operation, management recognized growing opportunities in the office products wholesale business. In 1970, the company opened its first state-of-the-art distribution center. As time passed, the company found it difficult to compete as both a retailer and wholesaler. So, in 1978, the retail operations were sold and the company began to operate exclusively as an office products wholesaler.
To provide the capital to further its growth, Essendant incorporated and then went public in 1981 as United Stationers Inc. (USTR) on the NASDAQ. In 1984, the company established MicroUnited to capitalize on the growth in the computer supplies sector. The company's MicroUnited division focused on the distribution of peripherals and supplies to computer products resellers. Essendant recognized that its marketing programs and distribution infrastructure would be attractive to customers within other industries.
In June 2002, the company announced that, as part of its succession plan, Richard W. Gochnauer, 52, would become the company's chief operating officer and a member of the board of directors, when he joined the company on July 22.[4]
In December 2010, the company announced that P. Cody Phipps, the company's Chief Operating Officer, would become president and CEO when Richard W. Gochnauer, CEO, retired at the annual shareholders’ meeting in May 2011.[5]
In April 2015, the company announced the departure of P. Cody Phipps, the company's Chief Executive Officer, and Director Robert Blaine Aiken Jr. would take over as interim CEO.
In early 2015, the company announced the re-branding of the company to Essendant from United Stationers. The new company name became effective in June 2015. The company's symbol on the NASDAQ Global Select Market changed from USTR to ESND.[6]
July 22, 2015 Essendant announced that its Board of Directors appointed Robert B. Aiken Jr., president and CEO effective immediately. Mr. Aiken, who was serving as interim president and CEO since May 2015, would also continue as an Essendant Board member.[3]

Mergers & Acquisitions[7][edit]
To expand their line of business, on October 31, 1996 the company acquired Lagasse Bros., Inc., a wholesaler of janitorial and sanitation supplies.
As competition in the late 1980s intensified within the office products industry, consolidation at all levels of the industry became commonplace. In June 1992, the company acquired Stationers Distributing Company, a $425 million office products wholesaler in Fort Worth, Texas. This transaction made the company a $1.5 billion wholesale distributor.
In March 1995, the company was acquired by Associated Stationers, a $475 million general line wholesaler.
On April 3, 1998, the company acquired Azerty, a $350 million wholesaler of computer consumables. Azerty was founded in April 1983 by Marvin Frackt as the US subsidiary of Inter City Papers Limited of Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Bill Dueger was the first manager of Azerty, reporting to Marvin Frackt. Subsequently, the company's MicroUnited division was merged into Azerty. In July 2000, Essendant increased its geographic penetration in Canada by purchasing Azerty Canada, a $115 million computer consumables business.
To broaden the Lagasse division's reach, the company completed the acquisition of Peerless Paper, a $75 million wholesaler in the janitorial/sanitation industry, in January 2001.[8]
In May 2005, Lagasse completed the purchase of Sweet Paper, a $250 million distributor of janitorial/sanitation, paper and food service products.[9] This acquisition expanded Lagasse's product line and enhanced its scale and infrastructure in key markets.
On March 31, 2006, the company decided to sell its Canadian division. In June 2006, it completed the sale of certain assets associated with its Canadian division.
To diversify and expand its product and customer base, the company acquired ORS Nasco, a $285 million wholesale distributor of industrial supplies, on December 21, 2007.[10]
On March 1, 2010 the company acquired their first technology company, privately owned MBS Dev, a Colorado-based software provider.[11]
In November 2012, the company signed a stock purchase agreement to acquire 100% of the outstanding shares of O.K.I. Supply Co. (O.K.I.) for an all-cash purchase price of $90 million.[12]
On May 29, 2014, the company announced that its wholly owned subsidiary, United Stationers Supply Co., signed an agreement to acquire 100 percent of the outstanding shares of CPO Commerce, Inc., for an all-cash purchase price of $30 million, with up to an additional $10 million to be paid in three years based on performance.[13]
On October 31, 2014, the company completed the acquisition of Liberty Bell Equipment Corporation, a United States wholesaler of auto aftermarket tools and supplies, and its affiliates (collectively, "MEDCO") including G2S Equipment de Fabrication et d'Entretien ULC ("G2S"), a Canadian wholesaler.[14]

On August 3, 2015, The company completed the acquisition of Nestor Sales LLC., a wholesaler and distributor of tools, equipment and supplies to the transportation industry.[16]

Products[edit]
Essendant stocks over 160,000 products in these categories:
Janitorial and Breakroom Supplies: Essendant holds over 25,000 items in the following areas: Janitorial supplies (cleaners and cleaning accessories), breakroom items (food and beverage products), food service consumables (such as disposable cups, plates and utensils), safety and security items, and paper and packaging supplies.
Technology Products: Essendent stocks over 10,000 items including imaging supplies, data storage, digital cameras, computer accessories and computer hardware items including printers and other peripherals.
Traditional Office Products: Essendant is one of the largest national wholesale distributors of a broad range of office supplies. It carries approximately 23,000 brand name and private label products such as filing and record storage products, business machines, presentation products, writing instruments, paper products, shipping and mailing supplies, calendars and general office accessories.
Industrial Supplies: Essendant carries approximately 100,000 industrial items including hand and power tools, safety and security supplies, janitorial equipment and supplies, various industrial MRO (maintenance, repair and operations) items, oil field and welding supplies, and automotive aftermarket tools and equipment.
Office Furniture: Essendant is one of the largest office furniture wholesale distributors in the U.S. It stocks approximately 4,000 products including desks, filing and storage solutions, seating and systems furniture, along with a variety of products for niche markets such as education, government, healthcare and professional services.
Customers[edit]
Essendant serves a diverse group of approximately 30,000 reseller customers. They include independent office products dealers, contract stationers, office products superstores, computer products resellers, office furniture dealers, mass merchandisers, mail order companies, sanitary supply, paper and food service distributors, drug and grocery store chains, healthcare distributors, e-commerce merchants, oil field, welding supply and industrial/MRO distributors, automotive aftermarket dealers and wholesalers and other independent distributors.
Marketing & Customer Support[edit]
Essendant provides value-added services designed to help their customers market their products and services while improving operating efficiencies and reducing costs.
The company provides comprehensive printed catalogs for easy shopping as well as reference guides to more promotional materials. Extensive digital content and capabilities are provided to better position resellers on the internet. This ranges from a content database digitized for e-commerce to advanced eBusiness capabilities, website development, analytics and digital promotional campaigns. Essendant produces the printed and digital assets on behalf of resellers and collects fees and/or advertising revenue from them in return.
Essendant also provides specific services that enable resellers to improve their business model. These include primary research efforts, brand strategy and development, campaign creation, customer segmentation, cost management and training programs designed to help resellers improve their sales and marketing techniques.
Distribution[edit]
Essendant's distribution network enables the company to ship most products overnight to more than 90% of the U.S. and next day delivery to major cities in Canada, with an average line fill rate of approximately 97%. Essendant's domestic operations generate approximately $5.1 billion of its approximate $5.3 billion in 2014 consolidated net sales, with its international operations contributing another $0.2 billion to 2014 net sales. Efficient order processing resulted in a 99.7% order accuracy rate for the year.
Essendant's network of 75 distribution centers is spread across the nation to facilitate delivery. It has a dedicated fleet of approximately 475 trucks. This enables the company to make direct deliveries to resellers from regional distribution centers and local distribution points.
The "Wrap and Label" program is another service provided to resellers. It gives resellers the option to receive individually packaged orders that are ready to be delivered to their end consumers. For example, when a reseller places orders for several individual consumers, Essendant can pick and pack the items separately, placing a label on each package with the consumer's name, ready for delivery by the reseller, to the end consumer. Resellers benefit from the "Wrap and Label" program because it eliminates the need to break down bulk shipments and repackage orders before delivering them to their end-consumer.
Competition[edit]
The markets in which Essendant participates are highly competitive. The company competes with other wholesale distributors as well as with the manufacturers of the products the company sells. In addition, the company competes with warehouse clubs, and the business-to-business sales divisions of national business products resellers.
Essendant competes primarily on the basis of breadth of product lines, availability of products, speed of delivery, order fill rates, net pricing to customers, and the quality of marketing and other value-added services.
Employees[edit]
As of February 13, 2015, Essendant employed approximately 6,500 people.
Officers[edit]
The current officers of the company include:[2]

Richard D. Phillips, interim President and Chief Executive Officer[3]
Janet Zelenka, Senior Vice President - Chief Financial Officer and Chief Information Officer
Eric A. Blanchard, Senior Vice President - General Counsel & Secretary
Ric Phillips, President of Industrial
Carole Tomko, Senior Vice President - Chief Human Resources Officer

History[edit]
Essendant was incorporated in 1922 under the name Utility Supply Company. During the early 1930s, the company published its first office products catalog. The concept was such a success that the business was further expanded with the opening of its first retail store in 1937. In the early 1950s, in addition to its catalog and retail operation, management recognized growing opportunities in the office products wholesale business. In 1970, the company opened its first state-of-the-art distribution center. As time passed, the company found it difficult to compete as both a retailer and wholesaler. So, in 1978, the retail operations were sold and the company began to operate exclusively as an office products wholesaler.
To provide the capital to further its growth, Essendant incorporated and then went public in 1981 as United Stationers Inc. (USTR) on the NASDAQ. In 1984, the company established MicroUnited to capitalize on the growth in the computer supplies sector. The company's MicroUnited division focused on the distribution of peripherals and supplies to computer products resellers. Essendant recognized that its marketing programs and distribution infrastructure would be attractive to customers within other industries.
In June 2002, the company announced that, as part of its succession plan, Richard W. Gochnauer, 52, would become the company's chief operating officer and a member of the board of directors, when he joined the company on July 22.[4]
In December 2010, the company announced that P. Cody Phipps, the company's Chief Operating Officer, would become president and CEO when Richard W. Gochnauer, CEO, retired at the annual shareholders’ meeting in May 2011.[5]
In April 2015, the company announced the departure of P. Cody Phipps, the company's Chief Executive Officer, and Director Robert Blaine Aiken Jr. would take over as interim CEO.
In early 2015, the company announced the re-branding of the company to Essendant from United Stationers. The new company name became effective in June 2015. The company's symbol on the NASDAQ Global Select Market changed from USTR to ESND.[6]
July 22, 2015 Essendant announced that its Board of Directors appointed Robert B. Aiken Jr., president and CEO effective immediately. Mr. Aiken, who was serving as interim president and CEO since May 2015, would also continue as an Essendant Board member.[3]

Mergers & Acquisitions[7][edit]
To expand their line of business, on October 31, 1996 the company acquired Lagasse Bros., Inc., a wholesaler of janitorial and sanitation supplies.
As competition in the late 1980s intensified within the office products industry, consolidation at all levels of the industry became commonplace. In June 1992, the company acquired Stationers Distributing Company, a $425 million office products wholesaler in Fort Worth, Texas. This transaction made the company a $1.5 billion wholesale distributor.
In March 1995, the company was acquired by Associated Stationers, a $475 million general line wholesaler.
On April 3, 1998, the company acquired Azerty, a $350 million wholesaler of computer consumables. Azerty was founded in April 1983 by Marvin Frackt as the US subsidiary of Inter City Papers Limited of Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Bill Dueger was the first manager of Azerty, reporting to Marvin Frackt. Subsequently, the company's MicroUnited division was merged into Azerty. In July 2000, Essendant increased its geographic penetration in Canada by purchasing Azerty Canada, a $115 million computer consumables business.
To broaden the Lagasse division's reach, the company completed the acquisition of Peerless Paper, a $75 million wholesaler in the janitorial/sanitation industry, in January 2001.[8]
In May 2005, Lagasse completed the purchase of Sweet Paper, a $250 million distributor of janitorial/sanitation, paper and food service products.[9] This acquisition expanded Lagasse's product line and enhanced its scale and infrastructure in key markets.
On March 31, 2006, the company decided to sell its Canadian division. In June 2006, it completed the sale of certain assets associated with its Canadian division.
To diversify and expand its product and customer base, the company acquired ORS Nasco, a $285 million wholesale distributor of industrial supplies, on December 21, 2007.[10]
On March 1, 2010 the company acquired their first technology company, privately owned MBS Dev, a Colorado-based software provider.[11]

Press Release








Essendant Reports Second Quarter 2017 Results
Company Release - 7/26/2017 4:24 PM ET




DEERFIELD, Ill., July 26, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Essendant Inc. (NASDAQ: ESND), a leading national wholesale distributor of workplace items, today announced financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2017.  Key results for second quarter 2017 were as follows:



Second Quarter 2017 Summary

Revenue declined 6.9% to $1.3 billion, compared to $1.4 billion in the prior year quarter
GAAP diluted earnings per share in the quarter of $0.14 decreased compared to $0.35 in the prior year quarter
Adjusted diluted earnings per share(1) of $0.28 in the quarter increased sequentially from the first quarter of 2017, but decreased compared to $0.55 in the prior year quarter
Free cash flow(1) was $67.4 million in the quarter and $112.1 million in the first six months of 2017
"We made good progress advancing our merchandising and pricing initiatives, and our industrial products category delivered growth for the second quarter in a row.  However, this was offset by top line pressure that is reflective of persistent industry challenges," stated Ric Phillips, interim president and chief executive officer of Essendant.  "In light of this pressure, we will continue to advance our transformation initiatives, and we will look to build on and accelerate our transformation in the second half of 2017."
Second Quarter Performance

Net sales decreased 6.9% in comparison to the prior year quarter, driven principally by reduced sales in technology, JanSan and traditional office products categories, partly offset by growth in cut-sheet paper and industrial products categories. Net sales by product category were:

JanSan Products: revenues of $339.4 million, a decrease of $(32.0) million or 8.6%, primarily driven by declines in the national retail channel.
Technology Products: revenues of $300.2 million, a decrease of $(42.6) million or 12.4%, as a result of reduced supplier promotions and declines in the national retail channel and the independent dealer channels.
Traditional Office Products: revenues of $181.3 million, a decrease of $(21.2) million or 10.5%, due to sales declines in the independent dealer channel and the national retail channel.
Industrial Products: revenues of $145.6 million, an increase of $2.4 million or 1.7%, due to growth initiatives and energy market recovery.
Cut-sheet Paper Products: revenues of $106.3 million, an increase of $4.8 million or 4.7%, primarily driven by independent dealer channel sales increases.
Automotive Products: revenues of $82.1 million, an increase of $1.6 million or 2.0%, driven by growth initiatives.
Office Furniture: revenues of $67.9 million, a decrease of $(6.7) million or 9.0%, primarily driven by sales declines in the independent dealer channel. 
Gross profit was $177.6 million, a decline of $(18.3) million versus the prior year quarter. The decline was the result of lower sales volumes, $(12.3) million with the remainder of the decline primarily driven by lower supplier allowances. Sales volume and supplier allowance declines more than offset the benefits of merchandising and pricing actions related to our transformation initiatives.
Operating expenses were $161.7 million, a decrease from $169.4 million in the prior year quarter resulting from prior year pension settlement expense of $11.7 million, creating a favorable comparison, partially offset by current year quarter transformational expenses of $(5.4) million, and litigation accruals of $(3.0) million, reflecting an agreement to resolve a litigation matter. Adjusted operating expenses were $153.3 million, a decrease of $4.4 million, which was primarily driven by overall cost containment actions including decreased variable labor expenses, partially offset by a reset of management incentives.
Income tax expense was $4.5 million in the second quarter of 2017, a decline from $7.8 million in the prior year quarter due to lower pretax income, partially offset by the impact of adopting new accounting guidance related to share-based compensation.
GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.14 compared to $0.35 in the quarter last year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share(1) were $0.28 compared to $0.55 in the quarter last year.
Free cash flow totaled $67.4 million in the quarter, reflecting continued working capital management and the timing of inventory receipts. Utilization of free cash flow from lower inventories drove a reduction in long-term debt of $60.5 million during the quarter.
Outlook for 2017

In light of the first half sales results, we anticipate full year 2017 sales to decline 6% to 9% from 2016
Similar to our experience in the first half of 2017, we expect the range of 2017 sales decline to affect our second half adjusted diluted earnings per share(1).
Based on strong cash flow generation in the first half of 2017, free cash flow(1) generation is expected to be in excess of $90 million for the full year 2017

Essendant Inc. and Subsidiaries Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures Adjusted Operating Expenses, Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share, Adjusted EBITDA, and Free Cash Flow 
The Non-GAAP table below presents Adjusted Operating Expenses, Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share, Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands, except per share data). These non-GAAP measures exclude certain non-recurring items and exclude other items that do not reflect the Company's ongoing operations and are included to provide investors with useful information about the financial performance of our business. The presented non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for the comparable GAAP financial measures. The non-GAAP financial measures do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP, and these non-GAAP financial measures should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP financial measures.
In order to calculate the non-GAAP measures, management excludes the following items to the extent they occur in the reporting period, to facilitate the comparison of current and prior year results and ongoing operations, as management believes these items do not reflect the underlying cost structure of our business. These items can vary significantly in amount and frequency.

Restructuring charges. Workforce reduction and facility closure charges such as employee termination costs, facility closure and consolidation costs, and other costs directly associated with shifting business strategies or business conditions that are part of a restructuring program. Restructuring actions were taken in 2015 to improve our operational utilization, labor spend, inventory performance and functional alignment of the organization. This included workforce reductions and facility consolidations with an expense impact of $0.3 million in the six months ended June 30, 2016.
Gain or loss on sale of assets or businesses. Sales of assets, such as buildings or equipment, and businesses can cause gains or losses. These transactions occur as the Company is repositioning its business and reviewing its cost structure.
Severance costs for operating leadership. Employee termination costs related to members of the Company's operating leadership team are excluded as they are based upon individual agreements.
Asset impairments.  Changes in strategy or macroeconomic events may cause asset impairments.In the six months ended June 30, 2017, the Company recorded an impairment of goodwill of $198.8 million, based on a decline in market capitalization.
Other actions.  Actions, which may be non-recurring events, that result from the changing strategies and needs of the Company and do not reflect the underlying expense of the on-going business. These include charges related to litigation totaling $3.0 million and $9.0 million, respectively, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 and transformational expenses totaling $5.4 million and $8.4 million, respectively, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017. In the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, other actions included a settlement charge of $11.7 million related to a defined benefit plan settlement. 
Adjusted operating expenses and adjusted operating income. Adjusted operating expenses and adjusted operating income provide management and our investors with an understanding of the results from the primary operations of our business by excluding the effects of items described above that do not reflect the ordinary expenses and earnings of our operations. Adjusted operating expenses and adjusted operating income are used to evaluate our period-over-period operating performance as they are more comparable measures of our continuing business. These measures may be useful to an investor in evaluating the underlying operating performance of our business.
Adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share. Adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share provide a more comparable view of our Company's underlying performance and trends than the comparable GAAP measures. Net income and diluted earnings per share are adjusted for the effect of items described above that do not reflect the ordinary earnings of our operations. 
Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). Adjusted EBITDA is helpful in evaluating our operating performance and is used by management for various purposes, including as a measure of performance and as a basis for strategic planning and forecasting. Net income is adjusted for the effect of interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation expense. Management believes that adjusted EBITDA is also commonly used by investors to evaluate operating performance between competitors because it helps reduce variability caused by differences in capital structures, income taxes, stock-based compensation accounting policies, and depreciation and amortization policies. 
Free cash flow. Free cash flow is useful to management and our investors as it is a measure of the Company's liquidity. It provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our cash flows than the comparable GAAP measure. Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities and net cash provided by (used in) investing activities are aggregated and adjusted to exclude the impact of acquisitions, net of cash acquired and divestitures. 
Outlook. Adjusted diluted earnings per share and free cash flow are non-GAAP measures. A quantitative reconciliation of our non-GAAP guidance to the corresponding GAAP information is not available because the non-GAAP guidance excludes certain GAAP information that is uncertain and difficult to predict. The adjusted diluted EPS guidance excludes expenses of $(0.14) and $(5.50) per share in the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, respectively, related to goodwill impairment, litigation charges and transformational expenses. Actual amounts for these expenses appear in the non-GAAP table included later in this section. For the remainder of the year, the factors that will be excluded are currently unknown due to the level of unpredictability and uncertainty associated with these items, but may include actions such as future restructuring charges, gain or loss on future sales of assets or businesses, cash flow impacts of acquisitions, and other actions.

Press Release








Essendant Reports Fourth Quarter And Full Year 2016 Results
Company Release - 2/27/2017 4:30 PM ET




DEERFIELD, Ill., Feb. 27, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Essendant Inc. (NASDAQ: ESND), a leading national wholesale distributor of workplace items, today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2016.  Key results for fourth quarter and full year 2016 were as follows:



Full Year 2016 Summary

Revenue, workday adjusted, declined 0.3% year-over-year, to $5.4 billion 
GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.73 compared to loss per share of $1.18 in 2015, including a $115.8 million, or $3.04 per share, impairment in the fourth quarter of 2015 
Adjusted diluted earnings per share(1) of $1.54 compared to $3.08 in 2015, including the recognition of a $13.3 million allowance on receivables from one customer in 2016 which impacted adjusted earnings per share by $0.22 in 2016 
Free cash flow(1) totaled $127.2 million compared to $134.7 million in 2015 
In February 2017, the Company replaced two of its financing agreements with a new credit agreement to provide greater liquidity and capital availability
Fourth Quarter 2016 Summary

Revenue, workday adjusted, decreased 3.3% compared to fourth quarter last year, to $1.3 billion 
GAAP net loss of ($2.4) million compared to a net loss of ($95.8) million in the prior year quarter 
GAAP diluted loss per share of ($0.06) compared to loss of ($2.61) per share in the prior year quarter, including a $3.04 per share impairment in 2015 
Adjusted operating income(1) of $3.3 million compared to $54.1 million fourth quarter last year including the recognition of a $13.3 million allowance on receivables from one customer in 2016 
Adjusted diluted loss per share(1) of ($0.02) compared to earnings per share of $0.81 fourth quarter last year, including earnings per share impact in 2016 of the allowance on receivable for one customer of $0.22 
"We continued to move aggressively in the fourth quarter to advance our transformation program and strengthen our balance sheet as we reposition Essendant to drive earnings growth," said Robert B. Aiken, Jr., president and chief executive officer of Essendant.
"While recognizing persistent industry headwinds, we are confident that our actions will position Essendant to deliver greater value to our shareholders, customers, suppliers and associates in the years ahead. Our actions are centered upon driving merchandising excellence through better sourcing and assortment and stronger alignment of our pricing with cost to serve. We are also intensely focused on winning back lost revenue in the JanSan distributor channel, diversifying and growing our industrial channel, driving productivity and cost reductions and further reducing our working capital.  We expect these actions will enable us to deliver sequential improvement in our results throughout 2017." 
Fourth Quarter Performance

Net sales, workday adjusted, decreased 3.3% year-over-year, driven principally by reduced sales in our JanSan, traditional office products, and technology products categories, partly offset by growth in our cut-sheet paper product category

JanSan: decreased $17.9 million, or 5.1%, to $332.7 million 
Technology Products: decreased $8.1 million, or 2.5%, to $309.7 million 
Traditional Office Products: decreased $14.3 million, or 7.0% to $190.8 million 
Industrial Supplies: decreased $3.6 million, or 2.6%, to $138.4 million 
Cut-sheet Paper Products: increased $10.6 million, or 11.9% to $99.8 million 
Automotive: decreased $2.1 million, or 2.7%, to $78.0 million 
Office Furniture: decreased $6.5 million, or 8.8%, to $67.3 million
Gross profit was $165.1 million, a decline of $35.7 million from $200.8 million in the prior year quarter resulting from:

Shifts in customer channel and product category mix, down $18.9 million 
Lower supplier allowances due primarily to lower purchases, down $13.9 million 
Higher freight cost, up $3.5 million
Operating expenses were $166.8 million, a decline from $280.1 million in the prior year quarter resulting from:

Fourth quarter 2015 impairment of certain Industrial (formerly ORS Industrial) assets of $115.8 million and work force reduction and facility closures charges of $12.1 million 
Increased litigation accruals in the fourth quarter 2016 of $4.0 million 
Recognition of an allowance on receivables from one customer totaling $13.3 million in the fourth quarter 2016
Income tax benefit was $4.1 million in the fourth quarter 2016 as compared to expense of $11.9 million in the prior year due to diminished operating results in 2016, exclusive of 2015 impairment, other non-deductible charges, and the utilization of a capital loss carryforward. 
Loss per share was ($0.06) per share compared to a loss per share of ($2.61) per share fourth quarter last year. Adjusted loss per share(1) was ($0.02) compared to earnings per share of $0.81 fourth quarter last year 
Outlook for 2017The following outlooks exclude the impacts of any new acquisitions or unusual charges.

Net sales expected to be flat to down 4% 
First quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share(1) are expected to be similar to Q4 2016, and we expect to generate sequential improvement in adjusted diluted earnings per share throughout 2017 apart from any impact of the allowances on receivables from the customer referred to above 
Free cash flow(1) generation expected to be in the range of $50 million to $70 million

Essendant Inc. and SubsidiariesReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresAdjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Operating Expenses, Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share, Adjusted EBITDA, and Free Cash Flow 
The Non-GAAP table below presents Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Operating Expenses, Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share, Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow for the three months and years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. These non-GAAP measures exclude certain non-recurring items and exclude other items that do not reflect the Company's ongoing operations and are included to provide investors with useful information about the financial performance of our business. The presented non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for the comparable GAAP financial measures. The non-GAAP financial measures do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP, and these non-GAAP financial measures should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP financial measures.
In order to calculate the non-GAAP measures, management excludes the following items to facilitate the comparison of current and prior year results and ongoing operations, as management believes these items do not reflect the underlying cost structure of our business.  These items can vary significantly in amount and frequency. 

Restructuring charges. Workforce reduction and facility closure charges such as employee termination costs, facility closure and consolidation costs, and other costs directly associated with shifting business strategies or business conditions that are part of a restructuring program. The Company commenced two such restructuring programs during 2015 and incurred adjustments of the related accruals in 2016.   
Gain or loss on sale of assets or businesses. Sales of assets, such as buildings or equipment, and businesses can cause gains or losses. These transactions occur as the Company is repositioning its business and reviewing its cost structure. The Company recognized a gain on the sale of its City of Industry facility in the year ended December 31, 2016, a loss on the sale and related impairment of intangible assets of the operations in Mexico in 2015, and a loss on the sale and related impairment of intangible assets of its software subsidiary in 2014, recording an impairment of the seller notes in the year ended December 31, 2015. Due to the sale of the City of Industry facility, the Company was able to utilize its capital loss carryforwards. This utilization resulted in the release of the valuation allowance previously established against the deferred tax asset.   
Severance costs for operating leadership.  Employee termination costs related to members of the Company's operating leadership team are excluded as they are based upon individual agreements.  Two operating leaders were severed from the Company during 2016, which were not part of a restructuring program.  
Asset impairments.  Changes in strategy or macroeconomic events may cause asset impairments.  The Company recorded impairment and accelerated amortization of its trademarks upon the announcement of its rebranding effort in 2015. The Company recorded impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, as well as an increase in reserves for obsolete inventory, based on a strategic review of the Industrial business unit in 2015.  
Other actions.  Actions, which may be non-recurring events, that result from the changing strategies and needs of the Company and do not reflect the underlying expense of the on-going business. These charges include items such as charges related to the defined benefit plan settlement, charges related to litigation, the tax impact of the dividend from a foreign subsidiary and reserves related to discrete prior year uncertain tax provisions in 2016.
Adjusted gross profit, adjusted operating expenses and adjusted operating income. Adjusted gross profit, adjusted operating expenses and adjusted operating income provide management and our investors with an understanding of the results from the primary operations of our business by excluding the effects of items described above that do not reflect the ordinary expenses and earnings of our operations. Adjusted gross profit, adjusted operating expenses and adjusted operating income are used to evaluate our period-over-period operating performance as they are more comparable measures of our continuing business. These measures may be useful to an investor in evaluating the underlying operating performance of our business.
Adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share. Adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share provide a more comparable view of our Company's underlying performance and trends than the comparable GAAP measures. Net income and diluted earnings per share are adjusted for the effect of items described above that do not reflect the ordinary earnings of our operations. 
Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). Adjusted EBITDA is helpful in evaluating our operating performance and is used by management for various purposes, including as a measure of performance and as a basis for strategic planning and forecasting. Net income is adjusted for the effect of interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation expense. Management believes that adjusted EBITDA is also commonly used by investors to evaluate operating performance between competitors because it helps reduce variability caused by differences in capital structures, income taxes, stock-based compensation accounting policies, and depreciation and amortization policies. 
Free cash flow. Free cash flow is useful to management and our investors as it is a measure of the Company's liquidity. It provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our cash flows than the comparable GAAP measure. Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities and net cash provided by (used in) investing activities are aggregated and adjusted to exclude the impact of acquisitions, net of cash acquired and divestitures. 
Outlook. Adjusted diluted earnings per share and free cash flow are a non-GAAP measures. A quantitative reconciliation of our non-GAAP guidance to the corresponding GAAP information is not available because the non-GAAP guidance excludes certain GAAP information that is uncertain and difficult to predict. The factors that will be excluded are currently unknown due to the level of unpredictability and uncertainty associated with these items, but may include actions such as gain or loss on future sales of assets or businesses, future restructuring charges, non-GAAP tax adjustments, cash flow impacts of acquisitions, and other actions.

Press Release








Essendant Reports Second Quarter 2017 Results
Company Release - 7/26/2017 4:24 PM ET




DEERFIELD, Ill., July 26, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Essendant Inc. (NASDAQ: ESND), a leading national wholesale distributor of workplace items, today announced financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2017.  Key results for second quarter 2017 were as follows:



Second Quarter 2017 Summary

Revenue declined 6.9% to $1.3 billion, compared to $1.4 billion in the prior year quarter
GAAP diluted earnings per share in the quarter of $0.14 decreased compared to $0.35 in the prior year quarter
Adjusted diluted earnings per share(1) of $0.28 in the quarter increased sequentially from the first quarter of 2017, but decreased compared to $0.55 in the prior year quarter
Free cash flow(1) was $67.4 million in the quarter and $112.1 million in the first six months of 2017
"We made good progress advancing our merchandising and pricing initiatives, and our industrial products category delivered growth for the second quarter in a row.  However, this was offset by top line pressure that is reflective of persistent industry challenges," stated Ric Phillips, interim president and chief executive officer of Essendant.  "In light of this pressure, we will continue to advance our transformation initiatives, and we will look to build on and accelerate our transformation in the second half of 2017."
Second Quarter Performance

Net sales decreased 6.9% in comparison to the prior year quarter, driven principally by reduced sales in technology, JanSan and traditional office products categories, partly offset by growth in cut-sheet paper and industrial products categories. Net sales by product category were:

JanSan Products: revenues of $339.4 million, a decrease of $(32.0) million or 8.6%, primarily driven by declines in the national retail channel.
Technology Products: revenues of $300.2 million, a decrease of $(42.6) million or 12.4%, as a result of reduced supplier promotions and declines in the national retail channel and the independent dealer channels.
Traditional Office Products: revenues of $181.3 million, a decrease of $(21.2) million or 10.5%, due to sales declines in the independent dealer channel and the national retail channel.
Industrial Products: revenues of $145.6 million, an increase of $2.4 million or 1.7%, due to growth initiatives and energy market recovery.
Cut-sheet Paper Products: revenues of $106.3 million, an increase of $4.8 million or 4.7%, primarily driven by independent dealer channel sales increases.
Automotive Products: revenues of $82.1 million, an increase of $1.6 million or 2.0%, driven by growth initiatives.
Office Furniture: revenues of $67.9 million, a decrease of $(6.7) million or 9.0%, primarily driven by sales declines in the independent dealer channel. 
Gross profit was $177.6 million, a decline of $(18.3) million versus the prior year quarter. The decline was the result of lower sales volumes, $(12.3) million with the remainder of the decline primarily driven by lower supplier allowances. Sales volume and supplier allowance declines more than offset the benefits of merchandising and pricing actions related to our transformation initiatives.
Operating expenses were $161.7 million, a decrease from $169.4 million in the prior year quarter resulting from prior year pension settlement expense of $11.7 million, creating a favorable comparison, partially offset by current year quarter transformational expenses of $(5.4) million, and litigation accruals of $(3.0) million, reflecting an agreement to resolve a litigation matter. Adjusted operating expenses were $153.3 million, a decrease of $4.4 million, which was primarily driven by overall cost containment actions including decreased variable labor expenses, partially offset by a reset of management incentives.
Income tax expense was $4.5 million in the second quarter of 2017, a decline from $7.8 million in the prior year quarter due to lower pretax income, partially offset by the impact of adopting new accounting guidance related to share-based compensation.
GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.14 compared to $0.35 in the quarter last year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share(1) were $0.28 compared to $0.55 in the quarter last year.
Free cash flow totaled $67.4 million in the quarter, reflecting continued working capital management and the timing of inventory receipts. Utilization of free cash flow from lower inventories drove a reduction in long-term debt of $60.5 million during the quarter.
Outlook for 2017

In light of the first half sales results, we anticipate full year 2017 sales to decline 6% to 9% from 2016
Similar to our experience in the first half of 2017, we expect the range of 2017 sales decline to affect our second half adjusted diluted earnings per share(1).
Based on strong cash flow generation in the first half of 2017, free cash flow(1) generation is expected to be in excess of $90 million for the full year 2017

Essendant Inc. and Subsidiaries Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures Adjusted Operating Expenses, Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share, Adjusted EBITDA, and Free Cash Flow 
The Non-GAAP table below presents Adjusted Operating Expenses, Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share, Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands, except per share data). These non-GAAP measures exclude certain non-recurring items and exclude other items that do not reflect the Company's ongoing operations and are included to provide investors with useful information about the financial performance of our business. The presented non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for the comparable GAAP financial measures. The non-GAAP financial measures do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP, and these non-GAAP financial measures should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP financial measures.
In order to calculate the non-GAAP measures, management excludes the following items to the extent they occur in the reporting period, to facilitate the comparison of current and prior year results and ongoing operations, as management believes these items do not reflect the underlying cost structure of our business. These items can vary significantly in amount and frequency.

Restructuring charges. Workforce reduction and facility closure charges such as employee termination costs, facility closure and consolidation costs, and other costs directly associated with shifting business strategies or business conditions that are part of a restructuring program. Restructuring actions were taken in 2015 to improve our operational utilization, labor spend, inventory performance and functional alignment of the organization. This included workforce reductions and facility consolidations with an expense impact of $0.3 million in the six months ended June 30, 2016.
Gain or loss on sale of assets or businesses. Sales of assets, such as buildings or equipment, and businesses can cause gains or losses. These transactions occur as the Company is repositioning its business and reviewing its cost structure.
Severance costs for operating leadership. Employee termination costs related to members of the Company's operating leadership team are excluded as they are based upon individual agreements.
Asset impairments.  Changes in strategy or macroeconomic events may cause asset impairments.In the six months ended June 30, 2017, the Company recorded an impairment of goodwill of $198.8 million, based on a decline in market capitalization.
Other actions.  Actions, which may be non-recurring events, that result from the changing strategies and needs of the Company and do not reflect the underlying expense of the on-going business. These include charges related to litigation totaling $3.0 million and $9.0 million, respectively, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 and transformational expenses totaling $5.4 million and $8.4 million, respectively, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017. In the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, other actions included a settlement charge of $11.7 million related to a defined benefit plan settlement. 
Adjusted operating expenses and adjusted operating income. Adjusted operating expenses and adjusted operating income provide management and our investors with an understanding of the results from the primary operations of our business by excluding the effects of items described above that do not reflect the ordinary expenses and earnings of our operations. Adjusted operating expenses and adjusted operating income are used to evaluate our period-over-period operating performance as they are more comparable measures of our continuing business. These measures may be useful to an investor in evaluating the underlying operating performance of our business.
Adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share. Adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share provide a more comparable view of our Company's underlying performance and trends than the comparable GAAP measures. Net income and diluted earnings per share are adjusted for the effect of items described above that do not reflect the ordinary earnings of our operations. 
Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). Adjusted EBITDA is helpful in evaluating our operating performance and is used by management for various purposes, including as a measure of performance and as a basis for strategic planning and forecasting. Net income is adjusted for the effect of interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation expense. Management believes that adjusted EBITDA is also commonly used by investors to evaluate operating performance between competitors because it helps reduce variability caused by differences in capital structures, income taxes, stock-based compensation accounting policies, and depreciation and amortization policies. 
Free cash flow. Free cash flow is useful to management and our investors as it is a measure of the Company's liquidity. It provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our cash flows than the comparable GAAP measure. Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities and net cash provided by (used in) investing activities are aggregated and adjusted to exclude the impact of acquisitions, net of cash acquired and divestitures. 
Outlook. Adjusted diluted earnings per share and free cash flow are non-GAAP measures. A quantitative reconciliation of our non-GAAP guidance to the corresponding GAAP information is not available because the non-GAAP guidance excludes certain GAAP information that is uncertain and difficult to predict. The adjusted diluted EPS guidance excludes expenses of $(0.14) and $(5.50) per share in the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, respectively, related to goodwill impairment, litigation charges and transformational expenses. Actual amounts for these expenses appear in the non-GAAP table included later in this section. For the remainder of the year, the factors that will be excluded are currently unknown due to the level of unpredictability and uncertainty associated with these items, but may include actions such as future restructuring charges, gain or loss on future sales of assets or businesses, cash flow impacts of acquisitions, and other actions.
