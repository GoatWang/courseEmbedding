ABS Capital Partners














 » About Us
About Us





WE'RE HERE TO TEAM WITH EXCEPTIONAL COMPANIES AND HELP THEM ACCELERATE AT THEIR MOST IMPORTANT STAGE.                
Many successful CEOs and their companies started with a bold idea, or a better way – bent on making a game-changing impact in their industry.  Our most productive partnerships begin with CEOs who have successfully piloted their companies through their exciting first stages and are now determined to make the choices to take them further.
What may have served them best at the start may be evolving in later stage growth, and ABS Capital can serve as a guiding partner through this exciting time. We deliver years of personal experience in the same fields where we invest most: business and tech-enabled services and health care.
Here you’ll find a dedicated team (many former C-level executives themselves) eager to work with CEOs focused on doing what’s best – and most impactful – for the next stage in growth.  We focus on helping face the dreams and realities associated with helming a company beyond its initial growth spurt; we’ve faced these things ourselves.
So we carefully choose the companies and CEOs we partner with, just as they carefully choose us. Once we’ve decided to work together, we prioritize growth potential above all. Therefore, we’re comfortable taking minority or majority positions, providing capital for expansion, and delivering acquisitions or liquidity for shareholders. Whatever’s right for building enduring value.
The goal is to unleash the most potential for lasting growth.  We find this to be the best measure of success – for us and for our CEO partners.
ABS Capital. Here, we grow.

WE MAKE SURE THERE’S AN EXCELLENT FIT WITH EVERY COMPANY WE WORK WITH.
Each falls within our area of expertise and lies within our preferred stage of development. As many of us are former C-level executives, investment bankers and consultants in these industries ourselves, we bring expertise to the business and tech-enabled services and health care sectors. We further make it our business to find the most promising companies across these areas.
