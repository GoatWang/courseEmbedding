We received the award for an innovative wireless network and mobile computer project that we did for a national tire and wheel reseller. In under 9 months Accucode configured and installed a wireless network, mobile computers and thermal printers at 873 Retail Locations, 22 Warehouses, 4 Distribution Centers.In total, thousands of pieces of equipment were deployed, including: 2,400 Meraki MR16 Access Points, 1,900 Zebra (Motorola) MC9190 mobile computers, 900 Zebra GT800 Thermal barcode printers.During the project Accucode was successfully completing up to 12 installations per day, supported by an internal team of just 6 people. Field Technicians utilized Samsung cellular tablets to stay in constant contact with the project coordinators, receive the floor-plans for their upcoming install, and to send the internal support team post-install wireless surveys and photos. This process resulted in unmatched quality control during the rapid roll-out, with less than 5% of locations requiring a return visit.ProjekteRapid Inventory YouTube ChannelStartdatum: April 2012In early 2012 I started the process of moving our existing training center videos from our legacy video hosting service to YouTube.

As part of my role, I created a formal Product Management function and Kevin agreed to join my team and lead the group. I could not have hoped for a better talent. Kevin has a very rare marriage of both strategic vision and capacity for detail. He quickly can get his head around any project, technology or service, comprehend all aspects of it and assess how best to employ, or not employ, it to optimize contribution to a strategic plan. His considerations and capabilities traverse technical, business, financial, sales, operational, market and other aspects of a project; a broad nuanced perspective with tremendous capacity for detail. The best thing about having Kevin on my team was that he made my job easy. You can’t ask for much more than that.Mehr anzeigenWeniger anzeigenI had the opportunity to work with Kevin at AccuCode.

At a Glance


Provider of automotive retailing solutions for car dealers and automakers in the U.S., Canada, U.K., and Europe.
Founded in 1866 as a business forms printing company; began serving automobile dealers in 1927.
Headquartered in Dayton, Ohio, with more than 4,300 associates worldwide.
Recognized leader in customer satisfaction.


A Legacy of Product Innovation and Customer Service

									The Reynolds and Reynolds Company has a heritage of nearly 150 years of business operations - a heritage that 
									sets us apart as we build for the future.
									
									Reynolds was founded in 1866 as a forms printing company in Dayton, Ohio. We began serving the needs of automotive retailers in 
									1927 by providing standardized accounting forms for all franchised Chevrolet dealers. That one simple product made the 
									dealer's business more efficient and productive, and it made General Motors' task of analyzing sales and forecasting demand 
									much more consistent and effective. That spirit of innovation is the same spirit that has nurtured our growth over time . . . 
									from business forms in the 1920s . . . to batch processing systems in the 1960s and 70s . . . to today's sophisticated 
									dealership management systems and Web technologies.
									
									Today, Reynolds and Reynolds delivers the software, business forms and supplies, and professional services that support all 
									areas of automotive retailing for car dealers and automakers. Our solutions help improve the customer experience and help 
									make the dealer's business more efficient and profitable.
									
									Driven by our legacy of product innovation and customer service, our vision for the future is to help dealers transform their 
									business and the customer experience. That vision is anchored in the capability of the Reynolds dealership management 
									system and extends to every aspect of the dealer's retailing that affects the consumer experience, whether that's inside or 
									outside the four walls of the dealership.

Curriculum Vitae

Research Interests

One of our major research areas is centered around microorganisms that produce secondary metabolites or natural products. These compounds find widespread use including antibiotics, immunosuppressants, anticancer agents, and antiparasitic agents. The carbon skeleton core of many of these compounds are produced by polyketide synthases (PKSs). We are studying these complex fascinating biosynthetic processes at both the genetic and enzymatic level. A combination of genetic techniques, including molecular breeding and in vivo recombination, are being used to generate engineered microorganisms in which the natural biosynthetic process of interest has been diverted, in some cases through the use of catalytically efficient hybrid PKSs. In combination with chemoenzymatic approaches and precursor-directed mutasynthesis we are producing a wide range of new natural products with a variety of biological activities.

Currently we are interested in the phoslactomycin (PLMs) and fostriecin (compounds with antitumor and antifungal activity), hygromycin A and pikromycin (antibacterial activity) and prodiginines (compounds with interesting immunosuppressant, antimalarial and antitumor activities). We have been able to generate a library of more than 50 new phoslactomycins and are evaluating their biological activities. We have also discovered that the prodiginines are orally effective in the treatment of malaria in mice.

We also study the primary metabolic pathways which provide the necessary precursors for assembling natural products. We have shown that manipulation of these processes affect the ratio and yields of natural product in a fermentation process. Currently we are both deciphering the importance of competing precursor pathways in mutagenized industrial strains under fermentation conditions which produce high titers of the natural product. We are also utilizing these strains as super hosts for heterologous expression of natural product biosynthetic processes where fermentation yields from the native microorganism are a limiting factor.
Our second area of research interests is the pathway of plant and bacterial fatty acid biosynthesis, catalyzed by type II fatty acid synthases (FASs). The unique features of this pathway, and of enzyme specific to this process have attracted considerable interest as both targets for both antibiotic development and biofuel production in bacteria and transgenic plants. 3-Ketoacyl ACP synthase III (KASIII) initiates fatty acid biosynthesis in this process by catalyzing a condensation between an acyl CoA and a malonyl ACP substrate. We are actively investigating different KASIII enzymes from Staphylococci aureus, Escherichia coli, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (the organism that causes tuberculosis) and Plasmodial falciparum (the parasite responsible for malaria). We are using mutagenesis, molecular modeling, kinetic analyses and X-ray diffraction to probe the mechanism and varying substrate specificities of these enzymes. We have crystallized and solved the structure of the M. tuberculosis KASIII, believed to play a critical role in initiating mycolate biosynthesis in this pathogenic microorganism. We have designed and synthesized several series of selective synthetic KASIII inhibitors and are using techniques such as molecular modeling and X-ray crystallography with a long term goal of developing these into a new generation of antimalarial, antibacterial and antituberculosis drugs.

It was in these earlier roles that Kevin established himself as a leader amongst his peers who respected the professional manner with which he conducted himself.

Kevin's initial district posed several leadership challenges that he confronted head on. These included a history of poor performance and significant market events that impacted his primary products. During this challenging time Kevin demonstrated a bias for action aggressively managing performance and ultimately improving results.Later Kevin was  re-assigned to the Hartford, CT District which was outside my span of control. In that role he built upon his experience and realized even greater returns on his efforts earning the Vice President’s club Award in 2009. 

Kevin is a dynamic leader who is very coachable and actively seeks feedback to further improve his skill sets. He is flexible in being able to learn new ways and would make a good addition to any organization.See moreSee lessI had the pleasure of meeting Kevin on the Northeast Leadership Council while working on a regional project.

Overview
Commercial Trial Lawyer
As a civil trial attorney with a specialty of products liability defense, Kevin Reynolds has tried dozens of cases to jury verdict in state and federal courts for over 30 years.  His extensive jury trial and appellate court experience provides him with a solid background when litigating commercial cases.  In Chambers USA guide 2016, he is described as “... prompt, thorough and has commercial awareness” and is valued for the quality of his work.  
Products Liability
He is sensitive to the needs of self-insured manufacturers and insurers who underwrite these unique risks, and has represented wholesalers, distributors, and retailers as well.  He is intimately familiar with such issues as: product recalls; conducting evidentiary Daubert hearings in federal court; spoliation of evidence; defenses based on federal preemption; protective orders against the dissemination of internal, confidential, and proprietary trade-secret type design information; and keeping proof of other accidents, claims or lawsuits out of evidence.
Aviation
As an experienced instrument-rated private pilot, with over 1,700 flight hours since 1989, his flying experience gives him a distinct advantage when he works on aviation-related matters.

About Us

Two of the most trusted household brands, Reynolds® and Hefty®, joined together as Reynolds Consumer Products in 2010. While the establishment of this new company made it official, the truth is that Reynolds® and Hefty® products have been found side-by-side in the kitchens of American families for more than three generations.The creation of both the Reynolds® and Hefty® brands is the direct result of American ingenuity mixed with a bit of elbow grease. Reynolds Wrap® foil was invented after aluminum was no longer needed for military use; and became a new staple for American kitchens. Hefty® waste bags were first developed with excess material from an early plastics innovator, creating another household essential.

We received the award for an innovative wireless network and mobile computer project that we did for a national tire and wheel reseller. In under 9 months Accucode configured and installed a wireless network, mobile computers and thermal printers at 873 Retail Locations, 22 Warehouses, 4 Distribution Centers.In total, thousands of pieces of equipment were deployed, including: 2,400 Meraki MR16 Access Points, 1,900 Zebra (Motorola) MC9190 mobile computers, 900 Zebra GT800 Thermal barcode printers.During the project Accucode was successfully completing up to 12 installations per day, supported by an internal team of just 6 people. Field Technicians utilized Samsung cellular tablets to stay in constant contact with the project coordinators, receive the floor-plans for their upcoming install, and to send the internal support team post-install wireless surveys and photos.

As part of my role, I created a formal Product Management function and Kevin agreed to join my team and lead the group. I could not have hoped for a better talent. Kevin has a very rare marriage of both strategic vision and capacity for detail. He quickly can get his head around any project, technology or service, comprehend all aspects of it and assess how best to employ, or not employ, it to optimize contribution to a strategic plan. His considerations and capabilities traverse technical, business, financial, sales, operational, market and other aspects of a project; a broad nuanced perspective with tremendous capacity for detail. The best thing about having Kevin on my team was that he made my job easy. You can’t ask for much more than that.See moreSee lessI had the opportunity to work with Kevin at AccuCode.  Kevin is a very capable and accomplished Product Manager.  At AccuCode he was instrumental in developing the Rapid Inventory SaaS application and consistently demonstrated strong Product Management skills with a keen focus on detail and project management.  Kevin is adept at staying abreast of the market, competitors and responding appropriately to customer requirements to improve the application. I would recommend Kevin for a senior level Product Management role within a technology or software company that wants to ensure their products remain compeitive and meet the needs of their customers.See moreSee lessSign up to see who recommended KevinGroupsQuickBooks Resources, Blogs, Articles, news and moreQuickBooks Consultants, accountants & bookkeepers -- Vendors and ClassifiedDeveloping Software for International Markets : i18n, l10n, T9n, G11nProduct ManagementInventory ManagementGoogle Universe : Jobs, Tools, Trends and Galaxies of IdeasCustomer Service Innovation GroupSee 7 moreSEO HardcoreCloud ComputingSuccessful QuickBooks Consultants QBO QB Power Hour Cloud Connect Accountant CPA Bookkeeping OnlineLean StartupProduct Marketing ManagersTransformational Leadership: Front Runners in OrganizationsProduct Management ExecutivesSee lessView Kevin’s full profile to...See who you know in commonGet introducedContact Kevin directlyView Kevin’s Full ProfileNot the Kevin you’re looking for?
