Five Simple Steps to Totally Mess Up Your Merger’s Virtual Data Room and Blow the Deal

Posted on August 13, 2014 | 1 comment


Ok, the headline is a bit dramatic – but when discussing Virtual Data Rooms (VDR), a little overacting is appropriate to emphasize the importance of “shopping” for a VDR.
It’s a very wide product market – ranging from inexpensive (limited functionality)  drop-n-drag box cloud folders to extremely powerful (aggressive priced) document management systems.
 Our VDR’s intelligent value meets the requirements of most M&A transactions – especially for middle market companies. Request a demonstration.
Step #1: Don’t Plan
Or… Planning is vital for every activity in business, and setting up a virtual data room is no different. By creating detailed plans of action you can avoid being caught unprepared for any situations arising from:

The index structure you need to fulfill the requirements of the deal
Methods of adding and removing user permissions
Ways of managing queries using the Q&A options
Controlling the quality of service provided to stakeholders
Finalization of the deal, closure of the data room and backing up of the information.

If you overlook these aspects you’ll find yourself having to scramble to meet the objectives of your data room.
Step #2:  Don’t Bother Understanding the Costs
Or… Virtual data room pricing depends on a number of variables, including the level of service you choose. Cheaper doesn’t always mean better, so make sure you understand exactly what your pricing covers. For example:

If your documentation consists mainly of many pages of text, then pricing per megabyte could be more practical than a price per page.
Data containing high-resolution images require more space to store so a price per page could be a better option in that case.

Other factors that affect pricing include the scanning and uploading of data, as well as the number of users that require access. If you do the prep work yourself you’re likely to pay less than you would if the service provider managed the process—as long as you do it right.
Step #3: Not Fussing With Permissions
Or… Providing access to your data is a sensitive issue, and one that can backfire badly if you get it wrong. User permissions determine what various parties in the deal are able to view, copy, print and download, so don’t leave this critical aspect in the hands of a junior staff member. The permission structure is ideally created during the planning stage and requires the knowledge and experience of a qualified deal co-ordinator to avoid errors. Make sure you understand who is getting what access and why, and ask questions to clarify any points you are unsure about.
Step #4: Don’t Think of Asking for Help
Or… Nobody expects you to be an expert in managing a virtual data room, especially not your first time around. There’s a reason why you choose a service provider carefully, and even if you’re determined to do your own prep work and manage the process yourself, don’t avoid asking for help when you need it. If you’re using a service provider that offers a full co-ordination service it can help you to prevent unpleasant surprises and leverage the technology available to make the best decisions for the deal.
Our recommendation? If possible, always use a deal co-ordinator who will be able to ensure you don’t make these mistakes. This will result in effective management and a good experience.
Step #5: Cheaper the Better! 
Or… Not all virtual data room providers are created equal, and if you want the service you need it’s critical to make sure you choose a vendor who is able to deliver. Before you appoint a provider, find out whether the company has the resources to offer a full service or if any aspects will be outsourced. If so, you’ll need to pay close attention to issues such as security, processing times and the integration across different platforms. Even if your provider manages everything in-house, it’s important to understand the security protocols in place and the document protection options that are available to you. Your choice of provider can affect the success of your deal and the integrity of your information significantly.
Request a demonstration.
Have a great day.

Larger companies billed 2.3X for financial printing over Emerging Growth Companies

Posted on August 8, 2014 | 1 comment


Not here they aren’t.
The new 2014 IPO Study from Proskauer Rose LLP is a must read for those of us in the capital markets business of working with IPOs. Click here to download the study.
The report examines in great detail:

The JOBS Act
Financial profiles and accounting disclosures
SEC comments and timing
Corporate governance
IPO expenses
Deal structure
Lock-ups
Sponsor-backed companies

Most relevant to Vintage are 1.) the JOBS Act, and the findings regarding Emerging Growth Companies (EGC) confidential IPOs vs. traditional IPOs and of course 2.) IPO expenses. But I will add a third point, the merging of those two as shown in the Proskauer Rose LLP (with added magnifying glass) chart below.

Generally, the lionshare of our S-1 work is with EGCs. Our intelligent value fee structure has always appealed to micro and small-cap companies. However, it was enlightening to read exactly how intelligent our value can be. A $400,000 delta (savings) is a lot of intelligent value for any size IPO. It’s over 1/10th of the total cost of the entire IPO process for an EGC.
Click here to download the S-1 workflow illustrated whitepaper.
From the Wall Street Journal:
What Proskauer found was that on average, the reported expense of going public as an emerging growth company was $3.7 million last year, versus $5.9 million for non-EGCs.
This could be partly explained by the fact that non-EGCs tend to be bigger companies.
No, says Proskauer’s Frank Lopez, co-head of the capital markets practice. While he couldn’t pinpoint the reasons, he explained that “larger companies [expenses] can be just as simple, but just generating more money [ROI],” implying that costs should be pretty standard across all deals.
Yes, cost should be standard across all deals. Pinpointing the reasons for financial printing cost control is easy as there are only a few, meaningful variables.

Accuracy of typesetting is NOT NOT NOT a variable: the S-1 is either accurate or not. And not is not an option or upgrade.
The SEC comments and revisions process can be a variable, but no direct trend was found in the report other than some sectors seem to have more comments than other sectors.
Physical printing is a variable, with large high-profile IPOs needing paper, ink and postage.

The last variable to highlight is that many IPOs are handed an “overabundance” of rush charges from rush changes. Vintage clients, fortunately, don’t face that: we have always believed that “rush” is inherent within the S-1 registration process – and not an add-on billable cost. It is the job.

Vintage Upgrades fleXBRL Program: Streamlines Corporate Reporting, Promotes Investor Adoption of SEC Filings

Posted on August 6, 2014 | Leave a comment


Two new enhancements focus on industry-wide drive for XBRL data quality   
NEW YORK, August 5 / PR Newswire / — Vintage, the capital markets and corporate solutions division of PR Newswire, today announced they have upgraded their XBRL (eXtensible Business Reporting Language) program, fleXBRL, with two new features, further demonstrating Vintage’s position as the industry’s intelligent value.

XBRL Online Review (XOR): XOR is a secure XBRL review portal that enables all reviewers of an SEC reporting company’s XBRL filing process to collaboratively review and comment on XBRL tagging selections before final submission to the SEC.
Built with an intuitive online interface, XOR delivers a complete set of user-friendly features that allow XBRL reviewers to navigate and communicate effortlessly through XBRL instance documents, streamlining the workflow for finance, counsel, C-suite, auditors and Vintage to thoroughly review the XBRL documents together, including:

XBRL calculations checking within the XOR viewer uses icons to clearly highlight extension tags, negated elements, calculation errors and more


Threaded commenting allows members of the internal financial reporting team, as well as permissioned outside auditors, to add comments to XBRL documents for quality assurance, verification of instance documents and the approval – or disapproval – of bookmark tags and facts


Comprehensive reporting of calculations, extensions, negations and units with an XBRL filing as well as comparing differences between two XBRL versions


Taxonomy searching provides simple navigation, filtering and reviewing options.

XOR will be especially useful to Vintage fleXBRL Core clients who are not currently working in Vintage’s comprehensive XBRL SaaS platform.
Online Interactive Analyst Center (IAC): Vintage has partnered with Virtua Research to allow fleXBRL clients to publish their financial fundamental information onto their investor relations website with data directly from their own official SEC XBRL files. This eliminates the concerns issuers have long held regarding the inaccuracies of manually collected third-party financial fundamental data and delivering that unvetted data to investors.
For investors and analysts, the Interactive Analyst Center makes company financial data – balance sheet, income statement and cash flow data – more readily accessible and easier to understand online.
“The issue of XBRL quality created an ROI ‘chicken & egg’ scenario in the capital markets,” said Liam Power, President of Vintage.
“Many corporate issuers have expressed concerns regarding their experience with XBRL because neither investors – nor the SEC itself – were using the data. Meanwhile, investors have equally expressed their concerns as the XBRL data was inconsistent across the market. Today’s announcement drives both quality and adoption. This is especially important in light of the SEC’s recent disclosure that they are taking a much more aggressive tone towards enforcing XBRL data quality,” continued Power.
“The common goal for everyone involved is uniform, usable data that connects issuer and investor.”
Both XOR and IAC are available to all Vintage XBRL clients at no additional cost and are included in all new compliance packages. For detailed information:  http://www.thevintagegroup.com/contact-us/

How Vintage became the intelligent value for public companies

Posted on August 5, 2014 | 9 comments


The feedback we received from clients, partners and other stakeholders regarding the relaunch of Vintage was affirming. We have become the industry’s intelligent value. Depending on whom you ask here, we’re either the Honda of XBRL, the Target Store of IR services or the Jetblue / Southwest of IPO transactions.
What is intelligent value? For a Vintage client, it’s the flexibility to receive a superior service at the appropriate scale to their business goal. And what is that appropriate scale?  That’s for a client to decide, but generally it is the Venn middle of cost-effective and intrinsic-importance.

 
Case examples:
An OTC Markets-listed company is a SEC reporting organization. They are doing all they can to be transparent while finding new investors. Unfortunately, the fee quoted for XBRL from an old-school financial printer seems “aggressive” and will drain an inordinate percentage of budget for the size of the issuer – reducing their overall budget for shareholder communications. Wisely, above cost, the issuer is equally concerned about quality and don’t want to switch to an “XBRL garage band” vendor nor a new, untried firm. Our fleXBRL Core solution delivers their intelligent value.
BONUS: They also find additional intelligent value by negotiating a bundle that includes shareholder communications (news distribution and their IR website)  with the XBRL.
A NASDAQ-listed mid-cap is going to issue more shares. They need to draft and file a new S-1 registration with the SEC, but as they have been public for quite a while, the registration is not as “passionate” as their IPO. It’s just paperwork. The S-1 working group is very small and don’t require to meet face-to-face. They don’t need the indulgence of a mahogany conference room. They do need accurate typesetting. A 100% Virtual Transaction delivers intelligent value.
BONUS: Fortunately for them, they are an existing PR Newswire client, which gives them a buying power boost.
Each day, more examples are being created. The bottomline for all these clients (and prospects) is be creative and precise with what you require to receive as intelligent value. Address your business goals. Don’t buy more than you need, but certainly don’t settle for less.
Are we the Kleenex of EDGAR? I can’t answer that really, but we are the #3 largest filer.
Have a great day.
