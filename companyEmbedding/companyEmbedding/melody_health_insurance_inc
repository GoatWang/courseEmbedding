No matter when you start, you always want to start off on the right foot.
And with a term life insurance policy from New York Life Insurance Company you’re starting off on the best foot possible.

Term life is simple and affordable and you pay a low monthly premium based on the term length and the amount of coverage you need. At the end of your term, you may be able to renew your coverage, often at a higher premium without having to provide evidence of good health. Buying term life insurance can be a wise decision while you are young and healthy, since premiums tend to be much lower. So why wait? Protect the ones you love and keep good going in your life.

The many benefits of a term life insurance policy include:


Affordable premiums: cover yourself, spouse, family or business without breaking the bank
Guaranteed death benefit paid out to a beneficiary or beneficiaries you select
Guaranteed coverage for the duration of the term selected (example: 5, 10, 20 years)
Conversion privilege at the end of the term to a permanent policy (certain limitations apply)


To get started, fill out the form above and a local, professionally-trained agent will get back to you with a no-cost, no-obligation consultation.

In Oregon, the policy form numbers are as follows: Family Protection - 206-110.27; Level Premium Convertible Term - 210-60.27; One-Year Non Renewable Term - 209-125.27; and Yearly Convertible Term - 210-135-27.

The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

No matter when you start, you always want to start off on the right foot.
And with a term life insurance policy from New York Life Insurance Company you’re starting off on the best foot possible.

Term life is simple and affordable and you pay a low monthly premium based on the term length and the amount of coverage you need. At the end of your term, you may be able to renew your coverage, often at a higher premium without having to provide evidence of good health. Buying term life insurance can be a wise decision while you are young and healthy, since premiums tend to be much lower. So why wait? Protect the ones you love and keep good going in your life.

The many benefits of a term life insurance policy include:


Affordable premiums: cover yourself, spouse, family or business without breaking the bank
Guaranteed death benefit paid out to a beneficiary or beneficiaries you select
Guaranteed coverage for the duration of the term selected (example: 5, 10, 20 years)
Conversion privilege at the end of the term to a permanent policy (certain limitations apply)


To get started, fill out the form above and a local, professionally-trained agent will get back to you with a no-cost, no-obligation consultation.

In Oregon, the policy form numbers are as follows: Family Protection - 206-110.27; Level Premium Convertible Term - 210-60.27; One-Year Non Renewable Term - 209-125.27; and Yearly Convertible Term - 210-135-27.

“Beyond being simple, the process is fast.
                            We started looking at insurance in December
                            and we were all set in January.” see more

How do I Buy Health Insurance?
For some, buying health insurance can be a confusing and overwhelming process. First, you have to find a health insurance plan within your budget. Then you have to contact the company or an insurance agent in order to get a quote. Once you have all of that information, you can evaluate your options. It is a very personal and complicated process, but there are ways to simplify it.
Now that the Affordable Care Act (sometimes referred to as “Obamacare”) is in place, it is much easier to find a health insurance plan based on your income and personal health needs. In most states, you may even qualify for financial subsidies. You can quickly and easily apply for coverage through the new Healthcare Marketplace.
Before you settle on a plan, you should first get a quote, find a price, and discover any out-of-pocket expenses your plan will expect you to pay (such as deductibles, co-insurance, and copay charges). Once you have all of this information together, it will be easier to find coverage which fits your needs.


What is the Healthcare Marketplace?
The passage of the Affordable Care Act established the Healthcare Marketplace. There are two distinct divisions - a state level, and a federal level. 37 states are members of the federal exchange, and 14 are limited to a state exchange. Unfortunately, not all insurance companies are required to provide information about their plans and prices to the Healthcare Marketplace, so be prepared to do some local searching for affordable plans in your area.
The Healthcare Marketplace may also be referred to as the Health Insurance Marketplace. It is a website managed by the federal government. When you visit, you can enter a few personal details about yourself and start shopping for plans in a matter of minutes.


What’s the "Health Insurance Exchange"?
The Health Insurance Exchange is the pool of health care plans and providers which are cooperating with the federal government in order to provide affordable health insurance to Americans in many states. 37 states are members of the Exchange on the federal level: AL, AK, AZ, AK, DE, FL, GA, HI, IL, IN, IA, KS, LA, ME, MI, MS, MO, MT, NE, NV, NH, NJ, NM, NC, ND, OH, OK, PA, SC, SD, TN, TX, UT, VA, WV, WI, and WY.
To see if you qualify for a tax subsidy, you need to enroll on the Healthcare Marketplace website (either the federal one, or your state’s website). If you do not qualify for a subsidy for whatever reason, you have the option of shopping through the Exchange or in your state’s private marketplace.


When Can I Sign Up for Health Insurance?
Keep the following terms in mind, as they will help make the search for insurance easier:

Obamacare - a nickname (sometimes considered derogatory) for the Affordable Care Act. Its full name is the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. It was signed into law by President Barack Obama in March of 2010.
Healthcare Marketplace - a resource for those without health insurance to find affordable coverage through either a state or federal exchange.
Subsidized Health Insurance - The passing of the Affordable Care Act began the process of subsidizing (offering at a lower cost) health insurance plans for those who cannot otherwise afford health insurance and medical care.
Medical Insurance - another term for health insurance. Also synonymous with healthcare plans and medical coverage.
Health Insurance Companies - companies which underwrite (provide) health insurance plans. They are responsible for paying out claims when their beneficiaries (customers) receive medical care.
Health Insurance Quotes - most health insurance companies are required to give you an accurate estimate of what you should expect to pay as well as the terms of your health insurance plan, should you decide to do business with them. These estimates are commonly referred to as a “quote”.
Premium - the monthly cost you must pay to maintain your health insurance coverage. Also sometimes referred to as a “monthly premium”.
Deductible - a fixed dollar amount your insurance company will require you to pay out-of-pocket for your medical care before they will pay out any claims. The deductible and monthly premium are inversely related: the higher the premium, the lower the deductible, and vice versa.



How Can I Find the Best Health Insurance Company?
Right now, there are hundreds of different health insurance companies participating in the Exchange offering thousands of different plans. These companies are rated on a letter grading scale (A, B, C, etc.) based on their performance. Their grade is calculated by attributes such as financial stability, claim payments, and customer service. You might also want to ask around among friends, family members, and colleagues. If their plans are working for them, they could work for you too.
You might also want to ask around among friends, family members, and colleagues. If their plans are working for them, they could work for you too. Here is list of some companies that our partners work with: Aetna, UnitedHealthCare, Humana, BCBS, Cigna, Anthem, AARP, and many others.


What Happens if I Still Can’t Afford to Buy Health Insurance?
If you cannot purchase insurance, the government will charge you a fine when you file your yearly income taxes. For 2015, the fine will be either $325 or 2% of your income (the higher of the two will be your fee). This fee will increase to $695 or 2.5% of your yearly income in 2016. To avoid the penalty, you have to be carrying a health insurance plan for at least 9 months of the year.

Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
