His father was Jack Goode, a celebrated star of Movies and Broadway who appeared in films with such Hollywood royalty as Fred Astaire, Ginger Rogers and Cary Grant. His mother was a free spirited, folk singing, songwriting Broadway dancer and between the two of them created in Irwin his musical foundation. A prodigious child, Irwin was recorded at two years old singing his own compositions into the family tape recorder. At five he was playing music on drums and ukulele. After the sudden death of his father, Irwin’s mother decided to start a new life for her and the ten year old in Australia and they moved to the countryside in Rural Victoria. Irwin took up guitar and practiced with obsessive fervor and dedication.By fourteen he had become so accomplished that he was playing in five different bands with musicians twice his age. He quickly absorbed a wide variety of styles during this apprenticeship ranging from R&B to Rock, Latin to Punk. At fourteen, Irwin met legendary guitar player/producer Carlos Rios (Gino Vannelli/Brother to Brother) whilst on tour in Australia. Carlos gave the fourteen year old his phone number, address and told him if he was ever in the Los Angeles area to give him a call. Six months later a rather surprised Carlos received a phone call from that very same kid. He had arrived in L.A. Irwin then sat in on a session for an album that Carlos was producing for Latino Actor/Singer Ruben Blades. That night he met the likes of Larry Klein and Al Schmitt. During his time there he witnessed the seedy L.A. rock scene first hand. From downtown to the strip he would crash on friends’ couches and sneak into the famous Rainbow theatre at every opportunity.His education continued. On his return to Australia Irwin announced that music was his life, so he left school and moved to Melbourne, determined to make it as a professional musician. Working as a session guitarist he assumed the moniker-: Jack Jones. Jack after his father and Jones because of his Mothers remarriage. His talents as a “guitar-for-hire” were much in demand, but his singing debut came by accident. The now world-renowned freak drummer Virgil Donati, whose band The State was gaining a reputation on the live circuit, was involved in a Van Halen cover band side project called Hans Valen. Virgil asked Irwin to sing and play guitar. Irwin, being unsure of his voice, didn’t feel like he could do the songs justice so just played guitar instead. One day, just before a gig the vocalist got sick, so Irwin stepped in and sang. The room went quiet as people stared in disbelief that this incredible voice had come from Irwin. He had impressed everyone…so much so that he was asked to join The State as singer/guitar player. The State became Southern Sons and over the next six years would go on to sell close to 1,000,000 units throughout Australia, Asia, Germany and Canada.Irwin’s time with Southern Sons served as a solid foundation for a life in the music business. He toured the country over and over. Honing his chops and getting used to playing in front of large audiences was a crucial part of his development. He was somewhat awkward with the fame and knew artistically it was not really what he wanted to do. He needed to explore his own musical identity. His skills were still in demand as a session player and during this time he toured with many of Australia’s best selling artists. You gotta eat, right?Then in the mid 90s Irwin found himself back in the U.S. with Dweezil & Ahmet Zappa in their band Z. Dweezil and Irwin had previously become fast friends after meeting in Sydney, Australia in 1990. Irwin was invited to come and live with the Zappas in L.A., and he was welcomed into the family. He stayed there for eighteen months, and it is in this environment of creativity that Irwin knew that he had to make the leap to being a solo artist.In 2000, Mudhead was released independently. A collaboration between Irwin and Garry Gary Beers of INXS, this was Irwin’s first taste of musical freedom. Later, working with his long time writing partner Rusty Brown, work on a purely solo album began. This culminated in 2002 with the release of the first fully-fledged Irwin Thomas album: The Evolution of Irwin Thomas - a rich and beautiful collection of musical soundscapes. This album’s supporting live shows were spectacular, and Irwin was invited to join Matchbox 20 as support during their tour of Australia. The album received much critical acclaim and is a buried treasure waiting to be discovered by a wider audience.Irwin’s newest album is tentatively called Made In China and has been written, recorded, produced, mixed and mastered totally independently. It was conceived in 2005 while Irwin was on a UK/ European tour. During a break in the tour there was an opportunity for Rusty to spend some time in London with Irwin to write new material, and within three weeks of hard work they had written the bulk of the album. Made In China showcases Irwin’s outstanding songwriting, dazzling guitar work and his amazing voice.

Early life[edit]
Irwin Thomas Whittridge was born in Manhattan, New York City. His father those stage name Jack Goode, was born Irwin Thomas Whittridge Snr (January 1908 – June 1971), was a Hollywood film actor and Broadway performer. His mother, Renalda Whittridge (née Green), was an Australian-born folk singer and dancer; she returned to Australia in 1980, with her son.[1] He was later known as Jack Thomas Whittridge Jones.[2]
Music career[edit]
While at a secondary school in the rural city of Traralgon, in the mid-1980s, Thomas was a member of rock groups, Get off the Cat and then Survival.[3][4] In the late 1980s he was a member of Hans Valen, which covered material by United State heavy rocker, Van Halen; and then he was in Gnomes of Zurich.[3] As Jones, he auditioned as lead vocalist for a Melbourne-based rock, pop group, the State. The State had formed in 1987, with the line-up of Peter Bowman on lead guitar and backing vocals (ex-Cutters), Phil Buckle on guitar and lead vocals (Cutters), Geoff Cain on bass guitar and Virgil Donati on drums (Taste, Cutters).[5] He was considered too young for that group.[6]
In mid-1990 Thomas, as Jones (on lead guitar), worked alongside Buckle in John Farnham's backing band to record that artist's album, Chain Reaction (September 1990).[3][5][6] Jones, on lead vocals and lead guitar, was asked by Buckle to form the Southern Sons, with former the State members: Bowman, Cain and Donati.[3][5][6] In April 1991 Buckle explained to Charles Miranda of The Canberra Times that Jones was recruited because "[The State] were going nowhere fast. At this stage [in late 1989] Buckle realised that his songs had potential but his voice didn't".[7]
Southern Sons debut self-titled album was released on 1 June 1990, which peaked at No. 5 on the ARIA Albums Chart.[5][8] Their first single, "Heart in Danger", was released in August, it also reached No. 5 on the related ARIA Singles Chart.[5][8] Jones and Buckle toured Australia and Europe as members of Farnham's backing band to promote Chain Reaction.[5] Southern Sons were a support act on Farnham's tours in 1990 and 1991.[5] The group also undertook their own headlining national tours.[5] Buckle disputed media criticism that Southern Sons "sounded too similar to John Farnham's music", he felt that although "Jack Jones, has a similar voice, they are very different. He believes the Sons guitar work makes for a harder sound."[7] Bowman left the group as a four-piece in mid-1992.[5][6]
As a member of Southern Sons, Thomas co-wrote some of their later material, including three tracks on their second album, Nothing But the Truth (November 1992),[9] and six of eleven tracks for their third album, Zone (1995).[5][10] The latter album was co-produced by the band with former member, Bowman.[3][6] By the end of 1995 the group disbanded.
During the 1990s Thomas worked as a session musician on albums by other artists including Lisa Edwards' Thru the Hoop (June 1993),[11] Debra Byrne's Sleeping Child (July 1994),[12] Phil and Tommy Emmanuel's Terra Firma (April 1995),[3][13] Bachelor Girl's Waiting for the Day (November 1998),[6] and Farnham's Live at the Regent Theatre 1st July 1999 (1999) as well as touring in Farnham's backing band for the I Can't Believe He's 50 Tour.[3][6]
In 1996 Thomas and Donati formed a trio, Hong Kong Meeting, with Steve Hunter on bass guitar.[3][14] Late in the next year Thomas and Donati joined Tina Arena's backing band for her national tour in support of her third solo studio album, In Deep (August 1997).[3][6] In the following year Thomas formed the Jack Jones Band with Garry Gary Beers on bass guitar (ex-INXS) and Alex Formosa on drums.[3] In March 1998 they performed at the Good Vibrations benefit concert by various artists for Marc Hunter, the ailing lead singer of New Zealand-Australian band, Dragon, who had been diagnosed with throat cancer.[15] Thomas covered the tracks "Are You Old Enough", "Voodoo Chile" and "Both of Me", he also performed a duet with Tommy Emmanuel on "Nothing to Lose".[3] A double-CD and a VHS of the concert, both titled Good Vibrations – A Concert for Marc Hunter, were released in mid-1998.[3] Hunter died in July.[15]
Thomas reverted to his birth name in 2000, working with Ahmet Zappa in Los Angeles, and with Beers. He has released music as a solo artist, first for BMG and then as an independent artist, with The Evolution of Irwin Thomas appearing in 2002. Since 2004 he has also been involved with Melbourne band Electric Mary, and he is also in a band called She Said Yes, led by Tania Doko, the former lead singer of Bachelor Girl.[16]
Private life[edit]
Jones was married to New Zealand-born Australian actress Rebecca Gibney from 1992 to 1995, which ended in divorce.[17] In December 1994 Gibney promoted her recent romantic comedy film, Lucky Break; she described her differences from her character, to The Canberra Times' David Bongiorno, "She's so unlike any other character I've played before. She's a woman you love to hate... And there's a part of me in there, because I know I wouldn't let my husband (Jack Jones of Southern Sons) go easily at all!"[18] She explained that the couple had no immediate plans to have children, "I want financial and career security before I become a mum. Only then will I take time off to have kids. And when I do, they'll be my absolute priority."[18]

Early life[edit]
Irwin Thomas Whittridge was born in Manhattan, New York City. His father those stage name Jack Goode, was born Irwin Thomas Whittridge Snr (January 1908 – June 1971), was a Hollywood film actor and Broadway performer. His mother, Renalda Whittridge (née Green), was an Australian-born folk singer and dancer; she returned to Australia in 1980, with her son.[1] He was later known as Jack Thomas Whittridge Jones.[2]
Music career[edit]
While at a secondary school in the rural city of Traralgon, in the mid-1980s, Thomas was a member of rock groups, Get off the Cat and then Survival.[3][4] In the late 1980s he was a member of Hans Valen, which covered material by United State heavy rocker, Van Halen; and then he was in Gnomes of Zurich.[3] As Jones, he auditioned as lead vocalist for a Melbourne-based rock, pop group, the State. The State had formed in 1987, with the line-up of Peter Bowman on lead guitar and backing vocals (ex-Cutters), Phil Buckle on guitar and lead vocals (Cutters), Geoff Cain on bass guitar and Virgil Donati on drums (Taste, Cutters).[5] He was considered too young for that group.[6]
In mid-1990 Thomas, as Jones (on lead guitar), worked alongside Buckle in John Farnham's backing band to record that artist's album, Chain Reaction (September 1990).[3][5][6] Jones, on lead vocals and lead guitar, was asked by Buckle to form the Southern Sons, with former the State members: Bowman, Cain and Donati.[3][5][6] In April 1991 Buckle explained to Charles Miranda of The Canberra Times that Jones was recruited because "[The State] were going nowhere fast. At this stage [in late 1989] Buckle realised that his songs had potential but his voice didn't".[7]
Southern Sons debut self-titled album was released on 1 June 1990, which peaked at No. 5 on the ARIA Albums Chart.[5][8] Their first single, "Heart in Danger", was released in August, it also reached No. 5 on the related ARIA Singles Chart.[5][8] Jones and Buckle toured Australia and Europe as members of Farnham's backing band to promote Chain Reaction.[5] Southern Sons were a support act on Farnham's tours in 1990 and 1991.[5] The group also undertook their own headlining national tours.[5] Buckle disputed media criticism that Southern Sons "sounded too similar to John Farnham's music", he felt that although "Jack Jones, has a similar voice, they are very different. He believes the Sons guitar work makes for a harder sound."[7] Bowman left the group as a four-piece in mid-1992.[5][6]
As a member of Southern Sons, Thomas co-wrote some of their later material, including three tracks on their second album, Nothing But the Truth (November 1992),[9] and six of eleven tracks for their third album, Zone (1995).[5][10] The latter album was co-produced by the band with former member, Bowman.[3][6] By the end of 1995 the group disbanded.
During the 1990s Thomas worked as a session musician on albums by other artists including Lisa Edwards' Thru the Hoop (June 1993),[11] Debra Byrne's Sleeping Child (July 1994),[12] Phil and Tommy Emmanuel's Terra Firma (April 1995),[3][13] Bachelor Girl's Waiting for the Day (November 1998),[6] and Farnham's Live at the Regent Theatre 1st July 1999 (1999) as well as touring in Farnham's backing band for the I Can't Believe He's 50 Tour.[3][6]
In 1996 Thomas and Donati formed a trio, Hong Kong Meeting, with Steve Hunter on bass guitar.[3][14] Late in the next year Thomas and Donati joined Tina Arena's backing band for her national tour in support of her third solo studio album, In Deep (August 1997).[3][6] In the following year Thomas formed the Jack Jones Band with Garry Gary Beers on bass guitar (ex-INXS) and Alex Formosa on drums.[3] In March 1998 they performed at the Good Vibrations benefit concert by various artists for Marc Hunter, the ailing lead singer of New Zealand-Australian band, Dragon, who had been diagnosed with throat cancer.[15] Thomas covered the tracks "Are You Old Enough", "Voodoo Chile" and "Both of Me", he also performed a duet with Tommy Emmanuel on "Nothing to Lose".[3] A double-CD and a VHS of the concert, both titled Good Vibrations – A Concert for Marc Hunter, were released in mid-1998.[3] Hunter died in July.[15]
Thomas reverted to his birth name in 2000, working with Ahmet Zappa in Los Angeles, and with Beers. He has released music as a solo artist, first for BMG and then as an independent artist, with The Evolution of Irwin Thomas appearing in 2002. Since 2004 he has also been involved with Melbourne band Electric Mary, and he is also in a band called She Said Yes, led by Tania Doko, the former lead singer of Bachelor Girl.[16]
Private life[edit]
Jones was married to New Zealand-born Australian actress Rebecca Gibney from 1992 to 1995, which ended in divorce.[17] In December 1994 Gibney promoted her recent romantic comedy film, Lucky Break; she described her differences from her character, to The Canberra Times' David Bongiorno, "She's so unlike any other character I've played before. She's a woman you love to hate... And there's a part of me in there, because I know I wouldn't let my husband (Jack Jones of Southern Sons) go easily at all!"[18] She explained that the couple had no immediate plans to have children, "I want financial and career security before I become a mum. Only then will I take time off to have kids. And when I do, they'll be my absolute priority."[18]

Early life[edit]
Irwin Thomas Whittridge was born in Manhattan, New York City. His father those stage name Jack Goode, was born Irwin Thomas Whittridge Snr (January 1908 – June 1971), was a Hollywood film actor and Broadway performer. His mother, Renalda Whittridge (née Green), was an Australian-born folk singer and dancer; she returned to Australia in 1980, with her son.[1] He was later known as Jack Thomas Whittridge Jones.[2]
Music career[edit]
While at a secondary school in the rural city of Traralgon, in the mid-1980s, Thomas was a member of rock groups, Get off the Cat and then Survival.[3][4] In the late 1980s he was a member of Hans Valen, which covered material by United State heavy rocker, Van Halen; and then he was in Gnomes of Zurich.[3] As Jones, he auditioned as lead vocalist for a Melbourne-based rock, pop group, the State. The State had formed in 1987, with the line-up of Peter Bowman on lead guitar and backing vocals (ex-Cutters), Phil Buckle on guitar and lead vocals (Cutters), Geoff Cain on bass guitar and Virgil Donati on drums (Taste, Cutters).[5] He was considered too young for that group.[6]
In mid-1990 Thomas, as Jones (on lead guitar), worked alongside Buckle in John Farnham's backing band to record that artist's album, Chain Reaction (September 1990).[3][5][6] Jones, on lead vocals and lead guitar, was asked by Buckle to form the Southern Sons, with former the State members: Bowman, Cain and Donati.[3][5][6] In April 1991 Buckle explained to Charles Miranda of The Canberra Times that Jones was recruited because "[The State] were going nowhere fast. At this stage [in late 1989] Buckle realised that his songs had potential but his voice didn't".[7]
Southern Sons debut self-titled album was released on 1 June 1990, which peaked at No. 5 on the ARIA Albums Chart.[5][8] Their first single, "Heart in Danger", was released in August, it also reached No. 5 on the related ARIA Singles Chart.[5][8] Jones and Buckle toured Australia and Europe as members of Farnham's backing band to promote Chain Reaction.[5] Southern Sons were a support act on Farnham's tours in 1990 and 1991.[5] The group also undertook their own headlining national tours.[5] Buckle disputed media criticism that Southern Sons "sounded too similar to John Farnham's music", he felt that although "Jack Jones, has a similar voice, they are very different. He believes the Sons guitar work makes for a harder sound."[7] Bowman left the group as a four-piece in mid-1992.[5][6]
As a member of Southern Sons, Thomas co-wrote some of their later material, including three tracks on their second album, Nothing But the Truth (November 1992),[9] and six of eleven tracks for their third album, Zone (1995).[5][10] The latter album was co-produced by the band with former member, Bowman.[3][6] By the end of 1995 the group disbanded.
During the 1990s Thomas worked as a session musician on albums by other artists including Lisa Edwards' Thru the Hoop (June 1993),[11] Debra Byrne's Sleeping Child (July 1994),[12] Phil and Tommy Emmanuel's Terra Firma (April 1995),[3][13] Bachelor Girl's Waiting for the Day (November 1998),[6] and Farnham's Live at the Regent Theatre 1st July 1999 (1999) as well as touring in Farnham's backing band for the I Can't Believe He's 50 Tour.[3][6]
In 1996 Thomas and Donati formed a trio, Hong Kong Meeting, with Steve Hunter on bass guitar.[3][14] Late in the next year Thomas and Donati joined Tina Arena's backing band for her national tour in support of her third solo studio album, In Deep (August 1997).[3][6] In the following year Thomas formed the Jack Jones Band with Garry Gary Beers on bass guitar (ex-INXS) and Alex Formosa on drums.[3] In March 1998 they performed at the Good Vibrations benefit concert by various artists for Marc Hunter, the ailing lead singer of New Zealand-Australian band, Dragon, who had been diagnosed with throat cancer.[15] Thomas covered the tracks "Are You Old Enough", "Voodoo Chile" and "Both of Me", he also performed a duet with Tommy Emmanuel on "Nothing to Lose".[3] A double-CD and a VHS of the concert, both titled Good Vibrations – A Concert for Marc Hunter, were released in mid-1998.[3] Hunter died in July.[15]
Thomas reverted to his birth name in 2000, working with Ahmet Zappa in Los Angeles, and with Beers. He has released music as a solo artist, first for BMG and then as an independent artist, with The Evolution of Irwin Thomas appearing in 2002. Since 2004 he has also been involved with Melbourne band Electric Mary, and he is also in a band called She Said Yes, led by Tania Doko, the former lead singer of Bachelor Girl.[16]
Private life[edit]
Jones was married to New Zealand-born Australian actress Rebecca Gibney from 1992 to 1995, which ended in divorce.[17] In December 1994 Gibney promoted her recent romantic comedy film, Lucky Break; she described her differences from her character, to The Canberra Times' David Bongiorno, "She's so unlike any other character I've played before. She's a woman you love to hate... And there's a part of me in there, because I know I wouldn't let my husband (Jack Jones of Southern Sons) go easily at all!"[18] She explained that the couple had no immediate plans to have children, "I want financial and career security before I become a mum. Only then will I take time off to have kids. And when I do, they'll be my absolute priority."[18]

Irwin Thomas's strat - any info and your thoughts about SD stacked singles

«  on: July 24, 2008, 10:28:26 PM »




Hey all,After whatching It reminded me how much I like the tone Irwin gets with this strat. Irwin Thomas/Jack Jones was in my office a couple of years back with his strat checking out pedals. I'm pretty sure it's the same strat that he uses in this UTube clip, old Gibson PAF in the bridge and some sort of seymour duncan stacks that looked vintage (6 poles, no rails)  in the middle and bridge. He could not remember which ones but he hit the strings harder than anyone I've ever seen and got an brilliant tone. If anyone has any more info on his strat I would be very interested including what value pots he's using. I think there is something clever going on to get such a great clean strat sound but not have any noise. But having a bucker in the bridge means maybe 500k pots. So has anyone had any experience running 500k pots with SD stracked singles. I know they have a reputation of being a bit muddy, but perhaps with 500k pots they would sing. My woodstocks are good, but they are extremely midrangy which is great for somethings but I would prefer a more "strat" sounding strat. I have some very bad wiring around my studio/office so noiseless is a bonus (at least on one of my strats). Any and all suggestions most welcome.

Hi Jules, if the SD Stacked pickups are the old models from the 80's they used to come with red covers and were deeper than a regular strat pickup, you could change the covers though and it wouldn't matter. From memory they sounded ok, bigger than a strat sound but in the same family. I seem to remember though that they some had  blades. I know you've been looking at this noise thing for a while now. I still think Kinmans or the Suhr BPSCC would be a good choice. I am setting up two guys systems next week, one with a SD humbucker who wants a couple of Suhr FL singles and a BPSCC to get rid of the noise, and another who is getting a set of Brierley's and wants to fit a BPSCC with them. The Brierley's work well with the BPSCC, Les Rankin has installed some in his personal guitar and I've passed along some info from John Suhr to Mick so that his pickups would work seemlessly.  That clip is Irwin doing "I'm Buzzed", a Mike Landau tune. He does a great job with it. Mike Is using Suhr Pickups and Guitars and Amps now. SSV humbucker, FL singles (FL = Fletcher/Landau) with built in SSC system.Gary.
