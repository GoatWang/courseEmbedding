Atlantic Media selling ownership stake to organization run by Laurene Powell Jobs
              
              Emerson Collective, founded by Laurene Powell Jobs, wife of late Apple founder Steve Jobs, is acquiring a majority ownership stake in The Atlantic. According to a news release on Friday Atlantic Media Chairman David Bradley told staff of the deal, which includes its flagship magazine, digital properties, live events business and consulting services. Bradley, through Atlantic Media, will hold a minority stake and continue to run The Atlantic for the next three to five years. In a letter to The Atlantic staff Bradley said, "Against the odds, The Atlantic is prospering. While I will stay at the helm some years, the most consequential decision of my career now is behind me: Who next will take stewardship of this 160-year-old national treasure? To me, the answer, in the form of Laurene, feels incomparably right." The terms of the deal were not disclosed. In the 18 years since Bradley acquired the magazine from Mortimer Zuckerman, digital readership has grown to a monthly average of 33 million unique visitors from 2 million in 2009, and it generates profits above $10 million per year after recording losses of more than $10 million a year in Bradley's early days. About 20% of the magazine's revenue comes from print advertising with 80% coming in digital advertising.

Electronic Arts shares slide 3% as outlook falls short
              
              Shares of Electronic Arts Inc.  were down 3% in premarket trade Friday, after the video game company offered a disappointing outlook for the second quarter. The company topped first-quarter profit and revenue estimates, but said it expects a net loss of $57 million and a loss per share of 18 cents for the second quarter, wider than the 6 cents forecast by FactSet.  Analysts were generally positive on the numbers, despite the outlook. "Overall, we thought this was a good start for EA, showcasing the healthy underlying trends or digital, which also serves as positive read-through to other video game publishers such as Activision Blizzard  and Take-Two --both are scheduled to report quarterly results next week," Stifel analysts wrote in a note. Electronic Arts shares have gained 49% in 2017, while the S&P 500  has gained 11%.

Goodyear Tire's stock dives after slashed profit outlook offsets in-line earnings
              
              Shares of Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.  plunged 9.3% in premarket trade Friday, after the tire maker slashed its 2017 profit outlook. Net profit for the quarter to June 30 fell to $147 million, or 58 cents a share, from $202 million, or 75 cents a share, in the same period a year ago. Excluding non-recurring items, adjusted earnings per share came to 70 cents, matching the FactSet consensus. Revenue slipped to $3.69 billion from $3.88 billion, just shy of the FactSet consensus of $3.73 billion. The company cut its 2017 guidance for segment operating income to a range of $1.60 billion to $1.65 billion from "approximately" $2.0 billion. "In addition to higher raw material costs, we have seen a weakening in OE and consumer replacement demand across many of our key markets during the first half, despite strong underlying industry fundamentals," said Chief Executive Richard Kramer. "The combination of these factors has led to a highly unusual first half environment, particularly given the favorable trends in miles driven, gasoline prices and unemployment that are generally supportive of our industry." The stock has rallied 14.9% year to date through Thursday, while the S&P 500  has gained 10.6%.

Ford reports Q2 earnings above Wall Street expectations, gives positive 2017 guidance
              
              Shares of Ford Motor Co.  rose 1.6% before heading down in premarket trade on Wednesday after the company reported second-quarter profit and revenue that was above Wall Street expectations. Net income for the quarter came in at $2.04 billion, or 51 cents per share, compared with $1.97 billion, or 49 cents per share during the year-earlier period. Adjusted earnings per share were 56 cents, above FactSet's earnings consensus for 43 cents per share. Revenue for the quarter hit $39.85 billion, compared with $39.49 billion during the same period a year ago. Revenue was above FactSet's expected $37.28 billion consensus. Revenue from automotive sales were up to $37.11 billion in the quarter, compared with $36.93 billion a year ago, and the company said that automotive profits were driven by North America. Europe and Asia Pacific were also profitable. The car manufacturer said it expects full-year adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.65 to $1.85. The FactSet consensus is for full-year earnings of $1.51 per share. Ford shares are down 7% in the year to date, while the S&P 500 index  is up nearly 11% in the year.

Amazon’s free-spending ways hit earnings, but don’t expect a shift to thrift
              
              Amazon.com Inc. has been riding high the past few months, sending its market cap and Chief Executive Jeff Bezos’s net worth to record levels. But the company’s free-spending ways took a big hit out of profit at the same time.

Wells Fargo: FDA plan to lower nicotine could be opportunity for Altria, Philip Morris
              
              Wells Fargo Securities analyst Bonnie Herzog said Friday that a new Food and Drug Administration plan to lower nicotine levels in cigarettes could be a long-term opportunity for makers of reduced-risk products like Altria Group Inc.  and Philip Morris International Inc. . Shares of cigarette producers plunged after the FDA announcement, with Altria plummeting 9.6%, Philip Morris declining 0.4% and British American Tobacco  plunging 7.2% in extremely heavy midday trade. Altria and Philip Morris, however, have a "unique competitive advantage" with smokeless iQOS devices. Philip Morris said "iQOS heats the tobacco just enough to release the flavorful nicotine-containing vapor but without burning the tobacco." Even so, one medical journal study found that smoke from heat-not-burn cigarettes have 85% of the nicotine in conventional cigarettes. "We see this as an opportune entry point for long-term investors and would recommend building positions on today's broad weakness," Herzog said. "We also note that PM/MO's premarket tobacco product application with the FDA to commercialize iQOS in the U.S. remains under review." Altria shares have dropped 6.9% over the last three months and Philip Morris shares have risen 5.8%, compared with a 3.6% rise in the S&P 500 .

UPDATE: Invisalign maker Align stocks surge 8% after earnings blow past estimates
              
              Align Technology Inc. shares  surged 9% Friday to lead S&P 500 gainers, after the maker of Invisalign dental braces blew past second-quarter earnings estimates. San Jose, California-based Align said late Thursday it had net income of $69.2 million, or $85 cents a share, in the quarter,  up from $50.1 million, or 62 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. Revenue rose to $356.5 million from $176.9 million. The FactSet consensus was for EPS of 72 cents and revenue of $344 million. North American shipments rose 27.6% while international shipments jumped 37%. The company said Invisalign shipments to the teen market rose 37.6%, after hitting a milestone of 1 million teen patients.  The company said it now expects net revenue of $355 million to $360 million in the third quarter, and EPS of 78 cents to 81 cents. The FactSet consensus is for EPS of 81 cents and revenue of $359 million. Leerink analysts welcomed the progress made in the key teen market. "Our recent diligence suggests that orthodontists see Invisalign potentially capable of addressing 60+% of their Teen cases, which would be well-above our 8% estimated penetration into Align's North American teen TAM ("fully loaded" ~3.94M cases) by 2020," they wrote in a note. Align shares have gained 77% in 2017, while the S&P 500  has gained 11%.
