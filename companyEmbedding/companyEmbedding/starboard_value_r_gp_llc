NEW YORK, May 26, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Starboard Value LP (together with its affiliates, "Starboard"), one of the largest shareholders of Depomed, Inc. (NASDAQ:    DEPO) with an ownership interest in approximately 9.9% of Depomed's outstanding shares, today announced it has delivered an open letter to Depomed shareholders and intends to recommence the process for calling a Special Meeting of Depomed shareholders for removing and replacing the current Depomed Board of Directors with a modified slate of six highly qualified director nominees.
The full text of the letter follows:








May 26, 2016
Dear Fellow Shareholders,
Starboard Value LP, together with its affiliates ("Starboard"), currently has an ownership interest in approximately 9.9% of the outstanding shares of Depomed, Inc. ("Depomed" or the "Company"), making us one of the Company's largest shareholders.  
We believe that Depomed is deeply undervalued and significant opportunities exist within the control of management and the Board of Directors (the "Board") to unlock substantial value for the benefit of all shareholders. Unfortunately, as we outlined in our previous letter to Depomed on April 8th, we have significant concerns regarding serious corporate governance deficiencies, questionable capital allocation decisions, and egregious actions taken by the Board to stymie strategic interest in acquiring Depomed. We believe the Board clearly lacks the independence, objectivity, and perspective needed to make decisions that are in the best interests of shareholders.
To that end, we will be delivering to Depomed today a new written request, in accordance with Depomed's Bylaws, that the Board set a record date for determining the shareholders entitled to call a special meeting (the "Record Date Request Notice") for purposes of seeking to remove and replace the current Board. This Record Date Request Notice supersedes our initial request delivered to Depomed, dated April 7, 2016 (the "Initial Record Date Request Notice").  As you may recall, the Initial Record Date Request Notice was delivered to Depomed in order to preserve our rights under California law and mitigate the risk that Depomed would seek to further amend its governance provisions to suppress shareholder rights.
Since delivering the Initial Record Date Request Notice, we have undertaken an extensive process to carefully vet a slate of highly-qualified nominees that included the evaluation of over 100 qualified potential candidates. We have selected a group of six candidates possessing unique skill sets and perspectives directly relevant to Depomed's business and current challenges, including pharmaceutical operations, healthcare regulatory, finance, board governance and oversight, and mergers and acquisitions expertise. Collectively, our slate of director nominees has decades of experience serving on well-performing public company boards. Importantly, this group of nominees, if elected at the special meeting, is prepared to serve the shareholders of Depomed and ensure that the interests of all shareholders are of paramount importance.
We appreciate that the Board promptly set a record date in response to our Initial Record Date Request Notice, thereby demonstrating that it does not intend to unnecessarily delay the calling of a special meeting by shareholders. While we also appreciate the Board's intentions in amending its 10% poison pill rights plan ("Poison Pill") to facilitate our delivery of the requisite requests from shareholders in order to call the special meeting, there are other considerations as a 13D filer that make us uncomfortable with the idea of soliciting and delivering requests from other Depomed shareholders without conducting a public solicitation. Therefore, today we are filing preliminary proxy materials with the SEC in furtherance of soliciting the requisite requests to deliver the special meeting request. Our expectation is that the Board will adhere to a similar timetable in setting a record date for this Record Date Request Notice as it did with our Initial Record Date Request Notice, and we look forward to calling a special meeting of shareholders in the near future.
We are confident that you will find the team of professionals we are nominating to be incredibly well-qualified to serve as directors of Depomed. We have provided detailed biographies of each of our nominees below. Over the coming weeks and months, we intend to share our detailed views on Depomed and look forward to engaging with you as we approach the special meeting of shareholders.

NEW YORK, April 8, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Starboard Value LP (together with its affiliates, "Starboard"), one of the largest shareholders of Depomed, Inc. (NASDAQ:    DEPO) with an ownership interest in approximately 9.8% of Depomed's outstanding shares, today announced it has delivered a letter to President and CEO, Jim Schoeneck, and the Depomed Board of Directors. 
The full text of the letter follows:








April 8, 2016
Depomed, Inc.   7999 Gateway Boulevard, Suite 300   Newark, CA 94560   Attn: Jim Schoeneck, President and Chief Executive Officer  
cc: Board of Directors
Dear Jim,
Starboard Value LP, together with its affiliates ("Starboard"), has an ownership interest in approximately 9.8% of the outstanding shares of Depomed, Inc. ("Depomed" or the "Company"), making us one of the Company's largest shareholders.  We believe that Depomed is deeply undervalued and that significant opportunities exist to create value for the benefit of all shareholders based on actions that should be within the control of management and the Board of Directors (the "Board").  However, we are highly concerned regarding a number of actions that the Board has taken which indicate to us that meaningful change is needed to ensure the Company is acting in the best interest of all shareholders.  Specifically, we have significant concerns regarding serious corporate governance deficiencies, questionable capital allocation decisions, and egregious actions taken by the Board to stymie strategic interest in acquiring Depomed.  In combination, these concerns lead us to believe that management and the Board may be more interested in entrenching themselves than in delivering maximum value for all shareholders.
As we will discuss in this letter and subsequent materials, yesterday we delivered to the Company the documentation required under Depomed's bylaws to request that the Board set a record date for determining the shareholders entitled to call a special meeting (the "Record Date Request Notice").  We understand that we are taking extraordinary actions and are doing so because of our serious concerns with the Board's recent actions and long history of shareholder-unfriendly tactics.   
We acquired our position in Depomed because we believe that the Company is substantially undervalued and opportunities exist to create significant value for shareholders.  This includes an opportunity to improve capital deployment, rationalize research and development, and explore a potential sale of the Company given potential operating, financial, and tax synergies.  However, while still acquiring our position, Depomed filed preliminary proxy materials for the upcoming annual meeting with a proposal to change the Company's state of incorporation from California to Delaware (the "Reincorporation Proposal").  Upon further review, we identified unconventional provisions that indicate management and the Board are using the Reincorporation Proposal as a tactic to further entrench themselves by suppressing shareholder rights that currently exist under Depomed-California.  This is just the latest egregious example of poor corporate governance and entrenchment by this Board.  Apparently, it was not enough for the current Board to unilaterally adopt onerous and shareholder-unfriendly special meeting bylaw provisions in July 2015, as part of its efforts to fend off an unsolicited proposal to acquire the Company from Horizon Pharma plc ("Horizon").  Now, under the guise of the Reincorporation Proposal, the Board is attempting to:
(i) Increase the solicitation requirement to call a special meeting from 10% of the voting power, as it currently stands under California law, to 25% of the voting power, as would be required under Depomed-Delaware's bylaws; and
(ii) Eliminate altogether the ability of shareholders to call a special meeting to remove and replace current Board members; and
(iii) Prevent shareholders, for all practical purposes, from commencing a special meeting request process within 180 days of any Annual Meeting; and
(iv) Obtain the sole discretion and authority to effect the Delaware reincorporation at any time prior to the 2017 Annual Meeting.
These are not typical or standard provisions that would reasonably be included in such a reincorporation proposal.  These appear to be carefully crafted provisions with the specific intention of further limiting shareholder rights.  In addition, Depomed conveniently failed to disclose some of these material provisions in the Reincorporation Proposal section of its preliminary proxy and instead chose to bury these significant entrenchment provisions in Appendices D and E towards the very end of the proxy.  We intend to vigorously oppose the current version of the Reincorporation Proposal, and we advise other shareholders to fully consider these provisions and the significant ramifications they would have on shareholder rights.
Unfortunately, these shareholder-unfriendly tactics are just the latest attempts by the current Board to further entrench themselves.  The Board took similar actions following Horizon's unsolicited proposal to acquire the Company.  Specifically, on July 7, 2015, the Company received an unsolicited offer from Horizon to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Depomed in an all-stock transaction for $29.25 per share, which represented a 42% premium to the closing price of $20.64 per share on July 6, 2015.  At the time, this $29.25 per share offer price would have represented an all-time high stock price for the Company, and compares to the current Depomed stock price of $15.00 per share as of yesterday's close.
Rather than engage with Horizon in an attempt to negotiate a value-maximizing transaction, on July 12, 2015, the Board adopted bylaw amendments, as well as a 10% poison pill rights plan (the "Poison Pill"), designed to make it as difficult and time-consuming as possible for shareholders to potentially have a say on Horizon's offer at a special meeting.  Nevertheless, Horizon proceeded to comply with the arduous steps under the special meeting bylaw amendments in order to give shareholders a voice on its offer.  Institutional Shareholder Services ("ISS") and Glass, Lewis & Co. ("Glass Lewis"), two leading proxy advisory firms, expressed concerns about Depomed's shareholder-unfriendly bylaw amendments and Poison Pill, and supported Horizon's efforts to call a special meeting to remove and replace the Board, noting:
"Given that the poison pill and unilateral bylaw amendments adopted by the Depomed board materially impact shareholder rights, shareholders should provide consent FOR the special meeting requests." – ISS, September 26, 2015
"[i]n this case, [Glass Lewis] believe[s] it would be in the best interests of [Depomed] shareholders to consent to the calling of the Removal and Bylaw Amendments Special Meeting and the Election Special Meeting so that the merits of the underlying issues can be more carefully evaluated." – Glass Lewis, September 28, 2015
In early August 2015, Horizon's merger subsidiary filed a lawsuit against Depomed and the Board, seeking to invalidate the bylaw amendments and the Poison Pill under California law and alleging that the Board members had breached their fiduciary duties.  That same day, Depomed filed a lawsuit against Horizon alleging, among other things, a breach of contract and other violations of California law by Horizon based on Horizon's possession and misuse of confidential information it obtained from Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ("Janssen") under a confidentiality agreement.  Depomed moved for a preliminary injunction to prevent Horizon from continuing with its offer to acquire Depomed based on Horizon's alleged misuse of confidential information, which the court granted on November 19, 2015.  Despite the onerous bylaw requirements, Horizon was close to submitting the requisite consents for calling the special meeting in mid-November 2015.  Following the court decision, however, Horizon withdrew its then-increased offer of $33.00 per share.  Depomed stock reached a high of $33.74 on July 21, 2015 following Horizon's final offer.  Since then, Depomed's stock price has declined 56%, resulting in significant losses for shareholders.
In addition to the decline in Depomed's share price, shareholders are continuing to pay for the Company's ill-advised lawsuit against Horizon.  In 2015, Depomed paid approximately $11.9 million in legal fees associated with the defense of Horizon.  Shareholders are still paying the Company's legal fees as Depomed continues a lawsuit that appears to have more to do with management and the Board's self-preservation than protecting the best interests of shareholders.  We see no legitimate rationale for the Board's continued insistence in proceeding with a lawsuit that deprives shareholders of the potential for an approach by a strategic acquirer.  This lawsuit sets a terrible precedent for potential future value creation, and significantly undermines the rights of Depomed shareholders.
This Company has a troubling record of manipulating Depomed's corporate machinery to entrench management and the Board.  This was clearly evident throughout Horizon's attempt to acquire the Company and has become even more evident with regard to Depomed's latest attempt to eliminate altogether the ability of shareholders to seek the removal of Board members at a special meeting under the guise of a Delaware reincorporation. 
Given the apparent willingness of the current Board members to take extraordinary action to entrench themselves, as exemplified by the Reincorporation Proposal, we have little choice at this time but to immediately commence the process to call a special meeting of shareholders in order to preserve our rights under California law and Depomed's current bylaws.  Therefore, yesterday, we delivered to the Company the documentation required under Depomed's bylaws to request that the Board set a record date for determining the shareholders entitled to call a special meeting (the "Record Date Request Notice").  Depomed's onerous special meeting bylaws require that we put forth our slate of director candidates as part of this initial step in commencing the special meeting process.
Given that the Reincorporation Proposal was publicly disclosed only three days ago on April 5, 2016, and our view that the members of the Board will go to any length to entrench themselves, out of an abundance of caution, we are immediately nominating six individuals, five of whom are Starboard Value investment professionals.  We intend to continue our search for a slate of director candidates that will ensure an experienced, diverse, and independent board, as has been our practice when proposing alternative board slates over the past fourteen years.  However, we deemed it necessary to take this action to preserve our rights as shareholders, and to ensure compliance with Depomed's current onerous bylaw requirements, so that management cannot further manipulate the bylaws prior to our ability to take action.
We are taking this extraordinary action because we cannot risk that the current Board may seek to further manipulate Depomed's bylaws to prevent a lawful special meeting request.  We caution the Board against taking any steps in response to our special meeting Record Date Request Notice to further diminish or suppress the rights of its shareholders to call a special meeting under California law and the Company's bylaws.
We have an ownership interest in approximately 9.8% of the outstanding shares of Depomed because we believe that significant opportunities exist to create value through better execution, improved capital allocation, and, potentially, a sale of the Company.  We hope to have a constructive dialogue with the Company, but need to make sure that shareholders' interests remain of paramount importance.  As such, we fully expect that management and the Board will halt their pattern of aggressive entrenchment behavior and take no action to further frustrate shareholders' rights. Additionally, despite recent rhetoric from management to the contrary, we believe that Depomed should not be contemplating acquisitions at this time given its levered capital structure and expensive debt.
To be clear, we are not currently advocating for any one particular transaction, or any transaction at all, but we firmly believe that board change is necessary to best represent the interests of all shareholders as it relates to the ongoing business and any potential transaction opportunities in the future.  Given your actions, and history of actions, we cannot take the risk that you further impair our shareholder rights.  We intend to share more details with shareholders in the coming weeks regarding our views on the Company, opportunities for value creation, and Depomed's significant corporate governance deficiencies.
Best Regards,

2.Appointment as Observer. The Company and Starboard hereby agree that following the 2017
Annual Meeting, Mr. Molinelli, during the Period (as defined in the Agreement) shall have the right to serve as a non-voting observer
(an “Observer”) to the Board of Directors of the Company (the “Board”). As an Observer, Mr.
Molinelli will (i) receive copies of all notices and written information furnished to the full Board in connection with each meeting,
reasonably in advance of such meeting to the extent practicable, and (ii) be permitted to be present at, but not vote at, all meetings
of the full Board (whether by telephone or in person). The Company shall be entitled to withhold any information and exclude Mr.
Molinelli from any meeting, or any portion thereof, (x) that is an executive session of the Board, (y) as is reasonably determined
by the Company to be necessary to protect the Company’s attorney-client privilege, or (z) that relates to matters as to which
the Company reasonably determines that there may be a conflict of interest between Mr. Molinelli or Starboard on the one hand,
and the Company on the other hand. As a condition to Mr. Molinelli serving as an Observer, Mr. Molinelli shall deliver an undertaking
to the Company agreeing to comply with all policies, procedures, processes, codes, rules, standards and guidelines applicable to
Board members, including the Company’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, securities trading policies, anti-hedging policies,
Regulation FD-related policies, director confidentiality policies and corporate governance guidelines. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Mr. Molinelli, if he wishes to do so, may provide confidential information of the Company which Mr. Molinelli learns in his capacity
as an Observer to the Board, including discussions or matters considered in meetings of the Board or Board committees (collectively,
“Company Confidential Information”), to Starboard, its Affiliates and Associates (each as defined in the Agreement)
and legal counsel (collectively, “Starboard Representatives”), in each case solely to the extent such Starboard
Representatives need to know such information in connection with Starboard’s investment in the Company; provided,
however, that Starboard (i) shall inform such Starboard Representatives of the confidential nature of any such Company Confidential
Information and (ii) shall cause such Starboard Representatives to refrain from disclosing such Company Confidential Information
to anyone (whether to any company in which Starboard has an investment or otherwise), by any means, or otherwise from using the
information in any way other than in connection with Starboard’s investment in the Company. Mr. Molinelli and Starboard shall
not, without the prior written consent of the Company, otherwise disclose any Company Confidential Information to any other person
or entity.
 
 


3.Miscellaneous. Except as specifically provided for in this Amendment, all of the terms of
the Agreement shall remain unchanged and are hereby confirmed and remain in full force and effect. The terms and provisions of
Sections 6, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 15 of the Agreement are incorporated herein by reference as if set forth herein and shall apply mutatis
mutandis to this Amendment. For the avoidance of doubt, so long as Starboard beneficially owns in the aggregate at least the
lesser of (x) 3.0% of the Company’s then outstanding Common Stock and (y) 1,862,986 shares of Common Stock (subject to adjustment
for stock splits, reclassifications, combinations and similar adjustments) as of the date that Mr. Molinelli no longer serves as
a director of the Company, Starboard shall have the right to recommend a substitute person to serve on the Board in place of Mr.
Molinelli in accordance with Section 1(a)(iv) of the Agreement, and the Company shall take whatever actions may be required by
Section 1(a)(iv) of the Agreement in connection with any such replacement director, and shall if necessary increase the size of
the Board.

Item 4.Purpose
                                         of Transaction.

The Reporting Persons purchased
the Shares based on the Reporting Persons’ belief that the Shares, when purchased, were substantially undervalued and represented
an attractive investment opportunity.  Depending upon overall market conditions, other investment opportunities available
to the Reporting Persons, and the availability of Shares at prices that would make the purchase or sale of Shares desirable, the
Reporting Persons may endeavor to increase or decrease their position in the Issuer through, among other things, the purchase or
sale of Shares on the open market or in private transactions or otherwise, on such terms and at such times as the Reporting Persons
may deem advisable.
 
The Reporting Persons believe
there is a substantial opportunity to improve the Issuer’s operating margins given the large disparity in the Issuer’s
margins versus its best-in class peers. Based on recent press reports, the Reporting Persons understand that the Issuer may be
working with investment bankers to explore a sale of the Issuer. The Reporting Persons believe that if the Issuer runs a legitimate,
robust process to explore strategic alternatives, there would be significant strategic and financial buyer interest in such sale
process.
 
Starboard Value LP has retained
D. Jamie Macdonald to consult with the Reporting Persons regarding the pharmaceutical and healthcare services industries, including
the Issuer. Mr. Macdonald has substantial experience as an industry executive, including as CEO of INC Research and SVP and Head
of Global Project Management of Quintiles, where he helped to significantly improve operating margins. Starboard Value LP entered
into an Advisor Agreement with Mr. Macdonald defined and described in Item 6 below.

actions discussed herein.  The Reporting Persons intend to review their investment in the Issuer on a continuing basis. 
Depending on various factors including, without limitation, the Issuer’s financial position and investment strategy, the
