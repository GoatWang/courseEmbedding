Redwood Mortgage Corp.,
Manager


  



March 2017





Redwood Mortgage Investors IX, a
Delaware Limited Liability Company
Fair Value per Unit at December 31,
2016

Background

Redwood Mortgage Corp. (RMC or
manager) obtained information regarding the fair value of a unit of
membership interest and of net assets at December 31, 2016
(the valuation date) for Redwood Mortgage Investors IX, a Delaware
Limited Liability Company (RMI IX). A qualified, nationally
prominent firm performed the analysis in accordance with scope
criteria, objectives and an overall approach set by RMC. The
purpose of their valuation was to provide an opinion of the fair
value of a unit of membership interest, which is determined
principally by the fair value of the commercial mortgage loans held
in portfolio (collectively referred to as, the “subject
items”) and the liquidity available to the members, inclusive
of redemption price and distribution factors. The firm understood
that the valuation report would be used by the manager for
financial and regulatory reporting purposes, specifically FINRA
Rule 2310 and NASD Rule 2340. Income (including Discounted Cash
Flow methods), Market and Cost approaches were utilized, as
appropriate, in deriving the fair values.

Fair Value of a Unit of
Membership Interest for RMI IX

Based on the analysis summarized
below, RMC concurred with the firm’s conclusion that the fair
value of a unit of membership interest, as of the valuation date is
$0.98.

RMI IX membership units have certain
restrictions, as to transferability and redemption including
maximums on individual and total annual and quarterly redemption
amounts. To provide liquidity, members have the option after one
year to sell their shares back to the company for $1.00 per unit,
adjusted for the years held (one year – 92% of the lesser of
the purchase price or the account balance, two years –
94%, three years – 96%, four years – 98%, five years
and longer – 100%).

The following three methods for
valuing the $1 per unit redemption price – considering these
restrictions – are outlined below.
 



 


1.


The
Black-Scholes-Merten option-pricing model was used as a proxy or
method to calculate the unit value. The Black-Scholes-Merton model
is a mathematical formula used to calculate a theoretical call
value using key determinants of an option’s price: stock
price, strike price, volatility, time to expiration, and short-term
(risk-free) interest rate. The volatility is derived from the
trading volatilities of companies comparable to RMI IX for a term
commensurate with the expected term of maturity. Using these
inputs, the Black-Scholes-Merton model produces an option value of
$0.99 (same as at year end 2015).



 



 


2.


Based on the
average age of an investment in RMI IX of 3.5 years, the redemption
rate discount, as outlined above, would be at approximately
4 percent of the current membership units and a weighted
average of 1.5 years until the shares can be redeemed at the
contractual $1.00. Based on the net asset value being above par and
the limited redemptions since inception, it appears highly likely
the members would not redeem until fully vested. The firm
calculated the present value of the $1 unit value, using a
risk free rate of return over the remaining 18-month period, of
1.03 percent, resulting in a calculated partnership unit value
as of the valuation date of $0.98 (same as at year end
2015).



 



 


3.


Based on the
average age of an investment in RMI IX of 3.5 years, the weighted
average redemption percentage is 96%. The rounded value of a
unit based on this method for a $1.00 redemption amount (before
discount) would be $0.96 ($0.97 at year end 2015). This amount
is considered to be the floor value.




Valuation of the Commercial
Mortgage Loan Portfolio

The fair value of the loan portfolio
is approximately $42.7 million, representing a premium of
approximately $2.6 million (6.6%) from the book
value.











Redwood
Mortgage Investors IX, LLC Per Unit Fair Value


  



P a g e |

At December 31, 2016, RMI IX had a loan
portfolio with a gross balance of $40.1 million. These
commercial mortgage loans were secured by single-family residences
(55 percent), apartments and condominiums (22 percent), mixed use
and retail (14 percent), and other office, commercial &
industrial, warehouse, etc., making up the remaining
9 percent. The balances and key characteristics of each loan
strata came from RMI IX’s loan trial balance and were,
classified into pools of like assets and then valued, as
appropriate.

The valuation work was completed in
accordance with ASC 820 (from the Codification of Accounting
Standards published by the FASB), which calls for a priority of
valuation methods. In the context of a loan portfolio valuation,
Level 1 inputs are direct sale quotes for the specific loans;
Level 2 inputs are sales of comparable loans and, Level 3
inputs require the use of management assumptions in determining the
fair value of the loans. The critical reasons for the lack of
Level 1 or 2 quotes are as follows:
 



 


•


 


Non-Standardization : mortgage and
commercial real estate credit generally is specific to an in- house
lending policy, borrower needs, local market conditions, and for
RMC’s loans in particular (which are of shorter term and
lower LTV’s,) - the unique characteristics of the real
property collateralizing the loans. With the exception of certain
types of mortgage credit, the terms and conditions usually do not
fit a conforming standard that are consistent across loans. As
such, mortgage and commercial real estate loans often are not
liquid and an inducement to investors requires a significant
premium. Interests in some large loans are traded in the secondary
market, but generally with very low frequency; the vast majority of
loans never trade after origination and syndication.

Market
Preferences : In times of market turmoil, fixed-income
investors often pursue less risky investments, such as
U.S. government bonds and bills, agency securities and
investment grade corporate bonds and notes. To induce market
investors to invest in certain loans requires a sig

OUR ROOTS GO WAY BACK



Today, Russ’s son, Michael Burwell, leads the company along with a team of highly skilled professionals, many of whom have worked together at Redwood Mortgage for over 25 years.


	When Russ Burwell Founded Redwood Mortgage Corp. in 1978, he had two goals:


Provide homeowners, homebuyers and entrepreneurs a source of capital, and

Provide investors with a consistent source of income


	Russ achieved those goals by designing an investment program backed by a portfolio of carefully selected, short-term loans secured by deeds of trust on high-quality California properties.

	That was over 30 years ago. Since then, Redwood Mortgage Corp. has arranged, underwritten and serviced over a billion dollars in loans and sponsored ten investment programs, including its current program, Redwood Mortgage Investors IX, LLC.

FIRMLY ESTABLISHED VALUES

	As President and CEO of Redwood Mortgage, Michael Burwell continues to strengthen and advance the company legacy of conservative investments, sound underwriting procedures and strong sense of family, ethics and community. Throughout the years, Redwood has remained committed to those values. Our roots in California real estate have grown strong because of it.

	We are proud of our heritage and the trust that homeowners, businesses, and investors have placed in us. We believe our growth will continue with the same steady and consistent investment approach that has served us so well in the past.

	When you invest with Redwood Mortgage, you invest with the confidence that comes from experience gained in over 30 years and ten investment programs.

WHO WE ARE
Redwood Mortgage Corp. is an established financial organization with over 30 years of experience in arranging and funding mortgage loans secured by California real estate. Our company was founded on the idea that mortgages, selected by experienced, knowledgeable professionals, would provide a steady source of income for its investors.


		Over the years we have enjoyed steady growth while staying true to our original philosophy. While we embrace new technologies, our underlying approach to real estate lending has remained largely unchanged since we began operations in 1978. This formula for success has generally served both our investors and borrowers well.

		For the borrower, we provide tailor-made loan solutions secured by residential, multi-family, commercial and mixed-use properties funded through mortgage pools. For the investor, we provide a level of investor confidence and customer service based on our integrity and positive portfolio performance. As a result, Redwood Mortgage Corp. has earned a position of industry trust of which we are very proud.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S
REPORT

Board of Directors
Redwood Mortgage Corporation
San Mateo, California

We have audited the accompanying
financial statement of Redwood Mortgage Corp, which are comprised
of the balance sheet as of December 31, 2015, and the related notes
to the balance sheet.

Management’s
Responsibility for the Balance Sheet

Management is responsible for the
preparation and fair presentation of this balance sheet in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America; this includes the design, implementation,
and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and
fair presentation of the balance sheet that is free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

Auditor’s
Responsibility

Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on this balance sheet based on our audit. We conducted our
audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in
the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the balance sheet is free from material misstatement.

An audit involves performing
procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and
disclosures in the balance sheet. The procedures selected depend on
the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks
of material misstatement of the balance sheet, whether due to fraud
or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers
internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation and
fair presentation of the balance sheet in order to design audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for
the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the
entity’s internal control. Accordingly, we express no such
opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of
accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant
accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the
overall presentation of the balance sheet.

We believe that the audit evidence
we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis
for our audit opinion.

Opinion

In our opinion, the balance sheet
referred to above presents fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of Redwood Mortgage Corp as of December 31, 2015
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America.

REDWOOD MORTGAGE CORP.
NOTES TO THE BALANCE SHEET
December 31, 2015

NOTE 1 – ORGANIZATIONAL
AND GENERAL

Redwood Mortgage Corp. (RMC) is
owned by Michael R. Burwell (Burwell), the D. Russell Burwell and
Carol E. Burwell 1994 Irrevocable Trust (the Trust) and a related
Burwell family trust. RMC’s articles of incorporation
authorized 100,000 shares of common stock of which 1,000 shares are
issued and outstanding with a stated value of $4,000. Effective
June 30, 2015, RMC’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Gymno LLC
(Gymno), merged with RMC, and in June 2015, another wholly-owned
subsidiary, Weeks LLC, was dissolved, after the real property asset
it held was sold.

RMC, as a real estate broker
licensed with the State of California, originates, arranges and
services loans with various maturities for five California limited
partnerships, and a Delaware limited liability company
(collectively, the affiliated mortgage funds). From time to time
RMC, from its own account, may fund loans and later assign them to
the affiliated mortgage funds or sell the loans to non-affiliates.
As of December 31, 2015, total assets under management by RMC
was approximately $230.3 million, which consisted of mortgage loans
of approximately $95.6 million, real estate owned (REO) of $91.9
million and the balance in cash and other assets, substantially all
for the affiliated mortgage funds.

Affiliated mortgage
funds

The affiliated mortgage funds,
sponsored by RMC, are as follows.
 



 


•


 


Redwood
Mortgage Investors IX (RMI IX), a Delaware limited liability
company- RMC is the managing member.



 



 


•


 


California
limited partnerships - Redwood Mortgage Investors IV (RMI IV),
Redwood Mortgage Investors V (RMI V) , Redwood Mortgage Investors
VI (RMI VI), - Redwood Mortgage Investors VII (RMI VII) and Redwood
Mortgage Investors VIII (RMI VIII) - RMC and Burwell are the
general partners (GP’s).




The rights, duties and powers of the
general and limited partners of the partnerships are governed by
the limited partnership agreements and Sections 15900 et seq. of
the California Corporations Code. The rights, duties and powers of
the members and the manager of RMI IX are governed by the operating
agreement, the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act and the
California Revised Uniform Limited Liability Company
Act.

The above entities were organized by
RMC for the purpose of making and investing in mortgage loans
secured by the California real estate. Under these programs, an
investor elects to receive periodic cash distributions of earnings
or to have the earnings retained or reinvested (in the case of RMI
IX) in the investor’s capital account.

-Publicly offered mortgage
programs

RMC has sponsored four publicly
offered programs.

NOTE 2 – SUMMARY OF
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of
presentation

The accompanying balance sheet of
RMC was prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. RMC’s balance sheet
does not include the accounts or balances of the affiliated
mortgage funds.

RMC is required by California
regulations to utilize trust accounts through which are processed
cash disbursements and receipts on certain mortgage loans of the
affiliated mortgage funds. As RMC does not have an ownership
interest in these clearing accounts, the accompanying balance sheet
does not include the activities, nor the balance, of these
accounts.

Management
estimates

The preparation of financial
statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”)
requires management to make estimates and assumptions about the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosures of
contingent assets and liabilities, at the dates of the financial
statements. Such estimates relate principally to the determination
of the fair value of loans, primarily loans designated impaired,
and the fair value of the related real estate collateral and real
estate owned, if any. Actual results could differ significantly
from these estimates.

REDWOOD MORTGAGE CORP.
NOTES TO THE BALANCE SHEET
December 31, 2015
 
NOTE 2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES (continued)
 
- Fair Value Estimates

GAAP defines fair value as the
exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to
transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most
advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly
transaction between market participants on the measurement date
(i.e. the balance sheet date). An orderly transaction is a
transaction that assumes exposure to the market for a period prior
to the measurement date to allow for marketing activities that are
usual and customary for transactions involving such assets and
liabilities; it is not a forced transaction. Market
participants are buyers and sellers in the principal market that
are (i) independent, (ii) knowledgeable, (iii) able
to transact and (iv) willing to transact.

The Company has no assets or
liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis.

Fair values of assets and
liabilities are determined based on the fair value hierarchy
established in GAAP. The hierarchy is comprised of three levels of
inputs to be used.
 



 


•


 


Level 1 inputs
are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical
assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access at
the measurement date. An active market is a market in which
transactions occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide
pricing information on an ongoing basis.



 



 


•


 


Level 2 inputs
are inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the
asset or liability, either directly or indirectly in active markets
and quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities that are not
active, and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable or
inputs derived from or corroborated by market data.



 



 


•


 


Level 3 inputs
are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. Unobservable
inputs reflect the Company’s own assumptions about the
assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or
liability (including assumptions about risk). Unobservable inputs
are developed based on the best information available in the
circumstances and may include the partnership’s own
data.




- Brokerage rights, mortgages,
net / formation loans

RMC, as a result of provisions in
the agreements with the affiliated mortgage funds, recognized as an
asset, its exclusive rights:
 



1)


to act as the
loan broker in arranging mortgage loans,



 



2)


to act as
servicing agent for all mortgages owned by the affiliated mortgage
funds and



 



3)


to be
compensated by the affiliated mortgage funds for 1) loan brokerage
commissions and 2) mortgage service fees.




Loan brokerage commissions are paid
to RMC when a loan is funded and mortgage servicing fees are earned
by RMC during the time loans are outstanding. The asset is referred
to as Brokerage rights, mortgages.

REDWOOD MORTGAGE CORP.
NOTES TO THE BALANCE SHEET
December 31, 2015
 
NOTE 2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES (continued)

- Brokerage rights, mortgages,
net / formation loans (continued)
 
The initial carrying values of these brokerage
rights are the total of the amounts RMC pays for commissions and
fees to broker-dealers on sales of limited partner or member
interests in the affiliated mortgage funds, plus unreimbursed
organization and offering expenses (O & O expenses),
if any, from any offering of limited partners or member interests.
RMC advances certain O & O expenses on behalf of RMI
IX, as it had done for the other affiliated mortgage funds. RMI IX
is obligated to reimburse RMC for O & O expenses up
to an amount equal to 4.5% of gross offering proceeds from sales of
member units until RMC has been fully reimbursed. Thereafter, RMI
IX pays these costs directly.

The Brokerage rights, mortgages are
amortized on an accelerated method over the approximated period
loan brokerage commissions and servicing fees are expected to be
earned by RMC.

RMC finances the payments of the
commissions to broker-dealers during the offering period with
advances from the particular affiliated mortgage fund. Collectively
these advances are the formation loans. The formation loans are
non-interest bearing and are repaid as provided for by the
entities’ operating agreements, principally from the loan
brokerage commissions earned by RMC. Accordingly, from time to
time, as RMC has gone through periods of not earning or receiving
loan brokerage commissions, the repayment terms of the formation
loans may be modified as proposed by the general partners, as
circumstances may warrant. Interest has been imputed on the
formation loans at the market rate of interest in effect in the
years of the offerings.

If the general partners/managing
members are removed and RMC is no longer receiving payments for
services rendered, the related formation loan is forgiven, and
would be an offset to any impairment otherwise resulting to the
carrying value of the brokerage rights, mortgage loans.

At least annually, RMC reviews the
estimated amounts of future loan originations and the balances of
loans being serviced to determine that the sum of the undiscounted
net cash flows therefrom exceeds the carrying value of the
brokerage-related rights.

Cash and cash
equivalents

The Company considers all highly
liquid financial instruments with maturities of three months or
less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. Periodically,
Company cash balances in banks exceed federally insured
limits.

Loans, advances and interest
income

Loans and advances generally are
stated at the unpaid principal balance (principal).

Real estate owned
(REO)

REO includes real estate acquired
through purchase or foreclosure and is either being operated as
rental properties or is idle property awaiting more favorable
market conditions. REO is recorded at acquisition at the lower of
the recorded investment in the loan, plus any senior indebtedness,
or at the property’s estimated fair value, net. After
acquisition, costs incurred relating to the development and
improvement of the property are capitalized, whereas costs relating
to operating or holding the property are expensed. Subsequent to
acquisition, management periodically compares the carrying value of
real estate to expected undiscounted future cash flows for the
purpose of assessing the recoverability of the recorded amounts. If
the carrying value exceeds future undiscounted cash flows, the
assets are reduced to estimated fair value.

NOTE 2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES (continued)
 
Fixed assets

Fixed assets generally are stated at
cost. Depreciation and amortization are computed on a straight-line
basis over estimated useful lives ranging from three to seven
years.

Income taxes

Income taxes are provided for those
taxes currently payable and those deferred. A provision (benefit)
for income taxes is provided for deferred taxes resulting from
differences in the timing of reporting revenue and expense items
for financial versus tax purposes.

The Company evaluated its current
tax positions and has concluded that as of December 31, 2015,
the Company does not have any significant uncertain tax positions
for which a reserve would be necessary.

Recent accounting
pronouncements

In November 2015, the FASB issued
ASU No. 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet
Classification of Deferred Taxes , which eliminates the
guidance that required an entity to separate deferred tax
liabilities and

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
