	Stillwater Mining Company Reports Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2016 Results







	LITTLETON, Colo., Feb. 16, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --

	Stillwater Mining Company (“Stillwater” or “the Company")

	(NYSE:SWC) today reported financial results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2016.



	Fourth Quarter 2016 Highlights:



	Announced proposed acquisition of Stillwater by Sibanye Gold Limited ("Sibanye") for USD$18 per share in cash


	PGM mined sales of 134,500 ounces, an increase of 11.8% from 120,300 ounces sold during the fourth quarter of 2015


	Costs of metals sold of $525 per PGM mined ounce, down 1.7% from $534 per PGM mined ounce for the fourth quarter of 2015


	PGM mined production of 132,100 ounces, compared to 132,400 PGM mined ounces during the fourth quarter of 2015; fourth quarter 2016 planned mined production was reduced by approximately 3,000 ounces due to weather-related road closures


	All-in sustaining costs (AISC)* of $661 per PGM mined ounce produced, up 7.8% from $613 per PGM mined ounce for the fourth quarter of 2015


	AISC for the fourth quarter of 2016 includes $15 per PGM mined ounce spend on productivity enhancement projects


	Processed 169,200 ounces of recycled palladium, platinum and rhodium, an increase of 30.4% over 129,800 ounces recycled during the fourth quarter of 2015


	Cash and cash equivalents plus highly liquid investments of $450.1 million at quarter end


	Consolidated net income attributable to common stockholders of $6.0 million, equivalent to net income of $0.05 per diluted share



	Full-Year 2016 Highlights:



	Achieved all 2016 guidance metrics


	Achieved a record safety performance for the second consecutive year, with a reportable incidence rate improvement of 14.2% compared to 2015


	PGM mined sales of 549,200 ounces, an increase of 8.3% from 507,300 ounces sold during 2015


	Costs of metals sold of $509 per PGM mined ounce, down 12.1% from $579 per PGM mined ounce for 2015


	PGM mined production of 545,300 ounces, a 4.7% increase from 520,800 PGM mined ounces during 2015


	AISC of $622 per PGM mined ounce produced, an improvement of 12.3% from $709 per PGM mined ounce for 2015


	Processed a Company record 668,300 ounces of recycled palladium, platinum and rhodium, an increase of 21.3% over 551,100 ounces recycled during 2015


	Consolidated net income attributable to common stockholders of $9.5 million, equivalent to net income of $0.08 per diluted share




	Proposed Transaction with Sibanye:



	On December 9, 2016, the Company entered into an agreement with Sibanye, under which Sibanye will acquire the Company for $18.00 per share in cash, representing an aggregate enterprise value of $2.2 billion. The $18.00 per share transaction price represents a 61% premium to Stillwater's volume-weighted average share price over the 52 weeks prior to the announcement of the transaction, a 25% premium to its volume-weighted share price over the 30 trading days prior to the announcement and a 23% premium to its closing share price on December 8, 2016.


	The closing of the merger is subject to certain conditions including shareholder and regulatory approvals. Additional details regarding the proposed transaction are available in the preliminary proxy statement that was filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission on January 24, 2017. Pending the receipt of all required approvals or waivers, the Company currently anticipates the completion of the merger during the second quarter of 2017.


	Commenting on the fourth quarter and full-year 2016 results, Mick McMullen, the Company’s President and Chief Executive Officer stated, “We are proud to announce today that Stillwater has again achieved all annual guidance targets. These achievements during 2016 are significant as they have been accomplished in conjunction with another record safety performance and simultaneous progress on the Blitz project throughout the year. The Company improved on its previous safety record, achieved just last year, with a 14.2% safety incidence rate improvement for 2016. In addition, the Company achieved a recycling record, processing 668,300 ounces of palladium, platinum and rhodium during 2016.


	“We continue our focus on Blitz, our primary growth project. The progress on the two critical path items to first production, the 56 East development heading and the 53 East decline continues ahead of plan. In addition, the Benbow access portal, on the east end of the Blitz project advanced over 240 feet during the fourth quarter of 2016 and continues to accelerate its development rates.


	"AISC increased in the fourth quarter as spending on productivity improvement projects continued and we expect to see the benefits of this spend in the coming quarters. In addition, severe winter weather resulted in road closures that prevented access to the mines for several shifts during December and resulted in the loss of approximately 3,000 ounces of production. Despite this, the Company met its guidance for the year."


	Mr. McMullen concluded, “I would like to thank our team for the continuous focus on improvement in all areas of the business. These efforts have resulted in another strong quarter and year in which our stated goals were achieved.”



	Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2016 Results:



	For the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company reported consolidated net income attributable to common stockholders of $6.0 million, equivalent to net income of $0.05 per diluted share. For the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company reported consolidated net income attributable to common stockholders of $4.4 million, equivalent to net income of $0.04 per diluted share. The increase in net income for the fourth quarter of 2016 was impacted by the rise in the number of mined PGM ounces sold and the higher sales price per PGM mined ounce realized compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. Underlying earnings* attributable to common stockholders for the fourth quarter of 2016 were $7.1 million (after tax), which excluded transactional costs associated with the proposed acquisition of the Company by Sibanye.


	For the full-year 2016, the Company reported consolidated net income attributable to common stockholders of $9.5 million, equivalent to net income of $0.08 per diluted share. In 2015, the Company reported a consolidated net loss attributable to common shareholders of $11.9 million, equivalent to a loss of $0.10 per share. The increase in net income reflects the larger number of mined PGM ounces sold and the decrease in average sales price per mined PGM ounce during 2016. Underlying earnings* for 2016 were $10.6 million (after-tax) adjusted for transactional costs associated with the proposed acquisition of the Company by Sibanye, compared to underlying earnings of $26.1 million (after-tax) for 2015, adjusted for an impairment charge, loss on repurchase of a portion of the convertible debentures and reorganization charges.

	Total recycled PGM ounces fed to the smelter during the fourth quarter of 2016 were up 30.4% from the prior year quarter to 169,200 ounces. For the full-year 2016, the Company processed a record 668,300 recycled PGM ounces, an increase of 21.3% from 2015.


	PGM Recycling segment revenues totaled $109.4 million for the 2016 fourth quarter, an increase from $87.2 million in the same period of 2015. The Company's combined average realized price for sales of recycled palladium, platinum and rhodium increased to $792 per ounce in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to $782 per ounce in the fourth quarter of 2015. Recycling sales volumes for the fourth quarter of 2016 increased to 134,900 ounces from 108,700 ounces sold in the fourth quarter of 2015. In conjunction, tolled ounces returned to customers decreased to 31,800 ounces for the fourth quarter of 2016 from 54,700 ounces in the fourth quarter of 2015.


	PGM Recycling segment revenues totaled $305.9 million for full-year 2016, compared to $310.2 million in 2015. For 2016, the Company’s combined average realized sales price for recycled palladium, platinum and rhodium was $736 per ounce, down from $886 per ounce for 2015.  Recycling sales volumes for 2016 totaled 401,100 ounces, an increase from 340,200 ounces sold for 2015. For 2016, tolled ounces returned totalled 228,300, an increase from 205,000 returned in 2015.


	PGM Recycling segment costs of metals sold totaled $106.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, an increase from $84.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. For the full-year 2016, PGM Recycling segment costs of metals sold decreased to $294.9 million from $300.7 million for 2015. A majority of the costs of metals sold from recycling in each period is attributable to the acquisition cost of purchasing recyclable materials for the Company's own account; therefore, the aggregate costs of metals sold from the PGM Recycling segment is driven by the volume and the value of the PGMs in the materials purchased by the Company.


	General and administrative costs were $9.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, compared to $6.4 million incurred during the same period of 2015. Contributing to the increase in the fourth quarter of 2016 was the $1.7 million of transactional costs associated with the potential acquisition of the Company by Sibanye. For the full-year 2016, general and administrative costs were $34.7 million compared to $34.0 million in 2015.



	Costs of Metals Sold Per PGM Mined Ounce:



	Costs of metals sold per PGM mined ounce totaled $525 for the fourth quarter of 2016, a decrease from $534 recorded for the fourth quarter of 2015. For the full-year 2016, costs of metals sold per PGM mined ounce totaled $509, a decrease from $579 for 2015.





	All-In Sustaining Costs Per PGM Mined Ounce Produced:



	AISC per PGM mined ounce produced totaled $661 for the fourth quarter of 2016, an increase from $613 recorded for the same period of 2015. AISC per PGM mined ounce produced during the full-year 2016 was $622, a decrease from $709 for 2015.

The Company is engaged in the development, extraction and processing of PGMs from a geological formation in south-central Montana recognized as the J-M Reef. The J-M Reef is the only known significant source of PGMs in the U.S. and the highest-grade PGM resource known in the world. The Company also recycles PGMs from spent catalytic converters and other industrial sources. The Company owns the Marathon PGM-copper deposit in Ontario, Canada, and the Altar porphyry copper-gold deposit located in the San Juan province of Argentina. The Company’s shares are traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "SWC". Information about the Company can be found at its website: www.stillwatermining.com.

	This press release includes "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the "safe harbor" provisions of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of words such as "target," "will," "forecast," "expect," "potential," "intend," "estimate," "anticipate," "can" and other similar expressions that predict or indicate future events or trends or that are not statements of historical matters.

	(1)  Sub-grade tons milled includes reef waste material only. Reef waste material is PGM-bearing mined material below the cutoff grade for proven and probable reserves but with sufficient economic value to justify processing it through the concentrator along with the mined ore. Total tons milled includes ore tons and sub-grade tons only. See

	“Proven and Probable Ore Reserves – Discussion

	” in the Company’s 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.




	(2)  Total cash costs include total operating costs plus royalties, insurance and taxes other than income taxes.

	Total cash costs per PGM mined ounce, net of credits

	is a non-GAAP financial measure that management uses to monitor and evaluate the efficiency of its mining operations. This measure of cost is not defined under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). Please see

	Reconciliation of GAAP Financial Measures to Non-GAAP Financial Measures

	and the accompanying discussion for additional detail.




	(3)  The concentrate tonnage and grade values are inclusive of periodic re-processing of smelter slag and internal furnace brick PGM bearing materials.

	(1)  Ounces sold and average realized price per ounce from

	PGM Recycling

	relate to ounces produced from processing of spent catalyst from catalytic converters and other industrial sources.




	(2)  By-product metals sold reflect net values of realized prices (discounted due to product form) per unit sold.




	(3)  The Company’s average realized price represents revenues, hedging gains and losses realized on commodity instruments and agreement discounts, divided by ounces sold.




	(4)  The average market price represents the average London market for the actual months of the period.




	(5)  The Company reports a combined average realized and market price of palladium and platinum at the same ratio as ounces that are produced from the base metal refinery.





	RECONCILIATION OF GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES TO NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES




	The Company utilizes certain non-GAAP financial measures as indicators in assessing the performance of its mining and processing operations during any period. Because of the processing time required to complete the extraction of finished PGM products, there are typically lags of one to three months between ore production and sale of the finished product. Costs of metals sold - Mine Production, the Company's most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, in any period includes some portion of material mined and processed from prior periods as the process is completed. Consequently, while costs of metals sold - Mine Production (a GAAP measure included in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss)) appropriately reflects the expense associated with the materials sold in any period, the Company has developed certain non-GAAP financial measures to assess the costs associated with its producing and processing activities in a particular period and to compare those costs between periods.


	While the Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures may also be of value to outside readers, both as general indicators of the Company’s mining efficiency from period to period and as insight into how the Company internally measures its operating performance, these non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized across the mining industry and in most cases will not be directly comparable to similar measures that may be provided by other companies. These non-GAAP financial measures are only useful as indicators of relative operational performance in any period, and because they do not take into account the inventory timing differences that are included in costs of metals sold - Mine Production, they cannot meaningfully be used to develop measures of earnings or profitability. A reconciliation of these measures to costs of metals sold - Mine Production, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, for each period shown is provided as part of the following tables, and a description of each non-GAAP financial measure is provided below.



	Costs of Metals Sold - Mine Production

	: For the Company as a whole, this measure is equal to total costs of metals sold - Mine Production, as reported in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss). For the Stillwater Mine and the East Boulder Mine, the Company segregates the expenses within total costs of metals sold - Mine Production that are directly associated with each of these activities and then allocates the remaining facility costs included in total cost of revenues in proportion to the monthly volumes from each activity. The resulting total costs of metals sold - Mine Production measures for the Stillwater Mine, and the East Boulder Mine are equal, in the aggregate, to total consolidated costs of metals sold - Mine Production as reported in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss).


	When divided by the total PGM mined ounces sold in the respective period, Costs of metals sold - Mine Production, measured for each mine or combined, provides an indication of the level of combined cash costs incurred per PGM mined ounce sold in that period. Consequently, Total Combined Cash Costs per PGM mined ounce sold (Non-GAAP) is a general measure of operating efficiency, and is affected both by the level of Total Combined Cash Costs (Non-GAAP) and by the total of PGM mined ounces sold.



	Total Combined Cash Costs (Non-GAAP)

	: This non-GAAP financial measure is calculated as total costs of metals sold - Mine Production adjusted for the change in mined inventories to calculate Total Combined Cash Costs before by-product and recycling income credits, (Non-GAAP). From this calculation, the Company deducts by-product and recycling income credits to arrive at Total Combined Cash Costs, net of by-product and recycling income credits. Total Combined Cash Costs is a measure of extraction efficiency. The Company uses this measure as a comparative indication of the cash costs related to production and processing in its mining operations in any period. When divided by PGM ounces produced in the respective period, Total Combined Cash Costs, net of by-products and recycling income credits (Non-GAAP), measured for each mine or combined, provides an indication of the level of combined cash costs incurred per PGM ounce produced in that period.


	When divided by the total ore tons milled in the respective period, Total Combined Cash Costs per PGM mined ounce, net of by-product and recycling income credits (Non-GAAP), measured for each mine or combined, provides an indication of the level of combined cash costs incurred per ton milled in that period. Because of variability of ore grade in the Company’s mining operations, production efficiency underground is frequently measured against ore tons produced rather than contained PGM ounces. Because ore tons are first weighed as they are fed into the mill, mill feed is the first point at which production tons are measured precisely. Consequently, Total Combined Cash Costs per Ore Ton Milled (Non-GAAP) is a general measure of production efficiency, and is affected both by the level of Total Combined Cash Costs (Non-GAAP) and by the volume of tons produced and fed to the mill.

	Stillwater Mining Company



	All-In Sustaining Costs (a Non-GAAP Financial Measure)



	(Unaudited)




	All-In Sustaining Costs (Non-GAAP):

	This non-GAAP financial measure is used as an indicator from period to period of the level of total cash required by the Company to maintain and operate the existing mines, including corporate administrative costs and replacement capital. The measure is calculated beginning with Costs of metal sold - Mine Production, the Company's most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and adding to it the change in mined inventories, and adjusting for the by-product and recycling income credits, domestic corporate general and administrative costs (excluding any depreciation, one-time event charges and general and administrative costs of foreign subsidiaries) and that portion of total capital expenditures associated with sustaining the current level of mining operations. Capital expenditures, however, for Blitz and certain other one-time projects are not included in the calculation.


	When divided by the total recoverable PGM mined ounces produced in the respective period, All-In Sustaining Costs per PGM Mined Ounce Produced (Non-GAAP) provides an indication of the level of total cash required to maintain and operate the mines per PGM ounce produced in the period. Recoverable PGM ounces from production are an indication of the amount of PGM product extracted through mining in any period. Because the objective of PGM mining activity is to extract PGM material, the all-in cash costs per PGM mined ounce to produce PGM material, administer the business and sustain the operating capacity of the mines is a useful measure for comparing overall extraction efficiency between periods. This measure is affected by the total level of spending in the period and by the grade and volume of mined ore produced.

	Underlying Earnings (Loss)



	(Non-GAAP Financial Measure)



	(Unaudited)




	Underlying Earnings (Loss) (Non-GAAP):

	This non-GAAP financial measure is considered by the Company to be reflective of the actual income / loss position. This non-GAAP financial measure provides to investors and analysts the ability to understand the results of the continuing operations of the Company relating to the production, processing and sale of PGMs, by excluding certain items that have a disproportionate impact on the results for the reported periods. The measure is calculated beginning with

	Net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders

	and adding back impairment charges, one-time event charges and charges infrequent to the Company's continuing operations and the income tax effect of such adjustments. Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest has been adjusted for the noncontrolling interest's ownership percentage of any applicable impairment charges to which the noncontrolling interest has an ownership. The Company's determination of the components of

	Underlying earnings


	(loss)

	are evaluated periodically and based, in part, on a review of non-GAAP financial measures used by mining industry analysts.



	Net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders

	is reconciled to Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders and Underlying earnings (loss) as follows:

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The commentary that follows should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and with the information provided in the Company's 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K. OVERVIEW Stillwater Mining Company (the Company) is a Delaware corporation, and is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "SWC". The Company extracts and processes ores containing palladium and platinum (along with by-product metals) from two underground mines situated within the J-M Reef, a geological formation of platinum group metal (PGM) mineralization located in Stillwater and Sweet Grass Counties in south-central Montana. Ore produced from the mines is crushed and concentrated in mills located at each mine site. Mine concentrates are then trucked to the Company's processing complex in Columbus, Montana, where they are smelted and partially refined. In addition to the mine concentrates, the Company also recycles spent automotive catalyst and other materials containing PGMs it receives from third parties at the processing complex. A portion of this recycling activity is material the Company purchases for its own account; while the remainder is toll processed on behalf of others for a fee. After being processed through the Company's processing facilities in Columbus, the final product, a PGM-rich filter cake, is shipped to Johnson Matthey (JM) in New Jersey for final refining and then delivered as finished metal into the Company's account. FIRST QUARTER 2016 SUMMARY RESULTS For the first quarter of 2016, the Company reported a consolidated net loss attributable to common stockholders of $9.9 million, or $0.08 per diluted share, as compared to consolidated net income attributable to common stockholders of $23.0 million, or $0.17 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2015. This was driven by a significant reduction in average combined realized price per mined ounce, which fell from $871 per ounce in the first quarter of 2015 to $612 per ounce in the first quarter of 2016 offset, in part, by a reduction in unit costs. The 2015 first quarter earnings also reflected a discrete tax benefit of approximately $8.6 million related to the Company's sales and trading activities. Segment earnings from the Company's mining operations totaled $1.3 million (before income taxes) for the first quarter of 2016, compared to $28.8 million (before income taxes) for the same period in 2015. Volumes of mined palladium and platinum sold in the first quarter of 2016 decreased to 132,000 ounces from 136,700 ounces in the first quarter of 2015. The average combined realized price per ounce on sales of mined palladium and platinum in the first quarter was 29.7% lower than that realized in the first quarter of 2015. Consolidated total cash costs, net of credits, per mined ounce for the Company's mining operations averaged $446 per ounce in the first quarter of 2016, which was 16.9% lower than the $537 per ounce in the first quarter of 2015, mostly resulting from higher production rates at the East Boulder Mine, labor reductions at the Stillwater Mine and a number of cost improvement initiatives at both mines. ("Total cash costs, net of credits, per mined ounce" is a non-GAAP financial measure further defined below in "Reconciliation of Costs of Revenues to Non-GAAP Financial Measures"). Segment earnings from the Company's recycling activities (before income taxes) were $1.8 million in the first quarter of 2016, down from $2.1 million in the first quarter of 2015. Earnings in the recycling segment typically lag corresponding volumes processed by approximately two to three months. The share of total recycling ounces toll processed on behalf of others continued to increase relative to recycling ounces purchased for the Company's own account in the first quarter of 2016. Total recycling ounces of palladium, platinum and rhodium fed to the smelter, including both purchased ounces and ounces processed on a toll basis, increased 41.9% to 154,200 ounces in the first quarter of 2016 from 108,700 ounces in the first quarter of 2015. Recycling volumes sold decreased 15.0% during the first quarter of 2016 totaling 63,400 ounces (including palladium, platinum and rhodium) at an average realization of $700 per ounce, as compared to 74,600 ounces sold during the first quarter of 2015 at an average realization of $981 per ounce. The recycling sales volume decrease reflects the move in the contract mix from purchased ounces to tolled ounces. The Company delivered 75,900 recycled tolled ounces during the first quarter of 2016, up from 40,200 recycled tolled ounces delivered in the first quarter of 2015, an 88.8% increase. The Company's cash and cash equivalents balance was $171.7 million at March 31, 2016, as compared to $147.3 million at December 31, 2015. Total outstanding liquidity, which includes highly liquid investments as well as available cash and cash equivalents, was $452.4 million at March 31, 2016, as compared to $463.8 million at December 31, 2015. See "Note 11 - Investments", in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information related to the Company's investments. Net working capital (including cash and cash equivalents and highly liquid investments) decreased to $520.8 million at March 31, 2016, from $523.0 million at December 31, 2015. Gross working capital in the PGM Recycling segment was $42.6 million at March 31, 2016 compared to $37.4 million at December 31, 2015.  MINING OPERATIONS   Three Months Ended March 31, Cash Costs Per Mined Ounce Combined Montana Mining Operations 2016 2015 Total combined cash costs per mined ounce, net of by-product and recycling credits* $ 446 $ 537 By-product revenue credit per mined ounce 37 51 PGM Recycling income credit per mined ounce 13 16 Total combined cash costs per mined ounce, before by-product and recycling credits* $ 496 $ 604  * These are non-GAAP financial measures. For a full description and reconciliation of these and other non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures, see Reconciliation of Costs of Revenues to Non-GAAP Financial Measures below. For assessing the overall operating efficiency of the Company's Montana operations, the Company utilizes a comprehensive non-GAAP financial measure, All-in Sustaining Costs (AISC) per mined ounce. This metric is an indication of the total cash capital and operating costs per mined ounce (including corporate general and administrative costs) required to sustain the Company's current level of mining activities. For the first quarter of 2016, AISC averaged $613 per mined ounce, in line with the fourth quarter of 2015, and 19.7% lower than the AISC of $763 per mined ounce achieved in the first quarter of 2015. This was driven by lower total cash costs and lower capital spending incurred to sustain operations during the first quarter of 2016. For a more complete discussion of this measure, see -- "Reconciliation of Costs of Revenues to Non-GAAP Financial Measures." Stillwater Mine At the Stillwater Mine, combined palladium and platinum production in the first quarter of 2016 totaled 80,900 ounces, compared to 83,700 ounces produced in the first quarter of 2015. Ore grade averaged approximately 0.51 combined ounces of palladium and platinum per ton in the quarter ended March 31, 2016, as compared to 0.48 ounces per ton in the quarter ended March 31, 2015. Mined ore and subgrade volumes fed to the Stillwater Mine concentrator during the first quarter of 2016 totaled 170,100 tons, a decrease of 10.4% from the 189,800 tons fed in the same quarter of 2015, however because of higher grade and improved operating procedures, total cash costs per mined ounce in the first quarter of 2016 was lower compared to the same quarter of 2015. Stillwater Mine's total cash costs per mined ounce, net of credits (a non-GAAP financial measure), decreased by 16.0% in the first quarter of 2016 compared with the same period in 2015. The lower costs for the first quarter of 2016 are principally the result of a reduced labor force at the Stillwater Mine, improved mining practices and the implementation of various cost reduction initiatives. The following table illustrates the effect of applying the by-product and PGM Recycling segment credits to the total cash costs per mined ounce at the Stillwater Mine:   Three Months Ended March 31, Cash Costs Per Mined Ounce - Stillwater Mine 2016 2015 Total cash costs per mined ounce, net of by-product and recycling credits* 446 531 By-product revenue credit per mined ounce 32 45 PGM Recycling income credit per mined ounce 13 16 Total cash costs per mined ounce, before by-product and  * These are non-GAAP financial measures. For a full description and reconciliation of these and other non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures, see Reconciliation of Costs of Revenues to Non-GAAP Financial Measures below. Capital expenditures at the Stillwater Mine totaled $16.8 million for the first quarter of 2016, including $7.8 million for Blitz development. This compares to the $21.0 million of capital expenditures at the Stillwater Mine during the first quarter of 2015, of which $5.2 million was for Blitz development. The reduction in capital expenditures was primarily due to reduced infrastructure spending in the mine. Primary and secondary development footages (excluding Blitz development) for the first quarter of 2016 decreased relative to the comparable footages for the first quarter of 2015, with primary and secondary development together advancing approximately 8,000 feet in the first quarter of 2016 and 12,300 feet in the first quarter of 2015. Diamond drilling footage (excluding Blitz development) decreased for the first quarter of 2016, totaling approximately 51,300 feet, compared to 110,300 feet drilled in the first quarter of 2015. Ongoing mine development efforts, including diamond drilling, are part of a continuing effort to maintain the developed state of the mine. East Boulder Mine   Three Months Ended March 31, Cash Costs Per Mined Ounce - East Boulder Mine 2016 2015 Total cash costs per mined ounce, net of by-product and recycling credits* $ 446 $ 547 By-product revenue credit per mined ounce 45 59 PGM Recycling income credit per mined ounce 13 16 Total cash costs per mined ounce, before by-product and recycling credits* $ 504 $ 622  * These are non-GAAP financial measures. For a full description and reconciliation of these and other non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures, see Reconciliation of Costs of Revenues to Non-GAAP Financial Measures below. Total cash costs per mined ounce, net of credits, (a non-GAAP financial measure) for the first quarter of 2016 decreased approximately 18.5% from the same period in 2015. The improvement in cash costs per ounce reflects the increased mine output. Capital expenditures at the East Boulder Mine totaled $4.1 million in the first quarter of 2016, as compared to $4.3 million in the first quarter of 2015. Actual primary and secondary development advanced approximately 5,400 feet during the first quarter of 2016 while the comparable development advance in the first quarter of 2015 was 5,700 feet. Diamond drilling footage for the first quarter of 2016 totaled approximately 55,200 feet compared to the 108,400 feet drilled in the first quarter of 2015.  PGM RECYCLING SEGMENT Volumes of recycling materials processed through the smelter increased 39.8% during the first quarter of 2016 to 22.5 tons per day of furnace feed from 16.1 tons per day in the first quarter of 2015. PGM loadings in the fed material in the first quarter of 2016 increased 41.9% to 154,200 ounces of palladium, platinum and rhodium compared to 108,700 ounces in the first quarter of 2015. Three Months Ended March 31, 2016 2015 Average tons of catalyst fed per day 22.5 16.1 Total tons processed 2,048 1,448 Tolled tons 1,002 371 Purchased tons 1,046 1,077 PGM ounces fed 154,200 108,700 PGM ounces sold 63,400 74,600 PGM tolled ounces returned 75,900 40,200  During the first quarter of 2016, the Company earned $1.8 million in income (before income taxes) from its PGM Recycling operations on revenues of $47.7 million. For the first quarter of 2015, the recycling operations earned $2.1 million in income on revenues of $74.7 million.  EXPLORATION AND DEVELOPMENT  CAPITAL EXPENDITURES The Company incurred cash capital expenditures of $18.8 million during the first quarter of 2016 compared to cash capital expenditures of $27.9 million in the first quarter of 2015. Capital Expenditures Three Months Ended March 31, (In thousands) 2016 2015 Sustaining capital: Stillwater Mine $ 8,966 $ 15,042 East Boulder Mine 4,078 4,269 Processing and Other 418 943 Total sustaining capital $ 13,462 $ 20,254 Project capital: Blitz 7,804 $ 5,241 Hertzler Tailings Expansion - 730 Other - 2,150 Total project capital $ 7,804 $ 8,121 Total U.S. capital expenditures $ 21,266 $ 28,375 Non-cash capitalized interest / depreciation (2,609 ) (2,167 ) Change in accounts payable for capital expenditures 185 1,694 Cash capital spend for the period $ 18,842 $ 27,902  SUPPLY AND DEMAND COMMENTARY FOR PGM MARKETS  [[Image Removed]] Annual world-wide platinum and palladium supply is driven by a combination of current mine production, recycling and draw-down of existing platinum and palladium stocks held by governments and financial investors. The prices of these metals are volatile and are affected by numerous factors including, but not limited to, the sale or purchase of the metals by various central banks and financial institutions, inflation, recession, fluctuation in the relative values of the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies (particularly the South African rand and Russian ruble), changes in global and regional demand and political and economic conditions throughout the world. The price of palladium is thought to be more closely tied to industrial demand and the rate of underlying world economic growth, particularly in automotive production.

	EXHIBIT 99.1


	Stillwater Mining Company Reports Third Quarter 2015 Results


	LITTLETON, Colo., Oct. 30, 2015 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --

	Stillwater Mining Company

	(NYSE:SWC) today reported financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2015.


	Third Quarter 2015 Highlights:



	All-in Sustaining Costs (AISC)* of $677 per mined ounce of palladium and platinum, down 19% from $837 per mined ounce for the third quarter of 2014


	Mined palladium and platinum production of 128,100 ounces, a 4% increase over 123,000 ounces mined during the third quarter of 2014


	Processed 161,000 ounces of recycled palladium, platinum and rhodium, an increase of 36.8% over 117,700 ounces recycled during the third quarter of 2014


	Consolidated net loss attributable to common stockholders of $11.9 million or $0.10 per diluted share, reflecting the decrease in average sales price per mined ounce (palladium and platinum) to $693, a 30% decrease from $983 realized for the third quarter of 2014 and a $4.0 million (before-tax) net loss on the repurchase of the 1.75% and 1.875% convertible debentures


	Repurchased $63.3 million of outstanding 1.75% and 1.875% convertible debentures for a total cash consideration of $61.0 million


	Cash and cash equivalents plus highly liquid investments of $460.3 million at quarter end



	For the third quarter of 2015, the Company reported a consolidated net loss attributable to common stockholders of $11.9 million, or $0.10 per diluted share, compared to consolidated net income attributable to common stockholders of $18.1 million, or $0.14 per diluted share for the third quarter of 2014. The decrease was primarily due to significantly lower realized metal prices and lower sales volumes partially offset by lower costs. In addition, the Company recognized a non-cash net loss of $4.0 million (before-tax) related to the repurchase of a portion of its convertible debentures and reorganization costs of $1.7 million (before-tax) during the third quarter of 2015.


	Commenting on the 2015 third quarter results, Mick McMullen, the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer stated, "The results for the quarter clearly demonstrate progress we have made in many areas of the business. Total mined production was on target, the recycling business continues to grow, we eliminated a meaningful portion of our outstanding convertible debt while maintaining an enviable cash balance and, most importantly, we reduced AISC to $677 per mined ounce for the quarter. Unfortunately, as we delivered on our initiatives, metal prices moved significantly lower. Our realized basket price of $693 per mined ounce for the third quarter was down from the $842 per ounce we received in the last quarter and was the lowest quarter in the last five years. We did see an inventory build of mined ounces, which meant that sales were 10,800 ounces lower than production for the quarter. We expect to see this metal sold in the fourth quarter of 2015.


	"To weather these storms in the PGM markets we continue to focus on costs and make improvements to gain additional efficiencies throughout the operations. During the third quarter of 2015 we executed the previously announced reorganization strategy which involved a staff reduction and modifying our mine plan to focus on the most profitable areas within the Stillwater Mine while maximizing production from the East Boulder Mine. Through our planned workforce reduction and natural attrition, the employee count decreased by 159 during the third quarter of 2015 to a total of 1,442 employees at the end of the period. We are already experiencing improved efficiencies as a result of these changes.


	"Following the roll-out of the strategic direction for the Company at the beginning of last year, we introduced a goal to achieve AISC in the low $700 per mined ounce range. I am pleased to report, based on recent performance, we are achieving that goal. The current platinum group metals (PGM) market demonstrates we must strengthen the business to ensure long-term sustainability. As part of that effort, today we are instituting a new target of AISC in the mid $600 per mined ounce range over the medium term. As we continue to decrease costs in conjunction with gains in operational efficiencies, Stillwater will be best positioned for all stakeholders in any market environment," concluded Mr. McMullen.

	Revenues from the Company's Mine Production segment (including proceeds from the sale of by-products) totaled $86.4 million, in the third quarter of 2015, down from $137.1 million for the third quarter of 2014. The decrease in Mine Production revenues reflects both lower average realized prices and volumes sold during the third quarter of 2015. The 2015 combined average realized price for the sales of mined palladium and platinum decreased for the third quarter of 2015 to $693 per ounce, compared to $983 per ounce realized in the third quarter of 2014. The total quantity of mined palladium and platinum sold in the third quarter of 2015 was 117,300 ounces compared to 132,400 ounces sold in the third quarter of 2014.


	Total costs of metals sold (excludes depletion, depreciation and amortization) decreased 25.0% to $147.9 million in the third quarter of 2015 from $197.3 million in the third quarter of 2014. Mine Production costs included in total costs of metals sold decreased to $69.0 million in the 2015 third quarter from $85.2 million in the 2014 third quarter.

	Recycling material processed during the third quarter of 2015 contained 161,000 ounces of palladium, platinum and rhodium, an increase of 36.8% from the total of 117,700 ounces processed during the third quarter of 2014. The proportion of ounces processed on a toll basis has increased compared to purchased ounces as a result of a shift in customer mix that began during the first quarter of 2015.


	PGM Recycling revenues totaled $82.0 million for the 2015 third quarter, a decrease from $109.5 million in the same period of 2014. This decrease was driven by the shift from purchased to tolled ounces processed. The Company's combined average realized price for sales of recycled palladium, platinum and rhodium was $881 per ounce in the third quarter of 2015 compared to $1,068 per ounce in the third quarter of 2014. Recycling sales volumes for the third quarter of 2015 decreased to 88,800 ounces from 101,400 ounces sold in the third quarter of 2014. In conjunction, tolled ounces returned increased to 73,700 ounces for the third quarter of 2015 from 22,900 ounces in the third quarter of 2014.


	PGM Recycling costs of metals sold totaled $78.9 million in the third quarter of 2015, down from the $106.8 million reported in the third quarter of 2014. This decrease was primarily due to the shift from purchased to tolling ounces processed during the quarter, as overall contained ounces volume increased. Net income, before income taxes, from the recycling segment totaled $3.3 million for the third quarter of 2015 compared to $3.1 million for the same quarter of 2014. Earnings in the recycling segment typically lag corresponding volume processed by approximately two to three months.


	General and administrative costs were $8.9 million in the third quarter of 2015, a decrease from $10.1 million incurred during the same period of 2014.





	All-In Sustaining Costs Per Mined Ounce:



	All-in Sustaining Costs per Mined Ounce (AISC)* totaled $677 for the third quarter of 2015, a decrease from $837 recorded for the same period of 2014.

	Labor Matters:



	The labor contract with employees represented by the USW International Union Local 11-0001 at the Stillwater Mine and Columbus processing facilities expired on June 12, 2015. On July 30, 2015, the Company notified the union that negotiations had reached an impasse and that it would implement its last, best and final offer. This is the same agreement previously recommended by the USW International Local 11-001 and rejected by the represented employees. The Company implemented the new agreement on September 1, 2015.



	Cash Flow and Liquidity:



	At September 30, 2015, the Company's cash and cash equivalents balance was $134.0 million, compared to $280.3 million at December 31, 2014. The Company's cash and cash equivalents plus highly liquid investments totaled $460.3 million at September 30, 2015, compared to $531.5 million at December 31, 2014. A significant driver of the decrease in cash was the Company's repurchase of a portion of its outstanding convertible debentures for $61.0 million during the third quarter of 2015. Net working capital decreased to $553.1 million at September 30, 2015, compared to $619.4 million at the end of 2014.


	Net cash provided by operating activities (which includes changes in working capital) totaled $75.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, compared to $131.7 million of cash provided by operating activities for the same period in 2014. Cash capital expenditures were $83.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, compared to $87.0 million in the same period in 2014.


	Outstanding total balance sheet debt reported at September 30, 2015, was approximately $255.9 million, a decrease from $296.2 million at December 31, 2014. The Company's reported debt balance at September 30, 2015, included approximately $254.2 million of 1.75% convertible debentures (net of unamortized discount of approximately $81.0 million), $0.5 million of 1.875% convertible debentures and approximately $1.2 million for a capital lease and financing for a small installment land purchase. The change in debt balance is a result of the Company's repurchase of a portion of its convertible debentures during the third quarter, partially offset by the accretion of the discount on the Company's outstanding 1.75% convertible debentures.

	(1) Sub-grade tons milled includes reef waste material only. Reef waste material is PGM-bearing mined material below the cutoff grade for proven and probable reserves but with sufficient economic value to justify processing it through the concentrator along with the mined ore. Total tons milled includes ore tons and sub-grade tons only. See

	"Proven and Probable Ore Reserves – Discussion

	" in the Company's 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.

	(2) 

	Total cash costs

	include total operating costs plus royalties, insurance and taxes other than income taxes.

	Total cash costs per ounce, net of credits

	is a non-GAAP financial measure that management uses to monitor and evaluate the efficiency of its mining operations. This measure of cost is not defined under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). Please see "

	Reconciliation of Costs of Revenues to Non-GAAP Financial Measures

	" and the accompanying discussion for additional detail.

	(3) The concentrate tonnage and grade values are inclusive of periodic re-processing of smelter slag and internal furnace brick PGM bearing materials.

	Reconciliation of Costs of Revenues to Non-GAAP Financial Measures



	The Company utilizes certain non-GAAP financial measures as indicators in assessing the performance of its mining and processing operations during any period. Because of the processing time required to complete the extraction of finished PGM products, there are typically lags of one to three months between ore production and sale of the finished product. Sales in any period include some portion of material mined and processed from prior periods as the revenue recognition process is completed. Consequently, while costs of revenues (a GAAP financial measure included in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive (Loss) Income) appropriately reflects the expense associated with the materials sold in any period, the Company has developed certain non-GAAP financial measures to assess the costs associated with its producing and processing activities in a particular period and to compare those costs between periods.


	While the Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures may also be of value to outside readers, both as general indicators of the Company's mining efficiency from period to period and as insight into how the Company internally measures its operating performance, these non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized across the mining industry and in most cases will not be directly comparable to similar measures that may be provided by other companies. These non-GAAP financial measures are only useful as indicators of relative operational performance in any period, and because they do not take into account the inventory timing differences that are included in costs of revenues, they cannot meaningfully be used to develop measures of earnings or profitability. A reconciliation of these measures to costs of revenues, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, for each period shown is provided as part of the following tables, and a description of each non-GAAP financial measure is provided below.



	Total Consolidated Costs of Revenues

	: For the Company as a whole, this measure is equal to total costs of revenues, as reported in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive (Loss) Income. For the Stillwater Mine, the East Boulder Mine, and PGM Recycling and Other, the Company segregates the expenses within total costs of revenues that are directly associated with each of these activities and then allocates the remaining facility costs included in total cost of revenues in proportion to the monthly volumes from each activity. The resulting total costs of revenues measures for the Stillwater Mine, the East Boulder Mine and PGM Recycling and Other are equal in the aggregate, to total consolidated costs of revenues as reported in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive (Loss) Income.



	Total Cash Costs (Non-GAAP)

	: This non-GAAP financial measure is calculated as total costs of revenues adjusted to exclude costs of metals sold from PGM Recycling and Other, depletion and depreciation and amortization for Mine Production and PGM Recycling and Other, asset retirement costs, and timing differences resulting from changes in product inventories to arrive at Total Cash Costs before by-product and recycling credits. From this calculation, the Company deducts by-product and recycling income credits to arrive at Total Cash Costs, net of by-product and recycling credits. Total Cash Costs is a measure of extraction efficiency. The Company uses this measure as a comparative indication of the cash costs related to production and processing in its mining operations in any period.


	When divided by the total tons milled in the respective period,

	Total Cash Costs per Ton Milled (Non-GAAP),

	measured for each mine or combined, provides an indication of the level of cash costs incurred per ton milled in that period. Because of variability of ore grade in the Company's mining operations, mine production efficiency underground is frequently measured against ore tons produced rather than contained PGM ounces. Because ore tons are first weighed as they are fed into the mill, mill feed is the first point at which mine production tons are measured precisely. Consequently, Total Cash Costs per Ton Milled (Non-GAAP) is a general measure of production efficiency, and is affected both by the level of Total Cash Costs (Non-GAAP) and by the volume of tons produced and fed to the mill.


	When divided by the total recoverable PGM ounces from production in the respective period,

	Total Cash Costs per Ounce (Non-GAAP),

	measured for each mine or combined, provides an indication of the level of cash costs incurred per PGM ounce produced in that period. Recoverable PGM ounces from production are an indication of the amount of PGM product extracted through mining in any period. Because ultimately extracting PGM material is the objective of mining, the cash cost per ounce of extracting and processing PGM ounces in a period is a useful measure for comparing extraction efficiency between periods and between the Company's mines. Consequently, Total Cash Costs per Ounce (Non-GAAP) in any period is a general measure of extraction efficiency, and is affected by the level of Total Cash Costs (Non-GAAP), by the grade of the ore produced and by the volume of ore produced in the period.


	With respect to 2015 guidance regarding Total Cash Costs per Mined ounce (net of by-product and recycling credits) and All-in Sustaining Costs per Mined Ounce, the Company cannot provide a quantitative reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measure without unreasonable effort. However, the Company would expect to calculate these non-GAAP measures in the same manner they were calculated in the reconciliations included this press release.

	All-In Sustaining Costs (a Non-GAAP Financial Measure)



	(Unaudited)




	All-In Sustaining Costs (Non-GAAP):

	This non-GAAP financial measure is used as an indicator from period to period of the level of total cash required by the Company to maintain and operate the existing mines, including corporate administrative costs and replacement capital. The measure is calculated beginning with total cash costs, net of by-product and recycling credits (another non-GAAP financial measure, described above), and adding to it the recycling income credit, domestic corporate overhead and marketing costs (excluding any depreciation, research and development, and reorganization costs included in corporate overhead costs) and that portion of total capital expenditures associated with sustaining the current level of mining operations (capital expenditures for Blitz, Graham Creek and certain other one-time projects are not included in the calculation).


	When divided by the total recoverable PGM ounces in the respective period,

	All-In Sustaining Costs per Mined Ounce (Non-GAAP)

	provides an indication of the level of total cash required to maintain and operate the mines per PGM ounce produced in the period. Recoverable PGM ounces from production are an indication of the amount of PGM product extracted through mining in any period. Because the objective of PGM mining activity is to extract PGM material, the all-in cash costs per ounce to produce PGM material, administer the business and sustain the operating capacity of the mines is a useful measure for comparing overall extraction efficiency between periods. This measure is affected by the total level of spending in the period and by the grade and volume of ore produced.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The commentary that follows should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and with the information provided in the Company's 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 22, 2016 (Form 10-K). OVERVIEW Stillwater Mining Company (the Company) is a Delaware corporation that has its shares of common stock listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "SWC". The Company extracts and processes ores containing palladium and platinum (along with by-product metals) from two underground mines situated within the J-M Reef, a geological formation of platinum group metal (PGM) mineralization, which is located in Stillwater and Sweet Grass Counties in south-central Montana. Ore produced from the mines is crushed and concentrated in mills located at each mine site. Mine concentrates are then trucked to the Company's processing complex in Columbus, Montana, where they are smelted and partially refined. In addition to the mine concentrates, the Company also recycles spent automotive catalyst and other materials containing PGMs it receives from third parties at the processing complex. A portion of this recycling activity is material the Company purchases for its own account; while the remainder is toll processed on behalf of others for a fee. After being processed through the Company's processing facilities in Columbus, the final product, a PGM-rich filter cake, is shipped to Johnson Matthey (JM) in New Jersey for final refining before it is then delivered as finished metal. SECOND QUARTER 2016 SUMMARY RESULTS For the second quarter of 2016, the Company reported a consolidated net income attributable to common stockholders of $0.8 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, as compared to the consolidated net loss attributable to common stockholders of $27.5 million, or $0.23 per diluted share, for the second quarter of 2015. The lower operating results in the second quarter of 2016 were driven by a significant reduction in average combined realized price per mined ounce, which fell from $842 per ounce in the second quarter of 2015 to $665 per ounce in the second quarter of 2016, which was offset, in part, by a reduction in unit costs. The second quarter of 2015 included an impairment charge of $46.8 million (before-tax). Segment earnings from the Company's mining operations totaled $10.3 million (before income taxes) for the second quarter of 2016, compared to $21.4 million (before income taxes) for the same period in 2015. Volumes of mined palladium and platinum sold in the second quarter of 2016 increased to 150,900 ounces from 133,000 ounces in the second quarter of 2015, reflecting both increased production and draw-down of mine ounce inventory. The average combined realized price per ounce on sales of mined palladium and platinum in the second quarter of 2016 was 21.0% lower than that realized in the second quarter of 2015. Costs of metals sold per PGM mined ounce is the Company's most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to total cash costs, net of credits, per PGM mined ounce, a non-GAAP financial measure. The Company's consolidated costs of metals sold per mined ounce of palladium and platinum was $501 per ounce in the second quarter of 2016 as compared to $606 per ounce in the second quarter of 2015, a 17.3% decrease. Consolidated total cash costs, net of credits, per PGM mined ounce for the Company's mining operations averaged $420 per ounce in the second quarter of 2016, which was 20.8% lower than the $530 per ounce in the second quarter of 2015, mostly resulting from higher production rates at the East Boulder Mine, labor reductions at the Stillwater Mine and a number of cost improvement initiatives at both mines. (See "Reconciliation of GAAP Financial Measures to Non-GAAP Financial Measures"). Segment earnings from the Company's recycling activities (before income taxes) were $3.0 million in the second quarter of 2016, an increase over the $2.0 million in the second quarter of 2015. Earnings in the recycling segment typically lag corresponding volumes processed by approximately two to three months. Total recycling ounces of palladium, platinum and rhodium fed to the smelter, including both purchased ounces and ounces processed on a toll basis, increased 12.1% to 169,900 ounces in the second quarter of 2016 from 151,600 ounces in the second quarter of 2015. Recycling volumes sold increased 25.3% during the second quarter of 2016 totaling 85,300 ounces (including palladium, platinum and rhodium) at an average realization of $666 per ounce, as compared to 68,100 ounces sold during the second quarter of 2015 at an average realization of $954 per ounce. The Company delivered 70,700 recycled tolled ounces during the second quarter of 2016, up from 37,400 recycled tolled ounces delivered in the second quarter of 2015, an 89.0% increase.  The Company's cash and cash equivalents balance was $130.1 million at June 30, 2016, as compared to $147.3 million at December 31, 2015. Total outstanding liquidity, which includes highly liquid investments as well as available cash and cash equivalents, was $442.2 million at June 30, 2016, as compared to $463.8 million at December 31, 2015. See "Note 12 - Investments", in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information related to the Company's investments. Net working capital (including cash and cash equivalents and highly liquid investments) decreased to $519.2 million at June 30, 2016, from $523.0 million at December 31, 2015. Working capital associated with the recycling activities was $63.1 million at June 30, 2016 compared to $37.4 million at December 31, 2015.   Three Months Ended Six Months Ended June 30, June 30, Combined Montana Mining Operations 2016 2015 2016 2015 Costs of metals sold per PGM mined ounce $ 501 $ 606 $ 506 $ 596 Total combined cash costs per PGM mined ounce, before by-product and recycling credits* $ 487 $ 600 $ 491 $ 601 Less: By-product revenue credit per mined ounce 45 54 41 52 Less: PGM Recycling income credit per mined ounce 22 16 17 16 Total combined cash costs per PGM mined ounce, net of by-product and recycling credits* $ 420 $ 530 $ 433 $ 533  * These are non-GAAP financial measures. For a full description and reconciliation of these and other non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures, see Reconciliation of GAAP Financial Measures to Non-GAAP Financial Measures below. The Company utilizes AISC (non-GAAP financial measure) to assess the overall operating efficiency of the Company's Montana operations. This metric is an indication of the total cash capital and operating costs per PGM mined ounce (including corporate general and administrative costs) required to sustain the Company's current level of mining activities. For the second quarter of 2016, AISC averaged $594 per PGM mined ounce, a 3.1% decrease from the first quarter of 2016, and 24.3% lower than the AISC of $785 per PGM mined ounce achieved in the second quarter of 2015. This was driven by lower total cash costs and lower capital spending incurred to sustain operations and higher production volumes during the second quarter of 2016. For a more complete discussion of this measure, refer to -- "Reconciliation of GAAP Financial Measures to Non-GAAP Financial Measures." Stillwater Mine At the Stillwater Mine, combined palladium and platinum production increased 8.2% in the second quarter of 2016 to 83,100 ounces, compared to 76,800 ounces produced in the second quarter of 2015. Ore grade averaged approximately 0.47 combined ounces of palladium and platinum per ton in the quarter ended June 30, 2016, as compared to 0.45 ounces per ton in the quarter ended June 30, 2015. Mined ore and sub-grade volumes fed to the Stillwater Mine concentrator during the second quarter of 2016 totaled 188,500 tons, an increase of 1.8% from the 185,100 tons fed in the same quarter of 2015.  Costs of metals sold per PGM mined ounce is Stillwater Mine's most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to total cash costs, net of credits, per PGM mined ounce, a non-GAAP financial measure. Costs of metals sold per mined ounce of palladium and platinum was $478 per ounce in the second quarter of 2016 as compared to $590 per ounce in the second quarter of 2015. Total cash costs per PGM mined ounce, net of credits, decreased by 26.0% in the second quarter of 2016 compared with the same period in 2015. The lower costs for the second quarter of 2016 are principally the result of a reduced labor force at the Stillwater Mine, higher production volumes, improved mining practices and the implementation of various cost reduction initiatives.   Three Months Ended Six Months Ended June 30, June 30, Stillwater Mine 2016 2015 2016 2015 Costs of metals sold per PGM mined ounce $ 478 $ 590 $ 483 $ 578 Total cash costs per PGM mined ounce, before by-product and recycling credits* $ 466 $ 612 $ 478 $ 602 Less: By-product revenue credit per mined ounce 40 49 36 47 Less: PGM Recycling income credit per mined ounce 21 16 17 16 Total cash costs per PGM mined ounce, net of by-product and recycling credits* $ 405 $ 547 $ 425 $ 539  * These are non-GAAP financial measures. For a full description and reconciliation of these and other non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures, see Reconciliation of GAAP Financial Measures to Non-GAAP Financial Measures below. Capital expenditures at the Stillwater Mine totaled $22.1 million for the second quarter of 2016, including $12.0 million for Blitz development. This compares to the $22.5 million of capital expenditures at the Stillwater Mine during the second quarter of 2015, of which $5.4 million was for Blitz development. The reduction in capital expenditures was primarily due to lower infrastructure activity in the mine along with higher development productivity that reduced unit rates. Primary and secondary development footages (excluding Blitz development) for the second quarter of 2016 decreased relative to the comparable footages for the second quarter of 2015, with primary and secondary development together advancing approximately 8,000 feet in the second quarter of 2016 and 10,900 feet in the second quarter of 2015. This was slightly above the development rates envisioned in the mine plan implemented in August 2015. Diamond drilling footage (excluding Blitz development) decreased for the second quarter of 2016, totaling approximately 50,700 feet, compared to 84,300 feet drilled in the second quarter of 2015. Ongoing mine development efforts, including diamond drilling, are part of a continuing effort to maintain the developed state of the mine. East Boulder Mine  The following table illustrates the effect of applying the by-product and PGM Recycling segment credits to the total cash costs per PGM mined ounce at the East Boulder Mine:   Three Months Ended Six Months Ended June 30, June 30, East Boulder Mine 2016 2015 2016 2015 Costs of metals sold per PGM mined ounce $ 538 $ 634 $ 542 $ 629 Total cash costs per PGM mined ounce, before by-product and recycling credits* $ 518 $ 584 $ 511 $ 602 Less: By-product revenue credit per mined ounce 52 63 49 61 Less: PGM Recycling income credit per mined ounce 22 17 17 16 Total cash costs per PGM mined ounce, net of by-product and recycling credits* $ 444 $ 504 $ 445 $ 525  * These are non-GAAP financial measures. For a full description and reconciliation of these and other non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures, see Reconciliation of GAAP Financial Measures to Non-GAAP Financial Measures below. Capital expenditures at the East Boulder Mine totaled $3.2 million in the second quarter of 2016, as compared to $4.6 million in the second quarter of 2015. Actual primary and secondary development advanced approximately 5,700 feet during the second quarter of 2016 while the comparable development advance in the second quarter of 2015 was also 5,700 feet. Diamond drilling footage for the second quarter of 2016 totaled approximately 37,800 feet compared to the 105,900 feet drilled in the second quarter of 2015 when there was a campaign on drilling at Graham Creek to prepare for the development of the second ore block.  PGM RECYCLING SEGMENT The volume of recycling materials processed through the smelter during the second quarter of 2016 was 26.4 tons per day of furnace feed compared to 26.9 tons per day in the second quarter of 2015. PGM loadings in the fed material in the second quarter of 2016 increased 12.1% to 169,900 ounces of palladium, platinum and rhodium compared to 151,600 ounces in the second quarter of 2015. Three Months Ended Six Months Ended June 30, June 30, 2016 2015 2016 2015 Average tons of catalyst fed per day 26.4 26.9 24.6 21.5 Total tons processed 2,404 2,452 4,452 3,900 Tolled tons 693 1,255 1,695 1,626 Purchased tons 1,711 1,197 2,757 2,274 PGM ounces fed 169,900 151,600 324,100 260,300 PGM ounces sold 85,300 68,100 148,700 142,700 PGM tolled ounces returned 70,700 37,400 146,600 77,600  During the second quarter of 2016, the Company earned $3.0 million in income (before income taxes) from its PGM Recycling operations on revenues of $59.2 million. For the second quarter of 2015, the recycling operations earned $2.0 million in income (before income taxes) on revenues of $66.3 million. For the second quarter of 2016, PGM Recycling revenues decreased by 10.7% compared to the same period in 2015 due to lower realized selling prices as a result of the fall in palladium and platinum market prices, which was partially offset by an increase in ounces sold. The cost of metals sold from the PGM Recycling segment was $56.5 million in the second quarter of 2016, as compared to $64.4 million in the second quarter of 2015, a decrease of 12.3%. A majority of the cost of metals sold from recycling in each period is attributable to the acquisition cost of purchasing recyclable materials for the Company's own account; therefore, the aggregate cost of metals sold from the PGM Recycling segment is driven mostly by the volume and the value of the PGMs in the materials purchased by the Company. Tolling revenues increased by approximately 80.0% in the second quarter of 2016 to $1.8 million, as compared to approximately $1.0 million in the second quarter of 2015, reflecting the increase in tolled ounces returned.  EXPLORATION AND DEVELOPMENT  CAPITAL EXPENDITURES The Company incurred cash capital expenditures of $19.6 million during the second quarter of 2016 compared to cash capital expenditures of $30.3 million in the second quarter of 2015.

Processing Mined Material[edit]
Stillwater Mining Company is engaged in the development, extraction, processing, refining and marketing of palladium, platinum and associated metals (platinum group metals or PGMs) from a geological formation in the Stillwater igneous complex in south central Montana known as the J-M Reef and from the recycling of spent catalytic converters. The J-M Reef is the only known significant source of platinum group metals inside the United States and one of the significant resources outside South Africa and Russia. Associated by-product metals at the Company’s operations include minor amounts of gold, silver, nickel and copper. The J-M Reef is a narrow but extensive mineralized zone containing PGMs, which has been traced over a strike length of approximately 28 miles (45 km).
The company conducts mining operations at the Stillwater Mine near Nye, Montana and at the East Boulder Mine near Big Timber, Montana. Both mines are located on the J-M Reef. The company operates concentrating plants at each mining operation to upgrade mined production to a concentrate form. The company operates a smelter and base metal refinery at Columbus, Montana at which it further purifies the mined production to a PGM-rich filter cake. The filter cake is shipped to third-party custom refiners for final refining before being sold.
The company recycles spent catalyst material to recover PGMs at the smelter and refinery. The company has a longterm catalyst sourcing agreement and spot contracts with other suppliers who ship spent catalysts to the company for processing to recover PGMs. The company smelts and refines the spent catalysts by the same process as the mined production is purified.
Business[edit]
Norilsk Nickel had bought a 51% stake in Stillwater in 2003, but in November 2010 Norilsk Nickel announced plans to sell this stake.[6]
Controversies[edit]
In 2002, two class action suits were filed against the company, wherein stakeholders claimed that the Stillwater was artificially inflating the price of its securities.[7] On Nov 1, 2004, Stillwater Mining restated its third quarter results, during which payment for debt issuance costs was $3.8 million, not a receipt of $0.8 million as originally reported.[8]
In 2006, a group of shareholders won a $2.6 million settlement against the company for "misleading statements about the company's financial performance" and its ore reserves.[9]

Processing Mined Material[edit]
Stillwater Mining Company is engaged in the development, extraction, processing, refining and marketing of palladium, platinum and associated metals (platinum group metals or PGMs) from a geological formation in the Stillwater igneous complex in south central Montana known as the J-M Reef and from the recycling of spent catalytic converters. The J-M Reef is the only known significant source of platinum group metals inside the United States and one of the significant resources outside South Africa and Russia. Associated by-product metals at the Company’s operations include minor amounts of gold, silver, nickel and copper. The J-M Reef is a narrow but extensive mineralized zone containing PGMs, which has been traced over a strike length of approximately 28 miles (45 km).
The company conducts mining operations at the Stillwater Mine near Nye, Montana and at the East Boulder Mine near Big Timber, Montana. Both mines are located on the J-M Reef. The company operates concentrating plants at each mining operation to upgrade mined production to a concentrate form. The company operates a smelter and base metal refinery at Columbus, Montana at which it further purifies the mined production to a PGM-rich filter cake. The filter cake is shipped to third-party custom refiners for final refining before being sold.
The company recycles spent catalyst material to recover PGMs at the smelter and refinery. The company has a longterm catalyst sourcing agreement and spot contracts with other suppliers who ship spent catalysts to the company for processing to recover PGMs. The company smelts and refines the spent catalysts by the same process as the mined production is purified.
Business[edit]
Norilsk Nickel had bought a 51% stake in Stillwater in 2003, but in November 2010 Norilsk Nickel announced plans to sell this stake.[6]
Controversies[edit]
In 2002, two class action suits were filed against the company, wherein stakeholders claimed that the Stillwater was artificially inflating the price of its securities.[7] On Nov 1, 2004, Stillwater Mining restated its third quarter results, during which payment for debt issuance costs was $3.8 million, not a receipt of $0.8 million as originally reported.[8]
In 2006, a group of shareholders won a $2.6 million settlement against the company for "misleading statements about the company's financial performance" and its ore reserves.[9]
