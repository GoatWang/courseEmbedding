        CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMOREYou may not know this, but Wall-based New Jersey Resources, the parent company of New Jersey Natural Gas, is not just about natural gas.It is in the electric business as well. And not the traditional electric business.Through its unregulated subsidiary NJR Clean Energy Ventures, the company has installed solar panels on more than 3,200 homes in 19 of New Jersey's 21 counties, making it the state's third-largest residential solar provider. When you add in 17 commercial solar projects, including a massive solar farm in East Windsor, the largest in the western hemisphere, New Jersey Resources has invested almost $400 million in solar energy in the Garden State.EDITORIAL: Energy future blowing in the wind"It has helped us achieve the goal of providing electric service," said Laurence M. Downes, New Jersey Resources' chairman and chief executive officer.New breezeNow NJR Clean Energy Ventures is in the midst of a new adventure: wind power. In June, the company announced that it has completed its first wind farm, a $22 million, 176-acre project, named the Two Dot Wind Farm, located in Two Dot, Montana.This spring, wind turbines at the $42 million Carroll Area wind farm in Carroll County, Iowa, the company's second project, are expected to start turning. Electricity from the wind farm will be sold to MidAmerican Energy, Iowa's largest energy company, which serves about 734,000 electric customers in Iowa, Illinois and South Dakota.Later in the fall, the Kansas City Board of Public Utilities and Yahoo! Inc. are expected to begin purchasing power from the $85 million Alexander Wind Farm, the company's third farm, planned for 7,000 acres of land in Rush County, Kansas.Why is NJ Natural Gas cutting bills by $100?Downes and Stanley M. Kosierowski, president of NJR Clean Energy Ventures, recently sat down to talk about the company's foray into solar and wind power. Their answers, which were edited, are below.Buy Photo (Photo: TANYA BREEN/STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER)How did the company get into this?Downes: This goes back to the late 1990s. We started out trying to look at ways that we can provide customers with an electric product. Back in 1999, we entered into an alliance with General Electric for the sale of plug power fuel cells. The idea was to have a utility that used natural gas to produce electricity for our residential customers. Ultimately, it didn't work because the product was not commercial for residential customers.About 10 years later, we offered customers that opportunity to use solar to save money on their electric bills and we grew from there.How does the solar program, called Sunlight Advantage, work?Downes: The company, working with contractors, installs solar panels on a house's roof, which the customer leases for $75 a month, saving about $60 a month on the electric bill. The company receives a federal investment tax credit, the solar renewable energy certificates, which represents the financial value of the environmental benefits created by the solar power, and the homeowner's monthly payment.What about wind power?Downes: We are very focused on the types of projects that make sense for us. We are not in the offshore wind market. That doesn't fit in with the overall type of investment we want to make. We'll do projects in states where there is a renewable portfolio standard and where we can get a long-term power purchase agreement for the sale of the output from the project. (A renewable portfolio standard requires the increased production of energy from sources such as solar and wind.)We want to focus on the mid-size onshore project. There are large players in wind right now. That's not what we're looking for, those massive projects.Kosierowski: As we look at our whole strategy, whether it's wind or solar, it is really to get power sources close to where it is being utilized. The more we do that, it really takes away the necessity, the imperative for long transmission lines. (Photo: COURTESY NEW JERSEY RESOURCES)Is there an effect on customers of New Jersey Natural Gas?Downes: This is not in utility bills.Upper Freehold board will not support new gas pipelineIs New Jersey Resources changing its focus?Downes: The goal is not to turn New Jersey Resources into a clean energy company. The goal is to have clean energy play a part in the overall company's performance, but New Jersey Natural Gas Co. will continue to be the largest piece. The regulated assets are our main investment and that will not change.Lastly, how about a wind farm in New Jersey?Downes: If we had the opportunity to do onshore wind in New Jersey we would do that, but the wind patterns in New Jersey are such that that will not work. We considered that.Wind power project near Atlantic City down, not out, backers sayDavid P. Willis: 732-643-4039; dwillis@app.com; facebook.com/dpwillis732
