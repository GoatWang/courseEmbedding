                Jake Dean            






Aaron P. Graft founded Triumph Land & Capital Management LLC in 2006, initially as a receiver for defaulted commercial real estate debt. But after the market crash of 2008-’09, its focus shifted.
“Instead of waiting for banks to sell their distressed assets, we’d go upstream and buy a bank,” he recalled. “Everyone thought we were crazy, but we got it done.”

Jake Dean






 


Graft is responsible for modeling a “servant-leadership culture” for the company, saying, “I am ultimately accountable to our investors for everything we do at Triumph.”
A moment that shaped your future: When Triumph was working on the deal to acquire our original bank, things were very difficult. I was trying to ... meet our operating expenses while having no idea if our deal would receive regulatory approval and, if it did, whether we’d be able to raise the capital to close the deal. I shared this with one of my mentors, Carlos Sepulveda, and he said, “This is real life. It’s so real you might not make it. What an exciting opportunity!” He could have said, “This will work out just the way we want,” but he didn’t. Carlos was challenging me to do business with reality.
Three work necessities: Bible, iPhone and lucky baseball.
