(BFMC) is pleased to announce during three days of testing in early December at the Quartz Creek property in Montana, approximately 254 yards of gravels were removed from three test sites and processed through the existing plant. We successfully recovered and weighed 7.85 troy ounces of placer gold which tested at 97.5% purity and ran approximately $38.00 dollars per yard, matching purity and historical values for the area. ($38.00 dollars per yard is based at the current market price of gold at $1240.00 per ounce and does not deduct the cost of recovery.)Mr. Shannon Anderson, President and CEO of B4MC Gold Mines, stated, "We are very excited about our late fourth quarter test results and look forward to implementing the company's business plan to drive significant production growth in 2014. We also seek to acquire additional acreage adjacent to our Quartz Creek property that would significantly increase the companies mineral reserves based on the historical data for the region." B4MC Gold Mines is operated by a fifth generation miner that dates back to the late 1890s dedicated to preserving the family legacy and growing the business for future generations.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextGold Mining Stocks' Q2 Earnings on Jul 26: ABX, AEM & MoreZacksEngineer Finds Pattern; Makes Millions in StocksMoney MorningSponsoredAcacia Mining rejects $190bn Tanzanian tax billBBC NewsHere's Trump's approval rating in every stateBusiness InsiderMotorola's Moto Z2 Force is a smartphone guaranteed not to shatterYahoo FinanceA Penny-Crypto Miracle Making Some Americans RichAgora FinancialSponsoredDonald Trump thinks Jeff Bezos is his biggest threatYahoo FinanceFirst ‘Avengers: Infinity War’ Trailer LeakedInvestorPlaceEconomists answer, are we at full employment?Yahoo Finance VideoWomen Everywhere Should Carry This Tiny DeviceSiren SongSponsoredFacebook earnings, Fed announcement — What you need to know in markets on WednesdayYahoo FinanceSenate opens 'Obamacare' debate at last but outcome in doubtAssociated PressConservative media outlets are sending Trump a big warning on Jeff Sessions — and Trump is paying attentionBusiness InsiderStart Earning Miles With The Best Travel CardWise BreadSponsoredOil bounce, company results keep stocks on highReutersGM to Consider Axing Six Models to Combat Slumping Sales, Avoid Plant LayoffsThe StreetSenate opens 'Obamacare' debate at last but outcome in doubtErik: After all this time all they have managed to do is to pass a vote to talk about it.Join the Conversation1 / 5935

Key Stock Data     ?    P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Change from Last Percentage change in short interest from the previous report to the most recent report. Exchanges report short interest twice a month. Percent of Float Total short positions relative to the number of shares available to trade.      Short Interest ()   N/A      ?    Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades.
