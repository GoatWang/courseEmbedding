BIOGRAPHY
CONTACT SCOTT


 Education
Scott attended undergraduate college at the University of Miami on a full scholarship for both academics and the debate team. He graduated Magna Cum Laude with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1980. He followed that with a full scholarship to law school at the University of Miami, graduating with honors in 1983. His current focus is on litigation of complex medical and professional negligence claims and other cases involving complicated and difficult issues, requiring aggressive and creative litigation techniques.
 
Memberships
Scott is a member of the American Bar Association (Member, Sections on Torts and Insurance Practice, Litigation), the American Association of Justice (formerly ATLA) and the Florida Justice Association. He is also a member of the Orange and Seminole County Bar Associations, and the Central Florida Trial Lawyers Association. Scott is also Board Certified in Civil Trial Law with The Florida Bar.  He is a member of the American Board of Trial Advocates and is Board Certified by The American Board of Professional Liability Attorneys.
For five years, Scott has served on the Client Security Fund Committee for The Florida Bar, which investigates claims against Florida attorneys who have wrongfully taken client funds. The Client Security Fund is funded through dues collected from licensed Florida attorneys, and reimburses clients who have lost monies as a result of the actions of Florida attorneys. Mr. Murphy served as Vice Chair of that committee.
 
AwardsScott is the co-author of the Chapter entitled DISCOVERY, in Products Liability in Florida, The Florida Bar, Third Edition (1995), and an article entitled THE GOOD SAMARITAN ACT, The Advocate, The Florida Bar (1987).
He has also given numerous presentations on various subjects, including Insurance Issues in Construction Litigation, Nursing Home Litigation, Standards of Care for Case Managers, Florida Claims Administration and Fair Claims Practices Act, Insurance Bad Faith and The Learned Intermediary Doctrine & Failure to Warn. 
Scott Murphy Biography Overview
Scott Murphy began his career in Orlando, Florida in 1983 with the established Orlando firm of Parker, Johnson, Owen & McGuire. In 1988, he was invited to join the firm as a partner, and subsequently helped establish the firm’s second office in South Florida in 1989. After successfully opening that office, he returned to Orlando and was elected as the firm’s Managing Partner in 1991. In 1993, he joined two colleagues in starting his own firm, Anderson, Murphy & O’Hara, P.A.  In 1995, he was invited by a major insurance company to establish its Florida staff attorney program, which he grew to three offices throughout the state by 2001. At that time, he decided to pursue his passion of representing the less fortunate and injured, and has done so since 2001.
Scott Murphy is devoted to complex Personal Injury cases, including Medical and Professional Malpractice and Products Liability, as well as Insurance Coverage and Consumer Fraud cases. Scott has achieved exceptional results in these areas.
Scott is admitted to practice in all Florida State and Federal Courts, including the Third Circuit, Eleventh Circuit, and U.S. Supreme Court. He is also admitted to practice in Nevada State and Federal Courts. Mr. Murphy has successfully argued appeals before the District Courts of Appeal, with reported decisions in the First, Second, Third, and Fifth Districts, as well as the Florida Supreme Court. He is committed to serving victims and families of those injured by the negligence and fault of others in his own community and throughout Florida and Nevada, and has proudly assisted hundreds of clients in the past three decades. He believes that every client deserves to have their side of the story told, and to be zealously and diligently represented in court.
Scott and his wife, Nicole live in Maitland with his stepson, Tristan, age 15. Scott’s daughter, Taylor, age 28, recently graduated from the University of Miami, and is now at Florida State University seeking a doctoral degree.
