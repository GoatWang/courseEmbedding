Biography
Craig Hatkoff is a co-founder of the Tribeca Film Festival along with Jane Rosenthal and Robert De Niro. The largest film festival in North America, the festival was created immediately following the events of September 11th to help revitalize lower Manhattan. In 2010, Craig created and curates the annual Tribeca Disruptive Innovation Awards in collaboration with Professor Clayton Christensen (with whom he is Co-founder of the Disruptor Foundation).Craig started his career in real estate after business school in 1978 at Chemical Bank where he became one of the pioneers of the real estate securitization industry. He left Chemical to form Victor Capital Group in 1990, then partnered in 1995 with Sam Zell to create Capital Trust that became the real estate industry’s largest public mezzanine lender. He left Capital Trust in 2000 to pursue more entrepreneurial and creative endeavors immersing himself in the field of innovation. He formed Turtle Pond Publications LLC, a private entertainment and media company, which is today a leading publisher of children’s books.As Chairman of Turtle Pond, he launched a number of successful start-ups. He currently serves on the Board of Directors of the Tribeca Film Institute, Tribeca Flashpoint Media Arts Academy, The Desmond Tutu Peace Foundation, the Child Mind Institute, The Alliance for Young Artists & Writers, The Wild Bird Fund and the Borough of Manhattan Community College Foundation. He is also a member of the Clinton Global Initiative. He is a Director of two NYSE public companies, Taubman Centers Inc. and SL Green Realty Corporation.In addition, he has co-authored with his young daughters a best-selling series of children's books including the New York Times #1 best-selling Owen and Mzee. Craig graduated from Colgate University '76 and received his MBA from Columbia University '78, where he was an adjunct professor at the business school from 1991-1995.

Education[edit]

Personal life and endeavors[edit]
Hatkoff is Chairman of Turtle Pond Publications which owns or invests in a number of new media, entertainment and publishing ventures.[6] Hatkoff is the co-founder of Capital Trust and served on the board of Directors.[7] He also serves on the Boards of the Taubman Centers Inc., Wildlife Direct, the NYU Child Study Center, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Sesame Workshop and The Borough of Manhattan Community College Foundation.[8][9][10][11]
Career[edit]
Craig Hatkoff has authored multiple best-selling children's books with his young daughters including the #1 New York Times best-selling Owen & Mzee: The True Story Of A Remarkable Friendship which describes the friendship between a tortoise and an orphaned hippopotamus in Kenya after the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake.[12] Other works include Good-Bye, Tonsils (2001),[13] Knut: How one little polar bear captivated the world (2007)[14] about the polar bear cub Knut from the Berlin Zoo and "Looking for Miza" and "Cecil's Pride". "Looking for Miza" and "Cecil's Pride" both were written together with his daughters Juliana and Isabella. Winter's Tail, (Scholastic Books, 2007, ISBN 978-0-545-12335-8) is about the disabled dolphin Winter.[15] The Hatkoff's series of children's books have won numerous prestigious awards including the American Book Association Book of the Year and the Christophers Award.[16][17] Owen and Mzee has been published in 17 languages including Swahili, Braille, Arabic and Hebrew.
One of Turtle Pond Publications significant investments is in Fillpoint LLC[18] a leading videogame e-commerce direct-to-consumer distribution and fulfillment provider for the nation's leading retailers.[19] In February 2009, Fillpoint acquired the much larger videogame distribution and publishing operations, SVG Distribution and Crave Entertainment, of the Handleman Company that focus on the value sector with a national in-store distribution platform.[20] The transaction established Fillpoint as a potent videogame distributor with both on-line and in-store capabilities.
Tribeca Film Festival[edit]
The Tribeca Film Festival is a film festival founded in 2002 by Jane Rosenthal, Robert De Niro and Craig Hatkoff in a response to the September 11, 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center and the consequent loss of vitality in the TriBeCa neighborhood in Lower Manhattan. In 2010, The Tribeca Film Festival introduced the Disruptive Innovation Awards. The Tribeca Disruptive Innovation Awards celebrates those whose ideas have broken the mold to create significant impact on the future of our world. The award recipients touch the world of business, technology, arts, entertainment and beyond.[21]

Editorial Reviews


From the Publisher
PW STARREDThose who were captivated byOwen & Mzee: The True Story of a Remarkable Friendship -about the bond between a baby hippo orphaned by the 2004 tsunami and an adult tortoise living in the same Kenyan sanctuary-will find this follow-up equally mesmerizing. Again, Greste's crisp color photographs reveal these inseparable animal companions at remarkably close range. A standout sequence of nine frames allows readers to observe one of the unique ways the pair communicates: the now two-year-old Owen, signaling Mzee to move to the left, nudges the 130-year-old turtle's left rear foot. The two also communicate in their own "language," a deep rumbling sound that is not intuitive to either species. The authors (a youngster, her father and the manager of the Kenyan park) do raise questions about how the friendship will progress, as Owen grows to his adult size of 7,000 pounds, and his caretakers worry that he could unintentionally harm Mzee. Nonetheless, readers of all ages will likely concur with the authors' observation: "No matter how things turn out, the story of their friendship will always remind the world that when you need a friend, one will be there for you." Youngsters will eagerly await the next chapter in this extraordinary companionship. Ages 4-8.(Jan.)KirkusIn 2005, this father-daughter team, with the ecologist and the photographer, chronicled the irresistible story of the baby hippopotamus, orphaned by the December 2004 tsunami, which imprinted on the more-than-a-century-old Aldabra tortoise in a nature preserve in Kenya. Owen andMzee's story continues, with unexpected communication and devotion between the animals and the unexpected difficulties (Owen acts much more like a tortoise than a hippo). The photographs continue to be quite wonderful, and it is hard not to agree with the astonishment in the text: These animals communicate, play, eat and live together, though they are utterly dissimilar in every way. Their story is recapitulated in this volume, so even if they don't own the first, eager young readers can catch right up and be mesmerized, mystified and charmed. (natural history, maps, notes) (Picture book. 5-10). . .


Owen and Mzee are perhaps nature's most endearing odd couple. Owen is an orphaned baby hippo; his real-life best friend, Mzee, is a 130-year-old giant turtle. Having made their debut in 2006's hit photo-essay Owen & Mzee: The True Story of a Remarkable Friendship, the pair return in a cute follow-up that shows how their unlikely friendship flourished during the subsequent year.

Children's Literature  - Phyllis Kennemer
The extraordinary friendship between a small hippopotamus and a mature tortoise is further explored through describing the ways in which these two communicate with each other. Owen the hippo and Mzee the tortoise were introduced to the world in the first book, which described Owen's dramatic rescue after the tsunami and his incredible attraction to Mzee, who actually began exhibiting some mothering qualities which are not natural for reptiles. Their camaraderie has strengthened over the past year. They eat at the same times and travel through the grounds togetherOwen slowing his pace to stay in sync with Mzee's deliberate movements. They communicate through nips and nudges when changing directions. But the most remarkable aspect of their friendship is a unique series of sounds they use together, which are not normal sounds for either hippos or turtles. When Mzee needed to be hospitalized for two weeks because of an infection, Owen made friends with Toto, a younger tortoise. Now the three friends spend most of their time together. The caretakers are concerned, however. Owen seems to have adapted fully to tortoise ways and does not seem to be aware that he is a hippopotamus. He is already twice the size of Mzee and could inadvertently injure his friend. It is unlikely that Owen would be accepted into an established pod of hippos. A possible solution exists in placing Owen with Cleo, another orphaned hippo who lives alone. Owen's story is not over. Another installment can most likely be expected. The large full-color photographs of Haller Park and the interactions of these friends are remarkable, adding meaning and insight to the understanding of this phenomenon of nature. A map ofKenya and further factual information about Owen, Mzee, and Haller Park appear in the back of the book.


School Library Journal
K-Gr 4Owen & Mzee: The True Story of a Remarkable Friendship (Scholastic, 2006) chronicled the fascinating story of a baby hippo who was orphaned by the December 2004 tsunami and the bond he formed with Mzee, a 130-year-old Alhambra tortoise at a wildlife sanctuary in Kenya. This sequel updates readers on the status of that friendship a year and a half later, particularly with regard to the way this unusual duo has learned to communicate with one another. They apparently call back and forth, making sounds that hippos and tortoises do not usually make. The authors honestly discuss the issues that will face these two friends in the future, as their caretakers become increasingly concerned that Owen could become a danger to Mzee as he continues to grow. Other problems and possible solutions are discussed. The text is clearly written and accompanied by numerous high-quality, full-color photos of this unique pair. Children captivated by the first book will be thrilled to discover this one, and enough background information is provided so that readers coming to the story for the first time will be comfortable. A first purchase for most libraries.Grace OliffCopyright 2006 Reed Business Information.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
