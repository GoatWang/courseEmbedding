Brian - Senior Manager, IT Account Management, IT

Please tell us what's great about working at Church & Dwight.
Church & Dwight is a successful company with strong brands and products that people value. It’s a professional environment where the work you do has a direct impact on what matters to the company, our customers, and shareholders. I have had a great experience here.
Please tell us what's great about working in your function or department.
Working in IT is great because it matters. Our company relies on technology not only to operate but as strategic lever to add value to our top and bottom line. My role is right in the middle of helping to define and ensure that this value is realized – and that’s exciting.
Please tell us about your on-boarding experience.
Three thoughts come to mind - comprehensive, effective, and an overall positive experience. It’s always a lot of information to consume but I think we do a good job. I believe the ‘Connections’ program is probably the most valuable aspect of our on-boarding program. Where each month all new hires are exposed to a different part of the organization and is able to see & hear directly from senior management in those department how each function works and its role in delivering results for the company.
What skills/competencies have you developed since working at C&D?
Many. Two that come to mind are priority setting and communication. Church & Dwight is a lean, fast-paced environment. There are is always more to do and say than time permits. So, success (and sanity) is dependent on knowing the most important things to do and say. So, I’ve really had to hone the competencies in my first two years here.
In your opinion, how would you describe the C&D culture?
It’s a culture of results. It’s about getting the job done. It’s a professional environment based on mutual respect and integrity. It’s also a place where ‘the grey’ is seen as an opportunity for creativity and action. If you want routine and slow pace – you won’t find it here.

Please tell us what's great about working in your function or department.
The great thing about working in Process Engineering is that I get to work cross functionally with several different groups like Product Development, Marketing and Manufacturing. As a result of that, we strengthen our manufacturing process and ensure successful scale up.
Please tell us about your on-boarding experience.
Church and Dwight has an on-boarding program for all new hires. Part of that program is that we get to meet the leadership team across the organization and understand their role in the company and day-to-day functions. This really helped me get a clear idea of company structure and how various groups interact with each other.
Describe your career path/growth since working at C&D. 
I joined Church & Dwight as a Lab technician, an entry level position. Over the period of time I grew in my knowledge and skills and became a Chemist and was responsible for entire product line. Thanks to tuition reimbursement program at Church & Dwight, I was able to pursue and complete Master's in chemical engineering which gave me the opportunity to get into processing department working as an engineer.

History[edit]




Pepsodent toothpaste


The company was founded in 1846 to unify two companies created by John Dwight of Massachusetts and his brother-in-law, Austin Church of Connecticut. Their partnership had begun in 1846 with the two founders selling sodium bicarbonate (also known as baking soda) that they refined in Dwight's kitchen.[4]
The Arm & Hammer logo, which dates back to the 1860s,[5] is often incorrectly claimed to have originated with tycoon Armand Hammer. Hammer was so often asked about the Church & Dwight brand, however, that he attempted to buy the company. While unsuccessful, Hammer's Occidental Petroleum in 1986 acquired enough stock for him to join the Church & Dwight board of directors.[6]
In 2001 the consumer product line of Carter-Wallace was sold to Church and Dwight and MedPointe bought the diagnostics and drug businesses.[7]
Church and Dwight acquired the OxiClean brand through its acquisition of Orange Glo International in 2006.[8] Church & Dwight was ranked 723 in the Fortune 500 listing of companies in 2010.[3]

History[edit]




Pepsodent toothpaste


The company was founded in 1846 to unify two companies created by John Dwight of Massachusetts and his brother-in-law, Austin Church of Connecticut. Their partnership had begun in 1846 with the two founders selling sodium bicarbonate (also known as baking soda) that they refined in Dwight's kitchen.[4]
The Arm & Hammer logo, which dates back to the 1860s,[5] is often incorrectly claimed to have originated with tycoon Armand Hammer. Hammer was so often asked about the Church & Dwight brand, however, that he attempted to buy the company. While unsuccessful, Hammer's Occidental Petroleum in 1986 acquired enough stock for him to join the Church & Dwight board of directors.[6]
In 2001 the consumer product line of Carter-Wallace was sold to Church and Dwight and MedPointe bought the diagnostics and drug businesses.[7]
Church and Dwight acquired the OxiClean brand through its acquisition of Orange Glo International in 2006.[8] Church & Dwight was ranked 723 in the Fortune 500 listing of companies in 2010.[3]

History[edit]




Pepsodent toothpaste


The company was founded in 1846 to unify two companies created by John Dwight of Massachusetts and his brother-in-law, Austin Church of Connecticut. Their partnership had begun in 1846 with the two founders selling sodium bicarbonate (also known as baking soda) that they refined in Dwight's kitchen.[4]
The Arm & Hammer logo, which dates back to the 1860s,[5] is often incorrectly claimed to have originated with tycoon Armand Hammer. Hammer was so often asked about the Church & Dwight brand, however, that he attempted to buy the company. While unsuccessful, Hammer's Occidental Petroleum in 1986 acquired enough stock for him to join the Church & Dwight board of directors.[6]
In 2001 the consumer product line of Carter-Wallace was sold to Church and Dwight and MedPointe bought the diagnostics and drug businesses.[7]
Church and Dwight acquired the OxiClean brand through its acquisition of Orange Glo International in 2006.[8] Church & Dwight was ranked 723 in the Fortune 500 listing of companies in 2010.[3]

Carter-Wallace, ending a yearlong process to find buyers for its many brands, will split its consumer brands—including Trojan condoms and Arrid deodorant—from its health business, after failing to attract a better offer for the entire company. For Church & Dwight, which owns the Arm & Hammer baking soda product line, the purchase of Carter-Wallace's deodorant and pet- care lines will help the firm expand internationally, it said. A 50- 50 venture Church has formed with Kelso will take the other consumer lines. MedPointe will get Carter-Wallace's diagnostics and drug businesses, which make the allergy medicine Astelin, the muscle relaxant Soma and Rynatan/Tussi cough and cold products. ...

History[edit]




Pepsodent toothpaste


The company was founded in 1846 to unify two companies created by John Dwight of Massachusetts and his brother-in-law, Austin Church of Connecticut. Their partnership had begun in 1846 with the two founders selling sodium bicarbonate (also known as baking soda) that they refined in Dwight's kitchen.[4]
The Arm & Hammer logo, which dates back to the 1860s,[5] is often incorrectly claimed to have originated with tycoon Armand Hammer. Hammer was so often asked about the Church & Dwight brand, however, that he attempted to buy the company. While unsuccessful, Hammer's Occidental Petroleum in 1986 acquired enough stock for him to join the Church & Dwight board of directors.[6]
In 2001 the consumer product line of Carter-Wallace was sold to Church and Dwight and MedPointe bought the diagnostics and drug businesses.[7]
Church and Dwight acquired the OxiClean brand through its acquisition of Orange Glo International in 2006.[8] Church & Dwight was ranked 723 in the Fortune 500 listing of companies in 2010.[3]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
