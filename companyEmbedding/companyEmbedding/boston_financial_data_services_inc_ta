Corporate Citizenship

Making a Positive Difference

Investing in and strengthening the communities we live and work in is a cornerstone of our culture. It also contributes toward a rewarding, engaged workplace. It's one of the ways we measure our success organizationally.
When we donate our time, talent, and resources ― engage with the community, we form meaningful connections that enrich us, bring us together, and help us reach our personal potential. 
Some of the ways we help address key needs and opportunities in the community include sponsorships, matching gift program, partnerships with charitable organizations, and our employee volunteer program. 
We invite and encourage all associates to build stronger communities where we work and live. We're proud of the ways our associates give to the causes that matter to them.

BBB Reason for Ratings


        BBB rating is based on 13 factors: Get the details about the factors considered.










BBB Reports On









Licensing









                        Licensing information is provided in the BBB Business Profiles to inform the public about industries that may require professional licensing, bonding, or registration. Better Business Bureau encourages you to check with the appropriate agency to be certain any requirements are currently being met.
                    





Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.
                    





Government Actions









                        BBB reports on known significant government actions involving the business's marketplace conduct.
                    





Out of Business









                        BBB reports on a company that is out of business for three years from the date the company closes its doors or ceases to do business.
                    





Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo









                        BBB reports on unauthorized use of the Better Business Bureau's name and/or logo for as long as the business continues to use it in any advertising, or for one year after the business ceases any repeated unauthorized uses.
                    





Bankruptcy









                        BBB reports on a business’s bankruptcy as long as the business remains in bankruptcy.
                    





Mail Returned









                        BBB reports when mail sent to the business was returned by the Postal Service.

Innovation Occurs In All Industries

By Frank CitroneDecember 1, 2014


When it comes to innovation, we can learn a lot from other industries. Take the food and beverage industry. Keurig, the popular coffee brewer and K-Cup maker, is expanding its K-cup line with an instant version of Campbell’s chicken noodle soup. The new product will use a K-cup for the broth and a separate packet for the dried noodles and veggies.
You might be thinking ok, I can have some coffee with my soup now, but how does this relate to innovation within the financial services industry?
Innovation always begins with a problem to be solved. What was Keurig’s problem to be solved? Key patents on Keurig’s K-Cups have expired. Third-party sales of coffee pods are increasing. Keurig’s problem to solve: how to protect revenue and increase sales.
Similarly, when asset managers are challenged with how to increase sales, they sometimes develop new products. For example, in 1993 State Street Global Advisors expanded its product line by launching the first ETFs in the U.S.
Companies must sometimes extend their own capabilities by relying on other firms to provide particular resources. They do this by forming key partnerships in order to make new business models work. A key component of Keurig’s strategy is an innovative partnership with Campbell.
Likewise industry trends have prompted our clients to look for a comprehensive solution in the unclaimed property administration (UPA) space in order to preserve assets while staying fully compliant with state regulations. When faced with this problem to be solved, Boston Financial developed a service which provided asset managers with one-stop access to the most comprehensive set of unclaimed property solutions available in the marketplace today. After evaluating options and performing due diligence on a number of vendors, Boston Financial formed a strategic partnership with Keane to complete this business model.
I don’t know if I’ll be using a Keurig in the future to make chicken noodle soup, but I can appreciate Keurig’s ability to solve problems through innovation. The food and beverage industry is vastly different from financial services; however, we still share common threads when it comes to the innovation and product development process.

History[edit]
DST was founded in the 1960s as a subsidiary of Kansas City Southern Industries (KCSI) to track movements on their railroad. KCSI also owned a mutual fund management company and leveraged technology to automate the administration of mutual funds, creating the industry's first online shareholder accounting system.
To handle the growing processing and data storage demands seen in the 1980s, DST built several data centers, including one called Winchester that was built in 1985, which was one of the most sophisticated such centers in the United States at the time.
In the 1990s, DST was spun off as an independent entity from KCSI and began trading on the NYSE in 1995 as NYSE: DST.
In 1990, DST first released the Automated Work Distributor (AWD[3]), a business process management product that has been widely adopted by banks, insurance companies, healthcare companies, brokerages and mutual fund companies looking for a paperless environment.
In 1989, DST acquired a 50% interest in Argus Health Systems, at the time focused on pharmacy benefit administration. On March 31, 2009, DST acquired the remaining equity interest of Argus Health.
In 2005 and 2006, DST acquired CSC's Health Plan Solutions group and Amisys Synertech, Inc,[4] allowing DST to provide claims administration, software applications and business process outsourcing (BPO) solutions. This became the newly established DST Health Solutions, a sister company to Argus Health.
In 1991, DST created a wholly owned subsidiary eventually known as DST Customer Communications (formerly DST Output) to handle the design, printing, sorting, mailing and electronic presentment of the voluminous output of its product management systems.
In July 2016, DST sold their North American Customer Communications business to Broadridge Financial Solutions.
Expansion, Partnerships & Investments[edit]
Since 1973, DST has offered many services through substantial joint venture enterprises with State Street Corporation. DST and State Street joint venture activities now include significant international operations.
In 1992, DST formed International Financial Data Systems (IFDS), UK, as a joint venture with State Street Corporation. The UK venture later expanded to locations in Germany and Ireland to provide financial service recordkeeping services for its clients.
In 2001, IFDS combined with International Financial Data Systems (Canada) Ltd.
In 2008, Bluedoor Technologies, a provider of software solutions for participant accounting for the superannuation markets in Australia, was acquired.[13] DST Retirement Solutions was formally established that year.
In 2011, UK-based Lateral Group was acquired to create what is now called DST Applied Analytics. That same year, DST Brokerage Solutions and DST Market Services were established. Also acquired in 2011 was ALPS Holdings, Inc. (ALPS), a Denver-based provider of servicing and asset gathering solutions to the asset management industry. ALPS began in 1991 and became the first service providers of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) beginning in 1995. In 2007, ALPS expanded their capabilities to asset management, specializing in satellite and alternative investment strategies.
DST acquired New York-based kasina LLC in January 2015. kasina is a strategic advisory firm to the asset management industry and provides business analytics, consulting and research to asset managers. DST kasina is now part of DST Distribution Services.
In July 2015, DST acquired Wealth Management Systems Inc. (WMSI), a leading provider of technology-based rollover services in the retirement industry offering wealth management solutions. WMSI is now part of DST Retirement Solutions.
February 24, 2016, DST completed an acquisition of alternative fund service provider Kaufman Rossin Fund Services (KRFS).[5] KRFS is a full-service provider of specialized administration services to the global financial community and has expertise in the hedge fund business. KRFS is part of the asset servicing division of ALPS.

History[edit]
DST was founded in the 1960s as a subsidiary of Kansas City Southern Industries (KCSI) to track movements on their railroad. KCSI also owned a mutual fund management company and leveraged technology to automate the administration of mutual funds, creating the industry's first online shareholder accounting system.
To handle the growing processing and data storage demands seen in the 1980s, DST built several data centers, including one called Winchester that was built in 1985, which was one of the most sophisticated such centers in the United States at the time.
In the 1990s, DST was spun off as an independent entity from KCSI and began trading on the NYSE in 1995 as NYSE: DST.
In 1990, DST first released the Automated Work Distributor (AWD[3]), a business process management product that has been widely adopted by banks, insurance companies, healthcare companies, brokerages and mutual fund companies looking for a paperless environment.
In 1989, DST acquired a 50% interest in Argus Health Systems, at the time focused on pharmacy benefit administration. On March 31, 2009, DST acquired the remaining equity interest of Argus Health.
In 2005 and 2006, DST acquired CSC's Health Plan Solutions group and Amisys Synertech, Inc,[4] allowing DST to provide claims administration, software applications and business process outsourcing (BPO) solutions. This became the newly established DST Health Solutions, a sister company to Argus Health.
In 1991, DST created a wholly owned subsidiary eventually known as DST Customer Communications (formerly DST Output) to handle the design, printing, sorting, mailing and electronic presentment of the voluminous output of its product management systems.
In July 2016, DST sold their North American Customer Communications business to Broadridge Financial Solutions.
Expansion, Partnerships & Investments[edit]
Since 1973, DST has offered many services through substantial joint venture enterprises with State Street Corporation. DST and State Street joint venture activities now include significant international operations.
In 1992, DST formed International Financial Data Systems (IFDS), UK, as a joint venture with State Street Corporation. The UK venture later expanded to locations in Germany and Ireland to provide financial service recordkeeping services for its clients.
In 2001, IFDS combined with International Financial Data Systems (Canada) Ltd.
In 2008, Bluedoor Technologies, a provider of software solutions for participant accounting for the superannuation markets in Australia, was acquired.[13] DST Retirement Solutions was formally established that year.
In 2011, UK-based Lateral Group was acquired to create what is now called DST Applied Analytics. That same year, DST Brokerage Solutions and DST Market Services were established. Also acquired in 2011 was ALPS Holdings, Inc. (ALPS), a Denver-based provider of servicing and asset gathering solutions to the asset management industry. ALPS began in 1991 and became the first service providers of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) beginning in 1995. In 2007, ALPS expanded their capabilities to asset management, specializing in satellite and alternative investment strategies.
DST acquired New York-based kasina LLC in January 2015. kasina is a strategic advisory firm to the asset management industry and provides business analytics, consulting and research to asset managers. DST kasina is now part of DST Distribution Services.
In July 2015, DST acquired Wealth Management Systems Inc. (WMSI), a leading provider of technology-based rollover services in the retirement industry offering wealth management solutions. WMSI is now part of DST Retirement Solutions.

“If you’re not failing you’re not trying hard enough”

By Kim FroioMarch 17, 2015


Mia Froio, Age 10
Do you take risks? Big risks, or small risks? If you’re like me you take calculated risks. Ones where I feel fairly confident I’ll be successful.  I must admit, I’m pretty confident, but do I have a fear of failing?
Recently, I attended the DST Advance Conference. This was a multi-day, multi-track event with top industry speakers and panelists providing many key takeaways. However, given my role and ongoing quest for innovation, the speaker that left the biggest impression on me was not an industry expert at all, but rather an artist.
Eric Wahl is an internationally recognized graffiti artist and best-selling author who incorporates his business background and artistic talent into corporate speaking engagements. He delivered not only an interesting keynote, but a thought provoking show.
As I sat, captivated by a mesmerizing scene of pure artistry and creativity by a modern day Picaso, set to the sound of Bono’s “It’s a Beautiful Day,” I couldn’t help but think:

Do we take enough risks in our jobs?
Do we have the mentality “Fail first, fail often?!”
Or, are we more likely to respond to ideas with every reason why that idea won’t work?


During his presentation, Wahl challenged us to allow our creativity to flow without fear of failure. As children, we create through play as we have little to no experience with failure, and therefore, our ideas are uninhibited -as illustrated here in my daughter Mia’s artwork. Mia’s innocence and freedom to create something that reflected her own personal style without adhering to preconceived expectations is priceless. As we get older, we often inhibit our creativity as experience tells us all the reasons why the idea won’t work. It’s time to reawaken our childhood creativity!
Every day in business and in life we are faced with the challenge to proceed without fear of failing. As a product manager, I’m continually faced with identifying product opportunities that are profitable, valuable to our clients and come with reasonable risk. But, it does take risk to move these product ideas forward. For me, the exciting challenge is figuring out how to present opportunities to the executive team illustrating that the opportunity is good for business and the reward offsets the risk.
One of our most profitable new businesses came with risk. Despite having a strong business case that captured critical factors such as market analysis, value proposition, market differentiators, growth projections and financial benefits it failed due to risk.  As a matter of fact, my second and third pitch didn’t make it over the finish line either.   With each pitch, I had takeaway lessons that helped balance the market demand with a risk profile that was acceptable to the enterprise.  And in the end, I didn’t have much to lose; ‘persistent’ could have been the worst adjective used to describe me.
So, maybe I’m really not afraid to fail after all.  And, yes, I believe that every great business has risks.
As business solutions providers, our success depends upon us building and amplifying trust with our clients. Instead of measuring success by starting with economic results, we need to determine what matters to our customers in terms of building their trust, and drive idea creation towards exceeding their expectations.
Will we fail from time to time? Yes, but as Wahl explained through his work, we need to reprogram our minds…to look for ways to build back an emotional connection for customer loyalty. If we fail nine times out of 10, chances are that one success story could be a game changer!
