5 Kevin Harrington Articles That Are Perfect For Remote Workers
June 29, 2017

If you work from home, then we have quite the treat for you.
We are about to unleash five articles that are jam-packed with gems/advice that will surely do every remote worker wonders.
While working from home is a dream come true for so many people, as it should be, if you actually do work from home, then you know how tough it can be. After all, everything becomes a distraction when you are a remote warrior, and so many people won’t take your job seriously.Continue reading

If You Want Success, Then Do This On The Weekends
June 26, 2017

It’s 5 p.m. on a Friday, and you are getting ready to leave your office job and enjoy your weekend by not doing any work. Sound familiar?
While we aren’t questioning your working habits, if you can relate to the above sentence, and if you take off the weekends, then you are likely wasting a lot of time. As a result, you probably aren’t where you want to be in life, and your goals and dreams might have even been put on the back burner.
Here’s the deal: If you want success, then you have to work for it. While so many people are looking for that secret ingredient for success, the real way to make all of your wildest dreams come true is by working. You can dream as much as you would like, but your dreams will stay in your head if you don’t take action.Continue reading

The Main Question Every Entrepreneur Must Answer At Some Point During The Journey Of Success
June 22, 2017

No matter what type of entrepreneur you want to be, and no matter how much success you are trying to achieve, there is a question you must answer on your journey of success.
Without wasting any time, here it is: What do you want your legacy to be?
Do you want to be known as a great father/mother? Do you want to be known as someone who had it all? Do you want to change the world for the better? Do you simply just want to be known as a person who worked on his/her passions, no matter how tall the climb seemed at first?Continue reading

What You Do In Your Free Time Will Make Or Break Your Path To Success
June 19, 2017

What we are about to say will be music to many people’s ears. For others, the opposite will ring true. Nonetheless, here it goes anyway: What you do in your free time will make or break you during your journey of success.
After all, so many people work Monday through Friday, or at least 30 to 50 hours per week. Unless you are constantly putting your foot on the gas pedal during working hours, or are a machine when it comes to productivity, it is going to be a challenge to get ahead of the competition. However, that is where nights and weekends come into play. Of course, mornings can play a big role in this as well — if you are using the waking hours to your advantage.Continue reading

The Easiest Way To Get Ahead Before A Vacation When You Have A Flexible Work Schedule
June 15, 2017

If you are a remote worker and/or self-employed, then you more than likely have a flexible schedule. Some people might look at that as a major blessing, and it is in many ways. With that in mind, being a remote warrior/self-employed isn’t always what it is cracked up to be.
There are many reasons why (for example, anything becomes a distraction when you work from home), but let’s focus in on one of the reasons. When you don’t work in an office, or have an employer, you likely don’t have a salary. Not to mention, you probably have to provide your own benefits, which means you aren’t given PTO/vacation time.
When you aren’t working, you aren’t making money. As a result, taking off an entire week of work during the summer will likely mean you won’t make a single penny during that time. Now, your business might be constantly making you money, and you might also invest, but when you work for yourself, you typically don’t have the luxury of PTO. When you take time off, the cash flow stops.Continue reading

About Kevin
 

 
 
 





KEVIN HARRINGTON:
 Kevin Harrington has been a successful entrepreneur over the last 40 years.  He is an Original Shark on the ABC hit, Emmy winning TV show, “Shark Tank.” He is also the Inventor of the Infomercial, As Seen On TV Pioneer, Co- Founder of the Electronic Retailers Association (ERA) and Co- Founder of the Entrepreneurs’ Organization (EO). Kevin has launched over 20 businesses that have grown to over $100 million in sales each, has been involved in more than a dozen public companies, and has launched over 500 products generating more than $5 billion in sales worldwide with iconic brands and celebrities such as Jack Lalanne, Tony Little, George Foreman, and the new I-Grow hair restoration product on QVC.  Kevin has extensive experience in business all over the world, opening distribution outlets in over 100 countries worldwide. His success led Mark Burnett to hand pick Kevin to become an Original Shark on Shark Tank where he filmed over 175 segments.
Kevin currently operates a private consulting firm where he works with companies to increase distribution; analyze electronic retailing opportunities; effectively market on digital, social media, TV, radio, or print; source manufacturing; celebrity relationships; open up his rolodex; and has been able to 10 X the stock price of several public companies. In today’s competitive world, companies cannot operate the way they have in the past because of the advancements in technology and the digital marketplace. Kevin provides the advice and expertise on how to navigate the constant changing distribution and marketing outlets. Kevin also brings his rolodex and relationships to all companies he works with, including help in financing, like he did with Russell Simmons and Celsius: http://www.bizjournals.com/southflorida/news/2015/04/21/celsius-lands-16m-celebrity-investment.html
Kevin got his start as a young entrepreneur in the early 80’s when he invested $25,000 and launched Quantum International. This turned in to a $500 million per year business on the New York Stock Exchange and drove the stock price from $1 to $20 per share. After selling his interest in Quantum International, he formed a joint Venture with the Home Shopping Network, called HSN Direct, which grew to hundreds of millions of dollars in sales. Entrepreneur Magazine has called him one of the top Entrepreneurs of our time.
Aside from speaking to audiences across five continents, Kevin’s influence has reached over 100 million people through his multi-media presence and industry dominance. A prominent business thought leader, he is often featured and quoted as a business leaders in the Wall Street Journal, New York Times, USA Today, CNBC, Forbes, Inc., Entrepreneur, Fortune, The Today Show, Good Morning America, CBS Morning News, The View, Squawk Box, Fox Business, and more. He is a regular contributor to Forbes.com Inc.com, and has published acclaimed books like Act Now! How I Turn Ideas Into Million Dollar Products as well as the best seller, Key Person of Influence.
He is a co founder of the EO (Entrepreneurs Organization), which has grown to 45 countries and thousands of members, generating over $500 Billion of member sales. In 1990 he co founded the global direct to consumer organization and trade show, the Electronic Retailers Association (ERA). Today ERA is the exclusive trade association to represent a global $350-billion direct-to-consumer market place, encompassing 450 different companies in 45 countries.
The true value of Kevin is not only the 40 years of his knowledge of building businesses but also what he can do for other companies in many industries with his global Rolodex and his ability to solve problems.

June 29, 2017

If you work from home, then we have quite the treat for you.
We are about to unleash five articles that are jam-packed with gems/advice that will surely do every remote worker wonders.
While working from home is a dream come true for so many people, as it should be, if you actually do work from home, then you know how tough it can be. After all, everything becomes a distraction when you are a remote warrior, and so many people won’t take your job seriously.Continue reading

If You Want Success, Then Do This On The Weekends
June 26, 2017

It’s 5 p.m. on a Friday, and you are getting ready to leave your office job and enjoy your weekend by not doing any work. Sound familiar?
While we aren’t questioning your working habits, if you can relate to the above sentence, and if you take off the weekends, then you are likely wasting a lot of time. As a result, you probably aren’t where you want to be in life, and your goals and dreams might have even been put on the back burner.
Here’s the deal: If you want success, then you have to work for it. While so many people are looking for that secret ingredient for success, the real way to make all of your wildest dreams come true is by working. You can dream as much as you would like, but your dreams will stay in your head if you don’t take action.Continue reading

The Main Question Every Entrepreneur Must Answer At Some Point During The Journey Of Success
June 22, 2017

No matter what type of entrepreneur you want to be, and no matter how much success you are trying to achieve, there is a question you must answer on your journey of success.
Without wasting any time, here it is: What do you want your legacy to be?
Do you want to be known as a great father/mother? Do you want to be known as someone who had it all? Do you want to change the world for the better? Do you simply just want to be known as a person who worked on his/her passions, no matter how tall the climb seemed at first?Continue reading

What You Do In Your Free Time Will Make Or Break Your Path To Success
June 19, 2017

What we are about to say will be music to many people’s ears. For others, the opposite will ring true. Nonetheless, here it goes anyway: What you do in your free time will make or break you during your journey of success.
After all, so many people work Monday through Friday, or at least 30 to 50 hours per week. Unless you are constantly putting your foot on the gas pedal during working hours, or are a machine when it comes to productivity, it is going to be a challenge to get ahead of the competition. However, that is where nights and weekends come into play. Of course, mornings can play a big role in this as well — if you are using the waking hours to your advantage.Continue reading

The Easiest Way To Get Ahead Before A Vacation When You Have A Flexible Work Schedule
June 15, 2017

If you are a remote worker and/or self-employed, then you more than likely have a flexible schedule. Some people might look at that as a major blessing, and it is in many ways. With that in mind, being a remote warrior/self-employed isn’t always what it is cracked up to be.
There are many reasons why (for example, anything becomes a distraction when you work from home), but let’s focus in on one of the reasons. When you don’t work in an office, or have an employer, you likely don’t have a salary. Not to mention, you probably have to provide your own benefits, which means you aren’t given PTO/vacation time.
When you aren’t working, you aren’t making money. As a result, taking off an entire week of work during the summer will likely mean you won’t make a single penny during that time. Now, your business might be constantly making you money, and you might also invest, but when you work for yourself, you typically don’t have the luxury of PTO. When you take time off, the cash flow stops.Continue reading

About Kevin Harrington - DRTV & Infomercial Pioneer





Kevin HarringtonChief Executive Officer, TVGoods.com LLC Kevin Harrington, CEO of TVGoods.com, LLC, is widely acknowledged as the pioneer and principal architect of the “infomercial” industry. Since producing the industry’s first infomercial in the 1980s, Harrington has financed more than 500 product launches resulting in sales of more than $4 billion worldwide with 20 products reaching individual sales of over $100 million each, and creating dozens of millionaires.Harrington got his start in direct TV marketing with his company Quantum International, which after merging with National Media in 1991 grew to over $500 Million in annual sales with distribution in over 100 countries in 20 languages.  Harrington was the pioneer responsible for setting up international infrastructure worldwide which lays the groundwork for today’s infomercial industry.  He had offices in: London, Tokyo, Sao Paolo, Brazil, and Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.After leaving Quantum, Harrington had several other successful infomercial ventures including HSN Direct with Home Shopping Network before founding TVGoods in 2005.He subsequently raised more than $20 million in capital from a New York hedge fund in a venture, which then acquired Tampa’s premiere film studio where TVGoods is headquartered.   The studio is located in Clearwater, Florida, featuring a 33,000 square state of the art production studio on 5.4 acres.Regarded as a tireless entrepreneur with a talent for identifying blockbuster products, Harrington’s business was a case study that was chronicled and taught for over 12 years at Harvard/MIT, called “The Rise, The Fall and The rise of Quantum International.”  The case study is used as a teaching guide about what it means to be a grass-roots entrepreneur in a fiercely competitive industry.In his latest venture, Harrington is an investor on a new ABC show called “Shark Tank”, in which budding entrepreneurs compete in pitching their potentially moneymaking ideas to business experts in hopes of securing investment financing. The show is owned by SONY Pictures and produced by Mark Burnett.Harrington is uniquely qualified as an investor/shark because of his involvement over his career in a wide range of industries.  As a young entrepreneur at the age of 19, Harrington launched and operated a successful company that reached $1 million in annual sales and employed 25 people, all while still in college.   In 1979, he started Franchise America, a franchise consulting and brokerage business, through which he sold thousands of businesses, giving him insight to the inner workings of dozens of industries; from restaurants to retail to small manufacturing, etc.Harrington’s book, ACT NOW!, explains how he innovatively turns ideas into million-dollar products. It is available through Amazon and at bookstores nationwide. Examples of popular products available through TVGoods.com currently are: Tony Little fitness, George Foreman cleaning, Jay “the Juice Daddy” Kordich Health, Flying Lure fishing, Wolfman Jack music, and the Dual Saw, marketed by the late legendary pitchman Billy Mays. One TVGoods.com product, the Air-Cutter, a precision vacuum haircutting system, will be featured in the upcoming film Father of Invention starring Kevin Spacey.Harrington is proud to have founded two of the most important global networking associations in the marketplace, the Entrepreneurs’ Organization (EO) and the Electronic Retailing Association (ERA).Entrepreneurs’ OrganizationIn 1987, Kevin and a group of young entrepreneurs including Michael Dell, of Dell Computers, and Ted Leonsis, of AOL, teamed up to create the Entrepreneurs’ Organization, or EO (formerly known as the Young Entrepreneurs’ Organization), and today it has grown to over 7,000 members worldwide, with 113 chapters in 38 countries with more than 924,000 members. The EO is recognized as a catalyst that enables entrepreneurs to learn and grow from each other, leading to greater business success and an enriched personal life. Electronic Retailing AssociationIn the 1990s the electronic and digital retail industries began converging into one, combing electronic retailing and direct marketing. Paralleling this convergence, Kevin co-founded the Electronic Retailing Association, or ERA, alongside key industry entrepreneurs, including Greg Renker of Guthy-Renker, LLC. This trade association represents the $125 billion electronic retailing industry and is comprised of over 450 member companies and subsidiaries worldwide that use the power of electronic retailing to sell directly to consumers via television, radio, Internet and wireless media in over 100 countries worldwide.
