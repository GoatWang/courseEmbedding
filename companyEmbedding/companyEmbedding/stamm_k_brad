A consumer demand model for prerecorded music
K. Brad Stamm, Fordham University

Abstract
Prerecorded music is a $12 billion industry in the United States and nearly \$40 billion worldwide. To date, very little economic research has been done to define and explain those factors that are responsible for this multi-billion-dollar industry.^    The focus of this research is to develop an econometric model which, through empirical analysis, determines those factors which affect the demand for prerecorded audio software. Ordinary least squares and pooled regression are utilized to analyze both world and individual country demand. When data is insufficient for regression analysis, graphical representations are incorporated. In addition, an overview and critique are done of pertinent demand models in the entertainment field along with an overview of the music industry's organizational structure. A theoretical basis for music copyright is also included.^    Through the creation and use of a hedonic demand model, the study finds that changes in technology that result in quality improvements, increases in real national income, and a youthful population, all are major determinants in the demand for prerecorded music. ^

Welcome to NK  Products!

 Welcome to the home of N-K Products, the leading producer of physical fitness equipment in the industry. Our products are manufactured entirely in our own metal shop, which allows us to ensure that only products of the utmost quality are given the name of N-K Products. We guarantee that our products will exceed your standards in the areas of quality, functionality, and durability. We offer a main line of products including wall pulleys, exercise tables, and treatment tables. Each product is offered with several different options in order to meet the individual needs of every customer. Finally, we offer a complete line of accessories, parts, and physical therapy and fitness items to compliment and accentuate our main line and to complete any clinic.

About Our Company

N-K Products Company was established in 1956 by Royce Nolan, PT and his partner from PT school. Their first product was the NK table for knee exercise and therapy. After a couple of years, they sold the business to their production manager, David Neilson. He ran the company until 1997 when it was purchased by I-REP, Inc. (founded in 1982 by Brad Wilhelm, the son of Tru G. Wilhelm, inventor of the Over-door traction and the Tru-Trac traction equipment). After acquiring N-K, the company was moved from Soquel, CA to Santa Ana, CA and the product line was expanded to include hi-lo tables. In January of 2003, the company was moved to larger facilities located in Lake Elsinore, CA. In June of 2003, I-REP, Inc. acquired the assets of Walsworth Medical Furniture Company and began making wooden treatment tables and mat tables. 



Future Goals

 NK is planning to continue adding products to our line and to reach out to the global market through national and international dealer contacts.

 In his book 'Faithonomics', K. Brad Stamm brings together the Scriptures, basic economic principles, and popular culture in an entertaining way, appealing to the informed and the uninformed about economics and Christian worldview. If you want to learn about a topic more talked about than the weather, or if you want to reflect on your spiritual life from a new perspective, Faithonomics is a book that will encourage, enrich, and bring new insight."Stamm gets us beyond the false notion that spirituality and economics are unrelated topics. In a winsome and thoughtful way, Stamm brings economics into clear focus through the lens of a Christian worldview. I enthusiastically recommend Faithonomics!" --Joseph M. Stowell, President, Cornerstone University"One truth Faithonomics pointedly demonstrates is that conventional wisdom isn't. True wisdom--the kind Stamm delivers in tasty morsels--is anything but conventional. Bringing together the academy and the marketplace, inspiration and perspiration, the twenty-four vignettes of Faithonomics provide much food for thought at the end of each interesting and educating chapter. Enjoy and be edified."--David E. Schroeder, President, Somerset Christian College, Truth in Education"The Christian higher education community has for some time been interested in the means and methods of integrating faith with learning. This book has done just that. Through a series of contemporary economic issues, Stamm has led the reader to an understanding of the issues and on to a series of reflective questions for further depth of analysis. Very well done!"--Davis Berryman, Dean of College of Professional & Graduate Studies, Southern Nazarene University"Faithonomics is unlike any book on economics you will ever read. It's not a micro- or macroeconomics how-to, or a theological treatise on personal finance. It is more like a principle-driven devotional that thoughtfully blends the economics-driven issues of the day with biblical truth. With the skill of a studied economist and the wisdom of a man of God, Stamm gives the reader plenty of food for thought on economics, culture, and living for Christ in the twenty-first century."--Michael G. Scales, President, Nyack College & Alliance Theological SeminaryK. Brad Stamm (PhD, Fordham University) is Chair of the Division of Business at Cornerstone University in Grand Rapids. He has published in many journals and newspapers, makes regular appearances on television, and is an ongoing radio commentator on the US economic environment.
