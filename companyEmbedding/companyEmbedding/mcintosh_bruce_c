It has a built-in 32-bit DAC and a DA1 Digital Audio Module, that allows future upgrades.  It includes a USB input that can support DSD256 and DXD 348kHz files.  And the MA9000 features the new McIntosh Monogrammed Heatsinks™ that are made from high quality materials with excellent thermal conductivity properties.
		







McIntosh MC1.2KW Power Amplifier
		

Producing a massive 1,200 watts, the MC1.2KW can now be auditioned at Overture.  The MC1.2KW features the extraordinary McIntosh Quad Balanced Circuit. Each amplifier consists of two balanced amplifier circuits, the outputs of which are combined in the unique, hand-crafted McIntosh Output Autoformer.  Both customers and staff alike have been astounded by their powerful bass response and extraordinary dynamic range.  Speakers of all efficiencies will benefit from the power output and reserves of the MC1.2KW's.

Fixed analog stereo outputs are available in both balanced and unbalanced offerings; a coax and optical output are also available if you prefer to send the digital audio signal to an external DAC, preamplifier or home theater processor.
		










McIntosh D1100 Preamp
		

nThe D1100 Digital Preamplifier is a reference level stereo preamplifier and digital-to-analog converter (DAC). Its 8-channel, 32-bit DAC is used in Quad Balanced mode, with half of it dedicated to the left audio channel and the other half to the right channel. It's the most advanced DAC McIntosh has ever used and delivers an unprecedented level of performance so that all digital music is reproduced with exceptional accuracy and authenticity.
		










McIntosh MP100 Preamp
		

The MP100 is the first dedicated phono preamplifier from McIntosh and is designed to help both new and experienced vinyl lovers get the most fidelity, performance and – most importantly – enjoyment from their albums. Hi-Fi News magazine has reviewed it and have awarded the MP100 their "Highly Commended" ranking.  "This is a clean-sounding, detailed, commanding phono amp that also represents excellent value. It’s compact, beautifully-made in the McIntosh manner and easy to use. Once the features are accounted for, especially XLR balanced out, you realise that it’s actually something of a bargain.

Our History :: McIntosh & McIntosh





























This unique firm continues one person's vision.  In 1927, Robert Garnet McIntosh began his practice of law in the city of Cincinnati dedicating himself to personal and quality handling of the business and personal needs of this community.  He was later joined by his two sons, Robert C. and Bruce B. McIntosh who dedicated themselves to the same high principals of service.


In August of 1999, Bruce McIntosh and his sons, Michael Todd McIntosh and A. Brian McIntosh continued the family tradition by forming the new firm of McIntosh & McIntosh, P.L.L.C.  Thus for over 75 years the McIntoshs' have provided clients, both large and small, legal care in many areas of their personal and business needs including litigation which has been expanded from civil matters to assistance in the area of criminal law.  It is our greatest concern that whatever your legal needs may be, that they be addressed quickly and efficiently with the best possible results.



Our firm has continued to grow in response to our clients needs and concerns.  It has received Martindale Hubbell's highest rating of "A".  We focus our skills on all phases of civil litigation, including personal injury, product liability, business, environmental, and employment and medical malpractice in both the Federal and State Court systems of Ohio.   In addition to this litigation practice, Bruce B. McIntosh is an active Mediator in Kentucky, West Virginia as well as Ohio and has forty hours of training and certification from the Indiana Continuing Legal Education forum.   Further, the firm stands ready to serve your corporate and personal business concerns as well as estate services and tax planning, real-estate matters, criminal defense and environmental issues.


In addition to our representation of individuals, our clients include numerous national and international insurance companies, businesses in the commercial, manufacturing and professional areas.    Our attorneys also handle health care and mental health issues. 


Even though there is a wide range of services we perform for our clients, we continue to strive for the goals upon which our Firm was founded, that is, confidential quality representation and client satisfaction.  It is likewise comforting to know that in an emergency, any of our attorneys can respond quickly to protect your interest.  Their resumes follow.

nThe D1100 Digital Preamplifier is a reference level stereo preamplifier and digital-to-analog converter (DAC). Its 8-channel, 32-bit DAC is used in Quad Balanced mode, with half of it dedicated to the left audio channel and the other half to the right channel. It's the most advanced DAC McIntosh has ever used and delivers an unprecedented level of performance so that all digital music is reproduced with exceptional accuracy and authenticity.
		










McIntosh MP100 Preamp
		

The MP100 is the first dedicated phono preamplifier from McIntosh and is designed to help both new and experienced vinyl lovers get the most fidelity, performance and – most importantly – enjoyment from their albums. Hi-Fi News magazine has reviewed it and have awarded the MP100 their "Highly Commended" ranking.  "This is a clean-sounding, detailed, commanding phono amp that also represents excellent value. It’s compact, beautifully-made in the McIntosh manner and easy to use. Once the features are accounted for, especially XLR balanced out, you realise that it’s actually something of a bargain.
