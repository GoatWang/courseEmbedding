LOS ANGELES, July 24, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Rexford Industrial Realty, Inc. (the "Company" or "Rexford Industrial") (NYSE:   REXR), a real estate investment trust focused on owning and operating industrial properties located in Southern California infill markets, today announced the acquisition of an industrial property for approximately $19.8 million. The acquisition was funded utilizing the Company's line of credit.








"This acquisition continues to demonstrate our ability to source off-market transactions across our supply constrained target infill Southern California submarkets at compelling values," stated Howard Schwimmer and Michael Frankel, Co-Chief Executive Officers of the Company. "This well-located property has significant rental upside, allowing us to capture near term cash flow and, upon lease expiration, the potential to roll rents to higher market rates. As we progress through the second half of 2017 and beyond, we continue to execute our internal and external growth strategies to drive cash flow and to create long term shareholder value." 
The Company acquired 11190 White Birch Drive, located in the Inland Empire West submarket, for $19.8 million, or approximately $99 per square foot. The industrial building contains 201,035 square feet on 9.27 acres of land and is 100% leased to a single tenant in the logistics industry on a triple net basis at below-market rent. The property features 26-foot clearance, 26 dock-high doors, and provides easy access to the 10 and 15 freeways. The building was originally constructed for two-tenant occupancy and, upon lease expiration, the property has the potential for efficient re-tenanting to two tenants at higher rents. According to CBRE, the vacancy rate in the 281 million square foot Inland Empire West submarket was 1.4% at the end of the second quarter 2017.
About Rexford IndustrialRexford Industrial is a real estate investment trust focused on owning and operating industrial properties in Southern California infill markets. The Company owns 143 properties with approximately 17.9 million rentable square feet and manages an additional 19 properties with approximately 1.2 million rentable square feet.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Zacks Rank:



                                                 3-Hold     3     




Style Scores:



F Value | C Growth | A Momentum | D VGM                


The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.


Value Score
A


Growth Score
A


Momentum Score
A


VGM Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

				Rexford Industrial Realty, Inc. - Initiation Note



Rexford Industrial Realty, Inc.
BUY (REXR, $21.68)
Southern California Focused Owner / Operator – Initiating at NEUTRAL with a $20.00 Price Target as Equity Looks Fully Valued and China Trade Data Strength In Question
July 12, 2016

Investment Conclusion. We are initiating coverage of Rexford Industrial Realty, Inc. with a NEUTRAL rating and $20.00 price target. Though we are fundamentally positive on the industrial REIT sector, REXR is trading at a significant premium on a P/FFO and P/NAV basis relative to its larger, more established peers, implying that the upside we feel attainable with other operators in the space is largely already reflected in REXR’s current share price. Unique to REXR among all other public industrial REITs is its geographic footprint, which is 100% Southern California based, the largest and most constrained industrial real estate market in the country. According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, in 2014 California’s GDP was an estimated $2.31 trillion, the highest in the nation and when measured by both the IMF and World Bank, it would be the world’s 8th largest economy. Specifically, REXR’s real estate is situated around the Port of Los Angeles and the Port of Long Beach, the two largest shipping ports in the United States and the 19th and 20th largest in the world. Why is this important; quite simply all those goods and services need to be manufactured and stored somewhere before being transported to world markets? Enter REXR, a Southern California focused industrial REIT poised to capitalize on the global economy. REXR owns and operates 12,152,138 square feet in one the most land constrained and population dense markets in the nation. REXR, like TRNO, also has an attractive existing portfolio from an acquisition vintage standpoint, with 21.6% of its assets acquired between 2009 and 2013, the bottom of the Moody’s / Real Capital Analytics Commercial Property Price Index. Our $20.00 price is based on an average of our $18.47 NAV, $18.10 book value + embedded equity and $22.64 discounted dividend model estimates.
