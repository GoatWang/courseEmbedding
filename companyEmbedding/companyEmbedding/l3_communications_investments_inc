The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

About L-3 Communications Holdings, Inc.

L3 Technologies (formerly L-3 Communications Holdings) provides products and services to the government based on intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR), including systems for satellite, avionics (aircraft electronics), and marine communications. Products include simulation, training, and night vision equipment, and L3 also provides aircraft maintenance and modernization services. The US government, primarily the
   
    Department of Defense
   
   (DoD), accounts for nearly 70% of its business, but L3 is expanding its commercial offerings. The company operates through 273 locations around the globe, but the majority of its revenues stem from the US.
  
Operations
L3 operates through four main segments: Electronic Systems, Sensor Systems, Communication Systems, and Aerospace Systems. 
Geographic Reach

   The company operates through 273 locations consisting of manufacturing facilities, administration, research and development and other properties throughout the US and internationally. The US is its largest market, accounting for roughly 80% of total revenue in 2016.
  
Sales and Marketing

   The company's sales are predominantly derived from contracts with agencies of, and prime system contractors to, the US government. In 2016, the
   
    Department of Defense
   
   (DOD) and other government agencies accounted for 73% of its total revenue; the remainder of revenue was contributed by commercial (12%) and foreign governments (15%).

In addition, direct sales to end customers represented 67% of net sales in 2016, and sales acting as a subcontractor or supplier represented the remaining 33%. Sales to L3's five largest contracts generated 15% of total sales; its largest contract was the Fort Rucker Maintenance Support contract with the US Army Aviation and Missile Life Cycle Management Command (AMCOM).
Financial Performance

   L3 has seen its net sales slowly diminish over the last five years. In addition, revenues remained static for 2015 and 2016, hovering around the $10.5 billion mark for both years. During 2016, L3 experienced significant sales declines in South Korea (39%), Australia (21%), Saudi Arabia (21%), and Japan (15%). These regions were affected by lower sales related to linguist services, training, and logistics support projects for the
   
    US Army
   
   due to the draw-down of American military forces in Iraq.
  
L3 posted a net loss of $240 million in 2015. The loss was attributed to the selling of its former National Security Solutions (NSS) business in early 2016 and led to the incurring of impairment charges and a loss from discontinued operations for 2015.
 With this divestiture behind it, L3 posted positive net income of $710 million in 2016. 
Strategy

   With such a major amount of business derived from the US government and DoD (the US Army and
   
    Air Force
   
   collectively account for about 70% of its total revenue), the company is vulnerable to the priorities of the Pentagon and other government agencies, which have resulted in cuts in defense spending and additional troop withdrawals from the Middle East.
  

   In addition, the company enters into collaborative ventures with other businesses to develop new opportunities, especially in the area of providing full-service, rather than just products. Additionally, L3 has been transitioning from providing individual products and components to bundled products and services, including logistics, MRO (maintenance, repair, and overall), and supply chain management. Its revenues from services is now neck-and-neck with that of its products, and L3 plans to add additional services under existing programs.
  

   To focus on this strategy, in early 2016 L3 sold its former National Security Solutions (NSS) business to
   
    CACI International
   
   for $550 million.
  
Mergers and Acquisitions
In early 2017, L3 acquired the explosives trace detection (ETD) business of Massachusetts-based Implant Sciences Corporation for $118 million in cash. L3 will integrate Implant into its security and detection systems division within its electronic systems business segment. The transaction enhanced its capabilities within the global aviation security and national security markets and allowed it to capitalize on significant opportunities in the growing security and detection market.
In 2016, the company obtained Micreo Limited, located in Brisbane, Australia. Micreo is a market leader in the design and production of RF and photonic products for radar and electronic warfare, and its products are currently installed in several of the world’s frontline military aircraft and ships. The deal complemented the company’s electronic warfare capabilities and expanded its Australian footprint.

   In 2015, L3 snapped up UK-headquartered CTC Aviation Group (now known as L-3 CTC Ltd) for $220 million. L-3 CTC is a global airline pilot training and crew resourcing specialist catering to major airlines and retail customers globally. The acquisition expanded L3's commercial aviation training business.

L-3 Bags Air Force Contract - L-3 Communications Holdings Inc. (NYSE:LLL) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»L-3 Bags Air Force ContractAug.20.09 | About: L-3 Communications (LLL) Zacks Investment Research Zacks Investment ResearchL-3 Communications Holdings Inc. (LLL - Analyst Report) Wednesday bagged a $680 million contract from the US Air Force to serve as prime contractor on the T-1A Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) program. This will boost the dwindling order backlog of the company, which fell 20% year-over-year in the second quarter of fiscal 2009 to $3.3 billion.
The 60-day base contract, with eight option years, would be serviced by L-3's Systems Field Support operating unit, based in Madison, Mississippi. The company would provide program management of logistics, material supply support and repair overhaul services for 179 T-1A aircraft based at Vance Air Force Base, Oklahoma; Columbus Air Force Base, Mississippi; Pensacola Naval Air Station, Florida; and the Randolph and Laughlin Air Force Bases, Texas. Headquartered in New York, L-3 Communications is a leading provider of Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) systems and products; secure communications systems; aircraft modernization, training and government services; and is a merchant supplier of a broad array of high technology products. Its major customers are the Department of Defense (DoD), U.S. government intelligence agencies, major aerospace and defense prime contractors, foreign governments, and commercial telecommunication and wireless customers. L-3's product mix is approximately 88% defense and 12% commercial. The company functions through four primary business segments: Specialized Products; Government Services; Aircraft Modernization and Maintenance (AM&M); and Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C3ISR). The company trades at a discount to its industry peers in terms of price-to-book, price-to-sales, and price-to-future cash flow.

600 3rd Avenue, 34th FloorNew York, New York 10016U.S.A.


Company Perspectives:

L-3 Communication's goal is to be the leading mezzanine supplier to prime contractors. The company will do so by investing in its core technologies and acquiring companies that enhance or complement its current technologies.
History of L-3 Communications Holdings, Inc.








L-3 Communications Holdings, Inc., through its L-3 Communications Corp. subsidiary, operates companies that produce secure communication systems, training systems, microwave components, avionics and ocean systems, telemetry, instrumentation, and space and wireless products. Its customers are mostly defense and intelligence agencies, as well as aircraft manufacturers and defense contractors. L-3 also supplies the commercial telecommunications industry. L-3 maintained a 60 percent defense, 40 percent commercial product mix. Like its predecessor Loral Corporation, L-3 Communications has undergone phenomenal growth, orchestrated by former Loral executives Frank Lanza and Robert LaPenta.

Origins

Loral Corporation was an assemblage of defense units acquired from Fairchild, Ford, IBM, Unisys, and others between the mid-1970s and mid-1990s by Wall Street investor Bernard L. Schwartz. In April 1996, Lockheed Martin acquired most of these businesses for $9.1 billion. Two Loral executives, COO Frank Lanza and comptroller Robert LaPenta, joined Lockheed Martin as executive vice-president and vice-president, respectively. Loral's space businesses formed a separate firm, Loral Space & Communications Ltd., run by Schwartz.
Lockheed Martin, which had been formed in 1995 by the merger of Lockheed Corp. and Martin Marietta Corp., began to divest noncore units after the massive Loral acquisition. It sold its stake in the Martin Marietta construction materials business in 1996.
Lanza, described by the Washington Post as "a taciturn New Yorker admired for his creativity and engineering genius," reportedly felt stifled by the bureaucratic corporate atmosphere at Lockheed Martin. An electrical engineer by training, Lanza had joined Loral in 1972 and was named president and chief operating officer in 1981. Along the way, he was instrumental in growing the company from modest origins to a $7 billion giant.
In 1997, as he approached traditional retirement age, Lanza convinced his new employer, Lockheed Chairman Norman R. Augustine, to spin off ten former Loral companies to form L-3 Communications. ("It took me less than half an hour to get a yes," Lanza later told Business Week.) Lanza finally got a chance to be CEO, and numbers whiz LaPenta was named president and chief financial officer.
The ten businesses spun off had annual revenues of $650 million and 4,900 employees. The largest of these were Wideband Systems in Salt Lake City and Communications Systems in Camden, New Jersey. Also included were two northern California companies, Randtron and Narda-Microwave, which manufactured microwave antennas for military applications. These two together had fewer than 400 employees.
Lockheed Martin received $503.8 million for selling 65 percent of its ownership in the ten companies. After the sale, a limited partnership led by Lehman Brothers owned half of L-3; Lockheed Martin retained a 35 percent interest and a management group accounted for another 15 percent. Lockheed agreed to invest $43.75 million in L-3, Lehman invested $62.5 million, and the management group provided $43.75 million. Another $375 million was financed with bank debt and high-yield bonds. The name of the new company came from Lanza, LaPenta, and either Lockheed or Lehman Brothers, according to varying reports.
In July 1997 L-3 found itself aggressively bidding against its part-owner, Lockheed Martin, for control of a Texas Instruments chip-making business that Raytheon was being forced to unload as part of a Justice Department settlement. The desired unit produced gallium arsenide high-power amplifier monolithic microwave integrated circuits, or MMICs, a proprietary product. L-3 was eager to expand its microwave components business, which accounted for a quarter of sales, and also sought out joint ventures with Sweden's Ericsson Microwave Systems AB and France's Thomson-CSF to bring new technologies into the U.S. military market.








L-3 had a well-developed commercial business as well. Its Advanced Recorders plant in Sarasota, Florida, which made "black boxes" for aircraft, landed a contract to supply American Airlines with solid-state flight data recorders for both its existing fleet and planes on order with Boeing. The deal had a potential value of $16 million.

1998 IPO

L-3's first year revenues were $701 million. Plans for a $100 million initial public offering (IPO) were announced in February 1998. The IPO at $22 a share came on May 19; in the next six months the company's share price would rise to $46 a share, helped by strong earnings.
Lanza's acquisition strategy was to buy technology leaders, either struggling independent companies or black sheep divisions of major defense contractors, observed Business Week. Lanza focused on small to medium sized companies to avoid costly takeover battles with aerospace giants. ESSCO, a leading producer of ground-based radomes (protective shields for antennas) and precision millimeter wave antenna systems, acquired in September 1998, was a representative purchase.
By November 1998, L-3 had already acquired seven companies, including SPD Technologies, which supplied power equipment to the U.S. Navy, and Storm Control Systems, Inc., which made satellite control software. The company spent heavily--$40 to $50 million a year--on R&D to improve its existing products and to make them cheaper to produce.
In December 1998, L-3 agreed to acquire Microdyne Corp., based in Alexandria, Virginia, for $90 million. Microdyne made radio receivers used in tracking satellites and aircraft. L-3 companies already made the data hardware that used these antennas.
L-3 posted after-tax profits of $32 million on revenues of $1 billion in 1998. An additional stock offering was announced in early 1999, intending to raise $136 million to pay down debt and fund further acquisitions.
In December 1999, L-3 agreed to pay $55 million for two businesses Honeywell International Inc. was required to sell after its merger with Allied Signal Inc. One of these produced gyroscopes, controlled momentum devices, and sensors for weapons systems and satellites; the other made an inertial sensor product based on micromachined electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) technology used in advanced guidance systems. L-3 also bought Honeywell's Traffic-Alert Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) business for $255 million. L-3 incorporated the TCAS unit into a joint venture with Sextant, a Thomson-CSF affiliate. TCAS had recently been required on all European cargo aircraft and passenger planes with more than 30 seats.
Another important acquisition in 1999 was that of Satellite Transmission Systems. This brought L-3 into a $200 million a year business of fixed wireless communications systems, typically installed in developing countries that lacked traditional land lines. Meanwhile, new Federal Aviation Administration requirements were boosting L-3's cockpit voice recorder business.
In January 2000, L-3 agreed to buy Raytheon Company's flight simulation and training business for $160 million. Link Simulation and Training, based in Arlington, Virginia, became L-3's largest division, with $300 million a year in revenues. Link had pioneered the earliest mechanical flight simulators in the first decades of aviation, but had languished in later years as it was shuffled among a succession of corporate foster parents; Lanza declared L-3 was committed to help Link thrive in the growing training market. In March 2001, however, L-3 sued Raytheon to cancel its acquisition agreement, alleging that Raytheon failed to disclose liabilities in the business.

Bigger Game in the New Millennium

When Institutional Investor asked Lanza L-3's next move in November 2000, he quipped, "We're gonna go buy Lockheed." L-3's impressive growth made this a less than outrageous prospect. The company's share price reached $80 by the end of the year. A new stock offering announced in April 2001 was to raise $350 million.
In the spring of 2001, Lanza announced that he was changing his acquisition strategy to buy larger companies in a bid to become "the Home Depot of the defense industry." He aimed for L-3 to have revenues of $6 or $7 billion within the next several years--a stretch for what was then a $2 billion company, but not a laughable one, especially given Lanza's reputation. Faster growth was deemed necessary to compete against Honeywell International Inc., which was being acquired by (the U.S.) General Electric Co., reported the Wall Street Journal.

At the 2001 Paris Air Show, Lanza told www.AviationNow .com that L-3 was a catalog company. It was more efficient, he said, to approach the handful of major aerospace companies with a vast array of products, than to try to vie for their business as a small, $100 million supplier. L-3 also boasted considerable financial resources and R&D capabilities and offered administrative efficiencies to the companies it acquired.

Please remember there's always the potential of losing money when you invest in securities. 
			
			Before you invest in a Section 529 plan, request the plan's official statement from your Financial Solutions Advisor and read it carefully. The official statement contains more complete information, including investment objectives, charges, expenses and risks of investing in the 529 plan, which you should consider carefully before investing. You should also consider whether your home state or your beneficiary's home state offers any state tax or other benefits that are only available for investments in such state's 529 plan. Section 529 plans are not guaranteed by any state or federal agency.

1 To be eligible for favorable tax treatment afforded to any earnings portion of withdrawals from Section 529 accounts, such withdrawals must be used for "qualified higher education expenses," as defined in the Internal Revenue Code. Any earnings withdrawn that are not used for such expenses are subject to federal income tax and may be subject to a 10% additional federal tax, as well as applicable state and local income taxes. 
			
2 Section 529 plans are established by various states and are offered to residents of all states. Depending on the laws of the customer's home state, favorable tax treatment for investing in a Section 529 plan may be limited to investments made in a Section 529 plan offered by the customer's home state. Neither Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated nor any of its subsidiaries are tax or legal advisors. We suggest you consult your personal tax or legal advisor before making tax or legal-related investment decisions.

Frequently Asked Questions 




What is an IRA?


							An Individual Retirement Account (IRA) may provide either a tax-deferred or tax-free way for you to save for retirement.  There are many different types of IRAs but Roth, Traditional and Rollover IRAs are the most common.
						






How does an IRA work?


							IRAs rely on long-term, tax-deferred compounding to provide your retirement savings the opportunity to grow more quickly than in a taxable account.  When you earn interest, receive a dividend or sell an investment (such as a mutual fund) for a gain, you don't pay taxes that year on the earnings.  Instead, all taxes are deferred until you withdraw those earnings in retirement.
						






Why is an IRA important now?


							In retirement you may need as much as 100% of your current after-tax income (take-home pay) minus any amount you are saving for retirement each year.  This makes it all the more important to start saving sooner rather than later, and an IRA can help you get started.
						






What are the ways I can invest in an IRA?


							You can choose from investment products such as mutual funds, stocks, bonds and ETFs, as well as bank products like CDs and money market savings.
						






What are the contribution deadlines?

You can make contributions to an IRA for a given tax year until the tax return filing deadline of the following year.






How do I convert to a Roth IRA?

A Roth IRA Conversion could help grow your retirement assets federally income tax-free. To help you convert to a Merrill Edge Roth IRA, call us at 888.637.3343 for one-on-one assistance and we'll guide you every step of the way. We're here 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.






What are my options for converting a 401(k) to an IRA?

You have several choices when it comes to your old 401(k). Typically known as a rollover IRA, you can opt to transfer your money into an IRA. Another option is keeping the current 401(k) with your old employer or transfer it to a new employer plan.

Frequently Asked Questions 




SEP IRA



Do I have to contribute annually?
                                No. A SEP IRA gives you the flexibility to decide each year whether to contribute and at what rate. That could mean contributing more during profitable years and less or nothing at all during less profitable years.
                            
Is it difficult to administer a SEP IRA?
                                SEP IRAs have little to no paperwork and administration and don't require filing with the IRS. Plus, a Small Business Financial Solutions Advisor can help you get started.
                            
Is there investment research I can review? 
                                Yes. As a Merrill Edge client, you get access to BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research (rated #1 by Institutional InvestorFootnote 2)-as well as research from other industry leaders-to gain investing knowledge and market
                                insights that can help inform your investment strategy.
                            




SIMPLE IRA



Is there a mandatory employer match? 
                                Yes. With a SIMPLE IRA, you must contribute either 2% of compensation for each eligible employee, regardless of participation, or a dollar-for-dollar match of employee salary deferral contributions, capped at 3% of compensation (which may be reduced to as low as 1% in any two years during a 5-year period).
                            
What if my business grows beyond 100 employees?
                                You may need to consider establishing a small business 401(k) plan when your business grows to more than 100 employees. A Small Business Financial Solutions Advisor can help you consider your options. Please note: If you decide to establish a 401(k) plan, you would stop contributions to the SIMPLE IRA plan and then start the 401(k). Participants that have been in the SIMPLE IRA plan for over two years may roll their SIMPLE IRA assets over to the new 401(k) if it allows for rollovers. Before making any decisions, you should speak with your tax and legal advisor about your situation and the requirements for terminating a plan and establishing a new one.
                            
Is it difficult to administer a SIMPLE IRA? 
                                We have many ways to make managing your retirement plan easier. Our Merrill Lynch E-Contribs for Small Business Retirement Accounts™ provides small business owners with a convenient web-based solution for making contributions to retirement plan accounts, while the Automated Investment Program provides a systematic way to invest in mutual funds on a schedule based on your needs.
                                
                                SIMPLE IRA contributions will be made through your payroll company and you will be required to send an annual notice to your employees. You do not file IRS Form 5500 as you would with a 401(k) plan.

1 You have choices for what to do with your employer sponsored retirement plan. Depending on your financial circumstances, needs and goals, you may choose to roll over to an IRA or convert to a Roth, roll over to an employer sponsored plan from a prior employer to an employer sponsored plan at your new employer, take a distribution or leave the account where it is. Each choice may offer different investment options and services, fees and expenses, withdrawal options, required minimum distributions, tax treatment and provide different protection from creditors and legal judgments. These are complex choices and should be considered with care.

Let me first start by saying I believe your site is THE BEST there is for connecting Entrepreneurs and Investors.  It is the site I've had most success with.  I had about 6 Investors either respond back or contact me because of your site with an interest in investing in my company. Thank you very much!  I love your site and will recommend it to any of my Colleagues.  I love the fact that we are able to contact the Investors directly (which many of the sites joining Entrepreneurs and Investors don't allow).  It looks like I'm about to go into contract with an Investor because of your site.  Thank you again.
