LIMA, Peru--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
      Cementos Pacasmayo S.A.A. and subsidiaries (NYSE:CPAC; BVL:CPACASC1)
      ("the Company" or "Cementos Pacasmayo") a leading cement company serving
      the Peruvian construction industry, announced today its consolidated
      results for the second quarter ("2Q17") and six months ("6M17") ended
      June 30, 2017. These results have been prepared in accordance with
      International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS") and are stated in
      nominal Peruvian Soles (S/).
    
Financial and Operational Highlights:
2Q17 Highlights

      (All comparisons are to 2Q16, unless otherwise stated)
    

Sales volume of cement, concrete and blocks decreased 2.8%
        primarily due to a sharp decline in sales volume in April due to
        landslides, flooding and heavy rain, in the North of Peru associated
        with Coastal El Niño. Sales volumes in May and June increased
        year-on-year.
      
Revenues decreased6.0%
      
Gross margin of 39.0%, a 3.6 percentage points decrease mainly
        due to significantly lower sales in April, as well as increased
        severance payments and lower dilution of fixed costs.
      
Cement EBITDA margin of 27.6%, a 4.4 percentage points
        decrease, resulting from unusually low cement EBITDA in April. May and
        June cement EBITDA margin was 30.5% and 32.3% respectively, showing a
        positive forward looking trend. Consolidated EBITDA of S/77.2
        million, a 19.1% decrease.
      
Net income of Continuing Operations of S/21.3 million, a 37.4%
        decrease due to lower sales volume, lower operating profit resulting
        from higher expenses related to severance payments, increased
        distribution costs due to road destruction, as well as the cost of
        some damages to our plants from Coastal El Niño.
      
Good Corporate Governance Index - Cementos Pacasmayo was
        included in the Lima Stock Exchange Good Corporate Governance Index
        ("BVL IBGC") for eighth consecutive year. The BVL IBGC Index is
        designed to track the performance of those companies committed to good
        corporate governance, with only six Peruvian listed companies included
        as part of the index in 2017.
      

6M17 Highlights

      (All comparisons are to 6M16, unless otherwise stated)
    

Sales volume of cement, concrete and blocks decreased 7.7%
        primarily due to a sharp decline in sales volume in the first four
        months of the year associated with Coastal El Niño.
      
Revenues decreased7.7% .
      
Gross margin of 39.6%, in line with gross margin for the 6M16.
      
Cement EBITDA margin of 28.7%, a 1.3 percentage points decrease
        resulting from unusually low cement EBITDA in April. Consolidated
        EBITDA of S/159.6 million, a 12.4% decrease.
      
Net income of Continuing Operations of S/43.7 million, a 31.2%
        decrease resulting from lower sales and lower operating margin.

Concrete Pumping





Our pumping equipment can be adapted to the needs of the different types of building works and the jobs to perform. We have experienced staff who evaluate the equipment that can be adapted to each need with the purpose of obtaining more productivity, minimizing the timing, costs and risks of the building works. We have boom pumps of 18, 20 and 32 meters in range, stationary trailer load and truck-trailer pumps. These models resist the rigors of any work zone and are easy to fill and to clean.

Quicklime





Quicklime is characterized by its versatility, since it may be used in almost all the industrial processes, whether as a neutralizing, melting, lubricating, drying, cementing, absorbing, precipitating, disinfecting or waterproofing agent, or as a raw material. In Peru, most of the lime goes to the mining, iron & steel, and construction industries. 
We currently sell the following types of lime:
Granular quicklime
It is called granular, because the granulometry of this product stays in the 1 inch and 3/8 inch meshes. This type of lime is delivered in Big Bags (1 MT), in cans and in hoppers.
Milled quicklime
It is called milled because the 60% of its content passes a 100 mesh, equivalent to 15 microns or 0.15 mm, so it could be said that it is powdered lime. This type of lime is delivered in Big Bags (1 MT), and in cans.

Concrete Prefabs





The prefabricated concrete elements, as its name suggests, are concrete elements manufactured before the building works, so that during the building they are directly placed, saving time and resources. There are many uses and types of prefab products that may be produced, from perimeter fences to whole houses. The most notorious benefits of this type of products vary with easiness and speed of placement, economy, aesthetics, duration, practicality, among others, depending of the type of prefabs used and their intended use. In Cementos Pacasmayo we currently produce the following types of prefabricated products:



 

Paving Stones

We have rectangular and square pavers, grass pavers....

Blocks

Its operations are concentrated in the north and east of the country, including cement plants in Rioja, Pacasmayo, and Piura, and ready-mix concrete plants in Chimbote, Trujillo, Pacasmayo, Chiclayo, Piura and Cajamarca. The firm also has eight concrete prefabs plants, one diatomite bricks plant, one lime plant, and three aggregates plants. Based in Santiago de Surco and founded in 1949, the company is part of local group Hochschild-Pacasmayo.

Where applicable, a project is considered as such until the end of construction and ramp-up to full capacity (with the exception of mining projects, where the date of commissioning signifies the end of the project). Projects must have a:  a) Start date b) Estimate for completion c) Initial investment estimate  Data For state-owned projects, initial information about the start date and estimates for completion and investment are taken from original signed contracts, along with addendums and annexes. If original contracts cannot be obtained, information is taken from public documents, presentations, news articles from BNamericas archives, and external sources. In cases where contracts are subject to approval by legislators, the start date is the date of the law or legislative approval. In the case of private projects, information is taken from public sources, such as stock exchange filings, annual reports, company presentations, third party research and press releases. In judging the timing of investment decisions for private projects, great care was taken to differentiate between large projects receiving environmental approval and proceeding directly to construction, and smaller projects where the investment decision hinges on securing financing. Best care is taken to ensure that recorded data is correct at the time of entry and that each entry is backed with a relevant source. The greatest care possible was taken to ensure consistency of information in order make a like-for-like comparison in project costs. Insofar as the figures rely on disclosure by the organization or company responsible, the figures can be considered to be conservative in nature. No attempt was made to adjust figures for inflation during the course of research or for consideration of the time value of money. Validation In the case of state-owned projects, validation is carried out where possible with either a member of the consortium, EPC contractor, a relevant state agency or advisors to either party. Currency Projects costs are measured in US dollars. Where project costs are measured in a local currency, amounts are converted to US dollars at the date of the relevant announcement, signature or report.  Severity of deviation from original estimates The severity of deviation from original estimates is defined according to set criteria. Timing    Status Condition     Ahead of time 95% of original estimate or below (measured in months)   On time 95% to 105% of original estimate   Minor changes 105% to 120% of original estimate   Medium changes 120% to 160% of original estimate   Major changes Over 160% of original estimate    Budget    Status Condition     Ahead of budget 95% of original budget estimate or below   To budget 95% to 105% of original budget estimate   Minor changes 105% to 120% of original budget estimate   Medium changes 120% to 140% of original budget estimate   Major changes Over 140% of original budget estimate    Changes in Scope Changes in scope beyond the start date are not accounted for. Language definitions Where guidance is non-specific as to dates for completion, the following is used. Project to be completed by 2018 = December 31, 2017 Project to be completed in 2018 = December 31, 2018
