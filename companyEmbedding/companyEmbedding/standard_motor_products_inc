The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

History[edit]
Standard Motor Products was founded in Manhattan in 1919 as a partnership between Elias Fife, a Jewish immigrant from Lithuania,[1] and Ralph Van Allen.[2] Originally the company specialized in ignition and electrical parts.[3] In 1920 Van Allen opened a Standard Motor Products branch in Seattle. In 1921 the company moved to the Long Island City section of Queens. The partnership dissolved in 1925 and in 1926 the company was incorporated with Fife as the sole proprietor. Van Allen operated a separate company in Los Angeles under the same name and logo until selling it to Fife in 1936.[2] That year the company also moved into the Art Deco building where it is still headquartered.[1] SMP has steadily grown with the automative age, evolving from ten employees to 3,500.
The Blue Streak line of premium impact parts was introduced in the 1930s. In 1947 Standard acquired Hygrade Products Co. The product line was expanded to include speedometer cables, carburetor repair parts, shock-absorber parts, and fuel pumps. In 1950 Standard introduced the Hygrade System, simplified carburetor kits for tune-ups and light overhauls.[2]
Standard Motor Products had its Initial public offering in 1960[2] and was listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in 1977.[3][4][5] In 1963 it entered the wholesale parts market with a new subsidiary, Marathon Parts.[2] Beginning in the late 1960s under Lawrence "Larry" Sills, Fife's grandson, Standard acquired several rival businesses.[1] In July 1997 it exchanged its brake business for Cooper Industries' temperature control business.[2][6] The company funded acquisitions by taking out loans and selling stock; as of 2011[update] less than 10% remains family-owned.[1] In the financial crisis of the late 2000s, the company had to retrench and sold its headquarters building for $40.6 million. The space was previously a manufacturing site producing items like distributor caps, but because of modern engine designs the workforce there dwindled over the years. The remaining Long Island City manufacturing operations were moved to its plant in Reynosa, Mexico, and Independence, Kansas.[7] On July 29, 2009 Chairman Sills rang the closing bell at the New York Stock Exchange to celebrate the company's 90th anniversary.[8]
In January 2014, the company acquired the assets of Pensacola Fuel Injection.[9]
Operations and products[edit]
The company has two operational segments, an Engine Management segment that produces parts for fuel systems, ignition and emissions, ignition wires, and battery cables, and a Temperature Control Segment that manufactures and refurbishes air-conditioning, heating, engine cooling system, and windshield washer parts, air-conditioning compressors, and power window accessories.[9] Its subsidiaries include Four Seasons Europe S.A.R.L. (in France), Marathon Auto Parts and Products, Inc., Motortronics, Inc., SMP Motor Products Limited (in Canada), Standard Motor Products Holdings Limited (in England and Wales), Standard Motor Products (Hong Kong) Limited, and Standard Motor Products de Mexico.[2]
The company sells to automotive stores and wholesalers. It manufactures approximately half of the parts it sells; most of the rest it imports from China.[10]
Some Standard products are sold under private labels, including CARQUEST, Cold Power, Duralast, Duralast Gold, Import Direct, Master Pro, Mileage Plus, Murray, and NAPA (NAPA Belden, NAPA Echlin, NAPA Temp Products). The company's own brands include Standard, BWD/NIEHOFF, Intermotor, OEM, LockSmart, TechSmart, and GP Sorensen for engine management and Four Seasons, Factory Air, EVERCO, ACi, Imperial, COMPRESSORWORKS, TORQFLO, and Hayden for temperature control.[11]
Sales[edit]
Standard Motor Products was listed as one of Crain's New York Business' top 250 publicly held companies for 2012,[12] and as number 94 in the Forbes list of America's best small companies in 2013. That year the company's earnings were $969 million with 4% sales growth and 61% earnings per share growth.[13] The company also received a positive review that year for its cash conversion cycle from an analyst at The Motley Fool.[14]

History[edit]
Standard Motor Products was founded in Manhattan in 1919 as a partnership between Elias Fife, a Jewish immigrant from Lithuania,[1] and Ralph Van Allen.[2] Originally the company specialized in ignition and electrical parts.[3] In 1920 Van Allen opened a Standard Motor Products branch in Seattle. In 1921 the company moved to the Long Island City section of Queens. The partnership dissolved in 1925 and in 1926 the company was incorporated with Fife as the sole proprietor. Van Allen operated a separate company in Los Angeles under the same name and logo until selling it to Fife in 1936.[2] That year the company also moved into the Art Deco building where it is still headquartered.[1] SMP has steadily grown with the automative age, evolving from ten employees to 3,500.
The Blue Streak line of premium impact parts was introduced in the 1930s. In 1947 Standard acquired Hygrade Products Co. The product line was expanded to include speedometer cables, carburetor repair parts, shock-absorber parts, and fuel pumps. In 1950 Standard introduced the Hygrade System, simplified carburetor kits for tune-ups and light overhauls.[2]
Standard Motor Products had its Initial public offering in 1960[2] and was listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in 1977.[3][4][5] In 1963 it entered the wholesale parts market with a new subsidiary, Marathon Parts.[2] Beginning in the late 1960s under Lawrence "Larry" Sills, Fife's grandson, Standard acquired several rival businesses.[1] In July 1997 it exchanged its brake business for Cooper Industries' temperature control business.[2][6] The company funded acquisitions by taking out loans and selling stock; as of 2011[update] less than 10% remains family-owned.[1] In the financial crisis of the late 2000s, the company had to retrench and sold its headquarters building for $40.6 million. The space was previously a manufacturing site producing items like distributor caps, but because of modern engine designs the workforce there dwindled over the years. The remaining Long Island City manufacturing operations were moved to its plant in Reynosa, Mexico, and Independence, Kansas.[7] On July 29, 2009 Chairman Sills rang the closing bell at the New York Stock Exchange to celebrate the company's 90th anniversary.[8]
In January 2014, the company acquired the assets of Pensacola Fuel Injection.[9]
Operations and products[edit]
The company has two operational segments, an Engine Management segment that produces parts for fuel systems, ignition and emissions, ignition wires, and battery cables, and a Temperature Control Segment that manufactures and refurbishes air-conditioning, heating, engine cooling system, and windshield washer parts, air-conditioning compressors, and power window accessories.[9] Its subsidiaries include Four Seasons Europe S.A.R.L. (in France), Marathon Auto Parts and Products, Inc., Motortronics, Inc., SMP Motor Products Limited (in Canada), Standard Motor Products Holdings Limited (in England and Wales), Standard Motor Products (Hong Kong) Limited, and Standard Motor Products de Mexico.[2]
The company sells to automotive stores and wholesalers. It manufactures approximately half of the parts it sells; most of the rest it imports from China.[10]
Some Standard products are sold under private labels, including CARQUEST, Cold Power, Duralast, Duralast Gold, Import Direct, Master Pro, Mileage Plus, Murray, and NAPA (NAPA Belden, NAPA Echlin, NAPA Temp Products). The company's own brands include Standard, BWD/NIEHOFF, Intermotor, OEM, LockSmart, TechSmart, and GP Sorensen for engine management and Four Seasons, Factory Air, EVERCO, ACi, Imperial, COMPRESSORWORKS, TORQFLO, and Hayden for temperature control.[11]
Sales[edit]
Standard Motor Products was listed as one of Crain's New York Business' top 250 publicly held companies for 2012,[12] and as number 94 in the Forbes list of America's best small companies in 2013. That year the company's earnings were $969 million with 4% sales growth and 61% earnings per share growth.[13] The company also received a positive review that year for its cash conversion cycle from an analyst at The Motley Fool.[14]

Standard Pro Training Seminars Syllabus
2016 Professional Technician Training SyllabusProfessional Technician’s Seminar Series Classroom Training Programs
Rapid Diagnostics: Going beyond the code - Available January 25, 2016
Engine performance problems typically set DTCs and technicians can fall into the trap of replacing parts based only on the code stored. What if replacing parts based on DTCs alone doesn't solve the customer concern? What if multiple codes are stored? What if a drivability concern exists and there are no DTCs? The most successful technicians in the industry approach problems in a structured and logical way. This class will give you a chance to follow their thought process and develop your own abilities.
Attend this class to:

Improve your accuracy and efficiency at diagnosing performance faults
Understand DTC definitions and code set criteria
Use schematics effectively to solve problems
Diagnose faults without stored DTCs
Participate in real world case studies to hone your skills

Induction System Diagnosis and Repair - Available January 25, 2016
Both gasoline and diesel engines use sophisticated induction systems which include exhaust gas recirculation, manifold tuning, turbocharging and supercharging. In this class we will introduce these systems and show how they can affect diagnosis of symptoms such as low power, fuel trim codes, and low fuel economy. We will use case studies to demonstrate field diagnostics and fixes on both gasoline and diesel engines.
Attend this class to:

Learn about turbocharger control systems
Perform turbocharger failure diagnosis
Repair and replacement techniques and tips
Diagnose manifold tuning controls
See how boosted systems affect fuel trim and diagnosis
Improve your induction troubleshooting skills

Automotive HVAC Solutions - Available January 25, 2016
HVAC systems have undergone significant changes and diagnostics and service need to change with them. The vehicles you will be servicing hold a fraction of the refrigerant of previous vehicles so each component must operate at maximum efficiency to produce the cooling your customers want. In this class we will dissect automotive HVAC systems and identify common failures as well as service pitfalls. You will see proven diagnostic and service techniques performed on a variety of systems. You will have a chance to join in the diagnosis of several problems. You don’t want to miss this opportunity to tune up your HVAC knowledge to ensure a successful season.
Attend this class to:

Learn how HVAC components operate and work together
See how simple tests can help you quickly find problems
Diagnose compressor and cooling fan controls
Collect valuable service tips
Be prepared for a successful AC season

Diagnosing Fuel Trim, MAF, and O2 Problems - Available August 1, 2016
The next vehicle you diagnose might be equipped with an Air/Fuel or Lambda sensor. These sensors have complicated the diagnosis of fuel trim DTC and reduced power concerns. Our familiar scan data such as g/s for a mass air flow sensor, Short Term and Long Term for fuel trim, 0-1 volt for O2 sensors have been replaced with terms like kg/hr, Equivalence Ratio, Milliamps, or strange voltages that don’t make sense.
The goal of this class is to help you streamline your diagnosis of fuel control related problems through an understanding of systems operation, and the application of data and diagnostic functions.  We will also cover the scenarios in which you must determine if the fuel trim is the cause or the result of the fault. 
Attend this class to:

Learn to troubleshoot AF sensor DTCs.
Interpret scan data to diagnose Fuel Trim issues.
Be prepared to determine if a low power complaint is caused by fuel delivery, engine breathing, or the MAF – even if the vehicle is equipped with AF sensors.

Cummins Diesel Diagnostic and Repair Solutions - Available August 1, 2016
The Cummins diesel engine has been a very popular engine choice for the Dodge truck platform. This engine has been in use for over 20 years but in recent years there have been a number of changes to the fuel system as well as the addition of emission devices. We will show you how they work, how they fail and how they affect diagnosis and service. The focus of this class will be to prepare you to diagnose and service these popular engines.
Attend this class to learn about:

Cummins common rail fuel systems including 5.9L and 6.7L engines
Supply and high pressure fuel systems
Turbocharger and EGR systems
Emission control systems
Exhaust after treatment systems
Diagnostic and repair tips

Additional Topics Available for 2016
Diagnosing the Top Duramax Diesel Problems
The Duramax diesel engine is a popular option in Chevrolet and GMC trucks. There are numerous pattern failures and the engine has undergone major changes since its' first introduction in 2000 to correct them. Technicians must be able to identify which engine design they are servicing and the unique issues related to it. Attend this class for important information on:

Fuel, air induction, and emissions systems including Particulate Filters and Diesel Engine Fluid systems.
System operation, pattern failures, diagnostics and case studies for each engine type.
Proper maintenance tips to improve the longevity of the engine and to improve profit in this market.

The goal of the class is to provide experienced diesel techs information and diagnostic strategies for dealing with the new DPF and DEF systems, as well as help the technician who doesn’t typically deal with diesel engines understand the concept and theories behind the Duramax engines. 
Diagnosing the Top Powerstroke Diesel Problems
It is an understatement to say that the Powerstroke engine has sold quite well in Ford pickups.  It is also widely known that there are plenty of service opportunities on these trucks as well.  These engines rely on high pressure oil systems that are prone to multiple failures, and take time and understanding of the system in order to diagnose and repair.  These engines rely on many electronic sensors and modules that require sharp diagnostic skills, electrical comprehension, and familiarity with module programming.  
While we will be introducing the 6.7 liter diesel, this class will focus on the operating characteristics of the 6.0 and 6.4 liter engines that are popular in the service bays today.     Common failures on these engines include: EGR cooler, head gasket, turbo, injectors, FICM, and high pressure oil systems.  Learn repair tips and diagnostic procedures submitted by technicians that work on these engines every day.
Diagnosing the Top Toyota/Lexus Engine Performance Problems
Toyota engines and control systems have undergone numerous changes and their diagnostic procedures have changed right along with them. Proper interpretation of scan data PIDs and the use of bidirectional controls and other enhanced scan tool functions can speed your diagnosis on these engines. Attend this class to improve your diagnostic skills and learn to:

Troubleshoot Toyota EVAP systems quickly using scan data.
Identify and diagnose misfiring cylinders.
Interpret AF sensor data and trim PIDs used by Toyota/Lexus vehicles.
Troubleshoot and repair electronic throttle controls.

The goal of this class is to prepare you to diagnose common problems on these engine control systems in the shortest amount of time. During the class, case studies will be used to demonstrate efficient diagnostic methods. Pattern failures and common pitfalls will be covered that will help you to diagnose these vehicles quickly and accurately.
Diagnosing Vehicle Electronics Problems
Today’s vehicles contain a complex mix of sensors, actuators, and control modules to perform most functions. Raising a window can involve a switch module, door module, and body control module in addition to the motor which does the work. A test light can only go so far in diagnosing these circuits and jumper wires can spell disaster if used incorrectly. Attend this class to improve your diagnostic skills and learn to:

Troubleshoot sensors and actuators and verify their operation.
Quickly interpret schematics and use them to determine a diagnostic path.
Verify module operation and communications.

The goal of this class is to prepare you to diagnose and repair problems in body, chassis, HVAC, and powertrain control systems, as well as the data bus which connects them. Case studies will be used to demonstrate techniques you can use to reduce the time spent on diagnosis.
Hyundai/Kia Drivability Solutions
This course is filled with the information needed to fix Hyundai/Kia vehicles quickly and accurately. A system descriptions and operational details are provided for EVAP, Fuel Control, and Ignition, along with proven diagnostic techniques. Common failures will be covered such as hard start, low power, stalling, and Misfire DTCs. Procedures for relearn and verification will be demonstrated.
A variety of case studies are used to demonstrate diagnostic techniques. Hyundai/Kia vehicles use unique scan data PIDs. The effective use of these PIDs will be demonstrated for each system. Field developed techniques and repair tips are included in the class and the manual.
Ford Driveability Solutions
Ford engine controls have undergone significant changes as more vehicles are equipped with features such as wide range air fuel sensors and EcoBoost systems. EVAP systems still require diagnosis and there are some new techniques required due to capless fuel fillers and other system changes. Ford’s approach to misfire detection and data display can result in wasted time during diagnosis.
This class will focus on common failures in electronic throttle control, variable valve timing, fuel measurement and delivery, and other areas which can cause driveability symptoms. Case studies will be used to demonstrate diagnostic techniques which same time and steps. Attend this class and become more efficient when solving Ford diagnostic puzzles.
Successful Hybrid Diagnosis & Repair
The hybrid market continues to expand and many hybrids now need high voltage battery or transaxle repairs. While these vehicles require specific service procedures and some special tools, the diagnosis and repairs they need are not beyond the capabilities of a well-equipped shop with trained technicians.
Hybrid vehicles on the road today include: true hybrids like the Prius, Ford Fusion, Focus, and CMax, large vehicle two-mode hybrids such as GM, Chrysler, and BMW, EV/Hybrid vehicles such as the Chevrolet Volt and the Toyota Prius Plug-In, and “e-assist” vehicles which have an auto-stop feature and limited regeneration capabilities.
 This class will focus on the big sellers; Gen 1, 2, and 3 Prius, Toyota Camry and Nissan Altima. We will also cover failures on Ford Escape, as well as Honda vehicles. These are the vehicles most likely to require battery or other hybrid system repairs.
Learn how to diagnose battery, inverter, transaxle and other hybrid systems failures and start making money when these systems fail.
Automotive CAN Bus – What it CAN do for you!
Controller Area Network has been used in vehicles since the early 2000s, but many technicians don’t realize the full capability of this system.  This course will begin by explaining the theory and benefits of the CAN bus design and operation.  It will then move into showing the additional scan data PIDs, Freeze Frame information, and Mode $06 information that will significantly aid the technician’s diagnosis. 
The course will focus on diagnostic strategies that the technician can use in the bay the next day.  There will be case studies that not only illustrate the use of CAN data PIDs found in generic OBDII, but also case studies illustrating diagnosing network communication faults that result in modules that are unable to communicate.
GM Driveability Solutions
General Motors vehicles have undergone many changes and improvements in recent years. At the same time, General Motors has changed the format of repair and diagnostic information. Diagnostic flow charts, for example, have been removed causing technician frustration.
This class will focus on solving driveability faults in a logical manner using the available information and tools in the context of real world case studies. Learn verified diagnostic procedures for Variable Valve Timing,                  Electronic Throttle Control, Fuel Trim, Evaporative Systems, Active Fuel Management, Network Faults, and Ignition Systems.

History[edit]
Standard Motor Products was founded in Manhattan in 1919 as a partnership between Elias Fife, a Jewish immigrant from Lithuania,[1] and Ralph Van Allen.[2] Originally the company specialized in ignition and electrical parts.[3] In 1920 Van Allen opened a Standard Motor Products branch in Seattle. In 1921 the company moved to the Long Island City section of Queens. The partnership dissolved in 1925 and in 1926 the company was incorporated with Fife as the sole proprietor. Van Allen operated a separate company in Los Angeles under the same name and logo until selling it to Fife in 1936.[2] That year the company also moved into the Art Deco building where it is still headquartered.[1] SMP has steadily grown with the automative age, evolving from ten employees to 3,500.
The Blue Streak line of premium impact parts was introduced in the 1930s. In 1947 Standard acquired Hygrade Products Co. The product line was expanded to include speedometer cables, carburetor repair parts, shock-absorber parts, and fuel pumps. In 1950 Standard introduced the Hygrade System, simplified carburetor kits for tune-ups and light overhauls.[2]
Standard Motor Products had its Initial public offering in 1960[2] and was listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in 1977.[3][4][5] In 1963 it entered the wholesale parts market with a new subsidiary, Marathon Parts.[2] Beginning in the late 1960s under Lawrence "Larry" Sills, Fife's grandson, Standard acquired several rival businesses.[1] In July 1997 it exchanged its brake business for Cooper Industries' temperature control business.[2][6] The company funded acquisitions by taking out loans and selling stock; as of 2011[update] less than 10% remains family-owned.[1] In the financial crisis of the late 2000s, the company had to retrench and sold its headquarters building for $40.6 million. The space was previously a manufacturing site producing items like distributor caps, but because of modern engine designs the workforce there dwindled over the years. The remaining Long Island City manufacturing operations were moved to its plant in Reynosa, Mexico, and Independence, Kansas.[7] On July 29, 2009 Chairman Sills rang the closing bell at the New York Stock Exchange to celebrate the company's 90th anniversary.[8]
In January 2014, the company acquired the assets of Pensacola Fuel Injection.[9]
Operations and products[edit]
The company has two operational segments, an Engine Management segment that produces parts for fuel systems, ignition and emissions, ignition wires, and battery cables, and a Temperature Control Segment that manufactures and refurbishes air-conditioning, heating, engine cooling system, and windshield washer parts, air-conditioning compressors, and power window accessories.[9] Its subsidiaries include Four Seasons Europe S.A.R.L. (in France), Marathon Auto Parts and Products, Inc., Motortronics, Inc., SMP Motor Products Limited (in Canada), Standard Motor Products Holdings Limited (in England and Wales), Standard Motor Products (Hong Kong) Limited, and Standard Motor Products de Mexico.[2]
The company sells to automotive stores and wholesalers. It manufactures approximately half of the parts it sells; most of the rest it imports from China.[10]
Some Standard products are sold under private labels, including CARQUEST, Cold Power, Duralast, Duralast Gold, Import Direct, Master Pro, Mileage Plus, Murray, and NAPA (NAPA Belden, NAPA Echlin, NAPA Temp Products). The company's own brands include Standard, BWD/NIEHOFF, Intermotor, OEM, LockSmart, TechSmart, and GP Sorensen for engine management and Four Seasons, Factory Air, EVERCO, ACi, Imperial, COMPRESSORWORKS, TORQFLO, and Hayden for temperature control.[11]
Sales[edit]
Standard Motor Products was listed as one of Crain's New York Business' top 250 publicly held companies for 2012,[12] and as number 94 in the Forbes list of America's best small companies in 2013. That year the company's earnings were $969 million with 4% sales growth and 61% earnings per share growth.[13] The company also received a positive review that year for its cash conversion cycle from an analyst at The Motley Fool.[14]

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.

How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
