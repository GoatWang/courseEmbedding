Oil & Gas Investment Fraud Scams & Lawsuits Attorneys
























































































Oil & Gas Investment Scams
With the drop in oil prices in 2014 and 2015, thousands of investors are realizing they have been taken advantage of in investments related to oil and gas. There are two types of investment losses in oil and gas securities that are potentially recoverable through the FIRNA arbitration process or via lawsuit.
Unsuitable Investment Recommendations In Oil and Gas Stocks, Bonds, Master Limited Partnerships and Mutual Funds: Negligence based unsuitable investment recommendations in oil, gas and energy related companies make up a majority of the cases we’ve handled for investors. For example, brokers at full service brokerage firms recommended oil and gas stocks, master limited partnerships and other related investments heavily to investors between 2010 and 2014. With the massive slide in oil prices in 2014 and 2015 caused by the jump in domestic oil stockpiles due to new, highly efficient drilling techniques like horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracking techniques, companies affiliated with the oil industries have lost substantial value resulting in devastating investment losses for many investors. Unfortunately, many small oil and gas producers have lost a majority of their value in 2014 and 2015. These companies have heavy debt loads that simply couldn’t be maintained with the oil price slide.
Dozens of master limited partnerships have declined in value in 2014 and 2015. The $500 billion master-limited-partnership sector is the sausage maker of the investment world. Buyers love the yields — now averaging about 6% — but many know little about how the yields are generated. The bullish pitch by brokers in favor of the investments centered around the high-yielding way to participate in the booming U.S. energy infrastructure build-out. Unfortunately, the investments, while providing generous yields, masked the substantial high risks of these investments.
Many of these investments were pitched to elderly and conservative investors because of the relatively high dividends and yields that the investments paid out. These losses are potentially recoverable through either FINRA arbitration claims against the brokerage firms whose brokers recommended the investments or lawsuits against the promoters of the investments.
Fraud Based Claims: The second type of oil and gas actions deal with fraud based claims. Oil and gas investments take many forms, including limited partnership interests, master limited partnerships, ownership of fractional undivided interests in leases, and general partnerships. Risk level, tax consequences and investor liability vary according to the type of program. Drilling partnerships have always been a gamble, but unfortunately many oil and gas scams have been perpetrated by bad actors in the securities industry. Although some of the con artists moved on to more lucrative venues since the oil boom ended in the mid-1980s, many continued to linger on in the oil field and the results of their actions are being felt now. Fraudulent oil and gas deals are frequently structured with the limited partnership (or other legal entity) in one state, the operation and physical presence of the field in a second state, and the offerings made to prospective investors in states other than the initial two states. Thus there is less chance of an investor dropping by a well site or a nonexistent company headquarters. Such a structure also makes it difficult for law enforcement officials and victims to identify and expose the fraud.
Our Securities Law Firm Holds Financial Advisors Accountable
Brokers at major brokerage firms like Linsco LPL, UBS, Merrill Lynch, Raymond James, Citgroup and Stifel Nicolaus also sometimes engage in an activity called “selling away”. When a broker sells a customer an “investment” outside the investment products offered by the brokerage firm and outside the client’s account, there may be a selling away issue. These investments, known as Private Securities, often involve investments in oil and gas related limited partnerships, privately held companies, private placements, promissory notes, and other similar investments. Sometimes they are real investments. Other times they are completely bogus and used as a means for the advisor to convert client funds.
Unfortunately, unscrupulous oil promoters and stockbrokers frequently use the Internet and “boiler room” offices with banks of phones manned by salespeople with little or no background in energy exploration, but plenty of experience in high-pressure sales. Their techniques include repeated unsolicited phone calls to potential investors, hyping the profitability of the deal and promises of safe but secure returns. Some examples of these pitches include:
• You will have an interest in a well that cannot miss;
• The risks are minimal;
• A geologist has given the salesperson a tip;
• The broker or salesperson has personally invested in the venture;
• The promoter has “hit” on every well drilled so far;
• There has been a tremendous “discovery” in an adjacent field;
• A large, reputable oil company like Chevron is operating or planning to operate in the area;
• Only a few interests remain to be sold and you should immediately send in your money in order to assure the purchase of an interest;
• This is a special private deal open only to a lucky chosen few investors.

Investor Update: Those Who Lost Money in ForceField Energy

Andrew Stoltmann /
Chelsea Financial Services, forcefield energy, fraud, gerald cocuzzo, investment fraud, lawsuit, legend securities, maroof miyana, meyers associates, naveed khan, newbridge securities, pranav patel, richard brown, SEC, sunsi energies / 

Stoltmann Law Offices continues to investigate ForceField Energy, formerly known as SunSi Energies. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently brought a complaint against many of its former operators and owners, as well as brokers from brokerage firms who recommended that their customers invest in ForceField. The financial advisors who recommended the investment and were named in the complaint were Gerald Cocuzzo, Naveed A. Khan, Maroof Miyana, Richard L. Brown and Pranav V. Patel. Allegedly, these advisors had an encryption on their phone that would delete texts after a certain period of time. The texts in question came from Jared Mitchell, who worked for ForceField, and would allegedly give the financial advisors brown bags of cash if they recommended his investment. The advisors would then receive kickbacks for their participation and sales. This is against securities laws. ForceField no longer trades on the NASDAQ.
Gerald Cocuzzo worked for Newbridge Securities Corp in Boca Raton, Florida from December 2014 until May 2016. Naveed Khan worked for Meyers Associates in Staten Island, New York from April 2013 until today. Khan was barred from the securities industry by the SEC and has pled guilty to securities fraud. Maroof Miyana worked for Legend Securities in Pompano Beach, Florida from December 2014 until today and Pranav Patel worked with Dawson James Securities in Boca Raton from January 2015 until December 2015. Richard Brown worked for Chelsea Financial Services in Huntington, New York from February 2012 until November 2015.
Because Newbridge Securities, Meyers Associates, Legend Securities, Dawson James Securities and Chelsea Financial Services did not reasonably supervise their brokers and allowed them to sell unsuitable investments such as ForceField Energy, each firm may be held liable for losses. If you invested money with Cocuzzo, Khan, Miyana, Patel or Brown or any of their firms, you may be able to bring legal action against their firms in the FINRA arbitration forum on a contingency fee basis. Call us today to find out how. 312-332-4200. The call is free with no obligation. We are based in Chicago, Illinois.

Update For Investors Who Lost Oil and Gas-Related Investments With Red River Securities

Andrew Stoltmann /
Brian Hardwick, oil and gas scams, Red River Securities / 

Stoltmann Law Offices continues to investigate River Securities and its CEO, Brian Hardwick, who were both recently expelled from the industry by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and jointly and severally ordered to pay $24.6 million in restitution to clients for fraudulent sales in five oil and gas joint ventures. FINRA found that Red River Securities and Hardwick allegedly intentionally and fraudulently misrepresented and omitted material facts in connection with the sales of interests in oil and gas joint ventures issued by Regal Energy, an affiliate of Red River Securities. The offerings were high-risk and illiquid, and were made more so by the alleged misrepresentations by Red River and its representatives. One client was 74 years old and a self-employed farmer. A Red River broker put more than half of her investment into three risky oil and gas ventures in a period of a year, which was not suitable for her, considering her age, net worth and risk tolerance. A broker must take into account these factors before recommending or selling a security, and if he does not, his firm can be liable for losses. The firm must reasonably supervise its representatives. Please call our law offices today at 312-332-4200 to speak to an attorney if you lost money in risky oil and gas ventures because of Red River Securities. We are securities attorneys who recover money for investors on a contingency fee basis.

They do typically get taxed at a higher rate due to taxes being imposed at both a personal and corporate level, however having access to more capital, higher revenue potential, and ultimately profits, often offsets this.Why choose a C Corp?

We love to help!What are the primary advantages of a C Corporation?The C Corporation structure is very similar to the C Corporation, with a few notable differences. The most important of these differences is that C Corporations are eligible for special pass through taxation status with the IRS. This allows C Corporation owners to avoid double taxation on their business income. Are there any restrictions on who can file to form a C Corporation?Outside of some state-specific regulations that require individuals to be 18 to own a business, there are no restrictions on who can form a corporation. However, if a corporation decides to elect for C Corporation status, there are several restrictions placed on who can become part of the organizations ownership. They are as follows:• All C Corporation shareholders must be legal citizens of the United States. • C Corporations are only able to distribute one uniform class of stock. • C Corporation are limited to 100 different shareholders • Subsidiary organizations may not have an ownership interest in a C Corporation; all shareholders must be individuals.  What are the tax implications of a C Corporation?One of the most common reasons that business owners elect to form a C Corporation is that the structure is eligible for pass-through taxation. Under this special tax status, the corporation is never taxed on its income. Instead, each individual owner is taxed on the company's profits and losses, as they are distributed and reflected on their personal income tax returns. Are there a required number of individuals needed to form a C Corporation?Most states only require one director in order to start a C Corporation. However, some states impose a minimum number of directors based on the number of shareholders the company has. This required number is typically never lower than three and there is no maximum limit.

Biographical notes:

The companies in this section of the Penn Virginia archive represent its post-1960 diversification effort.
Prior to the 1960s, the Virginia Coal & Iron Company's subsidiary companies all performed support services to its real estate
                        holdings in southwestern Virginia. By that time, however, these secondary functions had ceased to be productive and could
                        better be carried on by others. Most were therefore sold to larger firms engaged in the same line of work. The Interstate
                        Railroad was sold to the Southern Railway Company in 1961 and the First National Bank of Appalachia to Dominion Bankshares
                        Corporation in 1967. The two water companies were sold to the Town of Appalachia, Clear Creek, in 1973 and Cumberland in 1977.
                     
In view of its changing role, the Virginia Coal & Iron Company was renamed Penn Virginia Corporation in 1967 and began a program
                        of diversification. The company was gradually transformed into a natural resource oriented holding company with investments
                        in raw materials, raw materials processing, and the manufacture of processing equipment.
                     
The Wheelwright Corporation was created in 1967 for the purpose of converting fly-ash, a waste product of bituminous coal
                        combustion, into marketable products. These included lightweight aggregate for concrete block, a partial substitute for portland
                        cement, and magnetite for use in the flotation slurry used in coal-cleaning plants. The company absorbed the Viall-Ohio Fly
                        Ash Company, Inc., in 1973. Continuing difficulties in the production process, combined with the declining market for construction
                        materials during the recession of the late 1970s, rendered the company unprofitable, and it was sold in 1981.
                     
Penn Virginia Corporation acquired a minority interest in Can-Fer Mines, Ltd., a Toronto-based owner of iron ore lands, in
                        1967. It was later merged into Bralorne Resources, Ltd., a larger Canadian natural resources conglomerate. Between 1970 and
                        1971, Penn Virginia also had an investment in Ceramtec Industries, Inc., a manufacturer of ceramic shapes and coatings. Between
                        1974 and 1981, it had a large investment in the Whitehall Cement Manufacturing Company. It invested in limestone quarries,
                        purchasing the Farber White Limestone Company and Limestone Products Corporation of America in New Jersey, and the Luttrell
                        Mining Company of Tennessee between 1974-1977. Penn Virginia acquired the Pennsylvania Crusher Company in 1976 and the Merrick
                        Scale Manufacturing Company in 1980.
                     
From the description of Records of subsidiary companies, 1899-1980. (Hagley Museum & Library). WorldCat record id: 122333714
Penn Virginia Corporation was incorporated as the Virginia Coal & Iron Company on January 6, 1882. It was one of many firms
                        established by a group of interrelated entrepreneurs headed by John Leisenring (1819-1884), a Mauch Chunk, Pennsylvania, civil
                        and mining engineer.
                     
Beginning in 1854, members of the interrelated Leisenring, Bertsch, Price, Wentz and Kemmerer families formed a series of
                        anthracite mining companies whose operations were scattered throughout the Eastern and Western Middle Anthracite Coal Fields.
                        Their investment in anthracite mining continued to grow until the early 1920s, and they generally ranked among the top fifteen
                        anthracite producers.
                     
The Leisenrings were among several anthracite operators who made the transition to bituminous coal. In 1880, John Leisenring
                        organized the Connellsville Coke & Iron Company in the western Pennsylvania basin that then held a near-monopoly on the production
                        of coking coal. The next year, he began investing in hitherto inaccessible coking coal deposits in southwestern Virginia.
                     
The Virginia Coal & Iron Company acquired 70,000 acres of land near Big Stone Gap. The formation of the Virginia Coal & Iron
                        Company was part of a larger movement of northern capital and entrepreneurs into the underdeveloped natural resource industries
                        of the Appalachian South. Penn Virginia is somewhat atypical in that it is publicly traded, whereas most such land companies
                        have remained privately held or are subsidiaries of the coal-hauling railroads.
                     
The Connellsville Coke & Iron Company had come into competition with Andrew Carnegie and Henry Clay Frick, and the Leisenrings
                        were compelled to sell out to them in 1889. The capital and skilled personnel thus released were transferred to Virginia.
                     
After the death of John Leisenring, the company was headed by his son Edward B. Leisenring (1845-1894) and his son-in-law
                        Dr. John Shriver Wentz (1838-1918). In 1896, Dr. Wentz sent his eldest son, Daniel Bertsch Wentz (1872-1926), to Big Stone
                        Gap to take charge of the Virginia operations. D. B. Wentz returned to Philadelphia as president of all the bituminous coal
                        companies in 1904.
                     
In 1902, the operation of the mines was spun off to the Stonega Coke & Coal Company, controlled by Dr. Wentz. While operating
                        as a lessee, it remained partially interlocked with the Virginia Coal & Iron Company.
                     
The Wentz interests had organized several other bituminous coal and land companies. Dr. Wentz purchased 8,500 acres in Harlan
                        and Letcher Counties, Kentucky in 1899-1905 and conveyed them to the Wentz Company in 1907. The Wentz family also controlled
                        the Virginia-Kentucky Coal Corporation owning 11,000 acres in Knott County, Kentucky. Dr. Wentz purchased the Royal Colliery
                        Company of Virden, Illinois, in 1903, but it was too removed from the rest of his properties to be managed efficiently. In
                        1919, the Wentz Corporation acquired control of the Hudson Coal Company of Clarksburg, West Virginia.
                     
In 1916-17, Dr. Wentz had acquired a large block of the Westmoreland Coal Company, and when its president died suddenly in
                        1929 with the entire industry rapidly declining, its management was turned over to Stonega's officers. Its real estate was
                        spun off to a new company, Westmoreland, Inc., so that it conformed to the land company/operating company arrangement.
                     
In the 1960s, the entire corporate structure was reorganized. In 1962, the Virginia Coal & Iron Company acquired 52% of the
                        Westmoreland Coal Company's stock, and a year later it absorbed Westmoreland, Inc., to form a single land company. To reflect
                        its new functions and objectives, the Virginia Coal & Iron Company was renamed Penn Virginia Corporation on April 19, 1967.
                        The company also divested itself of its traditional Virginia subsidiaries between 1961 and 1977. Since 1967, Penn Virginia
                        Corporation has functioned as a holding and investment company. In addition to its coal lands, it owns limestone quarries
                        in New Jersey and Tennessee. Since 1976 it has purchased several small manufacturing companies specializing in equipment for
                        handling and processing natural raw materials.

Oil & Gas Investment Fraud Scams & Lawsuits Attorneys
























































































Oil & Gas Investment Scams
With the drop in oil prices in 2014 and 2015, thousands of investors are realizing they have been taken advantage of in investments related to oil and gas. There are two types of investment losses in oil and gas securities that are potentially recoverable through the FIRNA arbitration process or via lawsuit.
Unsuitable Investment Recommendations In Oil and Gas Stocks, Bonds, Master Limited Partnerships and Mutual Funds: Negligence based unsuitable investment recommendations in oil, gas and energy related companies make up a majority of the cases we’ve handled for investors. For example, brokers at full service brokerage firms recommended oil and gas stocks, master limited partnerships and other related investments heavily to investors between 2010 and 2014. With the massive slide in oil prices in 2014 and 2015 caused by the jump in domestic oil stockpiles due to new, highly efficient drilling techniques like horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracking techniques, companies affiliated with the oil industries have lost substantial value resulting in devastating investment losses for many investors. Unfortunately, many small oil and gas producers have lost a majority of their value in 2014 and 2015. These companies have heavy debt loads that simply couldn’t be maintained with the oil price slide.
Dozens of master limited partnerships have declined in value in 2014 and 2015. The $500 billion master-limited-partnership sector is the sausage maker of the investment world. Buyers love the yields — now averaging about 6% — but many know little about how the yields are generated. The bullish pitch by brokers in favor of the investments centered around the high-yielding way to participate in the booming U.S. energy infrastructure build-out. Unfortunately, the investments, while providing generous yields, masked the substantial high risks of these investments.
Many of these investments were pitched to elderly and conservative investors because of the relatively high dividends and yields that the investments paid out. These losses are potentially recoverable through either FINRA arbitration claims against the brokerage firms whose brokers recommended the investments or lawsuits against the promoters of the investments.
Fraud Based Claims: The second type of oil and gas actions deal with fraud based claims. Oil and gas investments take many forms, including limited partnership interests, master limited partnerships, ownership of fractional undivided interests in leases, and general partnerships. Risk level, tax consequences and investor liability vary according to the type of program. Drilling partnerships have always been a gamble, but unfortunately many oil and gas scams have been perpetrated by bad actors in the securities industry. Although some of the con artists moved on to more lucrative venues since the oil boom ended in the mid-1980s, many continued to linger on in the oil field and the results of their actions are being felt now. Fraudulent oil and gas deals are frequently structured with the limited partnership (or other legal entity) in one state, the operation and physical presence of the field in a second state, and the offerings made to prospective investors in states other than the initial two states. Thus there is less chance of an investor dropping by a well site or a nonexistent company headquarters. Such a structure also makes it difficult for law enforcement officials and victims to identify and expose the fraud.
Our Securities Law Firm Holds Financial Advisors Accountable
Brokers at major brokerage firms like Linsco LPL, UBS, Merrill Lynch, Raymond James, Citgroup and Stifel Nicolaus also sometimes engage in an activity called “selling away”. When a broker sells a customer an “investment” outside the investment products offered by the brokerage firm and outside the client’s account, there may be a selling away issue. These investments, known as Private Securities, often involve investments in oil and gas related limited partnerships, privately held companies, private placements, promissory notes, and other similar investments. Sometimes they are real investments. Other times they are completely bogus and used as a means for the advisor to convert client funds.
Unfortunately, unscrupulous oil promoters and stockbrokers frequently use the Internet and “boiler room” offices with banks of phones manned by salespeople with little or no background in energy exploration, but plenty of experience in high-pressure sales. Their techniques include repeated unsolicited phone calls to potential investors, hyping the profitability of the deal and promises of safe but secure returns. Some examples of these pitches include:
• You will have an interest in a well that cannot miss;
• The risks are minimal;
• A geologist has given the salesperson a tip;
• The broker or salesperson has personally invested in the venture;
• The promoter has “hit” on every well drilled so far;
• There has been a tremendous “discovery” in an adjacent field;
• A large, reputable oil company like Chevron is operating or planning to operate in the area;
• Only a few interests remain to be sold and you should immediately send in your money in order to assure the purchase of an interest;
• This is a special private deal open only to a lucky chosen few investors.

Recently, a complaint was filed against Stephen Swarbrick with the California Department of Business Oversight alleging unsuitable sales for $400,000 in equipment leasing and oil and gas partnerships for December 2009 through June 2014. Other complaints involve Swarbrick’s sales of alternative investment products such as equipment leasing and oil and as private placements. These can be extremely risky and illiquid investments that are not suitable for all investors. Many investments in oil and gas are risky and illiquid, and a broker must take into account a client’s age, net worth, and investment objectives before recommending an investment. Please call our securities law firm today at 312-332-4200 to find out how you may be able to sue Swarbrick’s firm, Questar Capital Corp if you suffered losses with him. The firm may be liable for those losses because it failed to properly supervise him. The call is free with no obligation. We take cases on a contingency fee basis only. According to his online, FINRA BrokerCheck report, Mr. Swarbrick was registered with Great Western Financial Securities in Northridge, Georgia from June 1994 until May 1998, WM Financial Services in Irvine, California from February 1998 until September 2003 and Woodbury Financial Services in Roseville, California from September 2003 until October 2012.

Investor Update: Those Who Lost Money in ForceField Energy

Andrew Stoltmann /
Chelsea Financial Services, forcefield energy, fraud, gerald cocuzzo, investment fraud, lawsuit, legend securities, maroof miyana, meyers associates, naveed khan, newbridge securities, pranav patel, richard brown, SEC, sunsi energies / 

Stoltmann Law Offices continues to investigate ForceField Energy, formerly known as SunSi Energies. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently brought a complaint against many of its former operators and owners, as well as brokers from brokerage firms who recommended that their customers invest in ForceField. The financial advisors who recommended the investment and were named in the complaint were Gerald Cocuzzo, Naveed A. Khan, Maroof Miyana, Richard L. Brown and Pranav V. Patel. Allegedly, these advisors had an encryption on their phone that would delete texts after a certain period of time. The texts in question came from Jared Mitchell, who worked for ForceField, and would allegedly give the financial advisors brown bags of cash if they recommended his investment. The advisors would then receive kickbacks for their participation and sales. This is against securities laws. ForceField no longer trades on the NASDAQ.
Gerald Cocuzzo worked for Newbridge Securities Corp in Boca Raton, Florida from December 2014 until May 2016. Naveed Khan worked for Meyers Associates in Staten Island, New York from April 2013 until today. Khan was barred from the securities industry by the SEC and has pled guilty to securities fraud. Maroof Miyana worked for Legend Securities in Pompano Beach, Florida from December 2014 until today and Pranav Patel worked with Dawson James Securities in Boca Raton from January 2015 until December 2015. Richard Brown worked for Chelsea Financial Services in Huntington, New York from February 2012 until November 2015.
Because Newbridge Securities, Meyers Associates, Legend Securities, Dawson James Securities and Chelsea Financial Services did not reasonably supervise their brokers and allowed them to sell unsuitable investments such as ForceField Energy, each firm may be held liable for losses. If you invested money with Cocuzzo, Khan, Miyana, Patel or Brown or any of their firms, you may be able to bring legal action against their firms in the FINRA arbitration forum on a contingency fee basis. Call us today to find out how. 312-332-4200. The call is free with no obligation. We are based in Chicago, Illinois.

Update For Investors Who Lost Oil and Gas-Related Investments With Red River Securities

Andrew Stoltmann /
Brian Hardwick, oil and gas scams, Red River Securities / 

Stoltmann Law Offices continues to investigate River Securities and its CEO, Brian Hardwick, who were both recently expelled from the industry by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and jointly and severally ordered to pay $24.6 million in restitution to clients for fraudulent sales in five oil and gas joint ventures. FINRA found that Red River Securities and Hardwick allegedly intentionally and fraudulently misrepresented and omitted material facts in connection with the sales of interests in oil and gas joint ventures issued by Regal Energy, an affiliate of Red River Securities. The offerings were high-risk and illiquid, and were made more so by the alleged misrepresentations by Red River and its representatives. One client was 74 years old and a self-employed farmer. A Red River broker put more than half of her investment into three risky oil and gas ventures in a period of a year, which was not suitable for her, considering her age, net worth and risk tolerance. A broker must take into account these factors before recommending or selling a security, and if he does not, his firm can be liable for losses. The firm must reasonably supervise its representatives. Please call our law offices today at 312-332-4200 to speak to an attorney if you lost money in risky oil and gas ventures because of Red River Securities. We are securities attorneys who recover money for investors on a contingency fee basis.

We love to help!What are the primary advantages of a C Corporation?The C Corporation structure is very similar to the C Corporation, with a few notable differences. The most important of these differences is that C Corporations are eligible for special pass through taxation status with the IRS. This allows C Corporation owners to avoid double taxation on their business income. Are there any restrictions on who can file to form a C Corporation?Outside of some state-specific regulations that require individuals to be 18 to own a business, there are no restrictions on who can form a corporation. However, if a corporation decides to elect for C Corporation status, there are several restrictions placed on who can become part of the organizations ownership. They are as follows:• All C Corporation shareholders must be legal citizens of the United States. • C Corporations are only able to distribute one uniform class of stock. • C Corporation are limited to 100 different shareholders • Subsidiary organizations may not have an ownership interest in a C Corporation; all shareholders must be individuals.  What are the tax implications of a C Corporation?One of the most common reasons that business owners elect to form a C Corporation is that the structure is eligible for pass-through taxation. Under this special tax status, the corporation is never taxed on its income. Instead, each individual owner is taxed on the company's profits and losses, as they are distributed and reflected on their personal income tax returns. Are there a required number of individuals needed to form a C Corporation?Most states only require one director in order to start a C Corporation. However, some states impose a minimum number of directors based on the number of shareholders the company has. This required number is typically never lower than three and there is no maximum limit.

Penn Virginia

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

Penn Virginia Corporation (OTC Pink: PVAHQ) is an independent oil and gas company engaged in the exploration, development and production of oil, NGLs and natural gas in various domestic onshore regions of the United States, with a primary focus in the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas. Penn Virginia headquarters and corporate office is located in Radnor, Pennsylvania, with operations primarily conducted from offices in Houston, Texas and district operations facilities at various locations in Texas.[1]
In January 2016, Penn Virginia announced it had received notification from the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) that the NYSE had determined to commence proceedings to delist the Company's common stock and that the Company will begin trading on the OTC Pink.[2] In May 2016, Penn Virginia announced that it had filed voluntary petitions for relief under chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.[3]
History[edit]
Penn Virginia's history dates to the Virginia Coal & Iron Co. (VC&I) founded in 1882 by Philadelphia, Pennsylvania businessman John John Leisenring, Jr.,[4] whose grandfather had settled in the anthracite coal-rich Lehigh Valley in 1748. Leisenring's father ran a hotel in Mauch Chunk which was the headquarters of the Lehigh Coal and Navigation Company. Leisenring engaged numerous coal partnership but his biggest success was acquiring rights to a coal vein in on 67,000 acres (270 km2) southwest Virginia, close to the Kentucky and Tennessee borders that had once been partially owned by Confederate general John D. Imboden who had sold it to the Tinsalia Coal & Iron Co. which also bought a Bristol Coal and Iron Company Narrow Gauge Railway to bring it to market.[5] In 1902 the Stonega Coke & Coal Co. was formed to be the company's operational arm. In 1917 it acquired a major stake in Westmoreland Coal.[5]
In 1967 it changed its name to Penn Virginia Corporation. After going through a period of diversification it began acquiring and oil and gas companies in the 1980s. Penn Virginia was listed on the New York Stock Exchange in 1997. In 2001 it began decentralizing again spinning off its coal and pipeline operations into Penn Virginia Resources.[5] In 2006 it spun off its ownership of Penn Virginia Resources into a third publicly traded company Penn Virginia GP Holdings, L.P. and in 2010 completed divestiture of Penn Virginia GP Holdings, L.P.[6] In 2011, Penn Virginia Resources and Penn Virginia GP Holdings merged[7] and were re-branded as PVR Partners, L.P. before merging with Regency Energy Partners, L.P. in 2014 (which was subsequently acquired by Energy Transfer Partners in 2015).

Penn Virginia

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

Penn Virginia Corporation (OTC Pink: PVAHQ) is an independent oil and gas company engaged in the exploration, development and production of oil, NGLs and natural gas in various domestic onshore regions of the United States, with a primary focus in the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas. Penn Virginia headquarters and corporate office is located in Radnor, Pennsylvania, with operations primarily conducted from offices in Houston, Texas and district operations facilities at various locations in Texas.[1]
In January 2016, Penn Virginia announced it had received notification from the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) that the NYSE had determined to commence proceedings to delist the Company's common stock and that the Company will begin trading on the OTC Pink.[2] In May 2016, Penn Virginia announced that it had filed voluntary petitions for relief under chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.[3]
History[edit]
Penn Virginia's history dates to the Virginia Coal & Iron Co. (VC&I) founded in 1882 by Philadelphia, Pennsylvania businessman John John Leisenring, Jr.,[4] whose grandfather had settled in the anthracite coal-rich Lehigh Valley in 1748. Leisenring's father ran a hotel in Mauch Chunk which was the headquarters of the Lehigh Coal and Navigation Company. Leisenring engaged numerous coal partnership but his biggest success was acquiring rights to a coal vein in on 67,000 acres (270 km2) southwest Virginia, close to the Kentucky and Tennessee borders that had once been partially owned by Confederate general John D. Imboden who had sold it to the Tinsalia Coal & Iron Co. which also bought a Bristol Coal and Iron Company Narrow Gauge Railway to bring it to market.[5] In 1902 the Stonega Coke & Coal Co. was formed to be the company's operational arm. In 1917 it acquired a major stake in Westmoreland Coal.[5]
In 1967 it changed its name to Penn Virginia Corporation. After going through a period of diversification it began acquiring and oil and gas companies in the 1980s. Penn Virginia was listed on the New York Stock Exchange in 1997. In 2001 it began decentralizing again spinning off its coal and pipeline operations into Penn Virginia Resources.[5] In 2006 it spun off its ownership of Penn Virginia Resources into a third publicly traded company Penn Virginia GP Holdings, L.P. and in 2010 completed divestiture of Penn Virginia GP Holdings, L.P.[6] In 2011, Penn Virginia Resources and Penn Virginia GP Holdings merged[7] and were re-branded as PVR Partners, L.P. before merging with Regency Energy Partners, L.P. in 2014 (which was subsequently acquired by Energy Transfer Partners in 2015).

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
