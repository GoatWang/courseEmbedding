Capriccio – Bass Trombone & Fanfare€ 49,00

Description



Description
Capriciously, virtuoso, sparkling but nevertheless also restful; in short “Capriccio”.
This work exists of three succeeding parts, which form together one expressive, fluent musical story.  After a triumphant opening we get acquainted with the floating strength of the bass trombone as a head role player.  The other players, a six piece trombone ensemble, ensure extra thrust.  The virtuoso and technical approach of the soloist is noticed immediately.  The thrust is scaled back and the technical virtuosity makes place for the warm and romantic side of the bass trombone.  In a 3/4 meter we start dreaming with a sultry accompaniment.  Towards the end, we get in higher environments both melodically and dynamically.  The cadenza acts as a bridge to the last part.  The head role player returns sobered up to the roots.  The driving beginning topic now develops to a climax in which the soloist, in a spectacular manner, can give the best of himself.
Capriccio was written especially for Ben Van Dijk, bass trombonist of the Rotterdam Philharmonic Orchestra and was premiered in November 2005 at the Kentucky University Trombone Day.

                                    Bungalow 5 products are hand-crafted
by artisans who use natural materials and heritage techniques to deliver
incredible quality, authenticity and value.  These unique, beautiful
products have slight variations that are hallmarks of the material used and
craftspeople who create them.   Products may contain natural
variations like knots, graining or signs of an artist’s hand—which we believe
contribute to uniqueness and desirability.  Material characteristics or
maker’s marks are not defects.
                                

                                    Our items come from different producers in different countries, so
all colors may not match across lines: for example, the shade of white in one
collection may be creamier or brighter than the shade of white in another
collection. Additionally, we continuously improve the design, make, and
finish of our products. Therefore, items from different production runs may
vary slightly. To match a previously ordered piece, please check this website
to confirm dimensions have not changed. Next, call customer service to inquire
whether more pieces from the same lot are available.
                                

                                    Note that products are not food safe and decorative
containers do not hold water unless specifically described as such.  Most
large cabinets are drilled for wiring.  Currently, smaller, side cabinets
are not drilled.  Many chairs are simple to re-cover with your own COM
fabric.  Chairs with drop-in linen cushions require 1/3 yard.  Other
upholstery styles need to be estimated by your upholsterer.
                                

                                    We try very hard to supply tools that help
customers envision products as they will appear in your home.  However,
photographs are approximations and colors vary on different monitors and
printers.

Steven Mead models feature further refinements and result in a mouthpiece that excels in accuracy, articulation, flexibility, range and overall response.The Steven Mead Ultra X series is for players looking for a sound that has more brilliance than the standard Ultra Series or classic Steven Mead Series. The cup has been rounded to a more defined bowl shape which adds more brilliance to the tone and provides better upper register response. The rim has been altered to have a slightly sharper inner edge which increases articulation response and accuracy. +1 Tweet Share Share PinShares 0Additional informationWeight0.15 kgDimensions5 x 5 x 11 cmSizeSM2U, SM3MU, SM3U, SM3X, SM3XM, SM4MU, SM4U, SM4X, SM4XM, SM5MU, SM5U, SM6MU, SM6URelated products American Classic Trumpet Mouthpiece – Gold Plated Classic Tenor Horn Mouthpiece – Silver Plated Maurice Murphy Classic Trumpet Mouthpiece – Silver Plated Classic French Horn Mouthpiece – Gold PlatedFind a product  Search for:   Product Categories Select a categoryAccessories   Adaptors   Boosters & Tone Collars   Brushes   Cleaning Cloths   Mouthpiece pouches      Large brass      Small brass   Mute bags   Mute corks   Tuners   Valve OilMouthpieces   Baritone   Cornet   Euphonium   Flugelhorn   French Horn   Tenor Horn   Trombone   Trumpet   TubaMutes   Baritone   Euphonium   Flugelhorn   French Horn   Tenor Horn   Trombone      Alto Trombone      Bass Trombone      Tenor Trombone   Trumpet & Cornet      B♭ Trumpet & Cornet      D or E♭ Trumpet & Soprano Cornet      Piccolo Trumpet   Tuba  Latest Products   Wooden Straight Mute for BB♭ Tuba      Flexible ‘Snake’ Brush for French Horn      Mouthpiece Brush (large)      Mouthpiece Brush (small)      Steven Mead Baritone Mouthpiece - Gold Plated    Featured Artist Terry HsiehThe US trombonist bringing jazz and funk to China

Product Enquiry



The hood has its original caddy top and turned wood pillars with giltwood capitals. The square topped 37” long trunk door has a brass escutcheon and shaped edging, while the base sits on a small plinth.
The 8-day movement has 4 turned pillars, cut out plates, anchor escapement and strikes the hours via an inside countwheel. The 11” dial has brass corner spandrels, silvered chapter ring with full signature and original hands. A good looking country clock.

additional biographical information 
Steven Mead's extraordinary pioneering work with the euphonium has gained him worldwide fame as perhaps the foremost euphonium soloist in the world today . He is without doubt most travelled soloist in the history of the instrument. His hectic schedule sees him playing concerts with leading ensembles, orchestras, brass and wind bands the world over. In recent years he has diversified still further he has begun to play popular styles and jazz.  He is currently in great demand as a recitalist and clinician throughout the world of brass playing (please refer to the events schedule on this site). Not only has he been at the forefront of performance but is credited as a pioneer in euphonium education and repertoire. Steven has been a professional euphonium soloist for some 18 years after a successful career with some of the top British brass bands and as a full time music teacher. It is this wealth of experience that has helped to create a musician who communicates with his audiences.  Born in Bournemouth , February 26th , 1962, he grew up at this popular south coast seaside town, attending Bournemouth  School for Boys from 1973-1980. His earliest brass 'training' began at the age of 6, with the Boscombe Salvation Army Junior Band. The euphonium was too big at that stage (!) and over the next few years, gravitated lower, onto tenor horn, then baritone, then at the age of 11 to the euphonium. From the age of 8 to 12 he took singing lessons passing his Grade 8 singing exam with distinction, as a boy soprano!  His love for the euphonium seriously developed from the age of 13 and he was entering competitions at local music festivals from this time. Early teachers included Bernhard Roberts and Glyn Bosanko at the Boscombe SA. From the age of 17 Steven took lessons from brass band euphonium legend Trevor Groom, travelling by train from Bournemouth to Kettering regularly, a round trip of 7 hours on Saturdays. From Bournemouth he moved to the West Country to begin his studies at Bristol University. Whilst at Bristol he came into contact with the composer Derek Bourgeois who encouraged him greatly to persevere while many others gave him advice that to become a professional player he would have to move to the trombone. Although Steven was playing a lot of trombone at the time, the Bristol years clarified that the euphonium was the instrument for his future career whatever that would be. He graduated with a BA Honours degree in Music and moved 12 miles south to the Newton Park College, Bath where he gained a Post Graduate Certificate in Education, qualifying him to teach at secondary school level, (high school).  His brass playing whilst at Bristol was with the University Symphony Orchestra (1st trombone) and with the Bristol Easton Salvation Army Band, then later, the Sun Life Stanshawe Band, his first 'contesting' band. As he completed his studies at Bath he received an invitation from Howard Snell , the musical director of the Desford Colliery Band, to join the band with immediate effect. As luck would have it a teaching job at the DeFerrers High School in Burton on Trent, in the Midlands, quite close to the band room, came vacant and Steven won the job and joined the band.  Television success undoubtedly helped his early career. On two occasions he won the solo prize in the BBC Best of Brass Competition (1983 with Sun Life and 85 with Desford). He also was awarded the Euphonium Player of the Year Award 1986 and 1993. The Desford years 1983-1989 saw the band playing at its very best, achieving many awards, including the European Championship, the Granada Band of the Year, BBC Best of Brass and the hat trick of victories at the National Brass Band Championships at the Royal Albert Hall. London (1987-89).  He enjoyed the high school teaching too with several outstanding music students going on to superb professional careers in music, He was also the conductor of the school brass band, string orchestra and directed 3 of the school shows.  By 1989 Steven had been invited to teach euphonium at the Royal Academy of Music, London, the Birmingham Conservatoire, and the Royal Northern College of Music in Manchester. The diary was getting very full and reluctantly the high school teaching had to be phased out over the next 3 years. The professional solo engagements also were already at around 40 per year, raising to its current level of about 75.  It is a spirit of innovation which has driven his career, from his early success with some of the leading brass bands in the UK, to his founding of the British Tuba Quartet to the countless premieres and commissions of new music. He premiered the Euphonium Concerto by Martin Ellerby in Switzerland with the Brassband Berner Oberland, and the Euphonium Concerto by Philip Sparke with the Breeze Brass Band in Osaka, Japan.  Innovative too is his work with the unique Brass Band of Battle Creek (USA), his involvement with the 6 National Tuba Euphonium Festivals (1994-2000) in the UK, and his setting up of specialist euphonium 'schools' in the Benelux countries and Japan. His innovation has extended to mouthpiece and instrument design, including the new Besson (www.besson.com) Prestige Euphonium, with many Steven Mead products now in demand the world over.  Now his lives with his new wife, euphonium star Misa Mead (Akahoshi), in the village of Fenny Drayton, near Nuneaton and concentrates most of his energies to his extraordinary solo career, the Royal Northern College of Music, Denis Wick Products, Bocchino Music and EuphoniumStore.net and of course Besson.  Whether as a campaigner for the instrument or on the concert hall stage Steven is rarely out of the spotlight, each year he continues to take the euphonium to new audiences including concerts with the Minneapolis Pops Orchestra, the Capella Cracoviensis (Poland), London Brass, the Dutch Marine Band and the US Army Band, Trombonisti Italiani, the Japan Chamber Orchestra, Sound INN Brass (Austria) and the Classic Quintet (Italy), The Garde Republicaine Band (France).  His CD company Bocchino Music is already very well known for its award winning CDs, including Euphonium Magic Volumes 1,2 and 3, Euphonium Virtuoso, Locomotion, Audacious (double CD), 20 Supreme Years, Virtuoso Music for Brass, Beautiful Sounds, Fandango, Rococo Variations, Diamonds and the most recent release, Pearls.
