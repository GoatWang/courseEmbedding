What Is Variable Life Insurance?
Variable life insurance from Northwestern Mutual offers life insurance with the potential for greater cash value and death benefit growth than other types of permanent life insurance. Because you determine where your policy’s cash value is invested you can take on more risk in exchange for greater potential growth.
Here’s How Variable Life Insurance Works:
Variable life insurance is uniquely flexible. With it, you can:

Decide how you want the cash value that you build in your policy to be invested. You can choose from a variety of investment options across different asset classes, offering the potential for growth over time. These investment options may be subject to market fluctuations and may lose value.
Select and change your death benefit option and amount, based on your policy's provisions, to meet your changing needs.
Choose to make higher or lower premium payments within certain limits. Of course, your policy value will increase or decrease accordingly.
Utilize the cash value to meet financial goals.1
Transfer funds among your investment options, enabling you to adjust your strategy as your needs change during your life. Read the Prospectus carefully before you invest or send money.

Variable life Insurance may be a good choice if you understand the risks associated with investing, have a long-term time horizon and are willing to continue paying adequate premiums over time.

										Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company is one of the biggest scammers out there today. I was a student attending the University of Dubuque, when I started looking for an internship. Northwestern Mutual was supposedly a "highly rated" company that had a "highly rated" internship program. My interview consisted of interigating me on every person I knew and they basically wanted me to come in and set up appointments with my friends and family so they could harrass them to buy more insurance. I then did further research after my interview, and talked to a couple classmates who had participated in their internship program  (by the way, was amazing how many people this company interviewed with. EVERYBODY!) Every, and I mean every, person I talked to said their "trainer" went in and pushed their friends and family and did hard sales with their horrible insurance programs. I was even more shocked when I found out their savings programs inside their insurance policies were even a bigger scam then their so called internship program. Did you know that when their clients die, Northwestern Mutual KEEPS THEIR SAVINGS ACCOUNT! Tell me how a savings account at all benefits a client that when they die, their family loses it! RIP OFF! RIP OFF! RIP OFF! They had no interest in training me and simply wanted to use my name when they called individuals that I knew to sell them garbage at that. I advise you, stay as far away from this company as you can.									    This report was posted on Ripoff Report on 10/12/2009 09:33 AM and is a permanent record located here:

										 0Author 16Consumer 0Employee/Owner    Updates & Rebuttals     #1 Consumer Comment  Northwest Mutual Paid Out AUTHOR: Micki -  (USA) SUBMITTED: Friday, April 14, 2017 POSTED: Friday, April 14, 2017   When my husband was diagnosed with cancer and we knew he was terminal, one of the things on his bucket list was to take the grandkids to Disney World.  We had not met them before and this would have been the first time we saw them because my son had moved to Colorado from Florida.  We didn't have the funds for this type of trip, so I cashed in my life insurance policy for what it was worth: $10,000. They did not ask me a thousand questions, the rep said it was my money to with what I wanted.  We got my son's family to Disney and were on our way from Key West to Orlando to meet them and have a great vacation/family reunion.  My husband didn't make it.  Half way up, he went into crisis and was gone 8 days later.  My husband passed away from kidney cancer caused by cigarette smoking.  I was bedside when he passed and was a complete absolute mess.  When I called NWM to report his passing, the live person I spoke with, not a computer, was nothing but compassionate, patient and knowledgable.  They took their time with me and helped me file the final claim.  I continue to have a ploicy for my mother, and I took out a new policy on myself. I know when the time comes, this company will not play games with our benificiaries.      Respond to this report!  What's this?  Are you an owner, employee or ex-employee with either negative or positive information about the company or individual, or can you provide "insider information" on this company?       #2 UPDATE EX-employee responds  Just To set some Myths aside AUTHOR: JustTryingToHelp -  () SUBMITTED: Thursday, July 24, 2014 POSTED: Thursday, July 24, 2014    I had to jump in because of so many misinterprutations.  I have worked in financial for years, and years, and years.  Interned with NWM and they do a great job of informing their employees on all the benefits of using their products and how great they are.  The problem is they never talk about the other options that are out there and what is best for the client.  Right away they teach you that a whole life policy is the best thing ever and that they have the best one.  Half true.  I think they do have one of the best out there but they only make sense for a small chunk of people.  Problem is they recommend it to everyone!  The interest is not fixed and is based off of the performance of the company.  In that aspect all your doing in a while life policy is buying NWM stock and collecting the everchanging dividend without growth of the asset itself.  Then you take insurance fees out, which they will never discuss but are necessary.  So at the end of the day take out maybe .5% if your young and 2% if your old from your cash value every year so your really earning some fraction of that dividend.  Now take your "Loan" out from the cash and pay an interest rate on the loan taken from the remaining cash value.  Again depleting your savings. From what I have seen you would have been better off buying a tax free bond, or bond fund, or just investing regularly if the goal is to save money.  Use Insurance companies for insurance, banks for banking, accountants for taxes, and investment firms for investments.  Use common sense.  Would you let an oncologist do neurosurgery, or your kidney specialist repair your spine?  No.     Respond to this report!  What's this?  Are you an owner, employee or ex-employee with either negative or positive information about the company or individual, or can you provide "insider information" on this company?       #3 General Comment  Grow-up AUTHOR: Timmy -  () SUBMITTED: Friday, February 14, 2014 POSTED: Friday, February 14, 2014   Are you serious? You know NOTHING about insurance so you're throwing Northwestern under the bus. In ALL sales situations, it's about who do you know? Sale at an insurance company and this one is Northwestern. Start with family and friends, see if there is a need, if none, move onto the next one. YOU failed at Northwestern, many people do. You're not cut-out for sales. Take a salaried postion. Earn $50,000/yr and struggle to pay your bills for the rest of your life. Or grow up and learn how to sell something     Respond to this report!  What's this?  Are you an owner, employee or ex-employee with either negative or positive information about the company or individual, or can you provide "insider information" on this company?       #4 UPDATE EX-employee responds  I was in the Intern program, too. It was great. AUTHOR: Tim S -  () SUBMITTED: Saturday, January 25, 2014 POSTED: Saturday, January 25, 2014   I read this report simply because in the late 80's I was in NML's college agent program. The ignorance of this claim against NML was so vast as to be exhausting. It is a Saturday night and I would much rather be relaxing. Instead, there is this monumentally sad attempt to harm a good company. Doing a little reading between the lines here, I can make a few guesses. One, I doubt you listened to the training. If you did, you did not understand it nor care for the discipline involved in being a saver or an agent. Two, you probably found it difficult to make money. Even if the commissions are what they were then you probably did not make money. The tone of the complaint makes it hard for me to imagine that you had the ear of too many people on matters as important as how to save money long term, provide needed death benefits, or even why savings and investments are completely different animals. I have not worked for Northwestern Mutual for decades but the business lessons and experiences I gained as an intern are invaluable to me even today at this late date. I know of five companies I would trust to put my permanent life insurance needs and Northwestern Mutual and its practices are designed to protect policy holders within the paramenters of providing maximum benefits with maximum dividend performance. That is a complex set of responsibilities. Northwest Mutual has my continued respect as do their training programs that I went through. Tim S.    Respond to this report!  What's this?

One $120K "investment" at NWM turned out to be a money-market account that was "earning" minus-$500 per year, after all of the fees were deducted.  When I challenged the wisdom of this account, I was told that, as retirees, we needed to have conservative investments, especially in trying financial times.  After insisting that the money-market account be closed, we were told that NWM would, out of the goodness of their heart, make a one-time exception to their rules and, at my request, reinvest the funds in a more risky account (something our NWM advisor told us was almost unheard of).  Since the money was going from one NWM account into another, I assumed the change would be free or that any charges would be nominal.  Our next statement, however, showed a "withdrawal charge" of more than $5000.  We were neither informed orally nor in writing that such a charge would occur.  I'm sure a withdrawal charge is stated somewhere in the mountains of fine print we received from the company, but I haven't found it yet.  My wife and I don't claim to be well prepared to understand the complexities of modern financial products.  However, we do expect that our money will be skillfully invested by the professionals of a major financial institution.  Northwest Mutual claims to be a Financial Services and Wealth Management company (it's on their letterhead).  I assumed we could trust them to look out for our interests while making a fair return on the money they invest.  But this example (and others that are too complex to explain here) suggest otherwise.  If you're in the same boat, be sure you ask lots of questions and read everything before signing on the dotted line.  I'm very serious about that--don't sign anything until you fully understand it and have asked lots of questions.  If you don't understand it, then you should find another company to handle your money.

There are many empassioned responses defending the honesty and sanctity of whole term life policies, and how great Northwest Mutual is, well to this, I say rubbish. Here is why. In some aspects, whole term life insurance may be a reasonable investment, IF you truly understand what you are getting into, and realized when your net cash value will break even, etc. However, certain representatives, eg christopher hahn( a bloated clown who was voted best financial rep for 2007, such jilted self serving awards, made by vultures for vultures) for instance, prey upon the financially ignorant , and use very aggressive , even bullshit scare tactics to get their victim to sign up. So in essence they are financial predators, case closed. Believe me , this is only my experience some 10 yrs ago, and actually, when I woke up, was lucky enough to cancel the policy at not such a significant loss. I could go on and on about unscrupulous procedural techniques, eg: isolating the victim, not talking to anyone else but you , so as to avoid more experienced questions, saying that a decision had to be made within 1 day as this was a "special offer", etc, etc....But ultimately, I would just tell the newbies out there (eg, just out of academia, greener than green), when it comes to whole life: be aware how much they are asking you to invest, really look at the ridiculous premiums paid out, compared to term insurance, realize opportunity cost of this vs immediate tax advantages of a 401k, and lastly realize how long they will have you put money into a hole, hoping some day it will pay out, with actually, only guaranteeing not even a 4% return , if that , perhaps just your principal, minus fees. Essentially be prepared that this is a long term investment, eg, dont expect to even break even until 12 years or more. If you do the math for a 25yr + policy, you will be horrified at the money you put into it, vs what you get out. Lastly, while again, in less aggressive ways, this could make sense in terms of a small policy, however, I KNOW FOR A FACT that these s**t suckers, aggressively target individuals who are just out of shool, or new to the area, with little or no experience. Lastly however, it is upto you to be strong, because ultimately, there is nobody to truly blame but yourself for being talked into something without complete understanding. 10+ years later, I am so much better off for it, that in certain regards, I should thank assholes like this for burning me, because my knowledge, savy and wisdom took off exponentially, and now I can retire if I wanted to. Burn me once, great, it is how you dust yourself off and learn from mistakes, and become all the better. Good luck people,  nobody and everybody who just tries to make their way    Respond to this report!  What's this?

														I have about 6 years of experience in the insurance/securities industry, and I truly feel sorry for anyone who does business with Northwest Mutual. Their products are horribly priced and generally outdated (6% dividends sounds great until you realize you're paying literally 2-3x as much in premium as you would be in a modern IUL), plus their sales force are a bunch of sharks and I've had multiple clients tell me about being offered rebates from NW agents if they sign up (meaning the agents offered to pay the premiums of the policy for 1-3 months, which is unethical and illegal). 
Their financial ratings are sound, largely because they are robbing you on the premiums they charge. Inevitably, this will provoke NW agents to start posting responses about the dividend payouts, but the bottom line is when you do the math, their whole life policies are SCREWING YOU. You can get the same tax-deferred growth and even more competitive returns through AXA Equitable's VUL or National Life group or North American's IUL products for 60-75% of the premium contribution. Plus all of the above named companies offer Long Term Care provisions that allow clients to access death benefits in a life policy for LTC purposes. 
Trust me, if a NW Mutual agent offers to "buy you lunch so he can introduce you to what he does," politely decline. Their products are a joke and they love to dangle the dividends in front of you but they're only telling a very small part of the whole story, which is that they'll rob you in the process and sell you an outdated product (Northwest mutual whole life is like buying a Nokia brick cell phone in 2013.)

														Savings accounts?  Are you talking about whole life insurance cash value?  Normally there's a selection in the application process whereby the client can select whether or not he/she wants the death benefit plus the cash value for an extra cost in premium.  The insurance company figures that you want the greater of the death benefit or the cash value.  The death benefit is usually greater.  Instead of paying the insurance company, why not buy term and some perm for the insurance need.  Term, remember, pays a claim only 3% of all policies in force.  Therefore, the perm is useful to pay expenses, as it's permanent and will be there when your client dies. 													   Respond to this report!

														I'm an advertising sales professional & truly appreciate everything that Northwestern Mutual has done for me with respect to planning my retirement. It's been incredibly difficult to weed through all of the options that are out there when it comes to retirement. My Northwestern rep started out in the same internship program you've mentioned in your report, but had a very different experience. I'm not sure what sort of a career you plan to go into, but if you intend to go into any type of selling job, you'll need to know how to work your friends & family to your advantage. I feel that my whole life policy from Northwestern is a great "fallback investment", in addition to my 401k, Roth IRA (Which I can no longer contribute to), Social Security, and cash savings. I understand that without an extensive knowledge of finances, it would be difficult for an intern to see the value of a long-term, guaranteed investment such as a whole life insurance policy. There are several advantages to it. 1) A whole life policy grows at a guaranteed 6% interest rate. Over the term of my policy, I will pay in roughly $48,000. However, at my paid-up date, it will be worth $100k 2) I can withdraw against a whole life policy when I'm older, without paying income tax. That makes it better than a savings account, and, generally speaking, better than a 401k (tax-free when you contribute, but taxed at normal rates upon withdrawal), but slightly worse than a Roth IRA, which is taxed pre-contribution, but tax-free at withdrawal. The downside to a Roth IRA is that you can only contribute up to $5k annually, until you earn a salary of 107k or greater. Once you earn that large of a salary, your contributions are limited even further, and ultimately eliminated at an income of $122k, leaving your only true, tax-free (at distribution) retirement option to be a whole life insurance policy. Is your post suggesting that Northwestern doesn't deserve to earn a profit for helping millions of American's retire comfortably? They're currently one of the highest rated financial services firms in the country, and they do it all without public relations & branding advertising (You've surely heard of companies like Charles Schwab, TD Ameritrade, Bank of America/Merrill Lynch, Scottrade, etrade, ING Direct, etc).  The bottom line is this: You should really be investing in nearly every type of retirement investment you possibly can. You'll almost always be better off. Just imagine if the millions of folks who were deeply invested in their company's 401k had been a bit more diversified in 2008 when their retirement plans lost 30% of their value in the stock market crash! If they had even 25-30% of their investments secured in whole life insurance policies, they wouldn't have been hurt nearly as badly. A small (very small) portion of the job crunch has also been caused by the lack of retirement that's happening in the workplace as a result of these losses. See this report, from before the recession hit, which shows that fewer than half of all Americans expect to be able to retire comfortably - this was 6 months before the market crashed: (((ROR REDACTED))) and this from more recently (November 2010) which points out that Employers will have a tough time facilitating the promotion of younger employees who want to get ahead: http://jobs.aol.com/articles/2010/11/02/fewer-americans-planning-to-retire/ 
No, I do not work for Northwestern Mutual, nor do I work in the insurance industry, or financial services industry. But I will retire very comfortably, while you (the author of this "ripoff" report), will most likely be working until you die.

If you don't think NWM whole life polices are terrific investments, then it would appear to me that you don't fully understand life insurance.

														I have owned four Northwestern Mutual life insurance policies for many years and my experience with the company has been entirely positive. When I bought these insurance policies I did extensive research and ran the numbers. This company, along with New York Life and Mass Mutual, came out on top. They pay great dividends and have been doing so for a very long time. They've been in business for over 150 years. They will be paying out $4.9 billion in dividends next year, the second highest amount in company history and more than the next two highest paying companies combined. They are one of only a handful companies with a A++ rating from A.M. Best. Does that sound like a "rip off" company selling a "garbage product"? I have had dealings with two of their reps and they have never pushed me to buy anything or given me a "hard sell." The original report's comments about the "savings program" being a "scam" are simply ridiculous and show a basic lack of understanding about how life insurance works.

														I have been in the insurance business for over 22 years. From running my own company and to selling to a larger corporation. Been on the independent side, general agent side and now part of NML. The first statement is this company in every regards puts the client first. You will find out they have their policy holders every year do their own audit of the company and their practices. Name another company allowing this today. To my knowledge their is no top 1000 company doing it. Next take their conservative stance to underwriting and you will see in their large dividend pay outs to policy holders a large portion comes from great underwriting. Now as a representative this can be frustrating when you have a president or key employee you want to insure and the company will not insure them due to medical issues. But it is in the policy holders best interest to only take risk in their best interest.  The policy holder/owners of the company do come first. Yes owners, a mutual company is owned by the policy holders. They do not have to show the big profits to share holders but only to the owners/policy holders. The company will also not tolerate representatives that due not follow their strict guide lines of professional representation. I have seen them fire a large producer for not following the rules as defined by them. Their are no exceptions to these rules. In other companies I have seen the old saying of production hides the sins. Not here if you do not keep records of your sales in a compliant manner and do what is best for the client, you will be looking for a job.    As a old time representative it was hard for me to do all their required education and record keeping but now after a short time it has paid off. If a client questions something I can go into our system and show them my dictations of the meeting and most of the time back it up with letters or emails explaining what we did an why. So you can teach an old dog new trick.     Our system is set up like a doctors would operate. When we see a client we find their needs and desires for their future and their families goals & dreams. We explore the what if's that are so hard for most people to talk about unless someone like myself comes to them as an advocate for their kids or spouse. In a role as the advocate we are the voice for the ones with out one. We are the ones that help a person provide for their family for the unexpected things in life. No one expects to die early or become disabled. When it does happen, they are always blessed when they did the responsible thing and took care of their family for those issues. Yes I said responsible, because it is our job to provide for our family in those times of need. When we have a child and do not take out disability or life insurance on our life it is a disservice as a parent. Almost child abuse at times. Would you want your child in foster care because you did not have life insurance when you and your spouse died before your time. I know with my family and friends it would be hard to see their family suffer because I did not do my job and ask the hard questions. You insure your house? So why would you not insure your families most important asset. YOU    In closing I will say that if you do not care for your family and friends then stay the path of not doing the responsible thing and sharing the need of life insurance and disability insurance with them. This is a selfless act to provide for your families needs at a premature death or disability. In looking at companies you will not find a better company, financially or ethically. This is coming from a guy that has been around for many years in this business. Also from my personal life and seeing it pay off when a family member died a early death. The money was their for the funeral and other cost needed, It was there because I asked the hard question and showed the need and provided the solution. These risk based products are a need for almost every individual but like other things in this country today we do not always do the responsible things. To many people live for today and let others worry when their dead. I have never had a widow say would you give me my savings part of the death benefits and you can keep the balance. Some people may pay a few hundred dollars in the so called savings part of their life insurance contract but receive millions back in the death benefit portion. In some cases the savings part is completed with the disability waiver added to the policy. So my question to you is, are you going to be responsible and take care of your family and purchase the needed death and disability benefits? Or will you allow the state or government to provide for your family if you die or become a disabled. If something happens to my family and friends I do not want to tell their children I did not do my job. No I want to be able to say your parents loved you enough to do the right thing an protect you even if they were not here to do so them selves.    If you need information on companies strength review the rating agencies of insurance companies. If you need to make the correct financial decisions find a reputable insurance professional. You can do back ground checks with most department of insurances and FINRA for securities checks. Do your home work and work with a professional. You can always find the closest NML office and talk to them. Thanks for this chance to tell another side of the story.

														First and foremost, Northwestern Mutual does interview a lot of candidates, especially for their internship program.  I was part of that process when I started as an intern in January 2009.  Let's look at this point first.  Northwestern has the reputation as the "Quiet Company," meaning that they don't spend a lot of their money on advertising in mass media.  While this is changing now, it is a great point for policy holders because the company is not spending its reserve funds on needless advertising.  With that point in mind, how many college students do you think have heard of Northwestern Mutual by actively seeking out insurance and investment advice or by seeing their commercials on t.v.?  I'll go out on a limb and say not a whole lot. So, for Northwestern to bring new blood into the company, they have to actively recruit competent talent.  Where to find these individuals with work ethic, smarts, and a drive to succeed? That's right, on college campuses.  So yes, they have to go out, see people, and find those with a passion to serve others.Number two, the "hard sale" of insurance products.  The company culture of Northwestern is not to "sell" anyone.  It is to identify a need and make recommendations for that need.  During the process of helping individuals build financial security, there are many aspects a financial representative needs to cover.  These areas include: saving, investing, debt reduction, and protecting a family with insurance products.  Out of these areas, which do you think a college student could be competent enough to explain, investment products or insurance coverage?  In my opinion it is far easier to learn the basics of insurance than investment strategies, risks, and returns for savvy investors.  Not to mention that it would take much to long, and no student would even try, to obtain securities licenses for an internship.  So, we are left with interns getting a license for life insurance which is still part of a comprehensive financial plan and much easier to put into place than investments.The third point of Northwestern keeping the cash value of a policy holder that dies is easy to rebut.  Yes, they keep the cash value.  That's right, I said that they do indeed keep the cash value.  But, that's because the surviving family receives the death benefit.  So, now it's time for an example.  Say John bought a $100,000 whole life (permanent) insurance policy 30 years ago.  Hypothetically the cash in the policy is $20,000 and the face value (death benefit) has gone up to $200,000. (Anyone with working knowledge of permanent insurance knows that cash value increases as well as the death benefit, barring any tweeks made by the policy owner that would keep these at a level amount).  John has lived a long life and passes, leaving the $200,000 death benefit to his family.  Northwestern keeps the $20,000 in cash value and premiums paid in.  If you could explain how getting 200k is better than getting the cash of 20k is better please go ahead.  Now, some would say, "Why don't they get both?"  I would say to that, how in the world would a company stay in business if it paid the death claim and all cash in the policy.  There would be no way to sustain the company if the only payment they ever got was premium.  Last, no one who uses the policy exclusively for the death benefit is concerned with the 'savings' aspect.  Younger people will like the savings aspect and can use the cash throughout their lifetime and should do so based on their specific goals.  If the 'savings' is a RIP OFF, please show me another asset that draws a 6.15% return (current Northwestern dividend), on a tax deferred basis, with no early withdrawal penalty.  IT CAN'T BE FOUND.  But to get interesting let's try.  Savings account - hahahaha, if you're lucky a 1% return - congratulations you lost out to inflation.  CD's - again 1-1.5% return, TAXED - still losing to inflation.  Bond portfolio - In this day in age still at 5-7% with junk bonds, taxed so that the real return is below 5%, and if it is inside IRAs there are early withdrawal penalties.  IRAs and 401k - great place for LONG TERM saving - they will get you the best returns with the right asset allocation, but if you want that money before you are 60 you will pay taxes and penalties.  So, you tell me what asset gives you great return, defers taxes (and has many options to use the money tax free), and is accessible to you at any time? You got it...Life Insurance through Northwestern Mutual.Now as far as them contacting family and friends, who else would you know to contact and have such an important conversation with?  Yes, that's right, you would have rather called on executives, partners in law firms, engineers, etc. because they would have certainly taken a college student seriously.  You have to start in your natural market, let them see the value you bring, and then be referred out to other individuals.  There shouldn't be a problem talking with your family and in fact those should be the most important conversations you have.  Consider your family not having the right amount of life coverage, or none at all.  Most likely a premature death would devastate the family; be it a parent, child, or primary wage earner.  I can say from experience that 80-90% of the people I have talked with don't have adequate coverage based on what they would want to have covered if they passed prematurely.  If you didn't talk with them about life insurance, no one probably ever would; which would be a sad tragedy.  Talk with a few financial reps, financial advisors, or even friends and family members and see if you can't come up with some stories of families or individuals devastated by a lack of life coverage.  It is just as important, if not more, than the investing part.  If you can come up with someone who has never heard of or known a person affected by losing a loved one too soon then you can bash life insurance all you like.  But I will venture that you can't find someone like that.In closing, life insurance is vital, no matter who you get it through.  But, if you are going to purchase something so important, why not go through the best company?  By best I am pointing to Northwestern Mutual, who has the strongest financial ratings across the board with a positive future outlook.  They are in fact the only insurance company with those ratings and one of only a handful of any type of company in the world with those ratings.  So it makes sense why they are so beloved even when there is misunderstood slander put out by people on sites like these.  For those that would like to rebut the ratings, feel free to look at the four large ratings firms and see where Northwestern ranks.  New York Life will claim the strongest ratings also, but they have a negative outlook, which indicates they will soon be downgraded; leaving Northwestern alone at the top.

Life insurance: Why it matters and how to shop for it


You work hard to provide a good life for your family, and you'd do anything to protect them. But what would happen to them financially if you died tomorrow?
If the answer troubles you, then you need life insurance. Life insurance provides a safety net tomorrow for the loved ones who depend on you today.
But where should you start? There are two main types of coverage are available: term life and permanent life insurance. The first step is to decide which of these suits you best.
Term vs. permanent life insurance
Term life insurance covers you for a certain period, such as 10, 15 or 20 years. Buyers typically choose a policy that covers them until their mortgages and other debts are paid off, or the kids have graduated from college and are living independently.
Term life is fairly straightforward, compared to permanent life, and it's less expensive than a permanent life policy. The average cost of a 20-year, $250,000 term life policy for a healthy 30-year-old is about $160 a year, roughly the cost of one latte per week, according to LIMRA and the LIFE Foundation.
A term life policy pays out if you die during the term while the coverage is in effect. Then your beneficiary collects the proceeds, called the "death benefit." You can't cash in the policy while you're still alive. With term life you risk buying something that your family might never end up using, but in return you gain the peace of mind of knowing they'd be OK if you died unexpectedly.
Permanent life insurance, such as whole life or universal life, covers you for the rest of your life. The policy pays the death benefit to your beneficiary whether you die tomorrow or in 50 years.
Permanent life insurance also includes an investment component, known as "cash value." The cash value of the policy starts off small and then gradually grows tax-free. If you hold onto the policy for many years, the cash account becomes a nest egg. You can borrow from the cash value -- the policy stays in effect as long as you repay the money, plus interest -- or surrender the policy for the cash.
Because of its cash value and lifelong coverage, permanent life insurance is pricier and more complex than term life. Some policies even provide long-term care benefits.
Which type of life insurance should you buy?
Choose term life insurance if you:

Need coverage only until a certain age (say, the age when your youngest child graduates college).
Have no dependents who will need financial help for the rest of their lives.
Don't own a family business or have a large estate to protect.
Want the most affordable type of coverage available.

Choose permanent life insurance if you:

Want to provide for lifelong dependents, such as a child with special needs.
Need to protect a large estate or family business from estate taxes.
Want to leave a legacy.
Want to provide loved ones with money for your final expenses, such as medical bills and funeral costs, no matter when you die.

How much life insurance should you buy?
Beware of easy formulas, such as multiplying your annual income by a certain number. Instead, do a thorough needs analysis. Determine how much your family would need to pay your final expenses, such as funeral costs, and how much your loved ones would need over the long haul to maintain their quality of life. Consider big expenses, such as paying off the mortgage and other debts, and funding your children's college educations.
Both parents should be insured -- not just the primary breadwinner. To determine the amount of insurance for a stay-at-home parent, consider how much it would cost to replace the services that parent provides, such as day care and other household tasks.
Don't assume your group life insurance through work will provide all the coverage you need. Most group life policies are small, and the coverage ends when your job ends. Roughly four in 10 insured married people depend solely on group life policies, according to LIMRA.
Life insurance rates
Life insurance premiums vary according to the type of policy, amount of coverage and the insurer, as well as your age and health.
That's why it's important to buy coverage sooner rather than later. The longer you wait, the higher the premiums will be and the greater the risk that you could develop a health condition that will disqualify you from coverage. Besides comparing policies, evaluate insurance companies. Insure.com's Best Life Insurance Companies Tool can help you sort through leading companies based on their customers’ reviews.
Unsure about the cost of life insurance? Get a no-obligation quote
If you’re interested in learning how much life insurance will cost for you, a sensible first step is to request some quotes. This will give you a sense of how much life insurance you can afford, and which companies are likely to be your best bets for coverage.
Insure.com compiles data from numerous leading life insurance companies to help you compare quotes easily and quickly. You can start comparing quotes by filling in your information at the top of this page.  
When it comes to securing life insurance, the first steps can be among the hardest. But if you take them today, you’ll be that much closer to knowing that your loved ones will be supported in the event of your death.
And there’s really no substitute for that knowledge.

Methodology
Insure.com commissioned Op4G to survey more than 3,700 insurance customers nationwide in June 2016. The survey collected customer ratings for 20 leading companies in the auto category and 15 leading companies in each of the home, health and life categories. Only current customers of the insurers on our lists were surveyed, and the survey was not open to the general public on the Insure.com website.
Auto, home and health insurers were ranked according to a weighted 5-point measurement of the following factors: customer service, claims processing, value for price, would recommend and would renew. Life insurers were rated on a weighted 5-point measurement on customer service, value for price, and would recommend. Weighted measurements were derived from surveyed policyholders’ rank of prioritization of these factors.
The A.M. Best ratings, discounts and coverage options noted in the survey do not affect the scores, but are provided as a supplementary resource.
Insure.com makes these ratings freely available via this site. The views and opinions expressed by users do not reflect the views and opinions of Insure.com. Insure.com expressly disclaims any and all liability in connection with the ratings.

Northwestern Mutual ranked No. 1 out of 18 large companies scored by NerdWallet. NerdWallet’s life insurance company rankings combine its A.M. Best rating, consumer complaints and J.D. Power’s customer satisfaction score.
» MORE: The best life insurance companies


A.M. Best financial strength rating: A++ (superior)
Northwestern Mutual’s financial strength is “superior,” according to ratings agency A.M. Best.
Financial strength is important because it indicates how well an insurer can pay claims. It’s especially important when choosing a life insurance company, because claims might not be made until many decades after a policy is purchased.


Consumer complaints: Better than the median
Northwestern Mutual drew far fewer than the median number of complaints to state regulators in 2015 for a company of its size, according to the latest data from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.
The association assigns a complaint ratio score to insurance companies, based on the number of complaints to state insurance commissioners, adjusted for market share. The median score is 1. A score less than 1 means fewer complaints. Northwestern Mutual’s score for individual life insurance in 2015 was .04.


J.D. Power ratings: Better than most
Northwestern Mutual ranks among the best life insurance companies for customer service, according to research firm J.D. Power’s 2016 U.S. Life Insurance Study. Northwestern Mutual scored four out of five stars across all five categories — overall satisfaction, annual statement and billing, price, policy offerings and interaction. The company had the third-highest score overall among 21 of the largest U.S. life insurers, behind Nationwide and State Farm.

Special insurance options
Combo term and permanent life insurance: Northwestern Mutual offers a product called CompLife, which provides a base of permanent life insurance with optional term life on top of it. Policyholders can choose the amounts of term and permanent life coverage. For example, the portion of permanent coverage within the policy can be increased by paying a higher premium. If the policyholder receives dividends from Northwestern Mutual, those can be used to pay for a higher portion of permanent coverage.
Long-term care money from whole life insurance: On its whole life insurance policies, Northwestern Mutual offers an “accelerated care benefit” option, which lets the policyholder access the death benefit to pay for long-term care. The policy’s death benefit and cash value are reduced proportionately according to how much is used for long-term care.
Disability insurance for part-timers and stay-at-home spouses: Northwestern Mutual offers disability insurance policies designed for part-time workers and stay-at-home spouses. The coverage for part-time employees is geared to people who work between 15 and 29 hours. The coverage can expand if their jobs become full-time. The policies for stay-at-home spouses are geared to people who provide care for children or elderly or disabled family members.

PROSPECTUS    Variable CompLife®    Variable Whole Life Policy  Minimum Guaranteed Death Benefit with
Additional Protection    
Summary of Benefits and Risks    The following
summary identifies some of the benefits and risks of the Policy. It omits important information which is included elsewhere in this prospectus, in the attached mutual fund prospectuses, and in the terms of the Policy.    
Benefits of the Policy    
Death Benefit The primary benefit of your Policy is the life insurance protection that it provides. The Policy combines a Minimum Guaranteed Death Benefit with Additional Protection. We guarantee the Minimum
Guaranteed Death Benefit for the lifetime of the insured so long as premiums are paid when due and no Policy debt is outstanding. We guarantee the Additional Protection for a period of years defined in the Policy. Your Policy may also include
variable paid-up additional insurance. Any Excess Amount or any adjustment required for certain tax purposes may also increase your death benefit. (See Death Benefit.)    
Access to Your Values You may surrender your Policy for the Cash Value at any time during the lifetime of the insured. We will permit partial surrenders so long as the Policy that remains meets our regular size
requirements. You may make a withdrawal from the Policy if the Excess Amount is sufficient. You may borrow up to 90% of your Policys Cash Value using the Policy as security. (See Loans and Withdrawals.)    
Flexibility You may select the proportions of Minimum Guaranteed Death Benefit and Additional Protection, subject to our minimum requirements for the Minimum Guaranteed Death Benefit. You may increase the
scheduled premium, or pay optional unscheduled additional premiums, at any time before the Policy anniversary nearest to the insureds 85th birthday, subject to our insurability requirements and issue limits. You may reduce or suspend payment
of premiums within the limits provided in the Policy. You may direct the allocation of your premiums and apportion the Account assets supporting your Policy among the 24 divisions of the Account, using as many as 10 divisions at any time. You may
transfer accumulated amounts from one division to another as often as 12 times in a Policy year.    
Tax Benefits You are generally not taxed on your Policys investment gains until you surrender the Policy or make a withdrawal. (See Tax Treatment of Life Insurance.)    
Risks of the Policy    
Investment Risk Your Policy allows you to participate in the investment experience of the Account divisions you select. You bear the corresponding investment risks. You may find a comprehensive discussion of these
risks in the attached mutual fund prospectuses.    
Policy for Long-Term Protection Your Policy is designed to serve your need for long-term life insurance protection. It is not a suitable vehicle for short-term goals. We have not designed the Policy for frequent
trading.    
Policy Lapse Your Policy will lapse if you do not pay sufficient premium to keep it in force. Favorable investment experience may reduce the required premium, but we do not guarantee investment experience. Policy
loans or withdrawals may increase the premium required to keep the Policy in force.    
Limitations on Access to Your Values We will deduct a surrender charge if you request a surrender or partial surrender of your Policy or the Policy becomes paid-up insurance during the first 15 Policy years. We
permit withdrawals only if the Excess Amount is sufficient. The minimum amount for a withdrawal is $250. A maximum of four withdrawals is permitted per Policy year. A partial surrender or withdrawal will reduce the death benefit.    
Adverse Tax Consequences Our understanding of the principal tax considerations for the Policy under current tax law is set forth in this prospectus. There are areas of some uncertainty under current law, and we
do not address the likelihood of future changes in the law or interpretations thereof. Among other risks, your Policy may become a modified endowment contract if the total amount of premiums you have paid exceeds a defined limit; surrenders,
withdrawals, and loans under the Policy will then be taxable as ordinary income to the extent there are earnings in the Policy, and a 10% penalty will apply to these distributions. Moreover, if excessive 
  
1 



Policy loans cause a Policy to terminate, or if the Policy otherwise lapses out of force before the insured dies, a tax liability may arise as a result with
little, if any value in the Policy with which to pay the liability. (See Tax Treatment of Policy Benefits.)    
Fee and Expense Tables    The following tables
describe the fees and expenses that you will pay when buying, owning, and surrendering the Policy. See Deductions and Charges for a more detailed description.    
Transaction Fees    This table describes the
fees and expenses you will pay when you pay premiums, withdraw Excess Amount, surrender the Policy or transfer amounts between the Account divisions.

The premium surrender charge is a percentage (shown in the table below) of the surrender charge base. If payment of the premium for a Policy year has been suspended, the premium
surrender charge percentage will be as if you had paid the annual premium. During the first five Policy years, if you pay premiums more frequently than annually we will adjust the premium surrender charge percentages to reflect the actual period for
which you have paid premiums. The surrender charge base equals the sum of an annual premium for the Minimum Guaranteed Death Benefit (exclusive of the Policy fee and exclusive of any charge for substandard mortality) plus a term insurance premium
for the initial amount of Additional Protection.

The amounts of these deductions may be effectively reduced by the dividends we may pay on inforce Policies. The dividends we currently pay are reflected in illustrations we provide.
You may request an illustration from your Northwestern Mutual Financial Representative. We do not guarantee future dividends. (See Annual Dividends.) The cost of insurance rate shown in the table may not be representative of the charge
that a particular Policy Owner may pay. Request an illustration for personalized information. (See Illustrations.)

(e)
The amount is determined by multiplying the net amount at risk by the cost of insurance rate.
The net amount at risk is the projected insurance amount, discounted at 4%, less the Policy Value. The projected insurance amount is the amount of insurance at the end of the Policy year, assuming that the Policy Value increases by the 4% annual
growth rate assumed in constructing the Policy. The cost of insurance rate reflects the attained age of the insured and a mortality table. The selection of the mortality table is determined by the risk classification of the insured.

(l)
The maximum benefit amount is $100,000   


(m)

(n)
The charge is applied to the Policy debt. We add unpaid interest to the amount of the loan.
Interest on a Policy loan accrues and is payable on a daily basis at an annual effective rate of 5% or an alternative variable rate based on corporate bond yields. The amount of the Policy loan will be transferred from the Account divisions to
our general account and credited on a daily basis with an annual earnings rate equal to the Policy loan interest rate.

Northwestern Mutual    The Northwestern Mutual Life
Insurance Company is a mutual life insurance company organized by a special act of the Wisconsin Legislature in 1857. It is licensed to conduct a conventional life insurance business in the District of Columbia and in all states of the United
States. The total assets of Northwestern Mutual exceed $132 billion. Northwestern Mutual sells life and disability insurance policies and annuity contracts through its own field force of approximately over 5,600 full time producing agents. Our Home
Office is at 720 East Wisconsin Avenue, Milwaukee, Wisconsin 53202.    Northwestern Mutual, we, us and our in this prospectus mean The Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company.    
The Account    We established Northwestern
Mutual Variable Life Account by action of our Trustees on November 23, 1983, in accordance with the provisions of Wisconsin insurance law. Under Wisconsin law the income, gains and losses, realized or unrealized, of the Account are credited to
or charged against the assets of the Account without regard to our other income, gains or losses. We use the Account only for variable life insurance policies. However, the policies issued prior to the introduction of Variable CompLife® (October 11, 1995 in most states) are different from the Variable CompLife® Policies described in this prospectus. The older policies are described in a separate prospectus and
are no longer offered. We also use the Account for other variable life insurance policies which are described in other prospectuses.    Northwestern Mutual is obligated to pay all amounts promised to Policy Owners, subject to the terms and conditions of the Policy. Furthermore, the portion of Account
assets equal to policy reserves and liabilities will not be used to pay any liabilities of Northwestern Mutual, other than those arising from variable life insurance policies, although Northwestern Mutual does reserve the right to transfer Account
assets in excess of this amount out of the Account.    The Account is registered
with the Securities and Exchange Commission as a unit investment trust under the Investment Company Act of 1940. This registration does not involve supervision of management or investment practices or policies. The Account has twenty-four divisions.
All of the assets of each division are invested in shares of a corresponding Portfolio of one of the Funds described below.    
The Funds    Each of Northwestern Mutual Series
Fund, Inc, Fidelity® Variable Insurance Products Fund III, and the Russell Investment
Funds is a mutual fund of the series type registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 as an open-end management investment company (Funds). The Account buys shares of the series of the Funds identified below
(Portfolios) at their respective net asset values without sales charge. You may choose to allocate your purchase payments among up to ten of twenty-four divisions and transfer values from one division to another, each of which
corresponds with one of the Portfolios. Amounts you allocate among the divisions may grow in value, decline in value or grow less than you expect, depending on the investment performance of the corresponding underlying Portfolios.    The investment objectives and types of investments for each Portfolio are set forth below.
There can be no assurance that the Portfolios will realize their objectives. For more information about the investment objectives and policies, the attendant risk factors and expenses for each of the Portfolios described below, see the attached
prospectuses. Read the prospectuses carefully before you invest.     
Northwestern Mutual Series Fund, Inc.     The investment adviser for the Northwestern Mutual Series Fund is Mason Street Advisors, LLC (MSA), our wholly-owned company. The investment advisory agreements for the respective Portfolios provide that MSA will provide
services and bear certain expenses of the Fund. MSA employs a staff of investment professionals to manage the assets of the Fund and the other advisory 
  
5 



clients of MSA. We provide related facilities and personnel, which MSA uses in performing its investment advisory functions. MSA has retained Templeton
Investment Counsel, LLC, Capital Guardian Trust Company, T. Rowe Price Associates, Inc., Alliance Capital Management L.P. and Janus Capital Management LLC under investment sub-advisory agreements to provide investment advice to the Portfolios
bearing their names or derivatives thereof.

Information About the Policy    
The Policy Design    The Policy combines a Minimum
Guaranteed Death Benefit with Additional Protection in an integrated policy design. The Minimum Guaranteed Death Benefit represents permanent life insurance guaranteed for the lifetime of the insured if premiums are paid when due and no Policy debt
is outstanding. The Additional Protection is guaranteed for a period of years which depends on the sex and risk classification and age of the insured when the Policy is issued and the relative proportions of Minimum Guaranteed Death Benefit and
Additional Protection. For an insured aged less than 43, the guaranteed period is not less than ten years. The guaranteed period is stated in the Policy. It is generally longer for younger insureds and shorter for insureds who are older, but will
not be less than six years, or more than 46 years.    We place Net Premiums in
the Account divisions you select. The Net Premiums increase the Policy Value. The Policy Value is the cumulative amount invested, adjusted for investment results, reduced any charges, including the cost of insurance, which is based on the net amount
at risk. This is the amount of insurance in force less the Policy Value. The cost of insurance also reflects the attained age of the insured each year. If you pay premiums when they are due, and investment experience is favorable, the Policy Value
will increase year by year.    We have designed the Policy so that the increase
in Policy Value over time should reduce the net amount at risk. The reduction in the net amount at risk offsets the rising cost of the mortality risk as the age of the insured increases, reducing the total cost of insurance which we subtract from
the Policy Value each year. This scenario depends, however, on the investment experience of your investments, which is a principal factor in determining Policy Value. Investment experience is not guaranteed. If investment experience does not produce
a sufficient rate of return, the amount of Additional Protection will be reduced in later Policy years, or you will need to pay additional premium to keep the Additional Protection from falling.    For a typical Policy the average annual net investment rate of return required to maintain
the initial amount of Additional Protection, without additional premium, should be between 4% and 6%, based on the current charges and dividend scale. You may request a sales illustration to show the impact on the Additional Protection of a
particular average annual net investment rate of return. (See Illustrations.) Any excess Policy Value (Excess Amount) is simply added to the death benefit and the Cash Value, dollar for dollar, unless a greater increase in
the death benefit is required to meet tax requirements for life insurance. (See Excess Amount and Tax Treatment of Policy Benefits.)    The Policy also allows you to pay additional premiums to purchase variable paid-up additional insurance. We calculate the values for the additional insurance separately
from those which support the initial amount of insurance. The values for the variable paid-up additional insurance do not affect the Policy Value. We allow unscheduled additional premiums to purchase variable paid-up additional insurance, subject to
insurability of the insured when we accept the premiums. You may also pay additional premiums to increase the Policy Value.    
Requirements for Insurance    The minimum amount we
require for the Minimum Guaranteed Death Benefit is $100,000, reduced to $50,000 if the insured is below age 15 or over age 59. If the initial premium is at least $10,000 ($5,000 for ages below 15) the required minimum for the Minimum Guaranteed
Death Benefit is $1,000. A lower minimum also may apply in some other circumstances and will apply if the Policy is 
  
7 



purchased for an employer-sponsored benefit plan. (See Special Policy for Employers.) In all cases, the Minimum Guaranteed Death Benefit must be
at least $1,000.    Before issuing a Policy, we will require satisfactory
evidence of insurability. Non-smokers who meet underwriting requirements for the best three classifications are considered Premier NT, Preferred NT, and Standard Plus NT, respectively. The best two classes of smokers are considered Premier T and
Preferred T, respectively. The premium depends in part on the risk classification. We charge a higher premium for insureds who qualify as substandard risks, i.e., for insureds who do not qualify for the risk classifications mentioned above.
The amount of extra premium depends in part on the risk classification in which we place the insured.    For contracts issued prior to January 1, 2005, we used a different risk classification system. Risks which would be considered Premier NT or Preferred NT under the current system were called Standard Plus. Risks
which would be considered Premier T or Preferred T under the current system were called Standard.    
Premiums    The Policy provides for a level
scheduled premium to be paid annually at the beginning of each Policy year. Premiums are payable at our Home Office. We accept premium payment by various means, including check and electronic funds transfer (EFT).    By administrative practice, we accept premiums on a monthly, quarterly or semi-annual
schedule and we permit premium payment under an authorized payment plan by electronic funds transfer from your bank. If you pay premiums more frequently than annually, we place the scheduled net annual premium in the Account on each Policy
anniversary. We advance this amount on this date and we are reimbursed as we receive your premium payments. You have no obligation to repay the amount that we have advanced, but failure to pay the premiums when due will cause (a) premium
payments to be suspended (subject to the conditions described later in this section), (b) the Policy to continue in force as a reduced amount of paid-up insurance, or (c) the Policy to terminate. If you do not pay premiums when they are
due, we will reduce the Account assets supporting the Policy to reflect the premiums due later in the Policy year.    Premiums you pay other than on an annual basis are increased to (1) reflect the time value of money, based on an 8% per annum interest rate, and (2) cover
the administrative costs to process the additional premium payments. A monthly premium is currently equal to the annual premium times .0863 plus 50 cents. You may pay monthly premiums only through an automatic payment plan arranged with your bank. A
quarterly premium is currently equal to the annual premium times .2573 plus $2.00. A semi-annual premium is equal to the annual premium times .5096 plus $1.35. For any frequency other than annual, the annual percentage rate (APR) will
depend on the amount of the annual premium and the premium payment frequency. For monthly premiums, the APR will be between 7.71% and 12.88%. For quarterly premiums, the APR will be between 7.81% and 16.48%. For semi-annual premiums, the APR will be
between 7.83% and 12.38%. You may obtain information about APR calculations for premiums paid other than annually from your Northwestern Mutual Financial Representative. The APR calculation is also available through www.nmfn.com. The following table
shows examples of annual and periodic premiums, the excess of the annual sum of the periodic premiums over the annual premiums and the APR.

   The scheduled premium
includes the premium for the Minimum Guaranteed Death Benefit and the premium for any Additional Protection. The amount of the premium depends on the amount of the Minimum Guaranteed Death Benefit and the amount of Additional Protection, as well as
the insureds age and risk classification. The amount of the premium also reflects the sex of the insured except where state or federal law requires that premiums and other charges and values be determined without regard to sex. We send a
notice to you not less than two weeks before each premium is due.   
8 


You may select the proportions of Minimum Guaranteed Death Benefit and Additional Protection, subject to the required
minimum amount for the Minimum Guaranteed Death Benefit. (See Requirements for Insurance.) Policies that include Additional Protection are subject to a minimum premium that is equal to 70% of the premium for a Policy that consists solely
of Minimum Guaranteed Death Benefit. The premium for the Additional Protection consists of two times the cost of term insurance (for the insureds age when the Policy was issued) as long as this amount in combination with the premium for the
Minimum Guaranteed Death Benefit meets the 70% requirement. If this combination does not meet the 70% requirement, the premium for Additional Protection is increased to bring the total up to the 70% level. We apply the amount by which the premium is
increased, after deductions, to increase the Policy Value. In most cases we will also guarantee the Additional Protection for a longer period. The premium rates for term insurance are set forth in the Policy. In addition to the premium required for
the Minimum Guaranteed Death Benefit and any Additional Protection, the scheduled premium may include additional premium to purchase paid-up additional insurance or to increase the Policy Value. The scheduled premium will also include the premium
required for any additional benefit included as part of the Policy.    After the
Policy is issued we will reduce the additional premium included in the scheduled premium at any time upon your request. You may increase the additional premium included in the scheduled premium, or you may pay optional unscheduled additional
premiums, at any time before the Policy anniversary nearest to the insureds 85th birthday, subject to our insurability requirements and issue limits.    If the Policy includes Additional Protection, we may require an increased premium after the guaranteed period to prevent a reduction of the amount of Additional
Protection. We determine the increased premium, if required, each year as of the date 25 days before the Policy anniversary. You are entitled to pay the increased premium required to keep the Additional Protection from falling until the insured
reaches age 80, but this right terminates as of the first Policy anniversary on which you do not pay the increased premium when it is due.    You may suspend payment of scheduled premiums, at your option, if, as of 25 days prior to the Policy anniversary on or before the due date of the premium, (1) the
Excess Amount exceeds one years minimum premium, and (2) the Policy Value exceeds the sum of the net single premium for the amount of insurance then in force, plus the present value of future charges for expenses, additional benefits, and
any extra mortality. (See Excess Amount.) The minimum premium is the sum of the premiums for the Minimum Guaranteed Death Benefit, the Additional Protection and any additional benefit included in the Policy. We will calculate the net
single premium and the present value of future charges using the mortality basis for the cost of insurance charges with 6% interest. (See Charges Against the Policy Value.) While payment of premiums is suspended, certain charges
ordinarily deducted from premiums will reduce the Policy Value instead. These charges are set forth in your Policy in the Table of Charges under Premium Suspension. You may resume payment of scheduled premiums as of any Policy anniversary. You must
resume payment of scheduled premiums as of the next Policy anniversary if the Excess Amount, as of 25 days prior to the Policy anniversary, is determined to be less than one years minimum premium. You may pay unscheduled additional premiums
while suspension of scheduled premiums is in effect, subject to our insurability requirements and issue limits.    The Policy provides for a grace period of 31 days for any premium that is not paid when due. The Policy remains in force during this period. If you pay a premium during
the grace period, the values for the Policy will be the same as if you had paid the premium when it was due. If you do not pay the premium within the grace period, and the Policy does not qualify for premium suspension, the Policy will terminate as
of the date when the premium was due and will no longer be in force, unless it is continued as paid-up insurance. (See Paid-Up Insurance.) If you surrender a Policy, its Cash Value will be paid. (See Cash Value.) The
following table shows representative annual premiums for a Policy with an initial death benefit amount of $400,000, divided equally between Minimum Guaranteed Death Benefit and Additional Protection, for male Premier NT or Preferred NT, Standard
Plus NT and Premier T or Preferred T, at three ages.

Death Benefit    The death benefit for a Policy
includes the Minimum Guaranteed Death Benefit, any Additional Protection in effect, any Excess Amount, and any paid-up additional insurance. It is reduced by the amount of any Policy debt outstanding and, if premiums are not paid on an annual basis,
an adjustment for premiums used to purchase paid-up additional insurance that are due later in the Policy year.    The Minimum Guaranteed Death Benefit you select when the Policy is issued will neither increase nor decrease, regardless of the investment experience of the Account
divisions where assets for the Policy are held, so long as you pay scheduled premiums when they are due and no Policy debt is outstanding. In setting the premium rates for the Minimum Guaranteed Death Benefit we have assumed that the Account assets
will grow at a net annual rate of 4% after the Account charges and the expenses of the Portfolios in which you invest. (See Charges Against the Account Assets.) We bear the risk that the rate of growth will be less. A higher rate of
growth results in an increase in the Policy Value.    The Additional Protection
included in a Policy when it is issued will not increase by reason of investment experience more favorable than the assumed 4% net annual rate of growth. It will not decrease, regardless of investment experience, until expiration of the guaranteed
period, so long as you pay scheduled premiums when they are due and no Policy debt is outstanding. A condition for this guarantee is that you must use any dividends paid on the Policy to increase Policy Value unless the Policy has an Excess Amount.
(See Excess Amount.) After the guaranteed period, the Additional Protection may be reduced unless the Policy Value exceeds the amount defined by the formula in the Policy. We calculate the amount of Policy Value, and the amount of
increased premium required to prevent a reduction in the Additional Protection, 25 days before each Policy anniversary. You may pay any increased premium required to prevent a reduction in the Additional Protection each year until the Policy
anniversary nearest the insureds 80th birthday, but this right terminates the first time you do not pay any required increased premium when it is due.    The Policy Value represents the cumulative net premiums for the Minimum Guaranteed Death Benefit and the Additional Protection, including any additional net premiums or
Policy dividends which have been used to increase the Policy Value, adjusted for investment experience, less the cost of insurance which we deduct from the Policy Value on each Policy anniversary, and any other charges. The Policy Value may exceed
the amount required to support the Minimum Guaranteed Death Benefit and the Additional Protection. This may result from favorable investment experience or from additional premium or Policy dividends used to increase the Policy Value. The amount by
which the Policy Value exceeds the amount needed to support the Minimum Guaranteed Death Benefit and the Additional Protection under a specified set of assumptions is called the Excess Amount. (See Excess Amount.) Any Excess Amount will
increase the death benefit for the Policy, dollar-for-dollar, except as described in the next paragraph. The Policy Value and any Excess Amount change daily.    We have designed the Policy to meet the definitional requirements for life insurance in Section 7702 of the Internal Revenue Code. (See Tax Treatment of Policy
Benefits.) These rules require that the death benefit will never be less than the Policy Value divided by the net single premium per dollar of death benefit. The required difference between the death benefit and the Policy Value is higher at
younger ages than at older ages. The Policy provides for an increase in the death benefit to the extent required to meet this test. After the death benefit has been increased to meet this requirement, an increase in the Policy Value will cause a
greater than dollar-for-dollar increase in the death benefit, and a decrease in the Policy Value will cause a greater than dollar-for-dollar decrease in the death benefit.    The death benefit is increased by the amount of any paid-up additional insurance purchased with additional premium or Policy dividends. The
amount and value of the paid-up additional insurance vary daily to reflect investment experience and are not guaranteed. The amount of any paid-up additional insurance is its value used as a net single premium at the attained age of the insured.
   Death benefits will be paid under the payment plan that takes effect on
the date of death of the insured. Available payment plans include an Interest Income Plan, Installment Income Plans, and Life Income Plans. The Interest Income Plan will be in effect if no payment plan has been elected. The Policy Owner may elect
the payment plan while the insured is living or, if the insured is not the Policy Owner, during the first 60 days after the insureds date of death. If the Policy Owner fails to elect a payment plan, a Beneficiary may elect a payment plan for
death benefits payable to that Beneficiary. A payment plan that is elected by the Policy Owner will take effect on the date of death of the insured if it is received in our Home Office while the insured is living. In all other cases, it will take
effect on the date of receipt or a later date, if requested.    
Policy Value and Paid-Up Additional Insurance    We
determine the Policy Value and the value of any paid-up additional insurance daily by separate calculations. An increase or decrease in the Policy Value has no effect on the value of any paid-up additional insurance, and an increase or decrease in
the value of any paid-up additional insurance has no effect on the Policy Value. You may increase or decrease the amount of scheduled additional premium which you are paying to increase the Policy Value or to increase the amount of paid-up
additional insurance, and you may 
  
10 



change the allocation for applying this additional premium. You must make changes in the scheduled additional premium and its allocation by written request.
We may require evidence of insurability if you increase the scheduled additional premium. We do not permit increases in the scheduled additional premium after the Policy anniversary nearest the insureds 85th birthday.    You may transfer the value of paid-up additional insurance to increase the Policy Value by
written request. This will generally result in a decrease in the total death benefit. You may not transfer Policy Value to the value of paid-up additional insurance.    
Allocations to the Account    We place the
first net annual premium for the Policy, including any net scheduled additional premium, in the Account as of the Policy date. We place the net scheduled annual premium in the Account on each Policy anniversary thereafter even if you are paying
premiums other than on an annual frequency. We will place net unscheduled premiums in the Account on the date they are received at our Home Office, provided the request is received in good order prior to the close of trading on the New York Stock
Exchange. Net premiums are premiums less the deductions from premiums. (See Deductions from Premiums.)    We invest premiums placed in the Account prior to the initial allocation date in the Money Market Division of the Account. The initial allocation date is identified in
the Policy and is the latest of the Policy date, 45 days after the date of the completed application or 32 days after we approve the application. If you do not pay the initial premium with the application, the initial allocation date is the latest
of 45 days after the date of the completed application, 32 days after we approve the application or 32 days after the Policy date. On the initial allocation date, the amount in the Money Market Division is invested in the Account divisions as you
have directed in the application for the Policy. You may change the allocation for future net premiums at any time by written request and the change will be effective for premiums placed in the Account thereafter. Eligible owners may also submit
allocation requests via Northwestern Mutual Express (1-800-519-4665) or via our website at nmfn.com. If you allocate any portion of a premium to a division, the division must receive at least 1% of that premium.    You may apportion the Account assets supporting your Policy among as many as ten divisions of
the Account at any one time. We count the Money Market Division as one of the ten available divisions if you are using it for any purpose, including the initial allocation date procedure described above or dollar cost averaging.    You may transfer accumulated amounts from one division of the Account to another. We will
make the transfer based upon the next valuation of Account assets in the affected divisions that we make after we receive the written request at our Home Office, provided it is in good order. If eligible, Owners may make a transfer request via
Northwestern Mutual Express (1-800-519-4665) or via our website at nmfn.com. Although no fee is presently charged, we reserve the right to charge a fee of up to $25 to cover administrative costs of transfers.    
Short Term and Excessive Trading Short term and excessive trading (sometimes referred to as market timing) may present risks to a Portfolios long-term investors because it can, among other things,
disrupt Portfolio investment strategies, increase Portfolio transaction and administrative costs, require higher than normal levels of cash reserves to fund unusually large or unexpected redemptions, and adversely affect investment performance.
These risks may be greater for Portfolios that invest in securities that may be more vulnerable to arbitrage trading, including foreign securities and thinly traded securities, such as small cap stocks and non-investment grade bonds. These types of
trading activities also may dilute the value of long-term investors interests in a Portfolio if it calculates its net asset value using closing prices that are no longer accurate. Accordingly, we discourage market timing activities.
   To deter short term and excessive trading, we have adopted and
implemented policies and procedures which are designed to control abusive trading practices. We seek to apply these policies and procedures uniformly to all Policy Owners, except to the extent we are prevented from doing so under applicable state or
federal law or regulation. Any exceptions must be either expressly permitted by our policies and procedures or subject to an approval process described in them. Because exceptions are permitted, it is possible that investors may be treated
differently and, as a result, some may be allowed to engage in trading activity that might be viewed as market timing.    Among the steps we have taken to reduce the frequency and effect of these practices are monitoring trading activity and imposing trading restrictions, including the
prohibition of more than twelve transfers among divisions under a single Policy during a Policy year. Further, an investor who is identified as having made a transfer in and out of the same division (round trip transfer) in an amount in
excess of $10,000 within fourteen calendar days will be restricted from making additional transfers after the third such round trip transfer until the next Policy anniversary date, and sent a letter informing him of the restriction. Thereafter, the
same investor will be similarly restricted after the second such round trip transfer. An investor who is identified as having made one or more round trip transfers within thirty calendar days aggregating more than one percent (1%) of the total
assets of the Portfolio underlying a division will be sent a warning letter after the first such round trip transfer and will be restricted from making additional transfers until the next Policy anniversary date after the second such round trip
transfer. Thereafter, the same investor will be similarly restricted after the first such round trip transfer. These limitations do not apply to automatic asset transfers, scheduled or systematic transactions involving portfolio rebalancing, dollar
cost averaging, interest sweeps, or initial allocations or changes in allocations.   
11 


These policies and procedures may change from time to time in our sole discretion without notice; provided, however,
Policy Owners would be given advance, written notice if the policies and procedures were revised to accommodate market timing. Additionally, the Funds may have their own policies and procedures described in their prospectuses that are designed to
limit or restrict frequent trading.    If we believe your trading activity is
in violation of, or inconsistent with, our policies and procedures or otherwise is potentially disruptive to the interests of other investors, you may be asked to stop such activities, and future investments, allocations or transfers by you may be
rejected without notice. Because we retain discretion to determine what action is appropriate in a given situation, investors may be treated differently and some may be allowed to engage in activities that might be viewed as market timing.
   We intend to monitor events and the effectiveness of our policies and
procedures in order to identify whether instances of potentially abusive trading practices are occurring. However, we may not be able to identify all instances of abusive trading practices, nor completely eliminate the possibility of such
activities, and there may be technological limitations on our ability to impose restrictions on the trading practices of Policy Owners.    
Deductions and Charges    
Deductions from Premiums We deduct a charge from each premium for state and federal taxes attributable to premiums. The total amount of this deduction is 3.5% of the premium. We may change the charge for taxes to
reflect any changes in the law, but will not charge more than the maximum amount allowed under the Policy.    We deduct a charge, or sales load, of 4.5% for sales costs from each premium. We expect to recover our expenses of selling and advertising (distribution expenses) from this amount, over the
period while the Policies are in force, and from the surrender charges described below. The amounts we deduct for costs in a Policy year are not specifically related to distribution expenses incurred that year. To the extent that distribution
expenses exceed the amounts deducted, we will pay the expenses from our other assets. These assets may include, among other things, any gain realized from the charge against the assets of the Account for the mortality and expense risks we have
assumed. (See Charges Against the Account Assets.) To the extent that the amounts deducted for distribution expenses exceed the amounts needed, we will realize a gain.    We deduct an annual charge of $60 from premiums each year for administrative costs to maintain the Policy. These expenses include costs of
premium billing and collection, processing claims, keeping records and communicating with Policy Owners. We retain the right to increase this charge after 10 years, but it is guaranteed not to exceed $84 plus $0.12 per $1,000 of both the Minimum
Guaranteed Death Benefit and the Additional Protection. We do not expect to profit from this charge.    We deduct an annual charge from premiums each of the first 10 years to compensate us for expenses, other than distribution expenses, incurred in issuing the Policy. These expenses include the costs of processing
applications, medical examinations, determining insurability and establishing records. The annual amount of this charge is $24 plus $ 0.12 per $1,000 of Minimum Guaranteed Death Benefit and Additional Protection. If you surrender the Policy
before these charges have been deducted for 10 years, the remaining charges will be reflected in the administrative surrender charge. (See Surrender Charges.)    We deduct an annual charge of $ 0.12 per $1,000 of Minimum Guaranteed Death Benefit from premiums each year to compensate us for the
risk we have assumed by guaranteeing the Minimum Guaranteed Death Benefit, as long as you pay all premiums when they are due, no matter how unfavorable investment performance may be.    To determine the net annual premium, we will also deduct any extra amounts we charge for insureds who qualify as substandard risks, plus the
cost of any additional benefits purchased with the Policy, to determine the net annual premium.    
Charges Against the Policy Value We deduct a cost of insurance charge from the Policy Value on each Policy Anniversary. We determine the amount by multiplying the net amount at risk by the cost of insurance rate.
The net amount at risk is the projected insurance amount, discounted at a net annual rate of 4%, less the Policy Value. The projected insurance amount is the amount of insurance at the end of the Policy year, assuming that the Policy Value increases
by the 4% net annual growth rate assumed in constructing the Policy. The cost of insurance rate reflects the attained age of the insured. For Premier NT and Preferred NT risks, the cost of insurance rate is based on the Commissioners 1980 Standard
Ordinary Non-Smoker Mortality Tables. For Premier T and Preferred T risks, the cost of insurance rate is based on the Commissioners 1980 Standard Ordinary Smoker Mortality Tables. For other risks, the cost of insurance rate is based on the
Commissioners 1980 Standard Ordinary Mortality Tables. The cost of insurance rates are included in the Policy. We also deduct a cost of insurance charge from the Cash Value of any paid-up additional insurance on each Policy anniversary. If we
receive an unscheduled premium on a day other than a Policy anniversary and the net amount at risk increases as a result, we will deduct a cost of insurance charge on that day, reflecting the increase in the net amount at risk and the portion of the
Policy year remaining.    While payment of premiums is suspended, a portion of
the annual charges which we would ordinarily deduct from premiums will be deducted from the Policy Value instead. We will also make this deduction on the Policy anniversary each year.   
12 


We will also reduce the Policy Value by any surrender charges, administrative charges or decrease in Policy debt that
may result from a withdrawal, a decrease in the face amount of insurance, or a change to variable benefit paid-up insurance.    
Charges Against the Account Assets There is a daily charge to the Account for the mortality and expense risks that we have assumed. The current charge is at the annual rate of .45% of the assets of the Account, not
to exceed a maximum annual rate of .60%. The mortality risk is that insureds may not live as long as we estimated. The expense risk is that expenses of issuing and administering the Policies may exceed the estimated costs. We will realize a gain
from this charge to the extent it is not needed to provide benefits and pay expenses under the Policies. The actual mortality and expense experience under the Policies may be used in determining dividends. (See Annual Dividends.)
   The Policies provide that a charge for taxes may be made against the assets of
the Account. We are not currently making a separate daily charge on assets for federal income taxes we have incurred. The Portfolios in which the assets that support your Policy are invested also bear expenses which reduce the investment rate of
return. (See Fee and Expense TablesAnnual Fund Operating Expenses and attached mutual fund prospectuses.)    
Transaction Charges The Policy provides for a fee of up to $25 for a transfer of assets among the Account divisions and for a fee of up to $25 for a withdrawal of Excess Amount. We are currently waiving these
charges.    
Surrender Charges If you surrender the Policy before you have paid the premium that is due at the beginning of the fifteenth year, we will deduct surrender charges from the Policy Value. Similarly, we will deduct
surrender charges on a change to paid-up insurance. (See Paid-Up Insurance.) A table of surrender charges is in the Policy.    The surrender charges consist of an administrative surrender charge and a premium surrender charge. The administrative surrender charge is equal to the sum of the issue
expense charges which we have not deducted. The administrative surrender charge in the first Policy year is $216, plus $1.08 per $1,000 of Minimum Guaranteed Death Benefit and Additional Protection. This charge grades down linearly each year as you
pay the premium (or payment of premiums is suspended) and is zero after you have paid the premium that is due at the beginning of the tenth Policy year (or it is suspended).    The premium surrender charge is a percentage (shown in the table below) of the surrender charge base. If payment of the premium for a
Policy year has been suspended, the premium surrender charge percentage will be as if you had paid the annual premium. During the first five policy years, if you pay premiums more frequently than annually, we will adjust the premium surrender charge
percentages to reflect the actual period for which you have paid premiums.    If none of the premium payments during the first five Policy years have been suspended, the surrender charge base equals the sum of an annual premium for the Minimum Guaranteed Death Benefit (exclusive of the Policy fee and exclusive of any
charge for extra mortality) plus a term insurance premium for the initial amount of Additional Protection.    If any of the premium payments during the first five Policy years have been suspended, the surrender charge base equals the lesser of (1) the sum of an annual premium for the Minimum Guaranteed Death Benefit
(exclusive of the Policy fee and exclusive of any charge for extra mortality) plus a term insurance premium for the initial amount of Additional Protection, and (2) the sum of the total premiums paid (exclusive of any premiums for additional
benefits purchased with the Policy, and premiums for extra mortality, and any extra amount for premiums paid more often than annually) divided by the number of years (including fractions), but not more than five, for which premiums have been paid or
suspended.

For a Policy that has a Minimum Guaranteed Death Benefit of $50,000 or more, the surrender charges will not exceed $41.16
per $1,000 of Minimum Guaranteed Death Benefit. For a Policy that has a Minimum Guaranteed Death Benefit of $100,000 or more, issued for an insured ages 15-59, the surrender charges will not exceed $22.86 per $1,000 of Minimum Guaranteed Death
Benefit. The surrender charges could equal or exceed the Policy Value but we will not apply the surrender charges to the value of any paid-up additional insurance.    
Expenses of the Portfolios The investment performance of each division of the Account reflects all expenses borne by the corresponding Portfolio. (See Fee and Expense Tables Total Annual Portfolio
Operating Expenses and the attached mutual fund prospectuses.)    
Guarantee of Premiums, Deductions and Charges    We
guarantee and may not increase the premiums for the Minimum Guaranteed Death Benefit and the charge for mortality and expense risks. These amounts will not increase regardless of future changes in longevity or increases in expenses.    
Cash Value    The Cash Value for the Policy
will change daily in response to investment results. No minimum Cash Value is guaranteed. The Cash Value is equal to the Policy Value plus the value of any paid-up additional insurance, reduced by any Policy debt outstanding and the surrender
charges. If you are not paying premiums on an annual basis, we reduce the Cash Value for any premiums due later in the Policy year.    We determine the Cash Value for a Policy at the end of each valuation period. Each business day, together with any non-business days before it, is a valuation period. A
business day is any day on which the New York Stock Exchange is open for trading. In accordance with the requirements of the Investment Company Act of 1940, we may also determine the Cash Value for a Policy on any other day on which there is
sufficient trading in securities to materially affect the value of the securities held by the Portfolios.    You may surrender your Policy for the Cash Value at any time during the lifetime of the insured. Alternatively, you may request that we apply the Cash Value to provide a reduced amount of fixed or variable paid-up
insurance. (See Paid-Up Insurance.)    We will permit partial
surrenders of a Policy so long as the Policy that remains meets the regular minimum size requirements. A partial surrender will cause the Policy to be split into two Policies. One Policy will be surrendered; the other will continue in force on the
same terms as the original Policy, except that the premiums will be based on the reduced amount of insurance. You will receive a new Policy document. The Cash Value and the death benefit will be proportionately reduced. We will allocate reductions
among the Account divisions in proportion to the amounts in the divisions. We will make a deduction from the Policy proceeds for a proportionate part of the surrender charges if a partial surrender takes place before you have paid the premium that
is due at the beginning of the fifteenth Policy year. Although no fee is presently charged, we may make a transaction charge when a partial surrender is effected. The amount of the transaction charge will not exceed the actual administrative costs
for the transaction.    
Annual Dividends    The Policies are eligible
to share in the divisible surplus, if any, of the Company. This divisible surplus is determined each year. The share, if any, of a Policy will be credited as a dividend on the Policy anniversary. Decisions concerning the amount and appropriate
allocation of divisible surplus are within the sole discretion of the Companys Board of Trustees. There is no guaranteed method or formula for the determination or allocation of divisible surplus. Even if there is a divisible surplus, the
payment of a dividend on a Policy is not guaranteed.    Dividend illustrations
published at the time a life insurance policy is issued reflect the actual recent experience of the issuing company with respect to investment earnings, mortality and expenses. State law generally prohibits a company from projecting or estimating
future results. State law also requires that dividends be paid out of surplus, after certain necessary amounts are set aside, and that such surplus be apportioned equitably among policies eligible for dividends. In summary, dividends must be based
on actual experience and cannot be guaranteed at issue of a Policy. Both federal and state tax law recognize that a dividend is considered to be a refund of a portion of the premium paid.    Although subject to change, the process of determining dividends generally can be described as follows. Our actuaries annually examine
current and recent experience and compare these results with those which were assumed in determining premium rates when each class of Policies was issued. The factors used to determine classes include, but are not limited to, year of issue, age,
plan of insurance, and risk classification. The actuary then determines the amount of dividends to be equitably apportioned to each class of policies. Based on the actuarys recommendations, our Board of Trustees adopts a dividend scale each
year, thereby authorizing the distribution of the dividend. We pay any dividend on a Policys anniversary, and the dividend reflects our experience for the prior year.   
14 


For purposes of the current dividend scale used for the illustrations we publish, we have assumed that mortality
experience in connection with the Policies will be comparable to that actually experienced with all of our life insurance.    Dividends for variable life insurance are generally lower than those for our fixed benefit life insurance, primarily because a variable life insurance policy provides a
contractual mechanism for translation of investment experience into a variable death benefit and variable Cash Value. For fixed benefit life insurance the dividend includes amounts produced by favorable investment results. Dividends based on the
Minimum Guaranteed Death Benefit for the Policies described in this prospectus are expected to be relatively low during the first 15 Policy years.    You may use dividends to increase the Policy Value. If the Policy has Additional Protection in force, the dividends will be used to increase the Policy Value unless the
Policy has Excess Amount. (See Excess Amount.) If the Policy has Excess Amount, or if no Additional Protection is in force, you may use dividends to purchase variable benefit paid-up additional insurance, or to pay premiums, or you may
receive the dividend in cash. We will use dividends to increase the Policy Value if you give us no direction. If the Policy is in force as fixed benefit paid-up insurance, you may use dividends to purchase fixed benefit paid-up additional insurance
or you may receive the dividend in cash. If the Policy is in force as variable benefit paid-up insurance, you may use the dividends to purchase variable benefit paid-up additional insurance or you may receive the dividend in cash. 
  
Loans and Withdrawals    Described below are
certain terms and conditions that apply when you borrow or withdraw amounts under the Policy. For information on the tax treatment on loans and withdrawals, see Tax Treatment of Policy Benefits and consult with your tax advisor.
   
Loans You may borrow up to 90% of the Policys Cash Value using the Policy as security. If a Policy loan is already outstanding, the maximum amount for any new loan is 90% of the amount of Cash Value the Policy
would have had if there were no loan, less the amount already borrowed. You may take loan proceeds in cash or you may apply them to pay premiums on the Policy. If the premium loan provision is in effect and premium payments are not suspended, a loan
will automatically be made to pay an overdue premium if the premium is less than the maximum amount available for a new loan.    Interest on a Policy loan accrues and is payable on a daily basis. We add unpaid interest to the amount of the loan. The Policys Cash Value is reduced by the amount
of the Policy loan. If the Cash Value decreases to zero, the Policy will terminate unless a sufficient portion of the Policy loan is repaid. We will send you a notice at least 31 days before the termination date. The notice will show how much you
must repay to keep the Policy in force.    You select the Policy loan
interest rate. A specified annual effective rate of 5% is one choice. The other choice is a variable rate based on a corporate bond yield index. We will adjust the variable rate annually, but it will not be less than 5%.    We will take the amount of a Policy loan, including interest as it accrues, from the Account
divisions in proportion to the amounts in the divisions. We will transfer the amounts withdrawn to our general account and will credit those amounts on a daily basis with an annual earnings rate equal to the Policy loan interest rate less a charge
for the mortality and expense risks we have assumed and for expenses, including taxes. The aggregate charge is currently at the annual rate of .90% for the 5% specified Policy loan interest rate and .90% for the variable Policy loan interest rate.
For example, the earnings rate corresponding to the specified 5% Policy loan interest rate is currently 4.10%.    A Policy loan, even if it is repaid, will have a permanent effect on the Policy Value and Cash Value because the amounts borrowed will not participate in the Accounts investment results while the loan is
outstanding. The effect may be either favorable or unfavorable depending on whether the earnings rate credited to the loan amount is higher or lower than the rate credited to the unborrowed amount left in the Account.    Except when the Policy is in force as fixed benefit paid-up insurance, we will allocate a
Policy loan between Policy Value and variable paid-up additional insurance in proportion to the amount of Cash Value attributable to each.    You may repay a Policy loan, and any accrued interest outstanding, in whole or in part, at any time. We will credit payments as of the date we receive them and transfer
them from our general account to the Account divisions, in proportion to the amounts in the divisions, as of the same date.    
Withdrawals You may make a withdrawal if the Excess Amount is sufficient. (See Excess Amount.) A withdrawal may neither decrease the Excess Amount to less than the surrender charge which would apply if
the Policy were surrendered nor reduce the loan value to less than any Policy debt outstanding. A maximum of four withdrawals are permitted per policy year. The minimum amount for withdrawals is $250. An administrative charge of up to $25 may apply,
but we are currently waiving that charge. We will allocate withdrawals in proportion to the amounts in the Account divisions.   
15 


A withdrawal of Policy Value decreases the death benefit by the same amount. If the death benefit for a Policy has been
increased to meet the federal tax requirements for life insurance, the decrease in the death benefit caused by a subsequent withdrawal may be larger than the amount of the withdrawal.    If cumulative withdrawals exceed the cumulative additional premiums which have been used to increase the Policy Value, with both withdrawals
and premiums increased by 4% annual interest, subsequent unfavorable investment experience may cause the Policy to lapse unless you pay an additional unscheduled premium to increase the Policy Value. The due date for this premium is the Policy
anniversary following written notice to you.    
Excess Amount    The Excess Amount is the
amount by which the Policy Value exceeds the Tabular Cash Value for the sum of the Minimum Guaranteed Death Benefit and any Additional Protection in effect. The Tabular Cash Value is an amount equal to a Policy Value calculated assuming (1) a
whole life Policy with a face amount equal to the sum of the Minimum Guaranteed Death Benefit and the Additional Protection, (2) all premiums are paid when due, (3) no additional premiums or dividends are used to increase Policy Value,
(4) a 4% level annual net rate of return, and (5) maximum Policy charges apply. If you are not paying premiums on an annual basis, the Excess Amount is reduced for any premiums due later in the Policy year.    
Paid-Up Insurance    If you do not pay a
premium within the 31-day grace period, and the Policy does not qualify for suspension of premium payments, the Policy will continue in force as a reduced amount of fixed benefit paid-up insurance. Alternatively you may select a reduced amount of
variable benefit paid-up insurance. You must make this selection during the grace period or sooner.    If the Policy is in force as a reduced amount of fixed benefit paid-up insurance, we will transfer the amount of the Cash Value from the Account to our general account. Thereafter the Policy will not participate in
the Accounts investment results unless the Policy is subsequently reinstated. (See Reinstatement.) The minimum Cash Value for fixed benefit paid-up insurance is $1,000. If the Cash Value is less than $1,000 as of the last day of
the grace period we will treat the Policy as surrendered. You may select variable benefit paid-up insurance only if the Cash Value of the Policy is at least $5,000.    We determine the amount of paid-up insurance by applying the amount of Cash Value plus any Policy debt as a net single premium at the
attained age of the insured. Paid-up insurance has cash and loan values. For fixed benefit paid-up insurance the amounts of these are guaranteed. For variable paid-up insurance, neither the death benefit nor the Cash Value is guaranteed. Paid-up
insurance remains in force for the lifetime of the insured unless you surrender the Policy or the Policy terminates. While the Policy is in force as either fixed or variable benefit paid-up insurance, the Minimum Guaranteed Death Benefit and any
Additional Protection will not be in effect. Any Policy debt and the Policy loan interest rate will continue. (See Loans and Withdrawals.)    
Reinstatement    If a premium is due and remains
unpaid after the grace period expires, the Policy may be reinstated while the insured is alive within three years after the premium due date. The insured must provide satisfactory evidence of insurability unless reinstatement takes place within 31
days after the end of the grace period. We may require a substantial payment. Following reinstatement the Policy will have the same Minimum Guaranteed Death Benefit, Additional Protection, Policy Value and paid-up additional insurance as if minimum
premiums had been paid when due. We will credit a 4% annual net rate of investment earnings for the period from the due date of the overdue premium to the date of reinstatement. We will make an adjustment for any Policy debt or the debt may be
reinstated. The Policy may not be reinstated if you have surrendered it for its Cash Value.    
Right to Return Policy    You may return a
Policy for a refund within 45 days after you sign the application for insurance, or within 10 days (or later where required by state law) after you received the Policy. You may mail or deliver the Policy to the Financial Representative who sold it
or to our Home Office. The amount of your refund depends on state law. In some states the amount of the refund will be the premium you paid. In other states the refund will be the sum of the amounts deducted from the premium plus the Policy Value
less any Policy debt on the date we receive a written request for the return of the premium at our Home Office. If returned, we will consider the Policy void from the beginning.    
Right to Exchange for a Fixed Benefit Policy    You
may exchange a Policy for a whole life insurance policy with benefits that do not vary with the investment experience of a separate account (Fixed Benefit Policy). You may elect the exchange at any time within twenty-four months after
the issue date of the Policy provided premiums are duly paid. We do not require evidence of insurability.   
16 


The new policy will be on the life of the same insured and will have the same initial guaranteed death benefit, policy
date and issue age. The premiums and Cash Values will be the same as those for fixed benefit policies we issued on the issue date of the Policy.    The exchange will be subject to an equitable cash adjustment. The amount will recognize the difference in premiums and investment performance of the two policies.
   An exchange will be effective when we receive a proper written request, as
well as the Policy, and any amount due on the exchange.    You may also
exchange a Policy for a Fixed Benefit Policy if any of the mutual funds changes its investment adviser or if there is a material change in the investment policies of a Portfolio. You will be given notice of any such change and will have 60 days to
make the exchange.    
Other Policy Provisions    
Owner The owner is identified in the Policy. The owner may exercise all rights under the Policy while the insured is living. Ownership may be transferred to another. Written proof of the transfer must be received by
Northwestern Mutual at its Home Office. In this prospectus you means the owner or prospective purchaser of a Policy.    
Beneficiary The beneficiary is the person to whom the death benefit is payable. The beneficiary is named in the application. After the Policy is issued, you may change the beneficiary in accordance with the Policy
provisions.    
Incontestability We will not contest a Policy after it has been in force during the lifetime of the insured for two years from the date of issue.    
Suicide If the insured dies by suicide within one year from the date of issue, the amount payable under the Policy will be limited to the premiums paid, less the amount of any Policy debt and withdrawals and less
the Cash Value of any variable paid-up insurance surrendered.    
Misstatement of Age or Sex If the age or sex of the insured has been misstated, we will adjust benefits under a Policy to reflect the correct age and sex.    
Collateral Assignment You may assign a Policy as collateral security. We are not responsible for the validity or effect of a collateral assignment and will not be deemed to know of an assignment before receipt of
the assignment in writing at our Home Office.    
Optional Benefits There are two optional benefits available for purchase under the Policy: (1) a Waiver of Premium Benefit; and (2) an Additional Purchase Benefit.    Subject to the terms and conditions of the benefit, the Waiver of Premium Benefit waives the
payment of all premiums that come due during the total disability of the insured if the disability is due to accident or sickness and it begins on or before the Policy anniversary nearest the insureds 60th birthday. If the disability occurs
after the Policy anniversary nearest the insureds 60th birthday the benefit waives the payment of all premiums that come due during the total disability of the insured until the Policy anniversary nearest the insureds 65th birthday.
   Subject to the terms and conditions of the benefit, the Additional Purchase
Benefit guarantees the right to buy more insurance without proof of insurability.    If you select one or both of these optional benefits, you will be subject to a separate charge. (See Periodic Charges Other than Fund Operating Expenses.) Any charge will continue to be assessed (1) as long as the benefit
remains in force; (2) until we have paid the benefit; or (3) until you decide you no longer need the benefit and let us know in writing at our Home Office. Once the Policy has been issued, an optional benefit may be issued only upon mutual
agreement.    
Benefit Payment Plans The Policy provides a variety of payment plans for Policy benefits. A Northwestern Mutual Financial Representative authorized to sell the Policies can explain these provisions on request.
   
Deferral of Determination and Payment So long as premiums have been paid when due, we will ordinarily pay Policy benefits within seven days after we receive all required documents at our Home Office. However, we may
defer determination and payment of benefits during any period when it is not reasonably practicable to value securities because the New York Stock Exchange is closed or an emergency exists or the Securities and Exchange Commission, by order, permits
deferral for the protection of Policy Owners.    If a Policy is in force as
fixed benefit paid-up insurance, we have the right to defer payment of the Cash Value for up to six months from the date of a Policy loan or surrender. If payment on surrender is deferred for 30 days or more, we will pay interest at an annual
effective rate of 4%.   
17 



Voting Rights    We are the owner of the Fund
shares in which all assets of the Account are invested. As the owner of the shares, we will exercise our right to vote the shares to elect directors of the Funds, to vote on matters required to be approved or ratified by Fund shareholders under the
Investment Company Act of 1940 and to vote on any other matters that may be presented to any shareholders meeting of the Funds. However, we will vote the shares held in the Account in accordance with instructions received from Policy Owners,
but may change this voting policy if required to do so by applicable Federal law. We will vote any shares for which we do not receive instructions and shares held in our general account in the same proportions as the shares for which voting
instructions are received from Policy Owners. If the applicable laws or regulations change so as to permit us to vote the shares in our own discretion, we may elect to do so.    The number of shares for each division of the Account for which a Policy Owner may give instructions is determined by dividing the amount of
the Policys Cash Value apportioned to that division, if any, by the per share value for the corresponding Portfolio. The number will be determined as of a date we choose, but not more than 90 days before the shareholders meeting.
Fractional votes are counted. We will solicit voting instructions with written materials at least 14 days before the meeting.    We may, if required by state insurance regulations, disregard voting instructions which would require shares to be voted for a change in the sub-classification or
investment objectives of a Portfolio, or to approve or disapprove an investment advisory agreement for a Portfolio. We may also disregard voting instructions that would require changes in the investment policy or investment adviser for a Portfolio,
provided that we reasonably determine to take this action in accordance with applicable federal law. If we disregard voting instructions we will include a summary of the action and reasons therefore in the next semiannual report to the owners of the
Policies.    
Substitution of Fund Shares and Other Changes    If, in our judgment, a Portfolio or Fund becomes unsuitable for continued use with the Policies because of a change in investment objectives or restrictions, we may substitute shares of another Portfolio or Fund or another mutual fund. Any
substitution of shares will be subject to any required approval of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Wisconsin Commissioner of Insurance or other regulatory authority. We have also reserved the right, subject to applicable federal and
state law, to operate the Account or any of its divisions as a management company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, or in any other form permitted, or to terminate registration of the Account if registration is no longer required, and to
change the provisions of the Policies to comply with any applicable laws.    If we take any of these actions, we may make an appropriate endorsement of your Policy and take other actions to carry out what we have done.    
Reports    For each Policy year, you will
receive a statement showing the death benefit, Cash Value and any Policy loan (including interest charged) as of the anniversary date. We will also send you a confirmation statement when you pay the annual premium. The reports and confirmation
statements will show the apportionment of invested assets among the Account divisions. The invested assets equal the Policy Value plus the value of any variable paid-up additions. The invested assets may exceed the Cash Value of your Policy, because
the Cash Value is reduced by the amount of any applicable surrender charge and any premiums due later in the Policy year. You will also receive annual reports, including financial statements. If the Policy is in force as fixed benefit paid-up
insurance, statements and reports will be limited to an annual Policy statement showing the death benefit, cash value, and any Policy loan.    
Special Policy for Employers    A reduced
minimum amount applies for Policies where the insurance involves an employer-sponsored benefit plan or arrangement. The sum of the Minimum Guaranteed Death Benefit and the Additional Protection must be at least $10,000, of which the Minimum
Guaranteed Death Benefit must be at least $1,000. The premium for the Additional Protection is two times the cost of term insurance for the insureds age when the Policy is issued. Premium rates for term insurance are set forth in the Policy.
   These Policies for employers may include a provision to permit the amount
of Additional Protection to increase after issue. Any such increase amount must be based on the terms of the benefit plan or arrangement and may not be subject to the discretion of the insured or the insureds beneficiary. A description of the
method of determining the amount of any increase is included in the Policy. Changes to the amount of Additional Protection will be effective on Policy anniversaries. The surrender charge and all charges for issue and administrative expenses will be
based on the initial amount of Additional Protection.    For certain
situations where the insurance involves an employer-sponsored benefit plan or arrangement, federal law and the laws of certain states may require that premiums and annuity rates be determined without regard to sex. Special Policies are available for
this purpose. You are urged to review any questions in this area with qualified counsel.   
18 



Householding    To reduce costs, we now send only a
single copy of prospectuses and reports to each consenting household (rather than sending copies to each contract owner residing in a household). If you are a member of such a household, you can revoke your consent to householding at any
time, and can begin receiving your own copy of prospectuses and reports by calling us at 1-888-455-2232.    
Financial Statements    Financial statements of the
Account are incorporated by reference into the Statement of Additional Information from the Accounts Annual Report to Policy Owners. The financial statements of Northwestern Mutual appear in the Statement of Additional Information. To receive
a copy of the Annual Report and/or the Statement of Additional Information containing such financial statements, call 1-888-455-2232.    
Legal Proceedings    We are engaged in litigation
of various kinds which, in our judgment, is not of material importance in relation to our total assets. There are no pending legal proceedings to which the Account is a party.    
Illustrations    Your Northwestern Mutual
Financial Representative will provide you with illustrations for a Policy upon your request. The illustrations show how the death benefit, invested assets and Cash Value for a Policy would vary based on hypothetical investment results. The
illustrations will be based on the information you give us about the insured and will reflect such factors as the amount of Minimum Guaranteed Death Benefit and amount of Additional Protection that you select. These should be based upon realistic
expectations given your own individual situation.    Illustrations for
variable life insurance policies do not project or predict investment results. The illustrated values assume that non-guaranteed elements such as dividends, policy charges and level investment returns will not change. Given the volatility of the
securities markets over time, the illustrated scenario is unlikely to occur and the policys actual Cash Value, death benefit, and certain expenses (which will vary with the investment performance of the Portfolios) will be more or less than
those illustrated. In addition, the actual timing and amounts of payments, deductions, expenses and any values removed from the policy will also impact product performance. Due to these variations, even a Portfolio that averaged the same return as
illustrated will produce values which will be more or less than those which were originally illustrated.    
Tax Treatment of Policy Benefits    
General The following discussion provides a general description of federal income tax considerations relating to the Policy. The discussion is based on current provisions of the Internal Revenue Code
(Code) as currently interpreted by the Internal Revenue Service. We do not intend this as tax advice. The discussion is not exhaustive, it does not address the likelihood of future changes in federal income tax law or interpretations
thereof, and it does not address state or local tax considerations which may be significant in the purchase and ownership of a Policy.    The Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001, enacted on June 7, 2001, made substantial changes to the estate, gift and generation skipping transfer
tax. The Act increases the amount of an estate exempt from tax from $675,000 in 2001 to $1 million in 2002, $2 million in 2006 and $3.5 million in 2009. The Act reduces the top estate, gift and generation skipping transfer tax rate from 55% in 2001
to 45% in 2009. In 2010, the estate tax and generation skipping transfer tax are repealed and the gift tax is reduced to 35%. All of these changes are sunsetted or repealed in 2011, unless extended or made permanent. It is generally believed that
the estate tax repeal will not be made permanent, but that further changes may be made.    
Life Insurance Qualification Section 7702 of the Code defines life insurance for federal income tax purposes. We have designed the Policy to comply with this definition.    The definitional test under the Code is currently based on mortality tables adopted in
1980 or earlier. However, for policies materially changed after 2008, the test will be based on 2001 mortality tables. Because the Policy will not satisfy the definitional test using 2001 mortality tables, you will not be permitted to make certain
changes to your Policy after 2008 (as defined by Notice 2004-61).    Section 817(h) of the Code authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to set standards for diversification of the investments underlying variable life insurance policies. Final regulations have been issued pursuant to this authority.
Failure to meet the diversification requirements would disqualify the Policies as life insurance for purposes of Section 7702 of the Code. We intend to comply with these requirements.

On July 24, 2003, the Internal Revenue Service issued Rev. Ruls. 2003-91 and 2003-92 that provide guidance on
when a policy owners control of separate account assets will cause the policy owner, and not the life insurance company, to be treated as the owner of those assets. Important indicators of investor control are the ability of the policy owner
to select the investment advisor, the investment strategy or the particular investments of the separate account. If the owner of a policy were treated as the owner of the mutual fund shares held in the Account, the income and gains related to those
shares would be included in the owners gross income for federal income tax purposes. We believe that we own the assets of the Account under current federal income tax law.    
Tax Treatment of Life Insurance While a Policy is in force, increases in the Cash Value of the Policy as a result of investment experience are not subject to federal income tax until there is a distribution as
defined by the Code. The death benefit received by a beneficiary will not be subject to federal income tax.    Unless the Policy is a modified endowment contract, as described below, a loan received under a Policy will not be treated as a distribution subject to current federal
income tax. Interest paid by individual owners of the Policies will ordinarily not be deductible. You should consult a qualified tax advisor as to the deductibility of interest paid, or accrued, by other purchasers of the Policies. (See Other
Tax Considerations.)    As a general rule, the proceeds from a withdrawal
of Cash Value will be taxable only to the extent that the withdrawal exceeds the basis of the Policy. The basis of the Policy is generally equal to the premiums paid less any amounts previously received as tax-free distributions. In certain
circumstances, a withdrawal of Cash Value during the first 15 Policy years may be taxable to the extent that the Cash Value exceeds the basis of the Policy. This means that the amount withdrawn may be taxable even if that amount is less than the
basis of the Policy.    Caution must be used when taking cash out of a Policy
through policy loans. If interest is not paid annually, it is added to the principal amount and the total amount will continue to accrue for as long as the loan is maintained on the Policy. If the Policy remains in force until death, the loan will
be repaid from the tax-free death benefit. However, if the Policy terminates by any method other than death, the loan will be repaid from the Cash Value of the Policy and the total Cash Value, including the total amount of the loan, will be taxable
to the extent it exceeds the amount of premiums paid. In extreme situations, Policy Owners can face what is called the surrender squeeze. The surrender squeeze occurs when the unborrowed Cash Value remaining in the Policy is insufficient
to cover the interest payment required to keep the Policy in force or to cover the tax due if the Policy terminates. Either the interest would have to be paid annually or the Policy would terminate and any income tax due would have to be paid with
other assets.    A Policy may be exchanged tax-free for another life insurance
policy, an endowment contract or an annuity contract covering the same insured. Special tax rules may apply when ownership of a Policy is transferred. You should seek qualified tax advice if you plan a transfer of ownership.    
Modified Endowment Contracts A Policy will be classified as a modified endowment contract if the cumulative premiums paid at any time during the first seven Policy years exceed a defined seven-pay limit.
The seven-pay limit is the sum of the premiums (net of expense and administrative charges) that would have to be paid in order for the Policy to be fully paid for after seven level annual payments. A Policy will be treated as a modified endowment
contract unless any excess premiums are withdrawn from the Policy with interest within 60 days after the end of the Policy year in which they are paid.    Whenever there is a material change under a Policy, it will generally be treated as a new contract for purposes of determining whether the Policy is a
modified endowment contract, and it will be subjected to a new seven-pay period and a new seven-pay limit. The new seven-pay limit would be determined taking into account the Cash Value of the Policy at the time of such change. A materially changed
Policy would be considered a modified endowment contract if it failed to satisfy the new seven-pay limit. A material change could occur as a result of a change in the death benefit, a change in the level of premium payments, and certain other
changes. A material change could occur as a result of an increase in the death benefit, the addition of a benefit or the payment of a premium that is considered unnecessary under the Code.    If the benefits under the Policy are reduced during the first seven Policy years after
entering into the Policy (or within seven years after a material change), for example, by making a withdrawal of Cash Value or, in some cases, by lapsing the Policy, the seven-pay premium limit will be redetermined based on the reduced level of
benefits and applied retroactively for purposes of the seven-pay test. If the premiums previously paid are greater than the recalculated seven-pay premium limit, the Policy will become a modified endowment contract. A life insurance policy which is
received in exchange for a modified endowment contract will also be considered a modified endowment contract.    If a Policy is a modified endowment contract, any distribution from the Policy will be taxed on a gain-first basis. Distributions for this purpose include a loan (including any increase in the loan amount to pay
interest on an existing loan or an assignment or a pledge to secure a loan), a withdrawal of Cash Value or a surrender of the Policy. If a Policy terminates while there is a Policy loan, the cancellation of the loan and accrued loan interest also
will be treated as a distribution to the extent not previously treated as such. Any such distributions will be considered taxable income to the extent the Cash Value exceeds the basis in the Policy. For modified endowment contracts, the basis would
be increased by the amount of any prior loan under the Policy that was considered taxable 
  
20 



income. For purposes of determining the taxable portion of any distribution, all modified endowment contracts issued by Northwestern Mutual to the same
policy owner (excluding certain qualified plans) during any calendar year are to be aggregated. The Secretary of the Treasury has authority to prescribe additional rules to prevent avoidance of gain-first taxation on distributions from modified
endowment contracts.    A 10% penalty tax will apply to the taxable portion of a
distribution from a modified endowment contract. The penalty tax will not, however, apply to distributions (i) to taxpayers 59 1/2 years of age or older, (ii) in the case of a disability (as defined in the Code) or (iii) received as part of a series of substantially equal periodic annuity payments for the life (or life expectancy) of the
taxpayer or the joint lives (or joint life expectancies) of the taxpayer and the taxpayers beneficiaries. The exceptions generally do not apply to life insurance policies owned by corporations or other entities.    
Business Owned Life Insurance Business-owned life insurance may be subject to certain additional rules. Section 264(a)(1) of the Code generally disallows a deduction for premiums paid on Policies by anyone who
is directly or indirectly a beneficiary under the Policy. Increases in Cash Value may also be subject to tax under the corporation alternative minimum tax provisions.    Section 264(a)(4) of the Code limits the Policy Owners deduction for interest on loans taken against life insurance policies to
interest on an aggregate total of $50,000 of loans per covered life only with respect to life insurance policies covering key persons. Generally, a key person means an officer or a 20% owner. However, the number of key persons will be limited to the
greater of (a) five individuals, or (b) the lesser of 5% of the total officers and employees of the taxpayer or 20 individuals. Deductible interest for these Policies will be subject to limits based on current market rates.    In addition, Section 264(f) disallows a proportionate amount of a businesss
interest deduction on non-life insurance indebtedness based on the amount of unborrowed Cash Value of non-exempt life insurance policies held in relation to other business assets. Exempt policies include policies held by natural persons unless the
business is a direct or indirect beneficiary under the policy and policies owned by a business and insuring employees, directors, officers and 20% owners (as well as joint policies insuring 20% owners and their spouses).    Congress also is considering limiting the tax free death benefit on business-owned life
insurance to policies insuring highly compensated employees who consent to the coverage.    
Split-Dollar Arrangements Life insurance purchased under a split dollar arrangement is subject to special tax rules. Notice 2002-8 provides that (1) the value of the current life insurance protection provided
to the employee under the arrangement is taxed to the employee each year and, until the issuance of further guidance, can be determined using the governments Table 2001 rates or the insurers lower one year term rates (which, for
arrangements entered into after January 28, 2002, must satisfy additional sales requirements); and (2) for split dollar arrangements entered into on or before September 17, 2003, taxation of the equity (cash surrender value in excess
of the amount payable to the employer) is governed by prior law and is subject to the following three safe harbors: (a) the annual accrual of income will not, by itself, be enough to trigger a taxable transfer; (b) equity will not be taxed
regardless of the level of the employers economic interest in the life insurance policy as long as the value of the life insurance protection is treated and reported as an economic benefit; and (c) the employee can elect loan treatment at
any time, provided all premiums paid by the employer are treated as a loan entered into at the beginning of the first year in which payments are treated as loans.    On September 17, 2003, the Treasury and Internal Revenue Service issued final regulations regarding the taxation of split dollar
arrangements. The final regulations apply only to arrangements entered into or materially changed after September 17, 2003. The regulations provide that such split dollar arrangements must be taxed under one of two mutually exclusive tax
regimes depending on the ownership of the underlying life insurance policy. Collateral assignment split dollar arrangements, in which the employee owns the policy, must be taxed under a loan regime. Where such an arrangement imposes a below market
interest rate or no interest rate, the employee is taxed on the imputed interest under Section 7872 of the Code. Endorsement split dollar arrangements, in which the employer owns the policy, must be taxed under an economic benefit regime. Under
this regime, the employee is taxed each year on (i) the value of the current life insurance protection provided to the employee, (ii) the amount of policy Cash Value to which the employee has current access, and (iii) the value of any
other economic benefits provided to the employee during the taxable year.    Under, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, it is a criminal offense for an employer with publicly traded stock to extend or arrange a personal loan to a director or executive officer after July 30, 2002. One issue that has not been
clarified is whether each premium paid by such an employer under a split dollar arrangement with a director or executive officer is a personal loan subject to the new law.    New requirements for nonqualified deferred compensation plans were enacted as part of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. The law
applies to deferrals after December 31, 2004 and imposes conditions on the timing of deferrals, distribution triggers, funding mechanisms and reporting requirements. Nonqualified deferred compensation plans that fail to meet these conditions
are taxed currently on all compensation previously deferred and interest earned thereon and assessed an additional 20% penalty. The law does not limit the use of life insurance as an informal funding mechanism for nonqualified deferred compensation
plans but proposed 
  
21 



regulations treat certain split dollar arrangements as nonqualified deferred compensation plans that must comply with the new rules. Further guidance is
expected on this issue.    
Valuation of Life Insurance In 2005, the Treasury and Internal Revenue Service imposed special valuation rules on life insurance distributed from a qualified plan to a participant or transferred by an employer to an
employee. Notice 2005-25 provides a safe harbor formula for valuing variable life insurance that is the greater of the interpolated terminal reserve or the cash value (adjusted by a surrender factor for policies distributed from qualified plans),
both increased by a pro rata portion of the estimated dividends for the Policy year. These rules do not apply to split-dollar arrangements entered into on or before September 17, 2003 and not materially modified thereafter.    
Other Tax Considerations Pursuant to regulations issued in 2003, taxpayers are required to annually report all reportable transactions as defined in the regulations. Reportable transactions
include transactions that are offered under conditions of confidentiality as to tax treatment and involve an advisor who receives a fee of $250,000 or more, or transactions that include a tax indemnity. Rev. Proc. 2003-25 further held that the
purchase of life insurance policies by a business does not, by itself, constitute a reportable transaction.    Depending on the circumstances, the exchange of a Policy, a Policy loan, or a change in ownership or an assignment of the Policy may have federal income tax consequences.
In addition, federal, state and local transfer, estate, inheritance, and other tax consequences of Policy ownership, premium payments and receipt of Policy proceeds depend on the circumstances of each Policy Owner or beneficiary. If you contemplate
any such transaction you should consult a qualified tax adviser.

Northwestern Mutual
Under attack
Companies have a new form of analyst to reckon with

NORTHWESTERN MUTUAL has an enviable reputation for selling life insurance to the rich, and also a top-flight rating for claims-paying ability from all three of the big rating agencies, A.M. Best, Standard & Poor's and Moody's. A fourth, smaller rating agency, Weiss, ranks it one step down from the top, but that still means “excellent” and puts Northwestern among the top 14 of 1,100 companies. Northwestern's annual report is light on financial information but it suggests that the company has both consistent revenues and decent investment returns. 
This, according to Richard Johns, is a mirage. Mr Johns, a present and former policyholder, runs a small organisation, Policyowner Protection Services, that is devoted to scrutinising one company: Northwestern Mutual. The bulk of its efforts appear on a website (www.nmlcomplaints.com) and can be split into four rough categories: management is rotten; the company's financial condition is becoming rotten; its insurance products will leave customers feeling rotten; and finally, top agents are heading for the door, either because their activities have triggered probes, or because they could no longer bear the rotten culture.
Harsh stuff—and it has not gone unnoticed. Moody's and Standard & Poor's both say they have had conversations with Northwestern about the allegations and concluded there was no cause to adjust their ratings. Joe Belth, author of an insurance newsletter in Indiana, has found that some of the letters on the site are written under pseudonyms (Mr Johns says they were agents or former agents under cover). Other entries were taken out of context. Information on the site, he says, should not be taken seriously.

Yet can it also be ignored? Mr Johns and his sources are hard to dismiss entirely. The website alleges that Northwestern is under investigation by the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD) for inappropriate sales tactics. Northwestern acknowledges it is being looked at by the NASD, but claims this is only because there is an industry-wide investigation into one of its products, variable whole life insurance. There is a second issue over the late reporting of customer complaints, which may result in a small fine, it adds.
One could argue that the consumer of any insurance product would be better-educated after wading through Mr Johns's site. Mr Johns was an early critic of variable whole life, a popular hybrid of a mutual fund and insurance. A related product, the variable annuity, was cited by the NASD this week when announcing the censure of one firm and civil charges against people at three others (none of them at Northwestern). 
Over the past decade, Northwestern's record has stood up well within the life-insurance industry, but it has not been beyond reproach. The nmlcomplaints.com site has a vast library of litigation, as well as a note that Northwestern agents will pay an additional 11% this year for errors and omissions insurance, because of the cost of settling several large claims (Northwestern says the real number is 9%, including the cost of successful defences). Mr Johns's own crusade began five years ago when, he contends, he received a poor settlement for a mis-sold product.
Northwestern contends that the site is a hunting-ground for lawyers seeking clients. Its response, says Mr Belth, has been not to call attention to it. Why does the company not respond or sue? Northwestern says there are huge obstacles to effective use of the law to stop commentary on the internet. No doubt competitors are watching closely. In today's world of angry customers and growing scrutiny what company does not face a similar risk?
