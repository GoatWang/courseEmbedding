Tronc, Inc. (stylized as tronc; formerly Tribune Publishing) is an American newspaper print and online media publishing company based in Chicago, Illinois. Among other publications, the company's portfolio includes the Chicago Tribune, the Los Angeles Times, the Orlando Sentinel, South Florida's Sun-Sentinel, The Baltimore Sun, Allentown, Pennsylvania's The Morning Call, the Hartford Courant, and The San Diego Union-Tribune. It also publishes several local newspapers in these metropolitan regions, which are organized in subsidiary groups. It is the nation's third-largest newspaper publisher (behind Gannett and The McClatchy Company), with ten daily newspapers and commuter tabloids located throughout the United States.
Originally incorporated in 1847 with the founding of the Chicago Tribune, Tribune Publishing formerly operated as a division of the Tribune Company, a Chicago-based multimedia conglomerate, until it was spun off into a separate public company in August 2014.
On June 20, 2016, the company adopted the name tronc, short for "Tribune online content".[2]

History[edit]

Early history[edit]
Tronc's history dates back to 1847; when the Chicago Tribune (for which the company and its former parent, Tribune Media, are named) published its first edition on June 10 of that year, in a one-room plant located at LaSalle and Lake Streets in Chicago.[3] The Tribune constructed its first building, a four-story structure at Dearborn Street (Chicago)|Dearborn and Madison Streets, in 1869; however the building was destroyed, along with most of the city, by the Great Chicago Fire in October 1871. The Tribune resumed printing two days later with an editorial declaring "Chicago Shall Rise Again". The newspaper's editor and part-owner, Joseph Medill, was elected mayor and led the city's reconstruction. A native Ohioan who first acquired an interest in the Tribune in 1855, Medill gained full control of the newspaper in 1874 and ran it until his death in 1899.
Medill's two grandsons, cousins Robert R. McCormick and Joseph Medill Patterson, assumed leadership of the company in 1911. That same year, the Chicago Tribune's first newsprint mill opened in Thorold, Ontario, Canada. The mill marked the beginnings of the Canadian newsprint producer later known as QUNO, in which Tribune held an investment interest until 1995. The Chicago Tribune-New York News Syndicate was formed in 1918, leading to Joseph Patterson's establishment of the company's second newspaper, the New York Daily News on June 26, 1919. Tribune's ownership of the New York City tabloid was considered "interlocking" due to an agreement between McCormick and Patterson.
Growth and acquisitions[edit]
The company acquired the Fort Lauderdale-based Sun-Sentinel newspaper in 1963; this was later followed by its purchase of the Orlando Sentinel in 1965. In 1973, the company began sharing stories among 25 subscriber newspapers via the newly formed news service, the Knight News Wire. By 1990, this service was known as Knight-Ridder/Tribune and provided graphics, photo and news content to its member newspapers. KRT became McClatchy-Tribune Information Services, which is jointly owned by the Tribune Company and McClatchy, when The McClatchy Company purchased Knight-Ridder Inc. in 2006.[4] Tribune later acquired the Newport News, Virginia-based Daily Press in 1986. In the wake of a dispute with some of its labor unions, the New York Daily News was sold to British businessman Robert Maxwell in 1991.[3]
In June 2000, Tribune acquired the Los Angeles-based Times Mirror Company in a merger deal worth $8.3 billion, which was the largest acquisition in the history of the newspaper industry.[5] The merger added seven daily newspapers to Tribune's portfolio, including the Los Angeles Times, the Long Island-based Newsday, The Baltimore Sun and the Hartford Courant. Tribune Media Net, the national advertising sales organization of Tribune Publishing, was established in 2000 to take advantage of the company's expanded scale and scope.
Later in the decade, Tribune launched daily newspapers targeting urban commuters, including the Chicago Tribune's RedEye edition in 2002, followed by an investment in AM New York one year later. In 2006, Tribune acquired the minority equity interest in AM New York, giving it full ownership of the newspaper. The company sold both Newsday and AM New York to Cablevision Systems Corporation in 2008, with the sale of the latter paper closing on July 29 of that year.[6]
Takeover by Sam Zell and bankruptcy[edit]
On April 2, 2007, Chicago-based investor Sam Zell announced plans to buy out the Tribune Company for $34.00 a share, totaling $8.2 billion,[7] with intentions to take the company private. The deal was approved by 97% of the company's shareholders on August 21, 2007.[8] Privatization of the Tribune Company occurred on December 20, 2007 with Tribune's stock listing being terminated at the close of the trading day.[9]
On December 8, 2008, faced with a high debt load totaling $13 billion, related to the company's leveraged buyout and subsequent privatization, and a sharp downturn in newspaper advertising revenue, Tribune filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in what was the largest bankruptcy in the history of the American media industry.[7][10] Company plans originally called for it to emerge from bankruptcy by May 31, 2010,[11] but the company would end up in protracted bankruptcy proceedings for four years.
On July 13, 2012, the Tribune Company received approval of a reorganization plan to allow the company to emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in a Delaware bankruptcy court. Oaktree Capital Management, JPMorgan Chase and Angelo, Gordon & Co., which were the company's senior debt holders, assumed control of Tribune's properties upon the company's exit from bankruptcy on December 31, 2012.[12][13]
Spin-off of publishing unit[edit]
On February 26, 2013, Tribune reportedly hired investment firms Evercore Partners and J.P. Morgan & Co. to oversee the sale of its newspapers.[14] On July 10, 2013, Tribune announced that it would split into two companies, spinning off its publishing division into the Tribune Publishing Company. Its broadcasting, digital media and other assets (including Tribune Media Services, which among others, provides news and features content for Tribune's newspapers) would remain with the Tribune Company.[15] On November 20, 2013, Tribune announced it would cut 700 jobs from its newspaper properties due to declining advertising revenues.[16]
On June 17, 2014, in a presentation for lenders, Tribune revealed that it had set August 4 as the target date for its spin-off of Tribune Publishing.[17][18][19] The split was finalized on the target date, with the publishing arm being spun out as Tribune Publishing Company, and its former parent company being renamed Tribune Media.[20][21][22]
Post spin-off[edit]
Tribune Publishing acquired 6 suburban daily and 32 weekly newspapers in the Chicago Metropolitan Area in October 2014. These acquisitions were similar in strategy to earlier acquisitions in the state of Maryland, expanding its footprint in its eight "core markets."[23]
On May 7, 2015, Tribune Publishing announced that it had reached a deal to acquire the San Diego Union-Tribune and its associated properties for $85 million, ending the paper's 146 years of private ownership. Following the completion of the acquisition, the Union-Tribune and the Los Angeles Times became part of a new operating entity known as the California News Group, led by current Times publisher and CEO Timothy E. Ryan. The two papers will retain distinct operations, but there will be a larger amount of synergy and content sharing between them. The acquisition did not include the paper's headquarters, which remains owned by the paper's previous owner, Doug Manchester.[24][25]
In April 2016, Gannett Company (which, much like Tribune, had spun out its broadcasting properties into a separate firm to focus on publishing assets) made an unsolicited bid to acquire Tribune Publishing for $12.25 per-share, or around $400 million. This deal was rejected by Tribune's shareholders in May 2016; in turn, Gannett increased its offer to around $15 per-share (around $800 million). On May 17, 2016, Tribune CEO Michael Ferro stated that he intended to make a bid to acquire Gannett instead.[26][27][28]
On November 1, 2016, Gannett announced that it would no longer pursue its acquisition of Tronc.[29]
Tronc era[edit]
On June 2, 2016, the company announced that it would rebrand itself as tronc, short for "Tribune online content".[2] The rebranding took place on June 20, 2016. Tronc began trading on NASDAQ under the symbol TRNC.[30]
That day, chief technology officer Malcolm CasSelle and chief digital officer Anne Vasquez announced to employees initiatives in content optimization, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and increasing the amount of video to 50% of all content by 2017, in an effort to increase reader engagement and ad revenue.[31] The company also introduced a new slogan, From Pixels to Pulitzers. The video announcement was widely derided in social and print media as full of buzzwords and lacking content.[32][33][34]On August 7, 2016, while criticising several aspects of a corporate restructuring that went along with the rebranding (for instance a shift of focus away from hard news towards usage maximization, which he perceived as undue), satirist John Oliver mocked this new name as "the sound an ejaculating elephant makes", and (ironically) "the sound of a stack of newspapers hitting a dumpster."[35]
On March 13, 2017, Tronc announced that it would be the first third party to license Arc, the digital publishing system of The Washington Post. [36]

Tribune Publishing will be born in a punishing print environment, but it will start off with $350 million in debt, of which $275 million will pay a one-time cash dividend to Tribune’s shareholders. That falls far short of the enviable $2 billion cash cushion Rupert Murdoch’s News Corporation gave its print division last year, but far better than the $1.3 billion in debt that Time Inc. started with when it was spun off in June.

Turns out, not so much — quite the opposite, really. The Washington Post seems fine, but recently, in just over a week, three of the biggest players in American newspapers — Gannett, Tribune Company and E. W. Scripps, companies built on print franchises that expanded into television — dumped those properties like yesterday’s news in a series of spinoffs.

Tronc, Inc. (stylized as tronc; formerly Tribune Publishing) is an American newspaper print and online media publishing company based in Chicago, Illinois. Among other publications, the company's portfolio includes the Chicago Tribune, the Los Angeles Times, the Orlando Sentinel, South Florida's Sun-Sentinel, The Baltimore Sun, Allentown, Pennsylvania's The Morning Call, the Hartford Courant, and The San Diego Union-Tribune. It also publishes several local newspapers in these metropolitan regions, which are organized in subsidiary groups. It is the nation's third-largest newspaper publisher (behind Gannett and The McClatchy Company), with ten daily newspapers and commuter tabloids located throughout the United States.
Originally incorporated in 1847 with the founding of the Chicago Tribune, Tribune Publishing formerly operated as a division of the Tribune Company, a Chicago-based multimedia conglomerate, until it was spun off into a separate public company in August 2014.
On June 20, 2016, the company adopted the name tronc, short for "Tribune online content".[2]

Early history[edit]
Tronc's history dates back to 1847; when the Chicago Tribune (for which the company and its former parent, Tribune Media, are named) published its first edition on June 10 of that year, in a one-room plant located at LaSalle and Lake Streets in Chicago.[3] The Tribune constructed its first building, a four-story structure at Dearborn Street (Chicago)|Dearborn and Madison Streets, in 1869; however the building was destroyed, along with most of the city, by the Great Chicago Fire in October 1871. The Tribune resumed printing two days later with an editorial declaring "Chicago Shall Rise Again". The newspaper's editor and part-owner, Joseph Medill, was elected mayor and led the city's reconstruction. A native Ohioan who first acquired an interest in the Tribune in 1855, Medill gained full control of the newspaper in 1874 and ran it until his death in 1899.
Medill's two grandsons, cousins Robert R. McCormick and Joseph Medill Patterson, assumed leadership of the company in 1911. That same year, the Chicago Tribune's first newsprint mill opened in Thorold, Ontario, Canada. The mill marked the beginnings of the Canadian newsprint producer later known as QUNO, in which Tribune held an investment interest until 1995. The Chicago Tribune-New York News Syndicate was formed in 1918, leading to Joseph Patterson's establishment of the company's second newspaper, the New York Daily News on June 26, 1919. Tribune's ownership of the New York City tabloid was considered "interlocking" due to an agreement between McCormick and Patterson.
Growth and acquisitions[edit]
The company acquired the Fort Lauderdale-based Sun-Sentinel newspaper in 1963; this was later followed by its purchase of the Orlando Sentinel in 1965. In 1973, the company began sharing stories among 25 subscriber newspapers via the newly formed news service, the Knight News Wire. By 1990, this service was known as Knight-Ridder/Tribune and provided graphics, photo and news content to its member newspapers. KRT became McClatchy-Tribune Information Services, which is jointly owned by the Tribune Company and McClatchy, when The McClatchy Company purchased Knight-Ridder Inc. in 2006.[4] Tribune later acquired the Newport News, Virginia-based Daily Press in 1986. In the wake of a dispute with some of its labor unions, the New York Daily News was sold to British businessman Robert Maxwell in 1991.[3]
In June 2000, Tribune acquired the Los Angeles-based Times Mirror Company in a merger deal worth $8.3 billion, which was the largest acquisition in the history of the newspaper industry.[5] The merger added seven daily newspapers to Tribune's portfolio, including the Los Angeles Times, the Long Island-based Newsday, The Baltimore Sun and the Hartford Courant. Tribune Media Net, the national advertising sales organization of Tribune Publishing, was established in 2000 to take advantage of the company's expanded scale and scope.
Later in the decade, Tribune launched daily newspapers targeting urban commuters, including the Chicago Tribune's RedEye edition in 2002, followed by an investment in AM New York one year later. In 2006, Tribune acquired the minority equity interest in AM New York, giving it full ownership of the newspaper. The company sold both Newsday and AM New York to Cablevision Systems Corporation in 2008, with the sale of the latter paper closing on July 29 of that year.[6]
Takeover by Sam Zell and bankruptcy[edit]
On April 2, 2007, Chicago-based investor Sam Zell announced plans to buy out the Tribune Company for $34.00 a share, totaling $8.2 billion,[7] with intentions to take the company private. The deal was approved by 97% of the company's shareholders on August 21, 2007.[8] Privatization of the Tribune Company occurred on December 20, 2007 with Tribune's stock listing being terminated at the close of the trading day.[9]
On December 8, 2008, faced with a high debt load totaling $13 billion, related to the company's leveraged buyout and subsequent privatization, and a sharp downturn in newspaper advertising revenue, Tribune filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in what was the largest bankruptcy in the history of the American media industry.[7][10] Company plans originally called for it to emerge from bankruptcy by May 31, 2010,[11] but the company would end up in protracted bankruptcy proceedings for four years.
On July 13, 2012, the Tribune Company received approval of a reorganization plan to allow the company to emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in a Delaware bankruptcy court. Oaktree Capital Management, JPMorgan Chase and Angelo, Gordon & Co., which were the company's senior debt holders, assumed control of Tribune's properties upon the company's exit from bankruptcy on December 31, 2012.[12][13]
Spin-off of publishing unit[edit]
On February 26, 2013, Tribune reportedly hired investment firms Evercore Partners and J.P. Morgan & Co. to oversee the sale of its newspapers.[14] On July 10, 2013, Tribune announced that it would split into two companies, spinning off its publishing division into the Tribune Publishing Company. Its broadcasting, digital media and other assets (including Tribune Media Services, which among others, provides news and features content for Tribune's newspapers) would remain with the Tribune Company.[15] On November 20, 2013, Tribune announced it would cut 700 jobs from its newspaper properties due to declining advertising revenues.[16]
On June 17, 2014, in a presentation for lenders, Tribune revealed that it had set August 4 as the target date for its spin-off of Tribune Publishing.[17][18][19] The split was finalized on the target date, with the publishing arm being spun out as Tribune Publishing Company, and its former parent company being renamed Tribune Media.[20][21][22]
Post spin-off[edit]
Tribune Publishing acquired 6 suburban daily and 32 weekly newspapers in the Chicago Metropolitan Area in October 2014. These acquisitions were similar in strategy to earlier acquisitions in the state of Maryland, expanding its footprint in its eight "core markets."[23]
On May 7, 2015, Tribune Publishing announced that it had reached a deal to acquire the San Diego Union-Tribune and its associated properties for $85 million, ending the paper's 146 years of private ownership. Following the completion of the acquisition, the Union-Tribune and the Los Angeles Times became part of a new operating entity known as the California News Group, led by current Times publisher and CEO Timothy E. Ryan. The two papers will retain distinct operations, but there will be a larger amount of synergy and content sharing between them. The acquisition did not include the paper's headquarters, which remains owned by the paper's previous owner, Doug Manchester.[24][25]
In April 2016, Gannett Company (which, much like Tribune, had spun out its broadcasting properties into a separate firm to focus on publishing assets) made an unsolicited bid to acquire Tribune Publishing for $12.25 per-share, or around $400 million. This deal was rejected by Tribune's shareholders in May 2016; in turn, Gannett increased its offer to around $15 per-share (around $800 million). On May 17, 2016, Tribune CEO Michael Ferro stated that he intended to make a bid to acquire Gannett instead.[26][27][28]
On November 1, 2016, Gannett announced that it would no longer pursue its acquisition of Tronc.[29]

On June 2, 2016, the company announced that it would rebrand itself as tronc, short for "Tribune online content".[2] The rebranding took place on June 20, 2016. Tronc began trading on NASDAQ under the symbol TRNC.[30]
That day, chief technology officer Malcolm CasSelle and chief digital officer Anne Vasquez announced to employees initiatives in content optimization, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and increasing the amount of video to 50% of all content by 2017, in an effort to increase reader engagement and ad revenue.[31] The company also introduced a new slogan, From Pixels to Pulitzers. The video announcement was widely derided in social and print media as full of buzzwords and lacking content.[32][33][34]On August 7, 2016, while criticising several aspects of a corporate restructuring that went along with the rebranding (for instance a shift of focus away from hard news towards usage maximization, which he perceived as undue), satirist John Oliver mocked this new name as "the sound an ejaculating elephant makes", and (ironically) "the sound of a stack of newspapers hitting a dumpster."[35]
On March 13, 2017, Tronc announced that it would be the first third party to license Arc, the digital publishing system of The Washington Post. [36]

 About Us - tronc, Inc. 

























About Us
What do we do?
We draw content from our vast media portfolio, where the search for truth
and dedication to our communities have earned 94 Pulitzers and a monthly
audience of 60+ million. We maintain the highest values of
journalism while merging that content with an arsenal of digital tools. With
them, we can exponentially enhance visual storytelling, catapult our ability
to track and engage our audience and offer world-class journalism with a
cutting-edge delivery system.
How are we different?
No other media company can match the power of our brands and the
power of our technology. No other media company surpasses the brilliance
of our content and the brilliance of a digital delivery system that makes
content easier to consume across every platform. No other media brand is
so intellectually distinguished and radically distinct at the same time. And
the journey is only beginning.
Why do we exist?
To transform journalism, offering the world a new model of media
companies. Where ingenious technology allows a storied portfolio of
storytelling to be pooled, personalized and presented to every person on
Earth at the speed of light. We are on a mission to scrupulously maintain
the integrity and values of each journalistic brand while enhancing our
ability to share and visualize our content.
What problem are we trying to solve?
In a media landscape ravaged by disruption, journalism retains its depth,
credibility and trust, but has been slow to mobilize the full thrust of cuttingedge
digital management tools. Digitally native enterprises, on the other
hand, can harness such tools but can’t offer the substance of traditional
journalism. So far, no one has cracked the code on how to merge the two
worlds.

Tronc, Inc. (stylized as tronc; formerly Tribune Publishing) is an American newspaper print and online media publishing company based in Chicago, Illinois. Among other publications, the company's portfolio includes the Chicago Tribune, the Los Angeles Times, the Orlando Sentinel, South Florida's Sun-Sentinel, The Baltimore Sun, Allentown, Pennsylvania's The Morning Call, the Hartford Courant, and The San Diego Union-Tribune. It also publishes several local newspapers in these metropolitan regions, which are organized in subsidiary groups. It is the nation's third-largest newspaper publisher (behind Gannett and The McClatchy Company), with ten daily newspapers and commuter tabloids located throughout the United States.
Originally incorporated in 1847 with the founding of the Chicago Tribune, Tribune Publishing formerly operated as a division of the Tribune Company, a Chicago-based multimedia conglomerate, until it was spun off into a separate public company in August 2014.
On June 20, 2016, the company adopted the name tronc, short for "Tribune online content".[2]

History[edit]





This section needs additional citations for verification. Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (August 2014) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)


Early history[edit]
Tronc's history dates back to 1847; when the Chicago Tribune (for which the company and its former parent, Tribune Media, are named) published its first edition on June 10 of that year, in a one-room plant located at LaSalle and Lake Streets in Chicago.[3] The Tribune constructed its first building, a four-story structure at Dearborn Street (Chicago)|Dearborn and Madison Streets, in 1869; however the building was destroyed, along with most of the city, by the Great Chicago Fire in October 1871. The Tribune resumed printing two days later with an editorial declaring "Chicago Shall Rise Again". The newspaper's editor and part-owner, Joseph Medill, was elected mayor and led the city's reconstruction. A native Ohioan who first acquired an interest in the Tribune in 1855, Medill gained full control of the newspaper in 1874 and ran it until his death in 1899.
Medill's two grandsons, cousins Robert R. McCormick and Joseph Medill Patterson, assumed leadership of the company in 1911. That same year, the Chicago Tribune's first newsprint mill opened in Thorold, Ontario, Canada. The mill marked the beginnings of the Canadian newsprint producer later known as QUNO, in which Tribune held an investment interest until 1995. The Chicago Tribune-New York News Syndicate was formed in 1918, leading to Joseph Patterson's establishment of the company's second newspaper, the New York Daily News on June 26, 1919. Tribune's ownership of the New York City tabloid was considered "interlocking" due to an agreement between McCormick and Patterson.
Growth and acquisitions[edit]
The company acquired the Fort Lauderdale-based Sun-Sentinel newspaper in 1963; this was later followed by its purchase of the Orlando Sentinel in 1965. In 1973, the company began sharing stories among 25 subscriber newspapers via the newly formed news service, the Knight News Wire. By 1990, this service was known as Knight-Ridder/Tribune and provided graphics, photo and news content to its member newspapers. KRT became McClatchy-Tribune Information Services, which is jointly owned by the Tribune Company and McClatchy, when The McClatchy Company purchased Knight-Ridder Inc. in 2006.[4] Tribune later acquired the Newport News, Virginia-based Daily Press in 1986. In the wake of a dispute with some of its labor unions, the New York Daily News was sold to British businessman Robert Maxwell in 1991.[3]
In June 2000, Tribune acquired the Los Angeles-based Times Mirror Company in a merger deal worth $8.3 billion, which was the largest acquisition in the history of the newspaper industry.[5] The merger added seven daily newspapers to Tribune's portfolio, including the Los Angeles Times, the Long Island-based Newsday, The Baltimore Sun and the Hartford Courant. Tribune Media Net, the national advertising sales organization of Tribune Publishing, was established in 2000 to take advantage of the company's expanded scale and scope.
Later in the decade, Tribune launched daily newspapers targeting urban commuters, including the Chicago Tribune's RedEye edition in 2002, followed by an investment in AM New York one year later. In 2006, Tribune acquired the minority equity interest in AM New York, giving it full ownership of the newspaper. The company sold both Newsday and AM New York to Cablevision Systems Corporation in 2008, with the sale of the latter paper closing on July 29 of that year.[6]
Takeover by Sam Zell and bankruptcy[edit]
On April 2, 2007, Chicago-based investor Sam Zell announced plans to buy out the Tribune Company for $34.00 a share, totaling $8.2 billion,[7] with intentions to take the company private. The deal was approved by 97% of the company's shareholders on August 21, 2007.[8] Privatization of the Tribune Company occurred on December 20, 2007 with Tribune's stock listing being terminated at the close of the trading day.[9]
On December 8, 2008, faced with a high debt load totaling $13 billion, related to the company's leveraged buyout and subsequent privatization, and a sharp downturn in newspaper advertising revenue, Tribune filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in what was the largest bankruptcy in the history of the American media industry.[7][10] Company plans originally called for it to emerge from bankruptcy by May 31, 2010,[11] but the company would end up in protracted bankruptcy proceedings for four years.
On July 13, 2012, the Tribune Company received approval of a reorganization plan to allow the company to emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in a Delaware bankruptcy court. Oaktree Capital Management, JPMorgan Chase and Angelo, Gordon & Co., which were the company's senior debt holders, assumed control of Tribune's properties upon the company's exit from bankruptcy on December 31, 2012.[12][13]
Spin-off of publishing unit[edit]
On February 26, 2013, Tribune reportedly hired investment firms Evercore Partners and J.P. Morgan & Co. to oversee the sale of its newspapers.[14] On July 10, 2013, Tribune announced that it would split into two companies, spinning off its publishing division into the Tribune Publishing Company. Its broadcasting, digital media and other assets (including Tribune Media Services, which among others, provides news and features content for Tribune's newspapers) would remain with the Tribune Company.[15] On November 20, 2013, Tribune announced it would cut 700 jobs from its newspaper properties due to declining advertising revenues.[16]
On June 17, 2014, in a presentation for lenders, Tribune revealed that it had set August 4 as the target date for its spin-off of Tribune Publishing.[17][18][19] The split was finalized on the target date, with the publishing arm being spun out as Tribune Publishing Company, and its former parent company being renamed Tribune Media.[20][21][22]
Post spin-off[edit]
Tribune Publishing acquired 6 suburban daily and 32 weekly newspapers in the Chicago Metropolitan Area in October 2014. These acquisitions were similar in strategy to earlier acquisitions in the state of Maryland, expanding its footprint in its eight "core markets."[23]
On May 7, 2015, Tribune Publishing announced that it had reached a deal to acquire the San Diego Union-Tribune and its associated properties for $85 million, ending the paper's 146 years of private ownership. Following the completion of the acquisition, the Union-Tribune and the Los Angeles Times became part of a new operating entity known as the California News Group, led by current Times publisher and CEO Timothy E. Ryan. The two papers will retain distinct operations, but there will be a larger amount of synergy and content sharing between them. The acquisition did not include the paper's headquarters, which remains owned by the paper's previous owner, Doug Manchester.[24][25]
In April 2016, Gannett Company (which, much like Tribune, had spun out its broadcasting properties into a separate firm to focus on publishing assets) made an unsolicited bid to acquire Tribune Publishing for $12.25 per-share, or around $400 million. This deal was rejected by Tribune's shareholders in May 2016; in turn, Gannett increased its offer to around $15 per-share (around $800 million). On May 17, 2016, Tribune CEO Michael Ferro stated that he intended to make a bid to acquire Gannett instead.[26][27][28]
On November 1, 2016, Gannett announced that it would no longer pursue its acquisition of Tronc.[29]
Tronc era[edit]
On June 2, 2016, the company announced that it would rebrand itself as tronc, short for "Tribune online content".[2] The rebranding took place on June 20, 2016. Tronc began trading on NASDAQ under the symbol TRNC.[30]
That day, chief technology officer Malcolm CasSelle and chief digital officer Anne Vasquez announced to employees initiatives in content optimization, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and increasing the amount of video to 50% of all content by 2017, in an effort to increase reader engagement and ad revenue.[31] The company also introduced a new slogan, From Pixels to Pulitzers. The video announcement was widely derided in social and print media as full of buzzwords and lacking content.[32][33][34]On August 7, 2016, while criticising several aspects of a corporate restructuring that went along with the rebranding (for instance a shift of focus away from hard news towards usage maximization, which he perceived as undue), satirist John Oliver mocked this new name as "the sound an ejaculating elephant makes", and (ironically) "the sound of a stack of newspapers hitting a dumpster."[35]
On March 13, 2017, Tronc announced that it would be the first third party to license Arc, the digital publishing system of The Washington Post. [36]

Retrieved 2014-08-11. Tribune Publishing will be born in a punishing print environment, but it will start off with $350 million in debt, of which $275 million will pay a one-time cash dividend to Tribune’s shareholders. That falls far short of the enviable $2 billion cash cushion Rupert Murdoch’s News Corporation gave its print division last year, but far better than the $1.3 billion in debt that Time Inc. started with when it was spun off in June.

Turns out, not so much — quite the opposite, really. The Washington Post seems fine, but recently, in just over a week, three of the biggest players in American newspapers — Gannett, Tribune Company and E. W. Scripps, companies built on print franchises that expanded into television — dumped those properties like yesterday’s news in a series of spinoffs.

Tribune Publishing Just Changed Its Name to ‘tronc’
New moniker is meant to stand for Tribune Online Content and evoke the company’s effort to ‘pool’ technology and content resources

 















Tribune Publishing’s new name tronc functions as an acronym of sorts for Tribune Online Content. The chairman has also said the phrase is a British term for the box in which tips are collected at a restaurant and are later doled out to staff, an analogy for how tronc will pool technology and content resources.

Tribune Publishing
 Co.

      , the 150-year-old brand that owns the Los Angeles Times and Chicago Tribune newspapers, is changing its name to tronc Inc. in a nod to the publisher’s transformation into a more digitally focused company. The new moniker, announced on Thursday, functions as an acronym of sorts for Tribune Online Content. The business is being described as “a content curation and monetization company focused on creating and distributing premium, verified content across all channels.” It’s just the latest shake-up under 



      Michael W. Ferro, Jr.



      , who bought a stake in the company and became chairman in February. He has since unveiled a new digital-first strategy, brought on new investors and board members and rebuffed a takeover offer from 





            Gannett
 Co.

        GCI -0.43%


       that carried a 99% premium.  Mr. Ferro first revealed the name tronc last month on an earnings call with analysts when he used it to describe the new digital platform he was building that would use artificial intelligence and “machine vision” technology to revolutionize how information reaches readers. At the time, he said the phrase was a British term for the box in which tips are collected at a restaurant and are later doled out to staff. According to some dictionaries, “tronc master” refers to the person who distributes those pooled tips at a restaurant or hotel. “Our industry requires an innovative approach and a fundamentally different way of operating,” Mr. Ferro said in a statement. “Our rebranding to tronc represents the manner in which we will pool our technology and content resources to execute on our strategy.” There is a long history of brands, particularly in media, adjusting their names after a split, usually to avoid confusion with the sister company. But Tribune Publishing has carried the same branding since it was spun off in 2014 from broadcast holdings that became Tribune Media. When Gannett separated, the digital and broadcast division changed its name to TEGNA, which it said was a nod to Gannett’s more than 100-year history—presumably because Tegna included the same letters as Gannett. And after 





            News Corp
.

      , the owner of The Wall Street Journal, split in two, the television and film side of the business took the name 





            21st Century Fox
.

       The nomenclature change led to frequent mix-ups at the studio, which is still called 20th Century Fox, a century behind its parent company. 
Time Warner
            

       Cable famously went the other route, licensing the “Time Warner” name ever since its 2009 spinoff from Time Warner Inc. That led to mass confusion over the years, with Time Warner Inc. CEO 



      Jeff Bewkes



       frequently getting missives from angry cable customers targeting the wrong company and protesters showing up at the wrong offices. That headache is soon fading away as the Time Warner Cable name is phased out after its sale to 





            Charter Communications
.
 One of the more famous head-scratcher rebrandings in recent years was Kraft Foods, which changed its name to 





            Mondelēz International
 Inc.

       (pronounced mohn-dah-LEEZ) in 2012. It was meant to evoke the idea of a “delicious world.” “Monde” comes from the Latin word for “world,” and “delēz” is a “fanciful expression of ‘delicious,’” Kraft executives explained at the time. In some places like Russia, however, the name elicited a level of embarrassment as it sounded very close to a very dirty Russian slang phrase. The name change to tronc will become effective on June 20, when the company’s stock will cease trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker TPUB and will be moved to the 





            Nasdaq
            

       with the new symbol TRNC.  Write to Lukas I. Alpert at lukas.alpert@wsj.com

If Chicago Tribune and L.A. Times publisher Tronc buys Sun-Times parent, it’s only Step 1

May. 18, 2017 at 2:24 p.m. ET
by Trey Williams









Chicago Tribune and L.A. Times publisher may acquire Chicago Sun-Times parent
Tronc Inc. , the former Tribune Publishing, said late Monday it has entered into a nonbinding letter of intent to buy Wrapports Holdings LLC, the owner of the Chicago Sun-Times and other media assets, which include the Reader, a pioneering alternative weekly, and the Straight Dope syndicated column. The announcement came as Wrapports, at the request of the Justice Department's antitrust division, is set to publish a notice Tuesday of its plan to sell the Sun-Times to a buyer that will continue to publish the paper, Tronc said. If no other bidder comes forward, Tronc will be that buyer, with the acquisition closing as soon as June 1. No value was given for the transaction. Tronc's Chicago Tribune Media Group has been distributing the Sun-Times since 2007, and the parties agreed to have Tribune print the Sun-Times in 2011. In 2014, the Tribune bought the Sun-Times' suburban newspapers. If the deal goes through, the Sun-Times newsroom will continue as an independent newsroom, said Tronc, which also owns the Los Angeles Times, the Orlando Sentinel, the Baltimore Sun and other newspapers. Tronc shares were flat in late trading after ending the regular session up 1%.

Private share buyback weighs on Tronc earnings
The bruising fight between the two largest shareholders at Tronc Inc. is starting to take a toll on the bottom line for the publisher of the Los Angeles Times and Chicago Tribune. The newspaper group said Wednesday that a large private share buyback from an outside investor in March that bolstered the position of Tronc's largest shareholder and nonexecutive chairman, Michael Ferro, resulted in a $3 million net loss for the firm in the first quarter.

If Chicago Tribune and L.A. Times publisher Tronc buys Sun-Times parent, it’s only Step 1

May. 18, 2017 at 2:24 p.m. ET
by Trey Williams









Chicago Tribune and L.A. Times publisher may acquire Chicago Sun-Times parent
Tronc Inc. , the former Tribune Publishing, said late Monday it has entered into a nonbinding letter of intent to buy Wrapports Holdings LLC, the owner of the Chicago Sun-Times and other media assets, which include the Reader, a pioneering alternative weekly, and the Straight Dope syndicated column. The announcement came as Wrapports, at the request of the Justice Department's antitrust division, is set to publish a notice Tuesday of its plan to sell the Sun-Times to a buyer that will continue to publish the paper, Tronc said. If no other bidder comes forward, Tronc will be that buyer, with the acquisition closing as soon as June 1. No value was given for the transaction. Tronc's Chicago Tribune Media Group has been distributing the Sun-Times since 2007, and the parties agreed to have Tribune print the Sun-Times in 2011. In 2014, the Tribune bought the Sun-Times' suburban newspapers. If the deal goes through, the Sun-Times newsroom will continue as an independent newsroom, said Tronc, which also owns the Los Angeles Times, the Orlando Sentinel, the Baltimore Sun and other newspapers. Tronc shares were flat in late trading after ending the regular session up 1%.

Private share buyback weighs on Tronc earnings
The bruising fight between the two largest shareholders at Tronc Inc. is starting to take a toll on the bottom line for the publisher of the Los Angeles Times and Chicago Tribune. The newspaper group said Wednesday that a large private share buyback from an outside investor in March that bolstered the position of Tronc's largest shareholder and nonexecutive chairman, Michael Ferro, resulted in a $3 million net loss for the firm in the first quarter.
