Serving as executive vice president and Chief Marketing Officer, Kevin Doohan oversees all marketing functions at DTS Inc., the premier audio solutions provider for high-definition entertainment experiences.
In his role as CMO, Doohan manages brand and consumer marketing, product marketing, partner marketing, advertising and media, artist relations, public relations and corporate communications.
Prior to joining DTS, Doohan was the executive vice president of marketing at Machinima, a leading video entertainment network. Doohan’s team led the evolution of the company from an entertainment brand to a lifestyle brand with gaming at its core, and delivered millions of views to key series like HALO 4: Forward Unto Dawn and Mortal Kombat Legacy.
From 2008 to 2012, Doohan was head of digital marketing at Red Bull. Under Doohan’s leadership, Red Bull experienced explosive growth across digital channels, building engaged audiences on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. Doohan’s team also was responsible for launching Red Bull’s gaming events, attracting millions of viewers online and thousands to watch live in-person.
Before leading Red Bull’s digital team, Doohan oversaw all digital marketing at ConAgra Foods, including the corporate brand and consumer brands Healthy Choice, Butterball, Orville Redenbacher’s, Hunts, and Slim Jim. Earlier in his career, Doohan held senior marketing roles at Digital Insight (now an Intuit company) and at Cendant Corporation.
Doohan earned an MBA at Northeastern University and is a dual citizen of the US and Ireland.

What mobile device can you not live without?
My iPhone.
Can we take a peek at your phone’s home screen?

Which app do you use most often for work?
Email.
What social media network or website do you frequent most when you’re not working?
Twitter, I use it equally for work, news and fun.
What’s the first thing you check on your phone in the morning?
I log my sleep on my Fitbit One.
Take me through your typical workday.
There’s no such thing as a typical workday for me.
What has been the most exciting work development during the past year?
Joining DTS – incredible technology and solutions and a crazy smart team. We are “where the puck is going.”
How many miles have you traveled in the last 12 months?
I’ve traveled 75,000 miles in past year.
The most interesting place is probably my many trips to Fuschl Am See, Austria when I was a marketing leader at Red Bull.
What work challenge keeps you up at night?
Nothing – I’m very good at separating what I can control from what I can’t. Speed is a constant opportunity: how can we go faster?
Can you tell us about a campaign or work project you’d like to do over?
I don’t have regrets. You learn lessons through every experience and they’re immensely valuable.
Tell me about the people who have been most influential in your career.
Too many important mentors to single one or more out. I’m fortunate to have had them.
What traits does a person need to succeed in your position?
Curiosity above all. Creativity, ambition, and emotional intelligence all matter also.
Can you tell us something about yourself that your team would be surprised to know?
Not sure I could surprise my team. I have over 100 pairs of Nikes, that’s surprising to many.
Why did you go into marketing?
I always loved marketing. My Dad gave me Positioning: The Battle For Your Mind when I was twelve.
What other career would you like to try and why?
I love what I do – wouldn’t want anything else.
What does your desk look like?
Here’s a picture of my office, my fave thing in there is a big whiteboard. Many problems are solved there.

What’s the last business book you read?
The First 90 Days by Michael Watkins. I read it every time I change roles.
Outside of your company’s efforts, what ad campaign or video caught your eye recently?
I loved the Pharrell “24 hours of Happy” video.
Also, the Honey Maid response to the negative feedback they received for their #ThisIsWholesome campaign was fantastic:

Kevin Doohan is a marketing professional with a proven ability to reach customers and call them to action. Doohan has nine years of internet specific marketing experience at leading companies including Cendant Corporation, Homestore.com, Digital Insight and ConAgra Foods. Doohan is currently employed as Director, Web Services on the Corporate Marketing Services team at ConAgra Foods. In this role, he develops and manages internet strategy for corporate- and consumer-facing websites, manages the marketing community on the company’s portal, and directs targeted marketing efforts to the company’s consumer database. iMedia: How has the media mix changed for you over the last few years? Is online still "an afterthought" or are campaigns, for the most part, conceived of in an integrated fashion from the get go? Or are you somewhere in between?  Doohan: Online is becoming more integrated as time goes on. I joined the team in January 2005 to increase focus on our online efforts and to counsel our leading brands and the corporation on how to best integrate online into our marketing mix. iMedia: What was your most successful online or integrated campaign recently and what made it successful?   Doohan: Our most successful campaign was one where we marketed consistently, over time, to a group of customers who subscribed to branded newsletters. Early results and analysis indicate that consumer purchasing behavior did change after they subscribed to and received the product newsletters. What made the promotion successful was the creation and distribution of relevant content, consistently over time, to consumers who had expressed an interest in receiving it. iMedia: What is the greatest benefit of online advertising? The ability to measure? Precisely target? Gather data? Something else?   Doohan: All of these benefits are important but the most immediate benefit of online advertising is the ability to gather data. Learning about what our customers say they want and what they do is critically important to our marketing effort. We can inexpensively and quickly gather information from our online customers. iMedia: What still frustrates you most about online advertising? What can be done to improve the situation?  Doohan: I'm still sometimes frustrated by the lack of focus on ROI in terms of selling product. Image and awareness changes are fantastic but they need to be tied to sales of more product at higher prices to truly grow the business. iMedia: Are you doing any behavioral targeting? If yes, please describe.  Doohan: We do some targeting of newsletter and promotional content to users based on their responses to registration and/or survey questions. We are not currently buying any ads or displaying dynamic content to web users based on their surfing behaviors. iMedia: Are you being affected by any consumer-generated marketing (CGM) -- blogs, user groups, etc.? Are you using any blogs or other social networking tools to market?  Doohan: We're not currently using blogs. We follow some on occasion because bloggers are passionate about their topics and often represent the feelings of groups of passionate users. We have to consider the source carefully and confirm hypotheses with other sources when making assumptions based on blog comments. iMedia: Have you found agencies to be able to handle your changing interactive/integrated needs? What could still be better?  Doohan: We're happy with our agencies to date. Challenges are traditional agency challenges: project management, billing, staff turnover, et cetera. iMedia: Have you done much with wireless, iTV or other emerging mediums?  Doohan: No iMedia: It's the beginning of a new year. What do you hope to accomplish this year?  Doohan: We will continue to refine our ability to measure ROI of online spends based on incremental product sales generated. We will also improve and better integrate our web presence as a whole across our strong stable of brands and our corporate sites. iMedia: What are you reading these days, other than iMediaConnection.com, of course?  Doohan: Last book read: The First 90 Days, Michael Watkins. Current read: The End of Marketing As We Know It, Sergio Zyman. Next up: Purple Cow, Seth Godin.

To say that Kevin Doohan leads digital marketing strategy for Red Bull is to say a lot. We're talking websites, social media, email, mobile, gaming, display, and search advertising -- if you can click on it, he handles it. The internal and external teams Doohan manages are tasked with creating outstanding consumer experiences that connect people around the globe -- experiences as eye-opening and stimulating as the Red Bull brand products themselves. That's no small charge, no matter how you slice it.  Fortunately for Red Bull, Doohan -- who joined the company in December 2008 -- has a demonstrated track record of coordinating multi-faceted, cutting-edge digital efforts. Prior to joining Red Bull, Doohan served as director of interactive marketing at ConAgra Foods, where he led all digital marketing -- from strategy through production -- for more than 30 consumer brands, including Slim Jim, Chef Boyardee, Orville Redenbacher's, Healthy Choice, and many more. Of particular note is Doohan's work on Healthy Choice's innovative "Working Lunch" campaign, a branded entertainment experience that gave more than 3 million consumers the opportunity to interact with live improv comedy sketches online.   Kevin is the perfect interactive marketer. He knows and loves the industry, has tremendous creativity and enthusiasm, and is a great communicator. The first time I saw Kevin he was presenting at a conference -- I knew right away that he was a star."    Crystal Gurin  VP, eMarketer From 1997 to 2004, Doohan held marketing leadership roles at Digital Insight (an Intuit company) and Cendant Corp. At Digital Insight, he launched several first-in-industry consumer marketing programs that drove growth and retention among millions of consumers on Digital Insight's ASP online banking platform. At Cendant, he recruited and led the team that designed Move.com, a leading internet real estate portal.  Beyond his impressive resume, Doohan's reputation as a passionate and dedicated digital marketer is well established among his peers. (Just ask any one of the dozens of professionals who have enthusiastically endorsed him on LinkedIn.) A regular speaker at leading industry conferences in past years, Doohan never hesitates to share his latest insights and visions with the broader industry, be it via Twitter at @kdoohan or his personal blog at KevinDoohan.com.
