Rubicon is the product the company is trying to create. They are working on a non-revenue demo machine to power a small building. It has taken over one year.     They plan on making a revenue producing machine by 2023. This could be a good investment in 5 years.

CURRENTERGY™









With the addition of the CURRENTERGY™ Division, Dominovas Energy diversifies its portfolio of energy solutions into multi-megawatt hydropower generation applications to broaden its revenue generating opportunities in the renewable energy sphere. Dominovas Energy prides itself on being a responsible “Energy Solutions Provider.” It also realizes that only innovative technologically advanced energy solutions will support the overall economic development and rapidly expanding growth of many developing economies, particularly in Africa and Latin America.
Dominovas Energy entered the world of electricity generation by way of its proprietary fuel cell technology, the RUBICON™. However, Dominovas Energy’s leadership understands the world’s electricity needs cannot be limited to a single source opportunity. While Dominovas Energy established itself in the market under the technical leadership of Dr. Shamiul Islam, Executive Vice President for Fuel Cell Operations, the Company now expands its core capabilities to hydroelectric power generation. In recognizing the significant advantages for diversification in its product offering, Dominovas Energy’s CURRENTERGY™ Division focuses on the deployment of hydroelectric power generation solutions.
Through extensive travels and experiences throughout the world and specifically in Africa, Dominovas Energy has identified an abundance of natural resources within developed countries and frontier markets that are underutilized and can be responsibly harnessed to create clean sources of power generation. After careful and thorough analysis, the Company realizes that the vast resource for hydropower potential in developing economies and frontier markets must be responsibly utilized, to usher in a new paradigm of energy security. Given that hydropower produces 75% of the world’s renewable energy output, Dominovas Energy strategically decided that hydropower is a necessity for its renewable energy offerings, as it supports the Company’s mantra to become the leading energy solutions company, dedicated to delivering clean, efficient, and reliable electricity on a multi-megawatt scale to areas of the world that lack this precious and necessary commodity. CURRENTERGY™ is a venerable strategic division and embodies Dominovas Energy’s steadfast dedication to bolster the Company’s renewable energy portfolio, as a whole.
As an energy solutions company, Dominovas Energy realizes the conservation and responsible utilization of natural resources is paramount to its corporate and social responsibility. Creating a large dam for the production of electricity can be environmentally obtrusive to local communities and wildlife; instead, the option to use multiple innovative hydropower solutions which is significantly less impactful environmentally for those who rely so much on these water resources for their basic needs and survival. CURRENTERGY™ seeks to maintain the harmony inhabitants have with water and their natural environment, to responsibly deploy its innovative, technologically advanced hydropower solutions – and thus becoming the cornerstone of what has evolved into a global push towards a sustainable renewable energy future.
CURRENTERGY™ is poised to deliver its proprietary ORCAS™ (Ocean River Current Access Solutions) system, which is platformed upon the most advanced eco-friendly and effective hydro technologies available today in creating sustainable power generation. The ORCAS™ system enables both on- and off-grid clean energy and micro-grid flexibility for the generation of electricity from river and ocean-based power generating systems, with minimal impact to the environment and natural resources. As a strategic partner and leading global technology supplier, CURRENTERGY™ has agreed to collaborate with Andritz Hydro. Andritz has over 175 years of experience in the deployment, service, refurbishment and rehabilitation of hydropower energy projects.

RUBICON™ Solution









The RUBICON™ Solution
Dominovas Energy’s most important product is its RUBICON™ fuel cell system. Its most important service is providing reliable, efficient, and clean electricity on a 24-hr basis, 365 days a year.
For communities worldwide, Dominovas Energy’s RUBICON™ can be a catalyst in developing and sustaining a standard of living consistent with real-time population and industry growth. Within any successful thriving society, clean water and the sophisticated generation and use of energy are vital elements necessary to ensure economic and social viability. The economic strength of industry, the speed of transportation, the conveniences of home and workplace, a strong and healthy societal foundation, and the security of a nation are each derived from ingenious and efficient provisions and applications of various sources and forms of energy.

Distributed Energy Power System (DEPS)
Dominovas Energy’s DISTRIBUTED ENERGY POWER SYSTEM “DEPS” represents a shift in power generation philosophy from a centralized natural monopoly of utilities, toward open, competitive markets—a methodology approach that will sweep the globe and revolutionize the near trillion dollar energy industry. As the cost of ever-larger power supply, or “dis-economies of scale,” come under greater scrutiny, Dominovas Energy recognizes that a smaller and more efficient location-specific energy source closer to the “End User” is the best approach and methodology.

In addition to becoming more economical when mass-produced, modular systems can be adjusted to match the scale of demand and installed in considerably less time than a centralized power station. Taking all factors into consideration, it is the qualified opinion of Dominovas Energy that the SOLUTION to the “Energy Crisis” rests in a strategy rooted in the implementation of what we call a “Distributed Energy Power System (DEPS).” The “DEPS,” consists of strategically deploying geographically separate modular systems from 500kW mobile systems to 500MW power plants. The solution contains both transformational and operational approaches to insure optimal methodology, in order to best solve an entity’s energy requirements. Combined strategies deploying “DEPS,” is a game changer relative to any system and solution that an entity may be considering. The “DEPS” improves reliability by reducing demands on transmission systems. Many electrical grids are often over capacity and experience more than 40% degradation and loss.

RUBICON™ Deployment Strategy

Reduced transmission and theft losses.
As new transmission lines are buried, combined technical and non-technical transmission and distribution losses are significantly reduced.
Reduced environmental impact.
Increased fuel diversity.
In most cases, location is selected close to the best possible fuel supply route, however, as long as a fuel source can be delivered to the RUBICON™, the system will continue to function efficiently and reliably.
Increased opportunity for economic development and job creation.
Through “DEPS,” dedicated RUBICON™ stations are located in immediate proximity to manufacturing, plant facilities, and corporate offices of businesses to ensure 100% energy reliability.

Global Impact










Dominovas Energy has a global reach, focused on emerging and developing markets to provide reliable, efficient, and clean electricity for uninterrupted power for all families, communities, and surrounding businesses. The RUBICON™ is versatile and designed to encourage the efficient use of natural resources in the production of energy and equally to require accountability for the stewardship of those natural resources.
Lacking access to electricity, communities are often forced to rely on dirty, inefficient coal plants, diesel generators and kerosene lanterns. In many areas of the world, decentralized technologies have enormous potential to bring power to the people, allowing for the deployment of stand-alone systems, resulting in the doing away with the need for expensive grid design and time consuming construction. Moreover, for a rapidly growing urban base, small-scale systems can substantially reduce the economic and environmental cost of electrical products and services.
The acceptance of ‘Climate Change’ and its impact around the globe are forcing many nations to reconsider their energy policies. Concurrently, energy demand is on the rise, because of growing populations. As a result, research, development, and deployment of clean and renewable energy technologies that lead to a significantly reduced dependence on fossil fuels are urgently being sought and sorely needed.
The RUBICON™ fuel cell is an energy technology that can significantly mitigate both air pollution and foreign oil import dependency at current levels. It is quiet, compact, flexible, highly efficient, and exceptionally clean; and it curbs emissions of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide. The RUBICON™ is much more efficient than conventional energy processes because it converts the chemical energy of the fuel directly into electricity without going through an intermediate combustion step. The RUBICON™ is cleaner than any carbon fueled combustion process, even when using carbon fuel as its hydrogen source. Additionally, the heat and water produced in the conversion process can be used for space and water heating.
The positive global impact of fuel cell technology is undeniable. With a 10 percent market penetration, carbon dioxide emissions – the major greenhouse gas – would be reduced by over 60 million tons a year.
Global warming is depicted as the increase in the average temperature of the Earth’s near surface and ocean’s air. The greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide trap heat in the Earth’s atmosphere and, thus, result in increasing the temperature of the Earth. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) states that anthropogenic greenhouse gases are responsible for most of the observed temperature increases since the middle of the twentieth century.
The RUBICON™ fuel cell’s byproducts are heat and water, with significantly reduced emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) over current industry standards. The ultimate integer in emission levels is the fuel source. Based on measured data, a RUBICON™ Based on measured data, a RUBICON™ “DEPS” creates 30% less CO2 emissions than the conventional combustion generating systems for the same kW-h of electricity production.
A major source of carbon dioxide emissions are power plants. Power plants emit inordinate amounts of carbon dioxide as a direct result of burning fossil fuels for the purpose of electricity generation. Coal is the major fuel that is burned in these power plants.
The “DEPS” can greatly reduce costly investment in new power plants. It also facilitates more local control over power use, contributing to economic development within the community and reducing the reliance on and inefficiency of “distant” power producing plants.
The environmental benefit is one of the greatest advantages of the “DEPS.” Modern micro-power systems will leave a lighter ecological footprint than currently deployed predominantly fossil fuel-based networks that host a myriad of environmentally damaging emissions. Candidly, Dominovas Energy realizes it takes vastly different skills and resources to successfully execute the principal strategies for the implementation of the “DEPS.” The operational approach doggedly focuses on conventional measures like capacity utilization, throughput, and customer service. The traditional strategies, by contrast, require decisions must be made in concert with the current leadership, and done so in a manner that considers the necessary investment in technology and the configuration of any resultant new business system. Most monopoly utilities perceive downsized systems as a threat to their core business of generating and distributing power. Nevertheless, communities stand at the threshold of a brave new reality and must avoid the temptation to “lock-in” dirtier, less efficient, less reliable, and more expensive Old Century combustion power generation technologies. Through Dominovas Energy and its RUBICON™ companies, nations, and communities have an excellent opportunity to “get it right” and to secure their economic and energy capacity for future generations.

Latest Update
Dominovas Energy Board of Directors member and President of the Africa Division Emilio DeJesus meets with Dr. Abdulaye Sylla – Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Mali – to discuss Dominovas Energy, its RUBICON fuel cell system, and delivering electricity to his nation.


 



Letter From Neal Allen, CEO
Dear Dominovas Energy Corporation Shareholder(s):

By way of this letter, please allow me to introduce myself to many, while also greeting many of you that already know me. I am Neal Allen, your company’s Chairman and CEO. I say “your” company because I want you to understand I am fully and ever mindful that I serve at the behest of you, our valued shareholder.
My journey in becoming CEO of Dominovas Energy was humbly launched over 6 years ago, as I traveled the globe witnessing firsthand, the lack of consistent and reliable electricity delivery, specifically in Asia, the Caribbean, and Africa.
I knew there was a solution, and I challenged myself and my business partners to find it. We studied the energy business as a whole, initially; but quickly determined fuel cell technology was the best solution. Understanding there are less financially taxing solutions to provide energy on a short term basis, the challenge, however, was to deliver a long term solution that could yield exponential benefit to the end user. There is no better solution than the fuel cell.
The next determination was to decipher what type of fuel cell technology would best represent the impact I felt needed to be made to truly make an undeniable difference for the customer. After many months of study and exploration, we chose Solid Oxide fuel cell technology.
It was about this time Dominovas Energy, LLC was introduced to Western Standard Energy Group, a Canadian based oil and gas concern. After months of negotiations and planning, we perfected an RTO (reverse merger), in order to provide the appropriate platform that would be required to produce thousands of megawatts of electricity to the most viable markets.
The reconstituted Dominovas Energy board consists of me, Mr. Spero Plavoukos, and Mr. Emilio DeJesus. Our executive team includes me as President and CEO; Mr. Michael Watkins, our COO; Mr. De Jesus, our president of Africa operations; Dr. Shamiul Islam, Director of Fuel Cell Operations; and Mr. Eric Fresh, SVP of Finance and Investments, a Georgetown University MBA and GE Capital veteran who is leading the charge to finance individual projects the company has secured, as well as being responsible for securing the overall financing for the day-to-day internal operations of the company. Under his leadership, Dominovas Energy is making significant strides in this regard, and I am optimistic his yield will serve Dominovas Energy Corporation well, in order to continue upon a course of action that supports both our short-term needs and long term goals. I invite you to review our company website for more detailed information on the entire Dominovas Energy team.
As a valued shareholder, I can tell you that the “state” of Dominovas Energy Corporation is healthy and continues to grow stronger each and every day. This past year was one that afforded us to fully solidify the company’s filings, become fully reporting and publically traded, build the right team, and set our course. The stock price at current levels is a great value, and time will reveal the diligence we have put forth in building this company. My objectives over this past year were purposefully explicit in nature, as I not only had to complete the process of making Dominovas Energy a fully reporting and fully compliant company in the eyes of SEC, but I also had to build the business operations and plan of execution to carry out the commercial proliferation of our fuel cell technology, known as the RUBICON™.
We are resolute in our mandate to always execute smartly and efficiently. Our plan of execution is simple and direct and includes fully utilizing the resources we have labored hard over the last year to secure. We have the “best of the best” in the industry as OEM partners, including DELPHI Automotive, along with cadre of multi- billion dollar OEM partners that are collaborating with us. We have orders to fill; and we are continuing to develop and nurture our political and social capital as required to yield significant returns for the company in the years to come.
In evidence of the forgoing and as was reported in our 8K filing, I am proud to let you know Dominovas Energy Corporation has been accepted as the first and only fuel cell company selected as a Private Partner member of President Obama’s Power Africa Initiative. Please visit the Power Africa website for greater detail: www.usaid.gov/pow. Our Investor and Public Relations team, as led by Michele King, will periodically update our website detailing the latest news and happenings of the company. Please avail yourself of this resource: www.dominovasenergy.com.
Although your paths to becoming DEC shareholders vary greatly, consider yourselves fortunate, as I feel bullish about our product, our direction, and our future. As Chairman and CEO, I will continue to expect excellence in all we do as a company. I appreciate your confidence in Dominovas Energy and the team of leaders we have assembled, and perhaps we will one day have the opportunity to meet in person.
Until such time, I humbly remain,

Neal Allen
