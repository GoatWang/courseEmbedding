		Jeffrey T. Slovin Appointed Chief Executive Officer of Sirona Dental Systems, Inc.
	

			New Executive Appointment - Sirona, the dental technology leader, announced that Jeffrey T. Slovin has become its Chief Executive Officer.		


Sirona, the dental technology leader, announced that Jeffrey T. Slovin has become its Chief Executive Officer in accordance with the succession plan previously announced on November 16, 2012. Also as part of that plan, Thomas Jetter, a Director, has become non-executive Chairman. Jost Fischer has retired from the positions of Chairman and CEO.

Bensheim/Salzbug, February 21, 2013. Thomas Jetter, non-executive Chairman of Sirona’s Board of Directors commented: “Jeffrey T. Slovin is the ideal candidate to succeed Jost Fischer as Sirona’s CEO. He has the necessary experience and stellar reputation in the dental community to take Sirona into the future. Before joining Sirona in 2006, Jeff was CEO of publicly traded Schick Technologies, Inc. where he built a reputation as an innovator and operator in the dental community, and delivered significant share-holder value. Since joining Sirona, he has consistently demonstrated excellent judgement and played a major role in improving our operations, targeting our research and development efforts and leading growth initiatives.”
	Jeffrey T. Slovin takes over the management of Sirona, the dental technology leader, that develops, produces, and markets a fullrange of advanced treatment centers, imaging systems, handpieces, hygiene systems, and dental CAD/CAM systems. The Company draws upon global expertise from nearly 3,000 employees located around the world. Sirona products are widely used by dental practices, clinics, and laboratories in more than 135 countries.

	“It is an honor to be given the opportunity to lead Sirona, the finest organization in dentistry, and you should expect a seamless transition. I understand and endorse the high level of expectations we and others place on us as the leader in dental technology, and I am excited by the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead. During my fourteen years in the dental industry, with the last seven at Sirona, I have been focused on advancing dentistry, improving patient care and delivering shareholder value. I am confident that with the ongoing commitment and dedication of our outstanding management team, we will continue to drive innovation to progress dentistry even further”, says Jeffrey T. Slovin, CEO of Sirona.

14 years in the Dental Industry, 7 years with Sirona
	Prior to being appointed CEO, Jeffrey T. Slovin (48) served as President and Director of Sirona, based in Bensheim, Germany, since September 2010. In this role, he was responsible for all segments as well as research and development. From June 2006 until September 2010, Slovin was Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of Sirona’s U.S. Operations. Jeffrey T. Slovin joined Sirona through the Company’s 2006 acquisition of Schick Technologies, Inc. Between June 2004 and June 2006 he served as Chief Executive Officer of Schick and from December 1999 until June 2006 as its President and Director. Prior to joining Schick he held executive positions in different industries. Slovin received his MBA degree from Harvard Business School. He is currently a member of the Young President’s Organization and the Board of Fellows of the Harvard School of Dental Medicine. Jeffrey T. Slovin was born in 1964 in Connecticut, raised in Massachusetts and is married with two children.

Farewell to Jost Fischer
	Jost Fischer (58) is leaving Sirona after eleven successful years. Jeffrey T. Slovin thanks his predecessor: “On behalf of Sirona and all the employees, I thank Jost Fischer for the commitment, vision and tireless dedication in transforming Sirona into the world-class global, dental technology company it is today.”

Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Sirona Dental third quarter 2015 earnings conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
I will now turn the call over to your host, Joshua Zable. Please go ahead.
Joshua Zable - Vice President-Investor Relations
Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter 2015 conference call. I would like to remind you that an earnings slide deck presentation relating to this call is available on our website at www.sirona.com.
Before we begin, please take a moment to read the forward-looking statement on Slide 2 of our earnings slide presentation. During today's conference call, we'll make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about our future performance and financial results. We base these statements on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Our most recent Form 10-K lists some of our most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions.
And with that, I'll now turn the program over to Jeffrey Slovin, President and CEO of Sirona Dental Systems.
Jeffrey T. Slovin - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Thanks, Josh. It is my pleasure to welcome all of you to our third quarter 2015 conference call. Joining me today is Uli Michel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
In the third quarter, we reported record revenues of $306 million and grew 15.2% local currency. Growth was driven by our achievements in the international markets. This 15.2% growth demonstrates the leadership of the Sirona brands and the strength of our global sales and service infrastructure.
Turning to the U.S., CAD/CAM growth was solid, but was offset by lower Imaging sales ahead of the U.S. launch of the ORTHOPHOS SL. Overall, our revenues in the U.S. were flat for the quarter. We are pleased to see that the U.S. dental equipment market remains healthy.
Revenues in international markets increased 23.4% local currency. Growth was broad-based across all regions. Europe led our growth this quarter. And Germany's contribution was uber-struck. We are very pleased with our ability to translate record interest at the IDS into record revenues in Q3. Rest of the world posted robust growth, led by Japan.
Despite the strength in many countries, we continue to see pockets of weakness due to the economic situations in places such as Russia and Brazil. China, while still growing, is also becoming incrementally more challenging.
Turning to our business segments, CAD/CAM posted record results and delivered outstanding 24.5% growth in local currencies. The introduction of our ROI campaign at IDS was very successful and will help drive growth in the coming quarters. As a reminder, our new software creates a unique ROI proposition for CEREC, which enables a seamless, restorative orthodontic and implantology workflow.
Treatment Center delivered an exceptional quarter, with 26.2% growth in local currency. We saw very strong growth across our Comfort and Standard lines. Our new Economy platform, the INTEGO, is being very well received by the market and in high demand. Instruments continued to grow faster than the market, with 7.2% growth. Imaging was up 3% this quarter. 3D adoption is driving growth, and the market is excited about our new ORTHOPHOS SL. Despite these positive developments, slower demand for the XG product line impacted growth.

Our record sales drove operating leverage and delivered record adjusted EPS of $1.16, representing 17% growth.
On June 30, we had completed the acquisition of a small dental company. We're excited to have this company in our portfolio. At this point, I do not want to get into the details, as we do not want to preempt the upcoming commercial launch. We do understand your need to model the financial impact on the fourth quarter. Uli will be discussing this in his prepared remarks.
Overall, I'm very pleased with our performance this quarter and how well the Sirona team delivered.
I'll now turn the call to Uli, who will review our third quarter financials and our guidance.
Ulrich Michel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone.
In the third quarter, our revenues increased by $6.4 million to $306.1 million, up 2.1% reported. In local currency, we grew $45.6 million or 15.2%, which was offset by unfavorable foreign exchange impacts of $39.2 million, or 13.1%. Year to date, about 38% of our revenue is U.S. dollar-denominated. Another 39% is euro-denominated. And the remaining 23% is denominated in a mix of other currencies, the most important ones being the Japanese yen, Australian dollar, Brazilian real, the Russian ruble, and the Chinese yuan. As you know, many of these currencies have declined significantly to the U.S. dollar over the past 12 months, which reflect itself in a 13.1% unfavorable impact on Q3 reported revenues.
As I go through the presentation today, I will focus on our revenue performance in local currencies. Jeff already addressed revenue by geography, so I'll move right to a review of our business segments.
Revenues in our CAD/CAM segment increased 11.4% to a record $121.8 million and were up 24.5% in the local currencies. Growth was geographically broad-based, but led by Europe with particular strength in Germany. We had strong growth for both our chairside and lab-side products.
Our CAD/CAM segment margin was 70.1%, up 120 basis points from last year. The gross margin improvement was mainly driven by favorable foreign exchange impacts.
Imaging segment revenue decreased 4.9% to $103.7 million, but was up 3% on a local currency basis. Revenue growth was driven by strong demand for our 3D units. In June, we began delivering the new ORTHOPHOS SL 2D-3D product line to our core European markets as planned. However, as a consequence, revenue of our Orthophos XG line declined, which impacted revenue growth, particularly in the U.S. As we roll out the ORTHOPHOS SL, we expect revenue growth to accelerate, beginning in Q4. Imaging segment gross profit margin was strong at 59%, but down 130 basis points versus last year. Margins benefited from the weakening of the euro, but were impacted by a less favorable product mix.
Treatment Center revenues were $53.8 million, up 5.1% reported, but up 26.2% on a local currency basis. We had a very strong showing at the IDS, which drove exceptional sales growth in the Comfort and Standard segments in Europe. In the Economy segment, our new INTEGO is very successful and in high demand. Treatment Center gross profit margin was 41.6%, a 290 basis points increase versus prior year. The margin improvement was driven by favorable product and regional mix.
Instrument revenues were $26.8 million, down 11% reported, but up 7.2% on a local currency basis. Instrument growth was driven by international markets, particularly Germany as a result of strong demand for our hygiene products and handpieces. Instrument segment gross profit margin was 37.3%, down 560 basis points over last year. Segment gross profit margins decreased, mainly due to unfavorable product and regional mix.
Moving on to a review of the total company's third quarter P&L. U.S. GAAP gross profit margin was 57% compared to 55.9% in the prior year. The increase in the gross profit margin was mainly due to the favorable foreign exchange effects, as well as reduced amortization and depreciation expense resulting from the step-up to fair values of tangible and intangible assets.

SG&A expense was $84 million, down $4.1 million versus last year. The decrease in SG&A expense was primarily driven by the weakness of the euro and other major currencies. We continue to invest in expansion of our sales and service infrastructure.
R&D was $12.9 million, down $3.7 million versus prior year. The decrease was mostly driven by the weakness of the euro and the ramp-down of expenses post IDS.
Net other income declined $1.7 million. Last year, we benefited from a one-time gain associated with the sale of business assets.
Net interest expense was $1 million, up slightly from last year. The income tax provision for the third quarter of fiscal 2015 was $17.8 million, representing an effective tax rate of 23%. The 23% is in line with last year's full-year tax rate and our expectations for fiscal 2015. As a result, Q3 U.S. GAAP net income was $58.8 million, up 14.2% from prior year. Third quarter 2015 dilutive GAAP earnings per share was $1.04 compared to $0.92 in the prior year.
Adjusted non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.16, up 17.2% from last year. As a reminder, adjusted non-GAAP EPS excludes: amortization and depreciation expense resulting from the step-up to fair values of intangible and tangible assets related to past business combinations; gain/loss on revaluation of foreign currency, monetary assets and liabilities; gain/loss on derivative instruments; any other cash or non-cash items that management does not view as indicative of its ongoing operating performance; and any related tax effects. For a reconciliation of GAAP EPS to non-GAAP adjusted EPS, please see our earnings press release.
At June 30, 2015, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $422.6 million and total debt of $80.4 million, resulting in net cash of $342.2 million. This compares to net cash of $321.7 million at March 31, 2015 and $217.5 million a year ago. Free cash flow, as defined by cash flow from operations less investing activities, was a net cash inflow of $26 million in the quarter. Excluding $18.5 million used for the acquisition Jeff mentioned, free cash flow would have been an inflow of $45 million. This compares to a net inflow of $50 million in last year's third quarter, which benefited from an $11.5 million inflow from the sale of a business, as mentioned in other income. Excluding the acquisition this year and the divestiture last year, our free cash flow improved $7 million, or 17%.
Now moving on to guidance, we are reiterating our previously provided fiscal 2015 guidance of 6% to 8% organic local currency revenue growth. At current exchange rates, the acquisition should add approximately $10 million to our Q4 revenues, or around 1% to our full year revenue guidance. Taking this into consideration, our local currency growth range increases to 7% to 9%. We are also reiterating adjusted non-GAAP EPS to range between $3.95 and $4.05. The acquisition is not expected to have a material impact on Q4 EPS. Guidance is based on the following key inputs. For the full year, we now anticipate the segment gross profit margin to be around 50 basis points higher than last year's level.
Reported gross profit margin is expected to improve more than the segment gross profit, due to the step-down in amortization expense. SG&A as a percentage of sales is still projected to be between 28.5% and 29.5% of sales for fiscal 2015. R&D expenses are still forecasted to be between 4.5% and 5.5% of sales. The estimated effective tax rate for fiscal 2015 is still around 23%. Our share count for the year is currently running a tad higher than we anticipated, negatively impacting our full-year EPS by about $0.03.
Based on all of these factors, we are reiterating our guidance range of $3.95 to $4.05. Currently, we see a slight bias to the lower half rather than the upper half of the range.

I will now turn the call back to Jeff. Jeff?
Jeffrey T. Slovin - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Thank you, Uli. As you just heard, we expect the positive momentum in our business to continue into the fourth quarter. Our guidance implies another quarter of 17% growth or better in EPS. Our success didn't happen overnight. Almost 30 years ago, the first chairside CAD/CAM system was developed with the vision of one day becoming the centerpiece of the dental office. Today, we are seeing that vision becoming a reality. This quarter, CAD/CAM posted record sales and robust growth around the world. There was tremendous excitement at the International Dental Show for our products and software.
Not only are we seeing more users adopting CEREC, but we are seeing utilization and cooperation with labs increasing significantly. This quarter, our Sirona Connect portal, the digital highway that connects dentists with their labs, saw usage rise 70% year-over-year. Earlier this year, we indicated that labs are encouraging dentists to send them digital files, which require the use of an intraoral camera, like our Omnicam, Bluecam or APOLLO DI.
Labs are even providing financial incentives for dentists to go digital. At the last few trade shows, we have noticed an even stronger endorsement from labs. They are actually accompanying dentists to our booth and encouraging them to buy our products.
We also continue to advance CEREC to the forefront of dental education. As we've told you in the past, we are in over 75% of U.S. dental schools and expect that number to grow. We recently released prepCheck 2.0 software, a new software aimed at assisting the training of students. In a traditional setting, students practice on models and have to wait for their professors to assess and comment on their work. With prepCheck 2.0, after initial prep work, students can take a digital impression with a Sirona scanner, get a quick assessment and get right back to work. This software not only enhances the value of CEREC to dental schools, but makes CEREC a central part of the student's education. When they enter the workforce, they will have an added comfort level with CEREC and its capabilities. This should drive demand for our products.
We also believe that the ROI proposition will accelerate adoption. This new restorative orthodontic and implantology workflow makes CEREC more profitable and transforms a dental practice. With this tool, general practitioners can now instantly offer a broader range of new procedures and products to their patients. With this increased utility, CEREC has truly become the centerpiece of the dental office.
As Uli mentioned, in June we launched our ORTHOPHOS SL, our new 2D-3D digital platform. We initially launched the product in Germany and throughout Europe. Feedback from the launch has been outstanding, and we will roll out the product globally and expect it to drive Imaging growth for years to come. 3D adoption is growing rapidly. And integration with CAD/CAM is driving safer, faster, and better procedures.
One key design element that permeates our R&D process is the importance of product integration. Sirona has long believed that the more integrated products are, the easier it will be for the practitioner to reap the benefits of them. Treatment centers have always been the brand-shaper of dental offices around the world, and for years Sirona has had the only treatment center with a digital workflow. Sirona's dental chairs are not only highly functional and ergonomically designed, but are by far the most technologically-integrated products on the market. Our exceptional 26% growth this quarter highlights the strength of our portfolio and the differentiation of our products.
At the International Dental Show, we introduced the ability to integrate X-ray generators into our treatment centers. Since the launch, we've seen strong demand for treatment centers with this added technology.

At IDS, we also introduced the concept of a fully-integrated treatment center with our Omnicam. We will begin rolling out this product at the end of the fiscal year. With one of the largest installed base of treatment centers around the globe, Sirona will leverage our growing installed base to usher in the new era of integrated digital dental offices.
Our installed base of treatment centers, instruments, imaging, and CAD/CAM creates a strong competitive advantage for Sirona. We have invested resources in prioritizing customer service and satisfaction and have earned a loyal customer base for doing so. This customer base is a powerful asset that will support our growth for years to come.
In September, we will celebrate our CEREC 30th Anniversary, which will be the largest and most comprehensive digital dentistry event in history. It will be filled with exciting developments and new offerings. I strongly encourage all of you to attend. Once again, we will host an analyst lunch on Thursday, September 17. Please get in touch with Josh if you're interested in joining us.
The shift to digital dentistry is transformational to the dental practice. It not only increases the efficiency of the office, but also facilitates the offering of more services, delivers better outcomes, and improves profitability. The strength of this year's IDS further validates that digital dentistry is gaining momentum, and Sirona is the best positioned to capitalize on this trend.
I'd like to thank our distribution partners, led by Patterson in the U.S. and Henry Schein internationally, and our outstanding employees, whose efforts and ideas make Sirona's success possible.
Uli and I will now address your questions. Operator, please proceed.
Question-and-Answer Session

Thank you. Our first question comes from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Thanks. Jeff, I want to ask about the CAD/CAM strength, obviously notable this quarter. Can you maybe talk a little bit about how much of this was just maybe pent-up demand coming out of IDS? And what are your thoughts on underlying market growth today? Are you seeing more of an acceleration, I guess?
Jeffrey T. Slovin - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yes, I think absolutely we have to look to the IDS, which we told you we thought was terrific for us. More demos being done, having the opportunity to present ROI brought a lot of dentists in who were thinking we just did restorative. Certainly what we're so pleased about is the IDS really was about digital dentistry. You heard a lot about CAD/CAM and you heard about chairside, which made dentists understand that's where dentistry is going.
And what we were able to do, which really tells you a lot about our organization, our brand, and capabilities is turn that excitement into orders. And not only, by the way, on the GP side, but also labs got involved and consumables. So I do believe that we're seeing adoption increasing. Certainly 24.6% growth is really strong. And the fact that we saw it broad-based gives me a lot of comfort. I will tell you in Germany, it was extraordinary growth. It also highlights the fact that more German dentists are taking a look at CAD/CAM and turning that into a decision to purchase. So we feel we're well placed. We also see that strength going into the fourth quarter as well.
Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC
And then I guess for Uli, if I think about the adjustment in gross margin, can you maybe talk a little bit about the drivers there? I guess the underlying question, is there a price dynamic that's playing into that?
Ulrich Michel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
The adjustment, are you talking about guidance?

Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Yes, in guidance.
Ulrich Michel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Okay, look. We like our margins in the third quarter overall. I think we should say this. We're very proud of the CAD/CAM margin. The Imaging margins were very strong in the context of the full year, but we wanted to give you an indication of what we see.
Jeff has already pointed to the fact that the emerging markets are a bit weaker than what we thought. I think this is one point we stressed to you from the beginning of the year, that this is the wild card in our budget and in our forecast and guidance, and these markets have played out worse for us than what we thought. You know that in these places, we largely go direct, which carries higher margins than our dealer business in Europe, for example, where we're doing a little better at the moment and which is compensating on the top line largely the shortfall we have out of these regions. So that has an impact on our margins. Then you see, for example, the Instruments business, that weighs in. We sold a fairly unfavorable mix this quarter, so that weighs in on the full-year margins. And I think these are the major drivers, Tycho. I hope this answers your question.
Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Yeah, that's helpful. And then, actually maybe, Jeff, if I could just ask one more. There were a number of kind of emerging opportunities you highlighted last quarter, the ADP supply agreement, the ortho JV with Align and the expanded Patterson agreement. Are you able to give us any color on any of those three at this point or do we have to wait until next quarter?
Jeffrey T. Slovin - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
I would say that we've continued to move forward on all of those. We've started a soft launch with the CEREC meets Invisalign. This is a new way of scanning for ortho and so training is a component of it. We are pleased with the collaboration. I think you will see more of it later in the summer. Absolutely the interest from both GPs and orthodontists is showing itself. I would also say we've put a specific sales force in place to go directly to the ortho market as well. And I think we're steadily moving forward. So, very positive and, Tycho, I think we'll even have more to say at CEREC 30 and on our fourth quarter call.
Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay, thank you.
Jeffrey T. Slovin - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Sure.

Our next question comes from John Kreger with William Blair. Your line is open.
John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC
Hi, thanks very much. Jeff, maybe just to follow-up on that, can you just maybe give us a little bit more detail about when you expect to be shipping the ORTHOPHOS SL in the U.S. and the orthodontic version of Omnicam in the U.S.?
Jeffrey T. Slovin - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
I would say that this should be a latter part of the fourth quarter. We will start to do that this year. And the specific date around that, I don't want to get into, but I think you know there is an important upcoming date in September for us called CEREC 30, but don't want to give you any specifics on that, John.
John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC
Okay, thanks. And then, given those interesting comments you made a few minutes ago with labs kind of encouraging more digital file submissions, are you finally starting to see a little bit more interest in your DI offerings or you still seeing sort of a disproportionate mix shift towards full CAD/CAM on the chairside of your business?
Jeffrey T. Slovin - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
I would say the overwhelming interest is in chairside. And I'll talk a little bit about that for you in a moment, but we are seeing this renaissance of a relationship with labs and the importance of capturing their customer to go directly to them. And so that DI aspect has played out, but, of course, when you go chairside, you also have the benefit of going to the lab on your more complicated cases. John, we've talked about competition in the past and made it clear about our 30 years in this business, the clear market leader, clinical studies, working with all of the material companies. But, I think what we have to understand is, there is the real difference between CEREC chairside and others.

CEREC really is about single-visit dentistry. That means having your patients sit down and being out within an hour, an hour and a half, maybe a little longer if it's a more complicated case. But when we talk about others, we're really talking about same day or next day dentistry, which is not the same proposition for the dentist or the patient. And then, when you're talking about laboratory flows, which is what a lot of the other competitors do, there's no benefit at all for the patient. And, of course, you're talking about multiple visits. There is some potential savings, but relatively light on that, and so, I think, it's important. We get too caught up about just saying chairside, but when you think about CEREC, you need to think about single-visit dentistry and being done within an hour to an hour and a half.
John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC
Okay, so thanks, Jeff. So just to clarify, it sounds like you're getting more labs driving interest in CAD/CAM, but it does not sound like you're starting to see more scanner-only sales within the CAD/CAM segment. Is that the message?
Jeffrey T. Slovin - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
No, we're seeing more. We are seeing scanner only, but when you say, look at all of them, it's disproportionately more chairside.
John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC
Okay.
Jeffrey T. Slovin - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
But we are pleased with that relationship with the lab and everybody feeling that there is a win-win proposition. And in the past, you would think that a lab would only want to talk about DI. And then the reality is they're getting behind the fact and saying, look, chairside is fine, too. I just want, when you want to go to a lab, I'd like you to use the Sirona highway to get it to me, and I want to show that support.
John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC
Very good, thank you.
Ulrich Michel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Really the growth rates are high on the DI only, but the base is lower, and the good thing on the DI only is that the interest is much more for our Omnicam, which is more expensive and carries more margin than for our other offerings.
Jeffrey T. Slovin - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
It's a fair point.
John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC
Interesting, thank you.
Jeffrey T. Slovin - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Sure, John.

Our next question comes from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Nathan A. Rich - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Hi, this is Nathan Rich on for Bob this morning. Just wanted to go back to guidance, you've talked on the call pretty positively about the sales momentum that you saw in the third quarter continuing going forward, but Uli, I think you said that your bias was towards the lower half of the EPS range. I was just wondering if you could kind of help square your comments there. Is it just a factor of margins maybe being a little bit softer than you had expected or any moving pieces related to the acquisition, just any color you could share there?
Ulrich Michel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Yes, I can. The acquisition, to start with, should not have a big impact on this. We said this from the beginning. It's about 8% on the revenue, which you can add to the range that we gave you, in your models. The relationship between cost of goods sold and revenue in the business that we acquired is very similar to our overall average. It's in the mid-50%. So I told you at the current exchange rate, it's about $10 million. So the impact that you see, even if it's a tad below maybe our overall margin, is not very big, right?
So this is not the reason why we are pointing to the margins. The biggest reason is, as we have said, the growth in the BRICS that is lower than we anticipated, which we are compensating with growth in other parts of the world, mostly dealer business with slightly lower margins.

And the other point I would say, a luxury problem to have, it's the technicality of our share count. When we started out the year, we had assumed that we would slightly reduce our diluted shares outstanding through our buyback. But with the high share price and the increase over the last quarters, we are now slightly up in our share count and the impact is about is $0.03 compared to when we started out the year and we gave the guidance. And since we're already in August, whatever we buy back for the remainder of the year will not have a material impact or an impact on this. So these are the two main reasons, share count and then the growth in the BRICS with high margins that is compensated with growth in the other parts of the world, mostly through dealer business and slightly lower margins.
Jeffrey T. Slovin - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
I would just highlight again, Uli said slight bias, which means there are opportunities as well on the upper end, but there is a slight bias to the lower.
Nathan A. Rich - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Understood, makes sense, and then just a quick follow-up on the U.S. growth. I'm wondering if you could give us the growth rate ex-Imaging, just so we could get a better sense of kind of underlying trend in the market.
Jeffrey T. Slovin - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
No, we're not going to go into segment details on that. But we do want to give you the confidence that you know what we're hearing from our team as well as the other dental companies is that the market is stable and improving. We qualified the U.S market as healthy. We're seeing some momentum. CAD/CAM did well and I think you need to put this in perspective. We haven't launched yet our SL and so there is a lot of excitement waiting for that, which means that the XG has some downward pressure on it as an older technology, still a terrific product. But overall, we feel we're well-positioned in the U.S. And Patterson is a big part of that and they continue to talk about the acceleration and of the adoption of CAD/CAM. And I see that playing out and I think you're going to see that even stronger at CEREC 30.
Nathan A. Rich - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Great, thanks for the questions.
Jeffrey T. Slovin - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director

Our next question comes from Steve Beuchaw with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Oh, hi, guys, good morning and thanks for taking the question. Just a couple of fine points on my end, one, could you give us an update on the FDA process behind the treatment center launch through Patterson in the United States?
Jeffrey T. Slovin - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah.
Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
And then I'll go ahead, if you don't mind. Well, actually, I'll pause there, thanks.
Jeffrey T. Slovin - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Okay, so just to be clear, right now, our C8 is available in the U.S. In July we received approval for the TENEO and the INTEGO, which we're very excited about. As you know, the TENEO is our high-end treatment center, really a traffic brand-shaper for the dental practice. And our INTEGO is also a great product, but more aimed at the Economy segment of it. And so this is great news for us. It's a real testament to our team, frankly, to be able to get this registered as quickly as they were able to. And I'm talking, Steve, they didn't get it done weeks early, but they got it done months earlier than we had expected. So I'm proud of our team's ability to do that.
Ulrich Michel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
I think we did it in about a third of the average time it takes for approval. So that's I think a testament to both to the quality of and strength of our product and our team.

Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
I'm going to do my best not to translate those expectations over to other FDA processes.
Jeffrey T. Slovin - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yes.
Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
And then I'll ask an open-ended question for you, Uli. I think it's always interesting to hear your latest thoughts on efforts around capital allocation. It would be interesting to hear a little bit about your thinking around the acquisition that you guys mentioned today, and then more broadly speaking, how you're thinking on that front. Thanks so much.
Jeffrey T. Slovin - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Thanks.
Ulrich Michel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Okay, thanks. Capital allocation, I think we've told you our priorities from the beginning. First thing is reinvest in our business, R&D, and we're funding all the opportunities that we see which warrant, so we're not saving any money on our R&D efforts. We grow our infrastructure in the emerging markets and other parts of the world where we are not represented as we want to be. And we're looking for acquisitions actively, which is what we've told you for a few quarters now.
This quarter, we just happened to close one at the last day of the quarter. We gave you a bit a sense of the financial impact. We'll tell you more when we give 2016 guidance and once these products have been officially launched with us. So we do not want to preempt the commercial impact of this. That's why we're not saying much more. But we think it's a really good acquisition. We like it. Don't expect too much in the first few quarters from this. But I think once it's integrated, looking maybe three, four quarters out, it should start contributing to our income as well and to our cash flow. For the moment, it's neutral.
Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Could we see this product at the show in Las Vegas in September?
Ulrich Michel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
I don't think we want to comment on this at this point.
Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC

Our next question comes from Erin Wilson with BOA. You line is open.
Erin E. Wilson - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Great, thanks so much. I believe last quarter you noted orders for ORTHOPHOS SL or just imaging products in general were strong heading into the quarter. How much was that contributing, and was there some sort of timing issue there in the orders with the June launch? I just want to understand the dynamics there.
Jeffrey T. Slovin - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
I think there was an issue, which we tried to highlight on our last call, that there was a lot of anticipation for the SL. And certainly, we were able to have some sales of the SL in Germany and Europe. And we got outstanding feedback. Now that's what you always want, but of course, when you have an older generation, and that feedback starts to get out there pretty quickly in markets that doesn't have it, then you have a situation where a number of your distributors and doctors are waiting for the latest and greatest product offering, which we think very highly of that.
I think the other thing is that, as we've discussed, there's a trend that has a lot of momentum, which is 3D, which is to a small degree in certain countries being offset by declines in 2D, and that also goes into the mix. Now keep in mind that the U.S., our largest market, has not yet launched the SL, but is pretty much aware of the fact that it's coming, but you should look for a pickup in Imaging in Q4.
Erin E. Wilson - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Okay, great. Thanks. And do you anticipate a benefit from Section 179 clarity in the coming quarter? I guess that was the headwind going into the end of the calendar year, last year. And could you speak to the dynamics there as well?

Jeffrey T. Slovin - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Erin, it's absolutely a fair question. I think I can speak for myself and all of the other dental CEOs. We hope so. We think it's a nice proposition to the dentist. Typically, the accountants are able to explain to them how they benefit so well from that. And having clarity this early should have an impact. So we are confident that knowing what's going to happen will play a better role for us in our communications.
Erin E. Wilson - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Okay, great. Thanks so much.

Our next question comes from Jason Bednar with Robert W. Baird. Your line is open.
Jason M. Bednar - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Thanks, guys. Good morning. So I just wanted to come back to some of your comments on the BRIC markets, a little bit of a twofold question here. So first on the top line, this is presumably more of a market issue, with some of the biggest incremental change in your commentary seemed to come from China. And I think you said in past calls that Brazil and Russia had been softer throughout the year. So I guess first, is this all accurate, or are you seeing some incremental softness in some of those markets? And then on the spending side, does the slowness in those markets make you any more hesitant to throw spending to further build out your sales and service presence in some of those markets?
Jeffrey T. Slovin - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Okay, a lot in that question. Let's start and say that we mentioned when we started the year that there were some clear concerns that were visible in both Russia and Brazil on political and then economic macro levels. I would tell you both of our organizations are well run, and we feel well positioned in Russia and Brazil, but the headwinds have been significant. And while we've said that these are low single-digit revenues for us, nevertheless they do add up and had an impact. But I think that from a standpoint of investing in them, right now would be a little bit too early to do it. But we do believe both those markets will come back, that we're the best positioned to sell technology, and we would continue to invest in them. But they have had a toll on our earnings.
Ulrich Michel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
China.
Jeffrey T. Slovin - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
China has been a little bit different. China is a top-10 worldwide dental market. We sell the most equipment of anyone in China. It's been a terrific grower for us. It's continuing to grow, but we see that there are more economic and political headwinds there. We don't expect to grow as fast as we have in the past, for now until this cleans up. But I would say our management and our feet on the street are second to none. And we see China to be a long-term growth driver. So, absolutely, we'll continue to invest in that area, but there are some challenges. But I believe China will continue to be a great driver for Sirona for years to come.
The Sirona brand in all three of these countries is recognized well. And that branding plays an important role during tough times. And keep in mind also this, that some of the areas have had to deal with financing challenges, like Brazil. As that starts to ease up, we'll be in better shape. But I think I feel good about our product portfolio, how we're positioned and the people that we have there. So, we'll just have to wait this out a bit, but the real end of the story is this. We've got a global business and look what stepped up. Europe stepped up in a big way; Germany, outstanding. Japan, this is what you're able to do with Sirona. When there is areas in one pocket, we have other areas that perform even better.

Jason M. Bednar - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Okay, thanks and that's all, helpful. The other question I just wanted to come back to the acquisition you guys did and I don't know if you'll answer this, but hoping to get maybe some additional color on the deal, even if you don't want to disclose the exact product or the company acquired. But are you able to tell us whether this fits into one of your existing product segments or if it's maybe a new category or is there anything you can provide? I guess you told us from a profitability margin perspective, that it's mid-50% on the gross margin side, but anything on whether it fits in, again, an existing product category that you already have?
Jeffrey T. Slovin - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
No. Look, we appreciate the question. And we know you're very curious about it, but it's not like we want to give you, well, you're close here or there, we really want to wait. We think competitively, it makes sense. Uli and I like the technology.
Ulrich Michel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
And we would love to talk to you.
Jeffrey T. Slovin - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
In fact, from our perspective, we'd love to start getting up on the table and telling you the impact of it down the road, but when you want to have a commercial launch of it, and it's going to be relatively soon, the best thing we can do is not launch it on a conference call. And so, we're excited about it. We think it will play into our strategy. It will lead to growth down the road and it's something that our investors and analysts will appreciate. And that's as far as we're willing to go on this call.
Jason M. Bednar - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Okay, thank you, guys.

Your next question comes from Brandon Couillard with Jefferies. Your line is open.
S. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC
Thanks, good morning.
Jeffrey T. Slovin - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Good morning.
S. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC
Just back on that acquisition, I think you said $10 million of revenue in the fourth quarter. Is that from the commercial launch that you mentioned or is that related to the base business of the assets? And would it be fair to annualize that number and think about that as a fair revenue estimate for next year in terms of contribution?
Jeffrey T. Slovin - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Okay. Brandon, look, I think you can think about the $10 million as a part of the base business. With regard to how to think about it for next year, we'll give you guidance on that in our fourth quarter call when we give guidance.
S. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC
Okay. Fair enough.
Ulrich Michel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
At the beginning, we think it's probably fair to think of this for the base business as an annualized number, depending on exchange rates and so on, but it's probably fair, right.
Jeffrey T. Slovin - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
And obviously, Brandon, they're trying to even lowball me by going – Uli, thank you for that one. I want more of it, other than an annualized number.
S. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC
All right, helpful. One minor question for Uli, could you tell us the impact of currency on operating dollars in the period?
Ulrich Michel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
I can try to give you a bit of a sense. I think we've always said in the first half of the year, it was a slight tailwind net-net for us. It's always been a hurt on the revenue line. It's been a hurt on the absolute gross profit dollars, although it's been a favorable impact on the margin percentage. Net-net, it was a hurt on the gross profit dollars. But because of our high share of SG&A and R&D spend in other areas than dollars, mostly the euro, we've slightly overcompensated the dollar hurt on the gross profit line when you come down to operating or net income, especially with the fairly high spend in euros around IDS and the product development efforts leading into it. And we've also, I think, on some of these said that on a full year basis, we would expect this to mitigate and the impact to be minimal on a full year basis at the exchange rates of the various times when we did it.

So, now in Q3, as we anticipated, it was a little bit of a headwind to us on the bottom-line. The loss we saw on gross profit dollars was largely, but not fully, compensated, so it's mildly unfavorable. For the third quarter at the current exchange rates, this is probably going to be a little bit bigger, but we're not talking huge dollars here. We're talking now looking forward maybe $0.03 a quarter or so unfavorable, something like this. All right.
S. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC
Super, thank you.
Ulrich Michel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
You're welcome.
Jeffrey T. Slovin - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Thank you.

Our final question comes from Jon Block with Stifel. Your line is open.
Jon D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Great, thanks, guys. And just a couple of quick ones for you, the revs were obviously well ahead. The OpEx leverage was a little light, at least from what we were looking for. And that sort of constrained the magnitude of the bottom-line beat. Uli, maybe this one is for you. I know FX can move things around a bit, but if I go back to 2011 and 2013, call it the prior two IDS years, I had the SG&A spend down about 4% to 5% from March to June. This year, it was up arguably 2% Q-on-Q. So anything you can call out on the moving pieces or maybe where some incremental spend is being put in plus?
Ulrich Michel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
You lost me a little bit on this one, I have to say.
Jon D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
I guess, if you can comment on why didn't we see more OpEx leverage and why was SG&A up Q-on-Q in an IDS year, if you could go back to 2011 and 2013, that wasn't the case?
Ulrich Michel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
A part of this is FX. I would really have to look at this.
Jon D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
But FX didn't move around a lot quarter-to-quarter. I get year-over-year, but Q-on-Q, it didn't move around a whole lot.
Ulrich Michel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
I have to look at this really on ex-FX basis. We'll get back to you with more detail, if you want to, offline. But the basic question, why didn't we see more leverage, this is the BRICS that we have told you, is part of the answer. And you know we had some ramp-up expenses, as we said, for the ORTHOPHOS SL still. We're investing, for example, in the treatment center launch in the U.S., right. That was a spend in the third quarter and things like this.
Jeffrey T. Slovin - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah. We had some programs also in Germany. I mean, Germany results were extraordinary, uber-struck, as we said, Jon, but there was also some programs we've had in place as well, which we'll take those every day, but they were not annualized.
Jon D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Okay, got it. And maybe just to shift gears, and you led me into the next question with your commentary around Germany. Jeff, just at a high level, can you speak to maybe some of the other – you detailed the BRIC markets, but some of the other European markets? Schein and Dentsply talked about greater consistency or a broadening out in Europe at least on the consumables side.
Jeffrey T. Slovin - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yes, yeah.
Jon D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
I'm wondering if you're seeing that also take place on the equipment side as well.
Jeffrey T. Slovin - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
We absolutely are. This quarter for Europe was really broad-based strength. I think that's absolutely right and, by the way, across all of our segments. So Europe really came through. And also in Germany, all of our segments were up. As you saw, Treatment Center big; CAD/CAM bigger. This really I would say has a lot to do about how well we performed at the IDS and it played out well in Europe. Very few of the countries in Europe were down in the quarter. So I think, as we think about it, we were lockstep with consumables. Jon, I think you'll recall, our second quarter, we also highlighted Europe. The consumable companies weren't as strong as we were. And thankfully, it wasn't a one quarter wonder for us and it played nicely after the IDS. Hope that color helps you. Anything else?

Operator
Thank you. That concludes the Q&A session. I will now turn the call back over to Jeffrey Slovin, President and CEO of Sirona, for closing remarks. Please go ahead.
Jeffrey T. Slovin - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Thank you very much for joining us today. I hope a number of you join us in September for our CEREC 30 event. It will be event not to be missed. For those of you who are not there, we look forward to updating you on our next quarterly conference call in November.
I'd also like to make a special shout-out to our Director of PR from the management team, who's getting married tomorrow in Italy. Marion [Weixlberger], good luck. Take care, everybody. Enjoy the rest of your summer. Thank you.
Operator

Good day and welcome to the Dentsply Sirona, Inc., First Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being record.
At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Joshua Zable, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communication. Sir, you may begin.
Joshua Zable - Vice President-Investor Relations
Thank you and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter 2016 conference call. I would like to remind you that an earnings slide deck presentation relating to this call is available on our website at www.dentsplysirona.com.
Before we begin, please take a moment to read the forward-looking statements on slides two and three of our earnings slide presentation. During today's conference call, we'll make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about our future performance and financial results. We take these statements on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Our most recent Form 10-K lists some of our most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions.
And with that, I'll now turn the program over to Jeffrey Slovin, Chief Executive Officer of Dentsply Sirona.
Jeffrey T. Slovin - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Thanks, Josh. It is my pleasure to welcome all of you to our first quarter and first ever conference call as Dentsply Sirona. Also joining us on the call today, Ulrich Michel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Chris Clark, President and Chief Operating Officer of our Technologies business; and Derek Leckow, Vice President of Investor Relations.
I'm delighted to report that our first quarter was a very successful one. We seamlessly completed our merger and begin working on the great opportunities ahead of us. Rather than being distracted by the merger, the team came together and was energized to perform.
In our first 67 days together, Dentsply Sirona team has much to be proud of. We've rebranded our company, announced our leadership team, and created an operating model to help optimize our growth. As you can see on the earnings presentation, we have organized our self into two segments: Dental and Healthcare Consumables; and Technologies.
Our Dental and Healthcare Consumables business is comprised of our endodontics, preventive, prosthetics, restorative, and instruments division, along with Wellspect, our healthcare business. Our Technologies business is comprised of our implant, CAD/CAM, imaging, treatment center and the orthodontic businesses.
We organized these segments to maximize efficiency and product development and cross-selling opportunities. In addition to developing new stand-alone products, our segments will introduce integrated solutions to improve workflow in advanced patient care.
Within Technologies, our loyal install base of CAD/CAM and imaging has been expanding to incorporate more specialty procedures. For decades, we have a proven track record of using technology to allow the dentists to advance patient care, both in terms of outcome and treatment times.

Now, we are moving towards integrated solutions, using technology combined with clinical products to provide dentists with end-to-end solutions and advance their own service capabilities. This was first evident in restoratives, but is now moving rapidly into implants, orthodontics, and endodontics. These capabilities, further facilitated with Dentsply Sirona's world-class clinical education platform, creates a powerful basis for advanced learnings in clinical settings.
Along the same lines, specialists are demanding more high-tech equipment, like 3D imaging and digital impressions. Our relationships with these practitioners will help drive adoption of our technologies.
From a product development standpoint, combining the experience and knowledge of our strategic business units, will enable the development of integrated technologies. Furthermore, by collaborating innovation should come faster and offer more to practitioners than ever before.
In Consumables, the majority of our revenues are operatory-related and often used in conjunction with one another. We are focusing on offering practitioners end-to-end solutions based on particular procedures. All root canal procedures require multiple tools and are completed with restoration. Dentsply Sirona is the only manufacturer with RestoDontics strategy, offering all the necessary instruments, equipment and consumables to diagnose and complete a root canal from start to finish.
As you can see, the goal of organizing into these segments was to accelerate adoption of all of our products, which will translate into top-line growth.
By driving growth and increasing productivity of our sales and service infrastructure, we will leverage our sales to deliver strong bottom-line growth as well. With so many opportunities ahead, we have created an integration management office to work hand-in-hand with senior management to oversee the seamless merging of both companies and cultures.
In order to capture our synergies, we have formed multiple teams to actively manage our cost of revenue initiatives. Feedback from these teams have been overwhelmingly positive. Ideas are being shared across organizations and plans are being implemented to ensure these synergies come to fruition. We are confident that we can deliver on our promise of $125 million in synergies by year three of our merger.
Capital allocation will also be important part of our go-forward strategy. Our company generates a significant amount of free cash flow and we have a large and flexible balance sheet. As always, our priority is to invest in growth drivers for our business. We will also use our cash flow to make acquisitions, repurchase our stock and support our dividend.
During the quarter, we executed on the $500 million share repurchase, consistent with the announcement we made at the time of the merger. We continue to have 3.6 million shares authorized for repurchase. We have flexibility to pursue multiple avenues of capital deployment, all of which will drive value for our shareholders.
The opportunity ahead of us is more significant than anything, either Dentsply or Sirona ever had on a stand-alone basis. We have never been in a better position to grow and deliver shareholder value.
Turning to the first quarter, Uli will explain some of the technicalities on the reported revenue growth. I will focus my comments here on the underlying growth of our two combined businesses. Although the merger closed on February 29, I think it is more meaningful to discuss the performance of our business during the full quarter.
We achieved strong results, with our combined businesses growing 6.5% constant currency. Excluding acquisitions, divestitures and discontinued products, internal sales growth was 5.5%. Geographically, we have solid growth across all regions.

Rest of World led our growth, delivering 8.4% constant currency, driven by internal sales growth of 7.5%. There continue to be a number of challenging environments around the globe, but we are much better positioned after the merger in these areas. We expect our Rest of World region to be the fastest-growing region this year.
The U.S. grew 8.8% constant currency, driven by internal growth of 5.7%, led by the Technology segment. Europe grew 3.1% constant currency, with internal sales growth of 4%, driven by solid growth in both our Technology and Consumables segments.
On a segment basis, our Technology business led our growth with 9.6% constant currency growth. Internally-generated sales grew 6.8%, led by strong growth in our high-tech products. CAD/CAM was particularly strong ahead of our new Zirconia product launch. In Q1, Dental and Healthcare Consumables generated internal sales growth of 4.5%. Growth was driven by operatory-focused consumables.
First quarter adjusted EPS was $0.69, representing 17% growth. We achieved strong financial results while investing in R&D and in our sales and service infrastructure. We will continue to ramp these investments in Q2 to better position our accelerating growth. Innovation and best-in-class customer service will be two key pillars of our new organization. Overall, we reported a very solid first quarter.
I'll now turn the call over to Uli, who will review our first quarter financials.
Ulrich Michel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP
Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. This morning I will discuss our GAAP results as well as our non-GAAP results, including the sales performance of our combined businesses for the complete three-month period of the first quarter 2016 as if the businesses had been consolidated on January 1, 2015. I walk through the earnings performance. I will also point out any impacts of merger accounting on earnings.
In the first quarter, our reported revenues increased $116.3 million to $772.6 million, up 17.7% reported. The consolidation of one month of Sirona contributed sales of $128.9 million, which were reduced by $8.8 million to $120.1 million as a result of purchase accounting.
This reduction from our normal revenue recognition practices results from a one-time treatment of deferred income on service contracts, where any deferred income at the time of the merger is removed from future revenues and income. This one-time treatment reduced revenue by $8.8 million this quarter and will reduce future revenue by about $8 million in the aggregate over the next six quarters.
As of March 1, any new contracts are again being treated as they have been historically. For non-GAAP reporting, we will treat all the contracts existing at the time of the merger under the ongoing policy as if incurred in normal course of business.
For the full three-month period ending March 31, 2016, adjusted sales of our combined businesses excluding precious metals grew 6.5% on a constant currency basis, internal growth was 5.5%, excluding 1.7% favorable impact from net acquisition and 70 basis points unfavorable impact from discontinued products. Foreign exchange movements were a headwind to revenue of 2.6%.
Jeff already addressed revenue growth by geography and segment. We have provided reconciliation tables for every segment and region that will help you understand how the GAAP reported revenue and internal growth for the complete quarter come together.
U.S. GAAP gross profit was $418.9 million, up $45.5 million from $373.4 million in 2015. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales, excluding precious metal content, decreased by 360 basis points to 55.5% from 59.1% in the prior year.
As you can see on the non-GAAP reconciliation tables, the gross profit margin was negatively impacted by about 500 basis points due to the roll-off of merger-related fair value adjustments. The company generated benefits from its global efficiency program which were largely offset by negative foreign currency impacts.

Reported SG&A expenses, which include R&D, was $342.1 million, up $71.8 million versus last year. SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales, excluding precious metal, increased 250 basis points compared to prior year. Merger-related expenses negatively impacted the rate by about 500 basis points, partially offset by savings from the global efficiency program and the consolidation of Sirona.
SG&A expenses were favorably impacted by foreign currency translation of approximately 100 basis points. Restructuring expenses were $4.1 million, down $1.3 million from last year.
In total, GAAP operating income was $72.7 million, representing 9.6% of sales, excluding precious metals. Excluding the non-GAAP items set forth in our non-GAAP financial measures, the adjusted operating margin was 22.2%, which compares to 18.7% last year. Margins benefited from the positive impacts of the global efficiency program and the consolidation of Sirona.
Due to the strong performance in March, the benefit from the consolidation is more pronounced. Had we consolidated Sirona for the complete three-month period, our adjusted operating margin would have been approximately 150 basis points lower. We believe this is more representative of the current performance level of our business.
Net interest expense for the first quarter was $8.7 million, $1.3 million lower than prior year, largely driven by lower average debt levels. Other income in the first quarter was $3.4 million, with the biggest impact coming from a small business divestiture, which was removed from adjusted income.
For the three months ended March 31, 2016, income taxes were a net benefit of $57.9 million versus an expense of $18.9 million last year. As part of the merger, we will be able to generate an early synergy by recovering previously reserved tax assets of $76.1 million. This is the single biggest driver of the favorable development and will be recovered in cash in future periods. We have removed this benefit from our non-GAAP results.
As a result, Q1 U.S. GAAP net income attributable to Dentsply Sirona was $125 million, up 95.3% from the prior year. First quarter 2016 diluted GAAP EPS was $0.70 compared to $0.45 in the prior year. Adjusted non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.69, up 16.9% from last year. For a reconciliation of GAAP EPS to non-GAAP adjusted EPS please see our earnings press release.
Cash flow from operating activities during the three months period ended March 31, 2016, was $0.7 million compared to $65.6 million during the three months period ended March 31, 2015. The year-over-year decrease was primarily related to a $56.9 million larger increase in accounts receivables due to stronger revenues in the month of March and payments of approximately $40 million of merger-related transaction fees and integration costs.
Cash provided by investing activities was $504 million favorable, which reflects the assumed cash in the merger with Sirona of $522.3 million. These funds were largely used to execute the $500 million share repurchase which, in exchange, is a major driver behind the $472.8 million cash used in financing activities. The company's cash and cash equivalents increased by $38.5 million to $323.1 million during the three months ended March 31, 2016.
Now, turning to guidance, for fiscal 2016, we expect adjusted non-GAAP EPS in the range of $2.70 to $2.80. Our guidance includes the following assumptions: constant currency sales growth to range from 4% to 6%, excluding precious metals. This includes a 1% benefit from acquisitions, divestitures and discontinued products and internal growth in the range of 3% to 5%.
At current exchange rates, this translates to reported revenues, excluding precious metals, of $3.73 billion to $3.81 billion. Please keep in mind that growth comps get more difficult in Q2 and Q3 related to last year's record international dental show and strong performance in our consumables business.

At the current exchange rates, we would expect adjusted operating income margins in the range of 21% to 22%. We anticipate our adjusted tax rate to be approximately 23%. Our EPS range implies a full-year share count of 220 million to 225 million fully diluted shares. Our share count will increase to 238 million as we move into Q2.
I will now turn the call back to Jeff.
Jeffrey T. Slovin - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Thanks, Uli. We are in the very early days of our journey as Dentsply Sirona, but we have a lot to be excited about. The key driving force behind our merger was growth. By accelerating the adoption of our products, we can bring about the full impact of digital dentistry in the dental practice. We can integrate equipment and consumables to meet the growing need for more efficient workflows. We will set new standards of care while meeting the growing demand for end-to-end solutions.
At Dentsply Sirona, we are the only company that can further drive these trends and are best positioned to benefit from them. Our installed base of equipment is the largest in the world. Our customers are loyal and supportive. They understand that our products are built to help them become more successful, which is driving our growth.
Every day, around 600,000 dental professionals use Dentsply Sirona product. Our reach is unparallel, and our brands are the most well-known in the industry. Dentsply Sirona is associated with quality and innovation.
We have the broadest clinical education platform in dentistry. Each year, we train more than 300,000 dental professionals on our products. Training builds loyalty to our company and our products, especially when they make procedures easier or more efficient.
We also are able to deliver all of our offerings around the globe with largest sales and service infrastructure in the industry. We are supported by 4,000 sales professionals and around 5,000 distributors around the globe. We also heard combining all of our capabilities create synergy opportunities. From a cost perspective, coming together will create opportunities to leverage our supply chain and cost structure.
Building off the legacy Dentsply efficiency program, we already have a platform to evaluate opportunities and the team to execute on them. We are evaluating ways to improve our processes and manufacture more efficiently. We have begun cutting redundant corporate expenses and consolidating some of our countries. All of these actions will generate tangible cost savings and create a more leverageable cost structure. We expect to achieve these savings while continuing to invest in R&D and our sales and service infrastructure.
With more innovations and farther reach, we can cross sell to our mutual customers or create bundles that specifically cater to each customer. We have been working closely with our distributors to develop plans that create growth opportunities for ourselves and our partners.
Some of these successes involve sales people coming together to move the combined business forward. We already have a number of stories from the field, of reps introducing customers to our expanded portfolio. We have a large sales organization around the globe and they've been meeting to find more ways to collaborate and accelerate growth while working with and respecting a wide range of distributor relationships that we have in place.
These are win-win scenarios for Dentsply Sirona and our distribution partners. The more significant opportunities will require investment in both R&D and infrastructure. While these take time and will mean that some of our revenue synergies are backend loaded to our third year, we are extremely confident that we can deliver them and they will be significant.
While these integrated solutions are in development, our R&D engine is continuing to introduce innovation to drive penetration of our products. We've recently introduced a number of new meaningful products to the market. Our SureFil SDR+ builds on our revolutionary market-leading bulk fill composite platform. The product has enhanced radiopacity in interproximal layer.

In our Healthcare business, the new Navina bowel management system provides a novel approach to irrigation in a rapidly expanding market. Early feedback has been overwhelmingly positive.
During the quarter, we launched our CEREC Zirconia package, which was well received by the market. The Zirconia package includes the new CEREC SpeedFire, our unique high speed sintering furnace and combination with the CEREC chairside CAD/CAM system. It allows for a single visit dentistry of Zirconia crowns and small bridges. In the past, using conventional furnaces, Zirconia needed about two hours for sintering. Therefore, Zirconia was exclusively processed in the dental lab.
CEREC SpeedFire brings sintering time down to about 15 minutes and opens up the possibility of processing Zirconia chairside. Zirconia is the most popular ceramic material for crowns in the U.S. Having this material available for CEREC will substantially expand the addressable market for CEREC.
In conjunction with our launch, we also introduced CEREC chairside Zirconia blocks and our new Calibra ceramic cement, a first Dentsply Sirona cement to address CAD/CAM restorations. As part of our launch, we also provided a materials and accessories starter kit for all new users of Zirconia packages.
Combining these new products with our CELTRA Duo blocks means that we can now offer dentists the tools and materials for all of our chairside restorations. And to complement this, we have outstanding relationships with our material partners that we'll continue to build on.
We will continue to invest in new CEREC consumables specialist sales force to work hand-in-hand with our equipment specialists to deliver a full value proposition to dental professionals. They now can source all of their CAD/CAM needs from Dentsply Sirona. Our efforts are already paying off. Our CELTRA and Zirconia lines are growing rapidly. This is the first example of Dentsply Sirona's leadership in both equipment and consumables coming together to drive growth globally.
We will continue to launch over 30 new products every year. Our new product pipeline is robust. We provide best-in-class equipment and consumables. We can accelerate adoption of technology and drive sales of our entire product portfolio.
We have a number of additional opportunities to quickly integrate our technology and consumable offerings. Orthodontists are rapidly adopting 3D imaging and digital impressioning systems. We have the most open orthodontic camera on the market, and we can benefit from our seamless integration with our own MTM Clear Aligner brands.
Coupled with our brackets and wires, orthodontists can now treat a patient from diagnosis to treatment. From the initial x-ray to impression and then to treatment, orthodontists can choose from an array of Dentsply Sirona products to effectively treat patients. With CEREC meets 3D, we offer the safest and easiest chairside implant planning.
As I mentioned, our implant sales force is already generating leads for imaging and CAD/CAM and planning joint clinical education events to train doctors on the Dentsply Sirona implants line.
An important part of our clinical education strategy is partnering with dental schools around the globe. In the U.S. Dentsply Sirona products are in virtually all dental and dental hygiene schools. Our Endo business currently partners with 100% of U.S. Endo residency programs. Today, Dentsply Sirona is training the next generation of dentists on products and introducing them to best-in-class solutions. Once they graduate and enter the workforce, they will demand technology and integrated solutions. Dentsply Sirona is the only manufacturer that can meet this growing trend and we will.
To deliver all of our solutions to the market, we'll continue to invest in our sales and service infrastructure. This quarter we built out our infrastructure in Mexico and continued expanding our presence in China and India. While we will leverage our infrastructure to sell more efficiently, we remain focused on accelerating long-term top-line growth.

Overall, I am excited to see the Dentsply Sirona team unite and deliver a strong first quarter. As the dental solutions company, Dentsply Sirona will transform the dental market.
I'd like to thank our customers for their loyal support, trust and enthusiasm for Dentsply Sirona. We are pleased to recognize our distribution partners for helping us achieve our very successful quarter. I'd also like to extend a special thanks to our 15,000 employees who work hard each and every day to improve the lives of dentists and their patients. Together, we will change dentistry for the better.
We will now address your questions. Operator, please proceed.
Question-and-Answer Session

Thank you. And our first question will come from Jeff Johnson with Robert Baird.
Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Thank you. Can you hear me okay, guys?
Jeffrey T. Slovin - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Perfect.
Ulrich Michel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP
Good morning, Jeff.
Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
All right. Great. Congratulations, guys, on a good first quarter here. Jeff, just wanted to start with you and then I have a follow-up for Uli. But I know you've only been in the seat now for a couple months here running the combined companies. But as you put everything together, any sense yet on kind of how you're thinking about the next several years from a top line perspective or maybe from an earnings growth perspective, just how you're seeing the two companies come together?
Jeffrey T. Slovin - Chief Executive Officer & Director
New company, same old questions, right? Look, first of all, it is early days and I have to tell you I'm thrilled with what the team's been able to do together. Frankly, one of the nice surprises is to see how talented we are across the globe in sales, marketing, R&D and certainly our functional areas, HR and finance. It's a big deal when two of the largest companies come together to make sure that you have the right cultural fit.
But one thing is for sure that we aligned on is really on our mission, Jeff, which is to empower dental professionals to deliver better, safer and faster dental care. And this idea of end-to-end solutions is where we feel the market is going. So a key fundamental to the merger was growth. So we expect to grow faster in the future. And the reason for that is we're better together to be able to accelerate the adoption of technologies and digital dentistry.
Frankly, when we look at what is possible on the synergy side, as you look at our specialty areas as well as our technology, there's a lot of things that we see early days that are just going to continue to play for us. And, of course, single-visit dentistry is just getting stronger. It's difficult to say if we're at a tipping point yet, but we feel better about that and our ability to work with CAD/CAM and implant, and ortho certainly gives us a strong feel for our ability to mobilize our synergy opportunities. So there's a lot of genuine excitement here. And I think it's truly great for the dental industry and our distributor partners, because we're going to do a lot of great things together.
Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
All right. Great. And, Uli, maybe my follow-up question. As I look at the EPS guidance over the balance of this year, it looks like it's kind of low-single digits EPS growth. We don't have the pro forma net income, pro forma operating income from last year. But when I mash your two models together and look at kind of the net income, operating income growth this year, it looks like even on a pro forma combined basis this year over last year, it's going to be much higher than that low-single digit. So what am I missing there between the operating income and net income good solid growth and the EPS growth that looks like it's going to come in lower than that over the balance of the year?

Ulrich Michel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP
Yes. I think, Jeff, the best way to think about it or to bridge it for you is if we start with Dentsply's stand-alone EPS last year of $2.62, right? And we take the midpoint of our guidance this year, $2.75, so this would be a $0.13 increase, or a 5%, which we will probably refer to as low-single digits, right? Then I told you that we expect FX headwinds of about $0.10, which would add another 4%. And as you know, we've issued Dentsply shares in exchange for Sirona shares. And with the multiple difference we issued, depends on if you look at it trailing or forward-looking, but somewhere in the neighborhood of 15 million, 16 million more shares for the same earnings than had we issued the shares at the same multiple.
So this gives you a diluted impact for the full-year of somewhere in the neighborhood of $0.15 to $0.17, say $0.16 for argument's sake. So that's another 6%. And if you add this up, you look at EPS growth excluding FX and excluding the difference of the multiples on the issuance of about 15%. And if you use this, I think you can back into our earnings growth from there. Does that answer your question?
Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Yes. I'll go back and check my math, but that's helpful. Thank you, Uli.
Ulrich Michel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP
Thanks. You're welcome.
Jeffrey T. Slovin - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Thanks, Jeff.

And our next question comes from Robert Willoughby with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Tyler Harris - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)
Hey, guys. It's Tyler Harris in for Bob today. It looks like you guys had pretty impressive internal growth rates across the board in the quarter. Can you give us any additional color on specific countries markets growth rates, especially in regards to Europe and Asia Pacific?
Jeffrey T. Slovin - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Sure. So I think we were across the board strong. No question about it. Rest of the world led the way for us. And of course, in the rest of the world, let's start there, a number of those areas are challenged. Japan, of course, is a very important market for us. But it has its challenges, but we continue to perform well. You'll start to hear a theme here, Tyler. China also had some challenges, but very pleased with what the team was able to accomplish there. And even Brazil, which certainly has its challenges, we were able to do particularly well in the consumables area, which is pleasing for us.
We expect the rest of the world to be a growth driver for us for the rest of the year. In Europe, we did well. We haven't seen anything really change over the last six months. Frankly, Russia still has some challenges, but I was pleased with how the team was able to perform, especially looking at our pipeline ahead, we have a number of projects there. Southern Europe seems to be picking up for us, albeit it's a low base. Germany performed but did not lead Europe. And then we saw strong growth in both Technologies and Consumables in Europe. But I would caution that our second quarter will be a difficult comp because of IDS last year. And keep in mind that IDS was a record for us.
In the U.S., again, very strong growth led by Technologies and also up operatory consumables. We feel good about what we're able to accomplish. We also see that the U.S. market is improving and the underlying demand for our products are strong.
Tyler Harris - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)
Thank you.
Operator
And our next question comes from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.
Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Thanks for the questions. The original view was for the deal to be accretive in year one. Now, Jeff, that you've had a little bit more time, not a ton, but a little bit more time to put the companies together and evaluate, as well as evaluate the synergies a little bit more deeply, can you maybe just give us a better sense of what you're seeing as far as the accretion or what your expectation is as far as the accretion will be in 2016, specifically?

Jeffrey T. Slovin - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Well, specifically, we're not going to get into that. But we'd say we're not backing off of our being accretive over the first 12 months, absolutely. We see such positive ability to grow together. And, of course, we've had a little headwind that Uli has talked about, but by and large, everything is on track or doing better.
Again, 67 days into this, pleased about how the team has mobilized together. We've certainly got some FX headwinds, and as Uli, I think, did a very nice job earlier talked about the share count headwind as well. But from a standpoint of growth in this market 4% to 6%, we think is leading the way. And we feel good about our prospects for the rest of 2016. And we started our year with a very solid quarter. So I think we're in a good place, Bob.
Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Got it. Got it. And then I guess just one specific one on the Technology segment. Really nice growth there in the quarter. Was wondering if you could comment on the sales of CAD/CAM specifically? As your channel partner in North America had talked about carrying a higher level of inventory coming into this year, I'm just trying to get a balance between what may be they're holding versus what the end-market's really doing. Any comments around that will be very helpful.
Jeffrey T. Slovin - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Well, certainly, Technology led the way at 6.5% for the quarter and certainly was leading the way in the U.S. as well, and that was led by CAD/CAM. And so the proposition has not changed with regard to us believing that along with Patterson that CEREC will become a standard-of-care, and we're on the appropriate trajectory for that. Keep in mind also that we launched the new Zirconia Blocks, but more critical to that was our SpeedFire. So there was a lot of interests ahead of that, and I think that it's a situation where we've got a lot of opportunities for CEREC in North America and we'll continue to. Uli, do you want to comment...
Ulrich Michel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP
No, thank you. You mentioned it with the launch of the SpeedFire, I think people geared up to be ready to deliver, right? And we had a really good growth in CAD/CAM. I think there was nothing to be ashamed of, right? Very solid growth.
Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.
No, I agree. Thanks so much for the comments.
Jeffrey T. Slovin - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Thanks. You're welcome.

Our next question comes from John Kreger with William Blair.
Roberto V. Fatta - William Blair & Co. LLC
Hi. Good morning, guys. This is Robbie Fatta in for John today. Thanks for taking the question. As we think about the new segment structure, is there any additional detail you'll be giving going forward on some of the sub-segments? I know we just talked about CAD/CAM a little bit, but imaging or implants or any of the traditional sub-segments that we used to get more detail on, will we be getting any going forward?
Jeffrey T. Slovin - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Well, we'll certainly give you color for how they performed and certainly talk about new products. The idea is we spent a lot of time thinking about how best to structure our organization, how could it be most meaningful for our organization to grow, to create value, to be able to untap both cost and revenue synergies. And so that structure also means that when you look at our overall business that there isn't any business that is really more than 15%. So going down to our smallest, which is instruments. So we're trying to get people focused on Technology and Consumable, but certainly we'll deal with the strategic business units within it. You had mentioned imaging. Imaging had a solid quarter and grew above the technology average. It was across all regions. So it was pretty strong growth.

Roberto V. Fatta - William Blair & Co. LLC
Great. And if we could just focus on implants for a second then. Can you give us a sense what the growth was for that in the quarter? And then maybe our sense is that the potential synergies that you could generate is pretty big and the implant group's maybe the biggest out all of them. Is that a fair...
Jeffrey T. Slovin - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Let's start with that, because I think that is absolutely an on-point comment. We think implant is a strategic fulcrum for us. We see how it relates to both our CAD/CAM and imaging business. We believe we are well positioned with our product offerings there. We think this is a category that will continue to grow. We have certainly a strong product offering there. When you couple that with CEREC, ATLANTIS, SIMPLANT and ISUS, it's a robust offering.
Rest of the world did better for us there. We were pleased to see the volume come up, pick up a bit for us there. We saw some challenges in Europe, and certainly a market that we're very excited about that we think we can do a lot more in is in the U.S. Chris, you want to make a few more comments?
Christopher T. Clark - President and Chief Operating Officer, Technologies
Yes. Absolutely. Thanks, Jeff. I think I agree with all of those comments. I think this is one where both parties came with very significant and meaningful assets to come together. If you think about, again, the implant is going digital. Obviously, we have the CEREC, we have all the imaging coming from the Sirona side, we've got the ATLANTIS, SIMPLANT, ISUS coming from the Dentsply side.
And I would say, I'm very pleased with how these teams have come together, both from a standpoint of longer term or middle term, if you will, as well product synergies. But in addition to that, some nearer-term opportunities in terms of lead sharing, KOL sharing, et cetera, that, again, there's a lot of excitement, a lot of movement and a lot of energy. And, again, as Jeff mentioned, we've got expectations here that this really does accelerate implant growth rate and also, frankly, helps imaging and CAD/CAM over time as well.
Jeffrey T. Slovin - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yes. When you just think about the clinical education, the engagement of our KOLs, the possibility of what we're able to do together with our technologies and in implant are pretty substantial.
Roberto V. Fatta - William Blair & Co. LLC
Great. Thanks very much.

And our next question comes from Matt Miksic with UBS.
Vik Chopra - UBS Securities LLC
Hey. Good morning, guys. This is Vik in for Matt. Thanks for taking the questions. I just had a couple over here. So can you help us understand the puts and takes on gross margin? I know you had mentioned FX in your global efficiency programs. Anything in particular on product mix, for example? And then how should we think about gross margin for 2016? And anything in particular we should keep in mind over the next three quarters?
Jeffrey T. Slovin - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Well, let me start and then I'll hand it over to Uli on that. But you need to understand that product mix and regional mix can have a significant impact in any quarter. But now that we talk about our businesses, no business being greater than 15% coming all the way down to 3%, it should take some of that lumpiness out of it. But, nevertheless, in the quarter, it can have the impact of more than 75 basis points, over 100 basis points, depending on the mix. So mix does play a role, no question about it. But the way to start to think about that is how we talk about how the consumables or the technology businesses grew in the quarter. That's the first thing you need to think about. But we're trying to also get you focused on our operating income, which we think is a better lever to understand our businesses. But go ahead.

Ulrich Michel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP
Yes. I think, if you look at our margins in Q1, we provided you with the rec tables. I talked a little bit on the prepared remarks on the GAAP versus non-GAAP items. So, I think, what you see on the rec table is the margin a little bit over 60% reported for the first quarter after these adjustments.
I did mention that the fact that Sirona has a very strong margin. We only consolidated one month of Sirona, pronounced a little bit the benefit of the merger. So that also helped the gross profit margins. They were probably a tad higher in this recording than they would have been on the complete month. I also said this on the remark to operating margins. And the other thing to think about is the exchange rates. We're now at $1.14. The first quarter was a little bit lower. So that will hurt our gross profit margins, especially on the Technology segment, literally almost all of our manufacturing is euros, Swiss franc or Swedish krona based, right? So, for the full year I would expect them to be quite a bit lower than the 60% we saw in Q1. Again, due to FX and due to the fact that we will not always only have the best month of the quarter in the numbers.
Vik Chopra - UBS Securities LLC
Okay. That's very helpful. Thanks. And just one more, if I could. Can you give us a sense of some of the areas that you're monitoring that could potentially put you at either the bottom or the top end of your guidance beyond what you've seen in a very strong first quarter? Thank you.
Jeffrey T. Slovin - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Well, I think the way to think about it is the markets continue to hold up. We continue to see that our early wins on our revenue synergies accelerate faster than we had expected. We certainly have some tough comps ahead of us on Q2 and Q3. So how we are able to execute in those quarters will have a lot to do with the ability to go beyond. But, of course, as we were just talking about, the impact from sales and margin mix will play a big role in that.
Vik Chopra - UBS Securities LLC
Great. Thanks a lot.
Operator
And we'll move next to Jon Block with Stifel.
Jon Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Great. Thanks, guys, and good morning. Maybe, Jeff, just the first one for you, the balance sheet is, obviously, very strong. You completed the $500 million share repo. I think you're still only in and around one times levered debt-to-EBITDA. So just maybe at a high level, if you can talk about the company's ability to do acquisitions, even small ones, over the next 12 months or so, and I'm asking more from the capabilities around an integration standpoint, obviously, more so than financial.
Jeffrey T. Slovin - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Right. Okay. First of all, let me tell you one of the truly gems of Dentsply Sirona is our business development team. We have exceptionally capable people there that can process and digest a lot. The fact that we've been working at the global efficiency and now have a formalized integration office to deal with this puts us in better stead. We know which countries are the most stable and ones that it might be a little bit longer away to contemplate a M&A position there.
But by and large, I will tell you that our strategic plan is all about continuing to do acquisitions. It's day 67 and I can tell you we are right up to speed on what the possibilities are to go out there. Of course, when you are in the midst of this type of transformational merger, you do take into consideration your ability to integrate and how quickly we'd be able to do it. So that's all part and parcel for that. But from the standpoint of myself, the management team and the board, we believe we've got a lot of room that can grow through acquisition.

Jon Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Perfect. Very helpful. And just one more quick one for you, Uli. I don't believe the $2.70 to $2.80, I don't think that assumes much more in the way of share repos done this year. So can you just talk about that a little bit? If you guys go ahead and do incremental share repurchases, should we view that as marginal upsides to the $2.70 to $2.80? Thanks, guys.
Ulrich Michel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP
Yes. I think we told you that our guidance is based on a share count range of 220 million to 225 million. And as we leave Q1 and if our share price doesn't change anymore, because this has an impact of the diluted part of the options, we would end up the year about in the middle of what we told you, around 223 million shares. We gave you the range, because we still have an authorization left. We have about $3.6 million left on our buyback authorization. We do intend to execute on this. Timing depends on the availability of our cash flow and our other plans. So it does include the possibility that we buy back a bit more in the course of the year.
Jon Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Thanks for your time.
Jeffrey T. Slovin - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Thanks, Jon.
Ulrich Michel - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP
You're welcome, yes.

Our next question comes from Steve Beuchaw with Morgan Stanley.
Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hi. Good morning. Nice to have the gang back together here. First question is on synergies. Jeff, you reiterated the $125 million by year three that you laid out with Bret in the call last September. It'd be helpful just to hear at a high level how your thinking around the $125 million is evolving and then how you think about the pacing. You mentioned in a prior comment that you see the sales piece of that as a little bit more back-half loaded. Could you comment on the cost piece of that as well?
Jeffrey T. Slovin - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yes. I would say that we've already started on some of the cost. Cost is easier to identify, and you can go at it a little bit quicker. Certain corporate costs we've evaluated and come after insurance audit fees. The other thing is when you're doing country consolidations, there are overlaps with regard to software and duplication in functionality and functions. And, certainly, also from a sourcing perspective, we are at that, there are some quick wins that we've been able to talk about.
But equally, I think, we've spent a lot of time with our team. And, in a moment, I'm going to have Chris talk to you a little about that, because he's been leading the way with revenue synergies, and we're really pleased to see how well the teams have come together to collaborate. Again, keep in mind it's day 67, but the type of wins that we're talking about that make sense for the dental practitioner, for our distribution partners, for Dentsply Sirona are really coming up.
From a perspective of the three years, the $125 million. Again, we're not backing away from that. We're very confident about it. But to give more color at this time about what we'll map in as far as year two and year three, I don't think we're – well, I know we're not going to talk about that today, Steve. But we tried, in my prepared remarks, to really give you a lot of things that we're working on that will have a big impact. Chris?
Christopher T. Clark - President and Chief Operating Officer, Technologies
Yes. I guess, Steve, I'd characterize it is follows. As I mentioned on the implants discussion that there's a lot of energy here and that's true, frankly, for all of the different work streams that we have going and these are numerous. You should think about the work streams really being both within the two segments and then across the two segments as well.

You should think about them being focused on product synergies, again, being probably more a little – think of that a little bit more innovation-based or R&D-based. There are some that are probably intermediate term, some longer-term. But again, those are probably going to be on the tail-end, if you will, or at least the back half of the three-year period. Some may be a little bit before then. And a lot of energy going there, again, when we get our scientists together, when we get our marketers together, and really think about the possibilities in terms of combined solutions.
On the other hand then, in the nearer term, on the commercial synergies think about, again, our sales and marketers getting together and talking about programmatically what can we do to drive more value with our customers together. And, again, you can think about that in terms of promotions, in terms of how we present ourselves to our customers, in terms of, as I mentioned earlier, KOLs, clinical education, et cetera. And so, again, there's a lot of energy, many, many work streams here. But, again, we're excited about how our people are engaging. And I think that bodes well for the trajectory and where we head, frankly, not just this year but over the three-year period and beyond.
Jeffrey T. Slovin - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Again, digital dentistry, clinical education, if you just, Steve, think about how many trainings and educations we do where we never had any of our products also in the room when you're doing a training on ortho, implant, endo, where that can play in. And it works both ways. And, certainly, nobody's done better than Dentsply Sirona in clinical education, and that is valued highly by the dental professional.
Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it. Thanks for all that color. Just one follow-up, actually, to a comment that you made earlier, Jeff, the language you used was something to the effect of our corporate strategy is all about M&A. I can't say it's a terribly surprising comment, but it would help given that comment and context to hear how you and the rest of the board think about your priorities and commitments around M&A, how do you think about the returns that you would require and what sort of strategic imperatives are you really trying to address there on the street? Thank you.
Jeffrey T. Slovin - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah. I mean, look, this is certainly from a standpoint of the bigger picture what we look at. We are first and foremost a innovator, right? And so, technology matters, so we're out there, we're looking at businesses that maybe need a larger company infrastructure. They've got something that they're either just finished with or they need more resources to finish that, that's something that's very important, something both companies have done extremely well.
And then, we take a look at what can we add to our SBUs? What would be a additional add-on that would help growth or the adoption of the technology or sell more of the consumables certainly. And let's not forget the regional play which is why I said we have to look at each country within the stability level there.
Certainly, again, we look for the acquisition to be accretive. And if it's not going to be accretive, we've got to be able to explain to you very quickly why this will get there in a fast enough form that is necessary. ROIC has always been something that is significant to us and hasn't changed. I think we have a very robust process internally that we go through.
Frankly, I wanted to highlight it earlier because I think the team's truly extraordinary. And that was something that I can tell you from a standpoint at Sirona, we were good, Dentsply is great. And so, coming together on that makes a big difference. Also, we've been able to have discussions with our board about that. We recognize that capital allocation is a critical component. We think that we're one of the few companies that can be a true consolidator in this industry. And so, there's a lot of room for that to take place over the years to come.

And as you know, like anything, you have to be ready to seize the opportunity when it becomes available. And I think that's the point that we want to stress. Yes, we have to integrate. Yes, we understand that priority. And our 15,000 know our first and foremost is to them and to our shareholders and stakeholders to make sure our nucleus is strong but after that, we just see plenty of opportunities. Now, we're going to stay disciplined. That doesn't change. But that's part of our roadmap. And I want to be crystal clear about that.
Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Thanks so much, guys.
Operator
And our next question comes from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan.
Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hey. Thanks. I want to go back to one of the questions earlier on CAD/CAM. I understand you guys don't want to give numbers for the quarter. But I'm wondering if you could just talk a little bit about underlying market growth for that market. You've got a number of dynamics here with the Zirconia workflow and obviously, some of your competitors. So, can you maybe just talk about how you see the growth trajectory for CAD/CAM for the next couple of years?
Jeffrey T. Slovin - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Hi, Tycho. Nice to hear from you. I mean, look we did give color that CAD/CAM led technology grew faster than the overall technology. And that's because single-visit dentistry is here to stay. You're hearing it more and more. In ortho, it's growing the fastest, I would say, around the globe. But you won't hear from the dental community or distribution a disagreement about chair side becoming the standard of care. We've heard more about digital impression only but that's typically in ortho. And, of course, our Zirconia, it's really a game changer. When you think about this material and the strength of it, and also the aesthetics and how it compares to others, typically, Zirconia has been something that you would only do through the lab and of course, our Cercon ht is a product that we're excited about that will deliver through the lab as well. But from a chair side perspective, you never considered it because it took two hours to sinter. Now, with the SpeedFire, it's 15 minutes.
Why is this so significant? Because Zirconia is a terrific material for molars and certain bridges and actually very popular amongst dentists. And so, to be able to have this type of ceramic be available at chair side just truly opens up our addressable market. And by addressable market, we're not talking about adding 2,000 or 3,000 more dentists who are interested. We're talking about tens of thousands of dentists that will now take a look at this opportunity where they wouldn't have before. So, we believe that's just another reason why CEREC makes sense.
But the other thing, frankly, is the fact that, now, everybody is talking about not just restorative, but we're talking about what you can do with CEREC on an implant and ortho side. And I have to say that we were at the AAO and in a second I'm going to ask Chris to tell you about that flavor. But you just see the appetite for digital impression and what the possibilities are for all types of applications. And I think that was a bit of the story at the AAO.
Christopher T. Clark - President and Chief Operating Officer, Technologies
Absolutely, Jeff. I mean, there's no doubt that a lot of energy regarding digital at the orthodontic show. Obviously, we're there and well positioned with the Omnicam. And, again, I think that as we look at the synergies of these companies coming together, there's no doubt that similar to implants, ortho is really one of the key fulcrums and one of the key opportunities. So, we're excited about that. I think that we're well positioned for where this market is headed. And, again, I think that really, as we move forward, I would expect that to be one of the key synergies.

Jeffrey T. Slovin - Chief Executive Officer & Director
I mean, it's a beautiful thing that the ortho to be the most open and also to have a clear aligner in our MTM for the anterior, which is exciting for us.
Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Great. I'll leave it at that. Thank you.
Jeffrey T. Slovin - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Thank you.
Christopher T. Clark - President and Chief Operating Officer, Technologies
Thanks, Tycho.

And there are no further telephone questions at this time. I'd like to turn the conference back over to management for any additional or closing remarks.

Thank you very much for joining us on our first ever first quarter conference call as Dentsply Sirona. Very excited what we have ahead of us. Our 15,000 strong are ready to go and have another strong quarter in Q2. So, I look forward to joining you in August to discuss our second quarter results. Thank you and have a great weekend.
