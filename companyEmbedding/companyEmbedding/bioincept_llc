About BioIncept, LLC





BioIncept, founded in 2001, is a clinical-stage privately held company committed to the development of transformative therapeutic and diagnostic products based on the discovery of the PreImplantation Factor (PIF).
Naturally occurring in mammalian embryos, PIF has broad regulatory implications in pregnancy, immunity, inflammation and transplant. Synthetic human-grade PIF was developed to translate the PIF effect for intended use in clinical trials.  As a result of extensive preclinical research conducted at leading academic institutions and centers of excellence, the Barnea Research Group — a worldwide network of PIF researchers — actively publishes PIF findings in peer-reviewed journals.
BioIncept pursues and prioritizes a range of clinical protocols in the areas of autoimmunity, neuro-regeneration, transplantation, oncology and pregnancy.  The company is assembling its Scientific Advisory Board comprised of key opinion leaders from across the PIF platform of disciplines.





In a First-in-Human (FIH) university-sponsored clinical trial, BioIncept currently evaluates PIF in an orphan autoimmune disease (NCT02239562). This trial was granted FAST-TRACK designation by the Food & Drug Administration (FDA). University-sponsored PIF Phase II clinical trials are planned for 2016. BioIncept is exploring additional clinical protocols within representative immune, inflammatory and transplant disorders.
With a top-tier management team, a global network of scientific collaborators and a robust intellectual property portfolio/patent estate, BioIncept is well positioned to achieve its mission of delivering on the promise of PIF for patients with significant unmet medical needs.

About PreImplantation Factor (PIF)





PIF is pivotal for reproductive success and immune modulation. The discovery of PIF represents a paradigm shift in understanding mammalian pregnancy; its premise is that the burden of successful pregnancy resides not with the mother as previously thought, but with the embryo/fetus and its ability to secrete PIF.
While researching causative factors associated with early pregnancy, Dr. Eytan Barnea discovered PIF, a naturally occurring peptide secreted only by viable mammalian embryos. PIF is secreted and detected as early as the 2-cell stage, and it continues to do so throughout pregnancy. In non-viable embryos, PIF is either absent or negligible. The discovery of PIF helps to explain why, at the inception of and during pregnancy, the mother’s immune system does not reject the embryo. This event, at its very core, is a perfect transplant in a well-adapted immune environment. PIF enables maternal immunity to simultaneously tolerate the embryo and continue to protect both mother and embryo against disease.
The Barnea Research Group, a worldwide network of PIF researchers, quickly ascertained that PIF’s immune-modulatory effects offer potential therapeutic benefits across diverse disease areas in pregnancy, and extending into disorders of immunity and transplant. Synthetic PIF, currently used in clinical trials, was produced following the identification of native PIF. To date, PIF has been studied in more than 25 different mammalian pregnant and non-pregnant models, generating compelling evidence to establish PIF’s potential impact as a diagnostic and single therapeutic agent. PIF-based diagnostics for in vitro fertilization (IVF) viable embryo identification is currently in multicenter clinical trials. In parallel, research continues to study PIF’s mode of action, corroborating its comprehensive local and systemic regulatory role.
Possible PIF translational applications identified and studied to date include: pregnancy (i.e. embryo viability, recurrent pregnancy loss, premature labor / preeclampsia), immunity (i.e. disorders affecting the liver, gastrointestinal tract and skin), injury (i.e. traumatic brain injury, acute radiation syndrome), and transplant (i.e. bone marrow and organs).






Unlike immune suppressant drugs that are associated with serious side effects, PIF regulates local and systemic immune response through targeted effects in a safe, nontoxic manner. PIF represents a New Drug Entity (NDE), and given its potential and high safety margin, was awarded the coveted Fast-Track designation by the FDA.This discovery has broad translational therapeutic implications for treating pregnancy disorders, organ transplant rejection and immune diseases. PIF is at the center of numerous current and upcoming human clinical trials worldwide (www.clinicaltrials.gov).

Our Team






The BioIncept Management Team


 DR. JACQUELINE H. BARNEAPresident, CEO, Chair, and Co-Founder of BioIncept, LLCDr. Jacqueline H. Barnea is the President, CEO and co-founder of BioIncept, LLC, a clinical stage biotechnology and intellectual property portfolio holding company that develops and manages the translation of the PreImplantation Factor (PIF) platform towards its intended clinical potential. Dr. Barnea brings her global vision, adaptability, flexibility and out-of-the-box thinking to this transformational technology project. She creates, adapts, and brings consensus to the scientific, legal and patent management of the PreImplantation Factor (PIF), the paradigm-shifting technology that is PIF.
Having earned her Doctorate summa cum laude in International Business Law in 1976 from the Sorbonne-Pantheon University in Paris, Dr. Barnea taught graduate-level students and corporate executive courses in decision-making, comparative management, international negotiations and marketing, while preparing for a corporate law and academic career. She redirected her career towards biotechnology upon co-founding BioIncept.
Dr. Barnea brings nearly two decades of uniquely adapted biotech building experience to BioIncept’s vast transformational platform. This journey began with global collaborations with leading scientists at prominent institutions, who then independently produced their own data and validated PIF scientific results. She has guided the PIF project from its inception to clinical reality, forging an innovative path for PIF by carefully monitoring pharmaceutical transition and adaptive reality. Dr. Barnea has surrounded herself with expert advisors and respected legal and patent teams to help her guide the Company successfully through uncharted territory.
Her next step at BioIncept is to safely shepherd PIF through FDA-approved, University-sponsored Phase I/II clinical trials, both therapeutic and diagnostic. At the completion of those trials, Dr. Barnea and her team will position BioIncept to leverage the appropriate industry partnerships to ensure that PIF reaches its full potential and that BioIncept provides therapeutic and diagnostic products to address a vast array of unmet global needs. DR. EYTAN R. BARNEA, MD, FACOG*Chief Scientific Officer, Director, and Co-Founder of BioIncept, LLCDr. Eytan R. Barnea discovered the PreImplantation Factor (PIF) and is the Chief Scientific Officer and co-founder of BioIncept, LLC, a clinical stage company. His investigations of embryo-derived signaling in pregnancy translate his observations to clinical applications in fertility and immune regulation.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
