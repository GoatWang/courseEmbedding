Product UPC Bar Code





Why do we need this?
Where is the UPC number? It is located below the bar codes which are scanned at stores.

Please note: Many Colgate toothpaste tubes do not display a UPC Code; it is located on the side of the outer carton, so a complete product name is very helpful to ensure we can provide you with easy and fast service.
Why do we need the UPC Number? We need this information to ensure we can help you with the specific product you are writing about. It is not required information however; it will expedite our response to you when provided.

Our Policy on Ingredient Safety: Earning Your Confidence for Generations, Every Day









Every day, millions of families around the world show their confidence in Colgate-Palmolive. They trust our toothpaste and toothbrushes for their families, rely on our soaps and body washes to stay healthy and fresh, choose our cleaners to care for their homes, and feed our pet foods to the dogs and cats they love. Colgate-Palmolive began earning this confidence more than 200 years ago by offering the highest quality products, and we know the trust we’ve earned over generations has to be earned anew every day. Earning your trust begins with the ingredients we choose.
Committed to Safety and Science
All of the ingredients we use in our products are safe for people and the environment. They meet our strict safety standards and all applicable government regulations everywhere they are sold around the world. The decisions we make on ingredients are based on a thorough evaluation of the latest scientific evidence. When we choose an ingredient – whether to contribute to the performance of a product or to keep it safe against microorganisms – it is first prescreened by a team of Colgate-Palmolive scientists. Every ingredient is assessed alone and within a formula to ensure that nothing unexpected will occur. Our ingredient review assesses not just what happens in our laboratories, but across a range of real-world conditions – during manufacturing, in transportation, at the store, in consumers’ homes, and after consumer use. We continuously monitor and evaluate the safety of our ingredients and we actively engage outside experts and resources to understand emerging science and deepen our knowledge. We seek the facts so that we can make the right decisions.
Listening to Consumers
We want consumers to continue to have confidence in our products and the ingredients we use. Our ingredient information is easily accessible in the Drug Facts labels on our toothpastes and mouthwashes, and on the labels of many other products. We listen to our consumers and the questions they raise about ingredients. Where we see opportunities regarding ingredients that are raising consumer questions, we substitute with other safe ingredients that provide the same or better benefits without sacrificing quality. Through this ongoing effort, we no longer use – or are on our way to eliminating – some of the ingredients currently raising consumer questions. We’re listening and formulating our products with our consumers in mind to keep earning their confidence.
 Ingredient Updates Formaldehyde and Formaldehyde Donors While formaldehyde and formaldehyde donors are safe when used at approved regulatory levels, we recognize that consumers have questions. Colgate-Palmolive does not add formaldehyde to any of our products and is committed to eliminating formaldehyde donors from our formulations. Globally, we do not use formaldehyde donors as a preservative system in any of our Oral Care products and have eliminated their use in our Home Care products. By the end of 2017, we expect to eliminate their use as a preservative in a limited number of remaining Personal Care products in North America and Latin America. Parabens Parabens are widely used preservatives, commonly found in foods, cosmetics and drug products. They are usually easy to identify by name, such as methylparaben, propylparaben, butylparaben or benzylparaben. Parabens inhibit the growth of bacteria and mold to maintain product integrity and protect consumer safety. Parabens have been used for many years, reviewed by regulatory bodies around the world, and are considered safe. However, some consumers have questions about their safety. To maintain consumer confidence, we have reformulated our products using alternative, safe preservative systems and are no longer using parabens as of July 2016. U.S. FDA Parabens Consumer Update: http://www.fda.gov/cosmetics/productsingredients/ingredients/ucm128042.htm Phthalates Phthalates are a group of organic compounds used in hundreds of products. They have been used safely for many years in personal care products, including to improve the performance of fragrances. Although there is no accepted scientific basis for avoiding phthalates, some consumers question their safety, so as of year-end 2014 we stopped stopped using this ingredient.. Triclosan Triclosan is the antibacterial ingredient in Colgate Total toothpaste, where the proven therapeutic benefits it provides as part of our unique copolymer system are unsurpassed. Colgate Total is clinically proven to work better than other toothpastes to reduce the germs that can cause the gum disease gingivitis. In the U.S., the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has recognized the effectiveness and safety of triclosan in Colgate Total toothpaste. We remain strongly committed to Colgate Total, which is the only toothpaste that has undergone the FDA's rigorous New Drug Application process for safety and efficacy. It is supported by more than 90 clinical studies involving over 20,000 people, its clinically proven benefits are unsurpassed, and it is approved by regulators and recommended by the dental profession around the world. Triclosan has been reviewed and approved as safe by regulators around the world, including by an expert European scientific committee that approved the use of triclosan in rinse-off cosmetic products following a full review of the scientific evidence. However, we recognize that some consumers have questions about triclosan and choose to avoid this ingredient in products where they believe it does not deliver a benefit to health. So while the use of triclosan continues to be permitted by regulators around the world, we have reformulated our antibacterial dish liquid and hand soaps with alternate active ingredients that provide the same or superior performance. U.S. FDA Triclosan Update: http://www.fda.gov/forconsumers/consumerupdates/ucm205999.htm Microplastics Colgate-Palmolive used microbeads in a limited number of oral care and personal care products to enhance aesthetics and aid in cleaning. However, some groups raised concerns regarding the potential contribution of microbeads to pollution of the world’s oceans. Recognizing that consumers have questions, as of year-end 2014 we stopped using microbeads. More recently, consumer questions have extended beyond microbeads to some polymer-based materials, many of which dissolve in water and biodegrade. Colgate-Palmolive continues to monitor the science and evaluate our use of polymer-based ingredients to ensure continued improvements in the environmental profile of our products. All exit dates represent the last date of manufacture.

History[edit]




1922 advertisement for Palmolive soap


In 1806 devout Baptist English immigrant soap and candle maker William Colgate established a starch, soap, and candle factory on Dutch Street in New York City under the name "William Colgate & Company". In 1833 he suffered a severe heart attack, stopping his business' sales; after a convalescence he continued with his business. In the 1840s the firm began selling individual cakes of soap in uniform weights. In 1857 Colgate died and the company was reorganized as "Colgate & Company" under the management of his devout Baptist son Samuel Colgate, who did not want to continue the business but thought it would be the right thing to do. In 1872 he introduced Cashmere Bouquet, a perfumed soap. In 1873 the firm introduced its first Colgate Toothpaste, an aromatic toothpaste sold in jars.[4] In 1896, the company sold the first toothpaste in a tube, Colgate Ribbon Dental Cream (invented by dentist Washington Sheffield). Also in 1896, Colgate hired Martin Ittner and under his direction founded one of the first applied research labs.[5] By 1908 they initiated mass sales of toothpaste in tubes. William's other son, James Boorman Colgate, was a primary trustee of Colgate University (formerly Madison University).




1915 magazine ad


In Milwaukee, Wisconsin, the B.J. Johnson Company was making a soap entirely of palm oil and olive oil, the formula of which was developed by B.J. Johnson in 1898. The soap was popular enough to rename their company after it — "Palmolive".[6] Around the start of the 20th century Palmolive, which contained both palm and olive oils, was the world's best-selling soap. Extensive advertising included the radio programs The Palmolive Hour (1927-1931) and Palmolive Beauty Box Theater (1934-1937). A Missouri-based soap manufacturer known as Peet Brothers merged with Palmolive to become Palmolive-Peet. In 1928, Palmolive-Peet bought the Colgate Company to create the Colgate-Palmolive-Peet Company. In 1953 "Peet" was dropped from the title, leaving only "Colgate-Palmolive Company", the current name.
Colgate-Palmolive has long been in competition with Procter & Gamble, the world's largest soap and detergent maker. P&G introduced its Tide laundry detergent shortly after World War II, and thousands of consumers turned from Colgate's soaps to the new product. Colgate lost its number one place in the toothpaste market when P&G added fluoride to its toothpaste. In the beginning of TV, Colgate-Palmolive wished to compete with P&G as a sponsor of soap operas and sponsored many soaps in full or in part including The Doctors.
George Henry Lesch, president, CEO, and chairman of the board of Colgate-Palmolive in the 1960s and 1970s, during that time transformed it into a modern company with major restructuring.
In 2005, Colgate sold the under-performing brands Fab, Dynamo, Arctic Power, ABC, Cold Power and Fresh Start, as well as the license of the Ajax brand for laundry detergents in the US, Canada and Puerto Rico, to Phoenix Brands, LLC as part of their plan to focus on their higher margin oral, personal, and pet care products.[7][8]
In 2006, Colgate-Palmolive announced the intended acquisition of Tom's of Maine, a leading maker of natural toothpaste, for US $100 million.[9] Tom's of Maine was founded by Tom Chappell in 1970.
Today, Colgate has numerous subsidiary organizations spanning 200 countries, but it is publicly listed in only two, the United States and India.
On October 25, 2012, the company announced it would cut 2,310 workers, or 6% of its workforce, by the end of 2016 in a push to make the consumer products company more efficient.[10][11]
Educational and community involvement[edit]
In 1890, Madison University in New York State was renamed Colgate University in honor of the Colgate family following decades of financial support and involvement.[12]
The Colgate-Palmolive Company has sponsored a non-profit track meet open to women of all ages called the Colgate Women's Games.[13] The Colgate Women's Games is the nation's largest amateur track series open to all girls from elementary school through college. Held at Brooklyn's Pratt Institute, competitors participate in preliminary meets and semi-finals over five weekends throughout January. Finalists compete for trophies and educational grants-in-aid from Colgate-Palmolive Company at New York City's Madison Square Garden in February. For more than 20 years, the company supports the Starlight Children Foundation which is a non profit organization dedicated to help seriously ill children and their families. The mission is to help children to cope with pain, fear and isolation through entertainment, family activities and education.(2012)
Ethical record[edit]
The Ethical Consumer Research Association once recommended that its readers not buy Colgate because of its use of animal testing, though this is no longer the case.[citation needed] In 2011, Colgate-Palmolive was one of the first companies recognized by PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) under the new "working for regulatory change" category for companies that test on animals only when mandated by government regulations and are actively seeking alternatives to animal testing.[14] This relates to the corporation's decision to continue to participate in the profitable Chinese market, where some animal testing is still a regulatory requirement.[15] Other ethical companies have chosen to decline entry to this market.[16]
In 2006 Colgate-Palmolive acquired an 84% stake in Tom's of Maine.[9][17]
In 2011 the company chose to retain the use of the antibacterial agent triclosan in its market-leading Total toothpaste range, despite withdrawing it from several other product ranges, following concerns about triclosan's impact on health and the environment.[18]
Environmental record[edit]
Products of the Colgate-Palmolive company, specifically "Total" brand toothpaste contain triclosan. This ingredient has a questionable impact on waterways and marine life.
Colgate consumes approximately 0.2 percent of the combined palm oil output of Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand,[19] the cultivation of which is known for environmental impacts on a global level including: deforestation, loss of natural habitats of critically endangered species, and increased greenhouse gas emissions.
Colgate-Palmolive, as a successor to The Mennen Company, is one of about 300 companies held potentially responsible for hazardous waste at the Chemsol federal Superfund site in Piscataway, New Jersey.[20] Their involvement in this site may have contributed to the contamination of an estimated 18,500 cubic yards (14,100 m3) of soil with volatile organic compounds (VOCs), PCBs, and lead off-site. A proposed $23 million agreement with the government and state of New Jersey would require Colgate-Palmolive and the other involved companies to pay for the cleanup of this hazardous waste that is contaminating the soil as well as the groundwater.[21] The company completed a LEED Silver certified manufacturing plant in Morristown, Tennessee in March 2008 which was the first of its kind in the U.S. The new LEED silver certified plant in Tennessee produces the Colgate Total toothpaste.[22]
Colgate Palmolive received the 2012 Safe-in-Sound Excellence in Hearing Loss Prevention Award.[23]
Anti-competitive practices[edit]
Colgate Palmolive was fined by Autorité de la concurrence in France in 2016 for price-fixing on personal hygiene products.[24]
Hill's Colgate (Japan)[edit]
In November 2016, Hill's-Colgate (Japan) Ltd. announced it will change its name to Colgate-Palmolive Japan Ltd. in 2017. However in February 2017 Cook stated that it is considering its first manufacturing plant in Japan. By the beginning of 2019, the 50,000 square feet facility will open while 50,000 jobs or addition install 150 robots annually.

Employment diversity[edit]
Colgate-Palmolive was named one of the "100 Best Companies for Working Mothers" by Working Mother magazine.[25] The 2012 Human Rights Campaign "report card" on American businesses gave Colgate an A for its support of diversity in the workplace.

Notes:
* While detergent brands continue to be manufactured and sold by Colgate-Palmolive in some countries, in the United States they have been sold to another company, Phoenix Brands, and are no longer made by C-P in the U.S.[44] In May 2015, Colgate-Palmolive sold its Australian laundry detergents and pre-wash brands to Henkel for US$245 million (€220 million).[45] Colgate-Palmolive has divested its laundry detergents business in Colombia, which was in turn acquired by Unilever and some Asian countries, which was acquired by Procter & Gamble.[46]
** Still being made by Colgate-Palmolive internationally, but no longer available in the U.S.
Vintage commercials for many of these discontinued C-P products can still be seen on YouTube.

History[edit]




1922 advertisement for Palmolive soap


In 1806 devout Baptist English immigrant soap and candle maker William Colgate established a starch, soap, and candle factory on Dutch Street in New York City under the name "William Colgate & Company". In 1833 he suffered a severe heart attack, stopping his business' sales; after a convalescence he continued with his business. In the 1840s the firm began selling individual cakes of soap in uniform weights. In 1857 Colgate died and the company was reorganized as "Colgate & Company" under the management of his devout Baptist son Samuel Colgate, who did not want to continue the business but thought it would be the right thing to do. In 1872 he introduced Cashmere Bouquet, a perfumed soap. In 1873 the firm introduced its first Colgate Toothpaste, an aromatic toothpaste sold in jars.[4] In 1896, the company sold the first toothpaste in a tube, Colgate Ribbon Dental Cream (invented by dentist Washington Sheffield). Also in 1896, Colgate hired Martin Ittner and under his direction founded one of the first applied research labs.[5] By 1908 they initiated mass sales of toothpaste in tubes. William's other son, James Boorman Colgate, was a primary trustee of Colgate University (formerly Madison University).




1915 magazine ad


In Milwaukee, Wisconsin, the B.J. Johnson Company was making a soap entirely of palm oil and olive oil, the formula of which was developed by B.J. Johnson in 1898. The soap was popular enough to rename their company after it — "Palmolive".[6] Around the start of the 20th century Palmolive, which contained both palm and olive oils, was the world's best-selling soap. Extensive advertising included the radio programs The Palmolive Hour (1927-1931) and Palmolive Beauty Box Theater (1934-1937). A Missouri-based soap manufacturer known as Peet Brothers merged with Palmolive to become Palmolive-Peet. In 1928, Palmolive-Peet bought the Colgate Company to create the Colgate-Palmolive-Peet Company. In 1953 "Peet" was dropped from the title, leaving only "Colgate-Palmolive Company", the current name.
Colgate-Palmolive has long been in competition with Procter & Gamble, the world's largest soap and detergent maker. P&G introduced its Tide laundry detergent shortly after World War II, and thousands of consumers turned from Colgate's soaps to the new product. Colgate lost its number one place in the toothpaste market when P&G added fluoride to its toothpaste. In the beginning of TV, Colgate-Palmolive wished to compete with P&G as a sponsor of soap operas and sponsored many soaps in full or in part including The Doctors.
George Henry Lesch, president, CEO, and chairman of the board of Colgate-Palmolive in the 1960s and 1970s, during that time transformed it into a modern company with major restructuring.
In 2005, Colgate sold the under-performing brands Fab, Dynamo, Arctic Power, ABC, Cold Power and Fresh Start, as well as the license of the Ajax brand for laundry detergents in the US, Canada and Puerto Rico, to Phoenix Brands, LLC as part of their plan to focus on their higher margin oral, personal, and pet care products.[7][8]
In 2006, Colgate-Palmolive announced the intended acquisition of Tom's of Maine, a leading maker of natural toothpaste, for US $100 million.[9] Tom's of Maine was founded by Tom Chappell in 1970.
Today, Colgate has numerous subsidiary organizations spanning 200 countries, but it is publicly listed in only two, the United States and India.
On October 25, 2012, the company announced it would cut 2,310 workers, or 6% of its workforce, by the end of 2016 in a push to make the consumer products company more efficient.[10][11]
Educational and community involvement[edit]
In 1890, Madison University in New York State was renamed Colgate University in honor of the Colgate family following decades of financial support and involvement.[12]
The Colgate-Palmolive Company has sponsored a non-profit track meet open to women of all ages called the Colgate Women's Games.[13] The Colgate Women's Games is the nation's largest amateur track series open to all girls from elementary school through college. Held at Brooklyn's Pratt Institute, competitors participate in preliminary meets and semi-finals over five weekends throughout January. Finalists compete for trophies and educational grants-in-aid from Colgate-Palmolive Company at New York City's Madison Square Garden in February. For more than 20 years, the company supports the Starlight Children Foundation which is a non profit organization dedicated to help seriously ill children and their families. The mission is to help children to cope with pain, fear and isolation through entertainment, family activities and education.(2012)
Ethical record[edit]
The Ethical Consumer Research Association once recommended that its readers not buy Colgate because of its use of animal testing, though this is no longer the case.[citation needed] In 2011, Colgate-Palmolive was one of the first companies recognized by PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) under the new "working for regulatory change" category for companies that test on animals only when mandated by government regulations and are actively seeking alternatives to animal testing.[14] This relates to the corporation's decision to continue to participate in the profitable Chinese market, where some animal testing is still a regulatory requirement.[15] Other ethical companies have chosen to decline entry to this market.[16]
In 2006 Colgate-Palmolive acquired an 84% stake in Tom's of Maine.[9][17]
In 2011 the company chose to retain the use of the antibacterial agent triclosan in its market-leading Total toothpaste range, despite withdrawing it from several other product ranges, following concerns about triclosan's impact on health and the environment.[18]
Environmental record[edit]
Products of the Colgate-Palmolive company, specifically "Total" brand toothpaste contain triclosan. This ingredient has a questionable impact on waterways and marine life.
Colgate consumes approximately 0.2 percent of the combined palm oil output of Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand,[19] the cultivation of which is known for environmental impacts on a global level including: deforestation, loss of natural habitats of critically endangered species, and increased greenhouse gas emissions.
Colgate-Palmolive, as a successor to The Mennen Company, is one of about 300 companies held potentially responsible for hazardous waste at the Chemsol federal Superfund site in Piscataway, New Jersey.[20] Their involvement in this site may have contributed to the contamination of an estimated 18,500 cubic yards (14,100 m3) of soil with volatile organic compounds (VOCs), PCBs, and lead off-site. A proposed $23 million agreement with the government and state of New Jersey would require Colgate-Palmolive and the other involved companies to pay for the cleanup of this hazardous waste that is contaminating the soil as well as the groundwater.[21] The company completed a LEED Silver certified manufacturing plant in Morristown, Tennessee in March 2008 which was the first of its kind in the U.S. The new LEED silver certified plant in Tennessee produces the Colgate Total toothpaste.[22]
Colgate Palmolive received the 2012 Safe-in-Sound Excellence in Hearing Loss Prevention Award.[23]
Anti-competitive practices[edit]
Colgate Palmolive was fined by Autorité de la concurrence in France in 2016 for price-fixing on personal hygiene products.[24]
Hill's Colgate (Japan)[edit]
In November 2016, Hill's-Colgate (Japan) Ltd. announced it will change its name to Colgate-Palmolive Japan Ltd. in 2017. However in February 2017 Cook stated that it is considering its first manufacturing plant in Japan. By the beginning of 2019, the 50,000 square feet facility will open while 50,000 jobs or addition install 150 robots annually.
Corporate governance[edit]
Current members of the board of directors of Colgate-Palmolive are:

Ian M. Cook, Chairman, President and CEO
John T. Cahill
Ellen Hancock
Richard Kogan
Delano Lewis
Pedro Reinhard
Stephen Sadove

Employment diversity[edit]
Colgate-Palmolive was named one of the "100 Best Companies for Working Mothers" by Working Mother magazine.[25] The 2012 Human Rights Campaign "report card" on American businesses gave Colgate an A for its support of diversity in the workplace.

History[edit]




1922 advertisement for Palmolive soap


In 1806 devout Baptist English immigrant soap and candle maker William Colgate established a starch, soap, and candle factory on Dutch Street in New York City under the name "William Colgate & Company". In 1833 he suffered a severe heart attack, stopping his business' sales; after a convalescence he continued with his business. In the 1840s the firm began selling individual cakes of soap in uniform weights. In 1857 Colgate died and the company was reorganized as "Colgate & Company" under the management of his devout Baptist son Samuel Colgate, who did not want to continue the business but thought it would be the right thing to do. In 1872 he introduced Cashmere Bouquet, a perfumed soap. In 1873 the firm introduced its first Colgate Toothpaste, an aromatic toothpaste sold in jars.[4] In 1896, the company sold the first toothpaste in a tube, Colgate Ribbon Dental Cream (invented by dentist Washington Sheffield). Also in 1896, Colgate hired Martin Ittner and under his direction founded one of the first applied research labs.[5] By 1908 they initiated mass sales of toothpaste in tubes. William's other son, James Boorman Colgate, was a primary trustee of Colgate University (formerly Madison University).




1915 magazine ad


In Milwaukee, Wisconsin, the B.J. Johnson Company was making a soap entirely of palm oil and olive oil, the formula of which was developed by B.J. Johnson in 1898. The soap was popular enough to rename their company after it — "Palmolive".[6] Around the start of the 20th century Palmolive, which contained both palm and olive oils, was the world's best-selling soap. Extensive advertising included the radio programs The Palmolive Hour (1927-1931) and Palmolive Beauty Box Theater (1934-1937). A Missouri-based soap manufacturer known as Peet Brothers merged with Palmolive to become Palmolive-Peet. In 1928, Palmolive-Peet bought the Colgate Company to create the Colgate-Palmolive-Peet Company. In 1953 "Peet" was dropped from the title, leaving only "Colgate-Palmolive Company", the current name.
Colgate-Palmolive has long been in competition with Procter & Gamble, the world's largest soap and detergent maker. P&G introduced its Tide laundry detergent shortly after World War II, and thousands of consumers turned from Colgate's soaps to the new product. Colgate lost its number one place in the toothpaste market when P&G added fluoride to its toothpaste. In the beginning of TV, Colgate-Palmolive wished to compete with P&G as a sponsor of soap operas and sponsored many soaps in full or in part including The Doctors.
George Henry Lesch, president, CEO, and chairman of the board of Colgate-Palmolive in the 1960s and 1970s, during that time transformed it into a modern company with major restructuring.
In 2005, Colgate sold the under-performing brands Fab, Dynamo, Arctic Power, ABC, Cold Power and Fresh Start, as well as the license of the Ajax brand for laundry detergents in the US, Canada and Puerto Rico, to Phoenix Brands, LLC as part of their plan to focus on their higher margin oral, personal, and pet care products.[7][8]
In 2006, Colgate-Palmolive announced the intended acquisition of Tom's of Maine, a leading maker of natural toothpaste, for US $100 million.[9] Tom's of Maine was founded by Tom Chappell in 1970.
Today, Colgate has numerous subsidiary organizations spanning 200 countries, but it is publicly listed in only two, the United States and India.
On October 25, 2012, the company announced it would cut 2,310 workers, or 6% of its workforce, by the end of 2016 in a push to make the consumer products company more efficient.[10][11]
Educational and community involvement[edit]
In 1890, Madison University in New York State was renamed Colgate University in honor of the Colgate family following decades of financial support and involvement.[12]
The Colgate-Palmolive Company has sponsored a non-profit track meet open to women of all ages called the Colgate Women's Games.[13] The Colgate Women's Games is the nation's largest amateur track series open to all girls from elementary school through college. Held at Brooklyn's Pratt Institute, competitors participate in preliminary meets and semi-finals over five weekends throughout January. Finalists compete for trophies and educational grants-in-aid from Colgate-Palmolive Company at New York City's Madison Square Garden in February. For more than 20 years, the company supports the Starlight Children Foundation which is a non profit organization dedicated to help seriously ill children and their families. The mission is to help children to cope with pain, fear and isolation through entertainment, family activities and education.(2012)
Ethical record[edit]
The Ethical Consumer Research Association once recommended that its readers not buy Colgate because of its use of animal testing, though this is no longer the case.[citation needed] In 2011, Colgate-Palmolive was one of the first companies recognized by PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) under the new "working for regulatory change" category for companies that test on animals only when mandated by government regulations and are actively seeking alternatives to animal testing.[14] This relates to the corporation's decision to continue to participate in the profitable Chinese market, where some animal testing is still a regulatory requirement.[15] Other ethical companies have chosen to decline entry to this market.[16]
In 2006 Colgate-Palmolive acquired an 84% stake in Tom's of Maine.[9][17]
In 2011 the company chose to retain the use of the antibacterial agent triclosan in its market-leading Total toothpaste range, despite withdrawing it from several other product ranges, following concerns about triclosan's impact on health and the environment.[18]
Environmental record[edit]
Products of the Colgate-Palmolive company, specifically "Total" brand toothpaste contain triclosan. This ingredient has a questionable impact on waterways and marine life.
Colgate consumes approximately 0.2 percent of the combined palm oil output of Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand,[19] the cultivation of which is known for environmental impacts on a global level including: deforestation, loss of natural habitats of critically endangered species, and increased greenhouse gas emissions.
Colgate-Palmolive, as a successor to The Mennen Company, is one of about 300 companies held potentially responsible for hazardous waste at the Chemsol federal Superfund site in Piscataway, New Jersey.[20] Their involvement in this site may have contributed to the contamination of an estimated 18,500 cubic yards (14,100 m3) of soil with volatile organic compounds (VOCs), PCBs, and lead off-site. A proposed $23 million agreement with the government and state of New Jersey would require Colgate-Palmolive and the other involved companies to pay for the cleanup of this hazardous waste that is contaminating the soil as well as the groundwater.[21] The company completed a LEED Silver certified manufacturing plant in Morristown, Tennessee in March 2008 which was the first of its kind in the U.S. The new LEED silver certified plant in Tennessee produces the Colgate Total toothpaste.[22]
Colgate Palmolive received the 2012 Safe-in-Sound Excellence in Hearing Loss Prevention Award.[23]
Anti-competitive practices[edit]
Colgate Palmolive was fined by Autorité de la concurrence in France in 2016 for price-fixing on personal hygiene products.[24]
Hill's Colgate (Japan)[edit]
In November 2016, Hill's-Colgate (Japan) Ltd. announced it will change its name to Colgate-Palmolive Japan Ltd. in 2017. However in February 2017 Cook stated that it is considering its first manufacturing plant in Japan. By the beginning of 2019, the 50,000 square feet facility will open while 50,000 jobs or addition install 150 robots annually.

Ian M. Cook, Chairman, President and CEO
John T. Cahill

Employment diversity[edit]
Colgate-Palmolive was named one of the "100 Best Companies for Working Mothers" by Working Mother magazine.[25] The 2012 Human Rights Campaign "report card" on American businesses gave Colgate an A for its support of diversity in the workplace.

Notes:
* While detergent brands continue to be manufactured and sold by Colgate-Palmolive in some countries, in the United States they have been sold to another company, Phoenix Brands, and are no longer made by C-P in the U.S.[44] In May 2015, Colgate-Palmolive sold its Australian laundry detergents and pre-wash brands to Henkel for US$245 million (€220 million).[45] Colgate-Palmolive has divested its laundry detergents business in Colombia, which was in turn acquired by Unilever and some Asian countries, which was acquired by Procter & Gamble.[46]
** Still being made by Colgate-Palmolive internationally, but no longer available in the U.S.
Vintage commercials for many of these discontinued C-P products can still be seen on YouTube.
Facilities[edit]
In the U.S., the company operates approximately 60 properties of which 14 are owned.[47] Major U.S. manufacturing and warehousing facilities used by the oral, personal and home care segment of Colgate-Palmolive are located in Morristown, New Jersey (previously the headquarters of the Mennen company prior to their 1991 buyout, and still HQ of the Mennen division); Morristown, Tennessee; and Cambridge, Ohio. The pet nutrition segment has major facilities in Bowling Green, Kentucky; Emporia, Kansas; Topeka, Kansas; Commerce, California; and Richmond, Indiana. The primary research center for oral, personal and home care products is located in Piscataway, New Jersey and the primary research center for pet nutrition products is located in Topeka, Kansas.
Overseas, the company operates approximately 280 properties of which 80 are owned in over 70 countries.[47] Major overseas facilities used by the Oral, Personal and Home Care segment are located in Australia, Brazil, China, Colombia, France, Guatemala, India, Italy, Malaysia, Mexico, Poland, South Africa, Thailand, Venezuela, Vietnam and elsewhere throughout the world.
Colgate-Palmolive has closed or is in the process of phasing out production at certain facilities under a restructuring program initiated in 2004 and has built new state-of-the-art plants to produce toothpaste in the U.S., Mexico and Poland.[48][49]
Colgate-Palmolive's chief manufacturing plant is located in Burlington, New Jersey, producing all of the fragrance and flavor oils for the company's facilities around the world.
Advertising[edit]
The iconic hand on the Palmolive dishwashing soap label belongs to Elizabeth Barbour. The image is an illustration of a photograph taken in 1985 when the Colgate-Palmolive Company updated the image, hiring Barbour, then a hand model with the Ford Agency in New York City.

History[edit]




1922 advertisement for Palmolive soap


In 1806 devout Baptist English immigrant soap and candle maker William Colgate established a starch, soap, and candle factory on Dutch Street in New York City under the name "William Colgate & Company". In 1833 he suffered a severe heart attack, stopping his business' sales; after a convalescence he continued with his business. In the 1840s the firm began selling individual cakes of soap in uniform weights. In 1857 Colgate died and the company was reorganized as "Colgate & Company" under the management of his devout Baptist son Samuel Colgate, who did not want to continue the business but thought it would be the right thing to do. In 1872 he introduced Cashmere Bouquet, a perfumed soap. In 1873 the firm introduced its first Colgate Toothpaste, an aromatic toothpaste sold in jars.[4] In 1896, the company sold the first toothpaste in a tube, Colgate Ribbon Dental Cream (invented by dentist Washington Sheffield). Also in 1896, Colgate hired Martin Ittner and under his direction founded one of the first applied research labs.[5] By 1908 they initiated mass sales of toothpaste in tubes. William's other son, James Boorman Colgate, was a primary trustee of Colgate University (formerly Madison University).




1915 magazine ad


In Milwaukee, Wisconsin, the B.J. Johnson Company was making a soap entirely of palm oil and olive oil, the formula of which was developed by B.J. Johnson in 1898. The soap was popular enough to rename their company after it — "Palmolive".[6] Around the start of the 20th century Palmolive, which contained both palm and olive oils, was the world's best-selling soap. Extensive advertising included the radio programs The Palmolive Hour (1927-1931) and Palmolive Beauty Box Theater (1934-1937). A Missouri-based soap manufacturer known as Peet Brothers merged with Palmolive to become Palmolive-Peet. In 1928, Palmolive-Peet bought the Colgate Company to create the Colgate-Palmolive-Peet Company. In 1953 "Peet" was dropped from the title, leaving only "Colgate-Palmolive Company", the current name.
Colgate-Palmolive has long been in competition with Procter & Gamble, the world's largest soap and detergent maker. P&G introduced its Tide laundry detergent shortly after World War II, and thousands of consumers turned from Colgate's soaps to the new product. Colgate lost its number one place in the toothpaste market when P&G added fluoride to its toothpaste. In the beginning of TV, Colgate-Palmolive wished to compete with P&G as a sponsor of soap operas and sponsored many soaps in full or in part including The Doctors.
George Henry Lesch, president, CEO, and chairman of the board of Colgate-Palmolive in the 1960s and 1970s, during that time transformed it into a modern company with major restructuring.
In 2005, Colgate sold the under-performing brands Fab, Dynamo, Arctic Power, ABC, Cold Power and Fresh Start, as well as the license of the Ajax brand for laundry detergents in the US, Canada and Puerto Rico, to Phoenix Brands, LLC as part of their plan to focus on their higher margin oral, personal, and pet care products.[7][8]
In 2006, Colgate-Palmolive announced the intended acquisition of Tom's of Maine, a leading maker of natural toothpaste, for US $100 million.[9] Tom's of Maine was founded by Tom Chappell in 1970.
Today, Colgate has numerous subsidiary organizations spanning 200 countries, but it is publicly listed in only two, the United States and India.
On October 25, 2012, the company announced it would cut 2,310 workers, or 6% of its workforce, by the end of 2016 in a push to make the consumer products company more efficient.[10][11]
Educational and community involvement[edit]
In 1890, Madison University in New York State was renamed Colgate University in honor of the Colgate family following decades of financial support and involvement.[12]
The Colgate-Palmolive Company has sponsored a non-profit track meet open to women of all ages called the Colgate Women's Games.[13] The Colgate Women's Games is the nation's largest amateur track series open to all girls from elementary school through college. Held at Brooklyn's Pratt Institute, competitors participate in preliminary meets and semi-finals over five weekends throughout January. Finalists compete for trophies and educational grants-in-aid from Colgate-Palmolive Company at New York City's Madison Square Garden in February. For more than 20 years, the company supports the Starlight Children Foundation which is a non profit organization dedicated to help seriously ill children and their families. The mission is to help children to cope with pain, fear and isolation through entertainment, family activities and education.(2012)
Ethical record[edit]
The Ethical Consumer Research Association once recommended that its readers not buy Colgate because of its use of animal testing, though this is no longer the case.[citation needed] In 2011, Colgate-Palmolive was one of the first companies recognized by PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) under the new "working for regulatory change" category for companies that test on animals only when mandated by government regulations and are actively seeking alternatives to animal testing.[14] This relates to the corporation's decision to continue to participate in the profitable Chinese market, where some animal testing is still a regulatory requirement.[15] Other ethical companies have chosen to decline entry to this market.[16]
In 2006 Colgate-Palmolive acquired an 84% stake in Tom's of Maine.[9][17]
In 2011 the company chose to retain the use of the antibacterial agent triclosan in its market-leading Total toothpaste range, despite withdrawing it from several other product ranges, following concerns about triclosan's impact on health and the environment.[18]
Environmental record[edit]
Products of the Colgate-Palmolive company, specifically "Total" brand toothpaste contain triclosan. This ingredient has a questionable impact on waterways and marine life.
Colgate consumes approximately 0.2 percent of the combined palm oil output of Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand,[19] the cultivation of which is known for environmental impacts on a global level including: deforestation, loss of natural habitats of critically endangered species, and increased greenhouse gas emissions.
Colgate-Palmolive, as a successor to The Mennen Company, is one of about 300 companies held potentially responsible for hazardous waste at the Chemsol federal Superfund site in Piscataway, New Jersey.[20] Their involvement in this site may have contributed to the contamination of an estimated 18,500 cubic yards (14,100 m3) of soil with volatile organic compounds (VOCs), PCBs, and lead off-site. A proposed $23 million agreement with the government and state of New Jersey would require Colgate-Palmolive and the other involved companies to pay for the cleanup of this hazardous waste that is contaminating the soil as well as the groundwater.[21] The company completed a LEED Silver certified manufacturing plant in Morristown, Tennessee in March 2008 which was the first of its kind in the U.S. The new LEED silver certified plant in Tennessee produces the Colgate Total toothpaste.[22]
Colgate Palmolive received the 2012 Safe-in-Sound Excellence in Hearing Loss Prevention Award.[23]
Anti-competitive practices[edit]
Colgate Palmolive was fined by Autorité de la concurrence in France in 2016 for price-fixing on personal hygiene products.[24]
Hill's Colgate (Japan)[edit]
In November 2016, Hill's-Colgate (Japan) Ltd. announced it will change its name to Colgate-Palmolive Japan Ltd. in 2017. However in February 2017 Cook stated that it is considering its first manufacturing plant in Japan. By the beginning of 2019, the 50,000 square feet facility will open while 50,000 jobs or addition install 150 robots annually.

Employment diversity[edit]
Colgate-Palmolive was named one of the "100 Best Companies for Working Mothers" by Working Mother magazine.[25] The 2012 Human Rights Campaign "report card" on American businesses gave Colgate an A for its support of diversity in the workplace.

Notes:
* While detergent brands continue to be manufactured and sold by Colgate-Palmolive in some countries, in the United States they have been sold to another company, Phoenix Brands, and are no longer made by C-P in the U.S.[44] In May 2015, Colgate-Palmolive sold its Australian laundry detergents and pre-wash brands to Henkel for US$245 million (€220 million).[45] Colgate-Palmolive has divested its laundry detergents business in Colombia, which was in turn acquired by Unilever and some Asian countries, which was acquired by Procter & Gamble.[46]
** Still being made by Colgate-Palmolive internationally, but no longer available in the U.S.
Vintage commercials for many of these discontinued C-P products can still be seen on YouTube.
Facilities[edit]
In the U.S., the company operates approximately 60 properties of which 14 are owned.[47] Major U.S. manufacturing and warehousing facilities used by the oral, personal and home care segment of Colgate-Palmolive are located in Morristown, New Jersey (previously the headquarters of the Mennen company prior to their 1991 buyout, and still HQ of the Mennen division); Morristown, Tennessee; and Cambridge, Ohio. The pet nutrition segment has major facilities in Bowling Green, Kentucky; Emporia, Kansas; Topeka, Kansas; Commerce, California; and Richmond, Indiana. The primary research center for oral, personal and home care products is located in Piscataway, New Jersey and the primary research center for pet nutrition products is located in Topeka, Kansas.
Overseas, the company operates approximately 280 properties of which 80 are owned in over 70 countries.[47] Major overseas facilities used by the Oral, Personal and Home Care segment are located in Australia, Brazil, China, Colombia, France, Guatemala, India, Italy, Malaysia, Mexico, Poland, South Africa, Thailand, Venezuela, Vietnam and elsewhere throughout the world.
Colgate-Palmolive has closed or is in the process of phasing out production at certain facilities under a restructuring program initiated in 2004 and has built new state-of-the-art plants to produce toothpaste in the U.S., Mexico and Poland.[48][49]
Colgate-Palmolive's chief manufacturing plant is located in Burlington, New Jersey, producing all of the fragrance and flavor oils for the company's facilities around the world.
Advertising[edit]
The iconic hand on the Palmolive dishwashing soap label belongs to Elizabeth Barbour. The image is an illustration of a photograph taken in 1985 when the Colgate-Palmolive Company updated the image, hiring Barbour, then a hand model with the Ford Agency in New York City.

History[edit]




1922 advertisement for Palmolive soap


In 1806 devout Baptist English immigrant soap and candle maker William Colgate established a starch, soap, and candle factory on Dutch Street in New York City under the name "William Colgate & Company". In 1833 he suffered a severe heart attack, stopping his business' sales; after a convalescence he continued with his business. In the 1840s the firm began selling individual cakes of soap in uniform weights. In 1857 Colgate died and the company was reorganized as "Colgate & Company" under the management of his devout Baptist son Samuel Colgate, who did not want to continue the business but thought it would be the right thing to do. In 1872 he introduced Cashmere Bouquet, a perfumed soap. In 1873 the firm introduced its first Colgate Toothpaste, an aromatic toothpaste sold in jars.[4] In 1896, the company sold the first toothpaste in a tube, Colgate Ribbon Dental Cream (invented by dentist Washington Sheffield). Also in 1896, Colgate hired Martin Ittner and under his direction founded one of the first applied research labs.[5] By 1908 they initiated mass sales of toothpaste in tubes. William's other son, James Boorman Colgate, was a primary trustee of Colgate University (formerly Madison University).




1915 magazine ad


In Milwaukee, Wisconsin, the B.J. Johnson Company was making a soap entirely of palm oil and olive oil, the formula of which was developed by B.J. Johnson in 1898. The soap was popular enough to rename their company after it — "Palmolive".[6] Around the start of the 20th century Palmolive, which contained both palm and olive oils, was the world's best-selling soap. Extensive advertising included the radio programs The Palmolive Hour (1927-1931) and Palmolive Beauty Box Theater (1934-1937). A Missouri-based soap manufacturer known as Peet Brothers merged with Palmolive to become Palmolive-Peet. In 1928, Palmolive-Peet bought the Colgate Company to create the Colgate-Palmolive-Peet Company. In 1953 "Peet" was dropped from the title, leaving only "Colgate-Palmolive Company", the current name.
Colgate-Palmolive has long been in competition with Procter & Gamble, the world's largest soap and detergent maker. P&G introduced its Tide laundry detergent shortly after World War II, and thousands of consumers turned from Colgate's soaps to the new product. Colgate lost its number one place in the toothpaste market when P&G added fluoride to its toothpaste. In the beginning of TV, Colgate-Palmolive wished to compete with P&G as a sponsor of soap operas and sponsored many soaps in full or in part including The Doctors.
George Henry Lesch, president, CEO, and chairman of the board of Colgate-Palmolive in the 1960s and 1970s, during that time transformed it into a modern company with major restructuring.
In 2005, Colgate sold the under-performing brands Fab, Dynamo, Arctic Power, ABC, Cold Power and Fresh Start, as well as the license of the Ajax brand for laundry detergents in the US, Canada and Puerto Rico, to Phoenix Brands, LLC as part of their plan to focus on their higher margin oral, personal, and pet care products.[7][8]
In 2006, Colgate-Palmolive announced the intended acquisition of Tom's of Maine, a leading maker of natural toothpaste, for US $100 million.[9] Tom's of Maine was founded by Tom Chappell in 1970.
Today, Colgate has numerous subsidiary organizations spanning 200 countries, but it is publicly listed in only two, the United States and India.
On October 25, 2012, the company announced it would cut 2,310 workers, or 6% of its workforce, by the end of 2016 in a push to make the consumer products company more efficient.[10][11]
Educational and community involvement[edit]
In 1890, Madison University in New York State was renamed Colgate University in honor of the Colgate family following decades of financial support and involvement.[12]
The Colgate-Palmolive Company has sponsored a non-profit track meet open to women of all ages called the Colgate Women's Games.[13] The Colgate Women's Games is the nation's largest amateur track series open to all girls from elementary school through college. Held at Brooklyn's Pratt Institute, competitors participate in preliminary meets and semi-finals over five weekends throughout January. Finalists compete for trophies and educational grants-in-aid from Colgate-Palmolive Company at New York City's Madison Square Garden in February. For more than 20 years, the company supports the Starlight Children Foundation which is a non profit organization dedicated to help seriously ill children and their families. The mission is to help children to cope with pain, fear and isolation through entertainment, family activities and education.(2012)
Ethical record[edit]
The Ethical Consumer Research Association once recommended that its readers not buy Colgate because of its use of animal testing, though this is no longer the case.[citation needed] In 2011, Colgate-Palmolive was one of the first companies recognized by PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) under the new "working for regulatory change" category for companies that test on animals only when mandated by government regulations and are actively seeking alternatives to animal testing.[14] This relates to the corporation's decision to continue to participate in the profitable Chinese market, where some animal testing is still a regulatory requirement.[15] Other ethical companies have chosen to decline entry to this market.[16]
In 2006 Colgate-Palmolive acquired an 84% stake in Tom's of Maine.[9][17]
In 2011 the company chose to retain the use of the antibacterial agent triclosan in its market-leading Total toothpaste range, despite withdrawing it from several other product ranges, following concerns about triclosan's impact on health and the environment.[18]
Environmental record[edit]
Products of the Colgate-Palmolive company, specifically "Total" brand toothpaste contain triclosan. This ingredient has a questionable impact on waterways and marine life.
Colgate consumes approximately 0.2 percent of the combined palm oil output of Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand,[19] the cultivation of which is known for environmental impacts on a global level including: deforestation, loss of natural habitats of critically endangered species, and increased greenhouse gas emissions.
Colgate-Palmolive, as a successor to The Mennen Company, is one of about 300 companies held potentially responsible for hazardous waste at the Chemsol federal Superfund site in Piscataway, New Jersey.[20] Their involvement in this site may have contributed to the contamination of an estimated 18,500 cubic yards (14,100 m3) of soil with volatile organic compounds (VOCs), PCBs, and lead off-site. A proposed $23 million agreement with the government and state of New Jersey would require Colgate-Palmolive and the other involved companies to pay for the cleanup of this hazardous waste that is contaminating the soil as well as the groundwater.[21] The company completed a LEED Silver certified manufacturing plant in Morristown, Tennessee in March 2008 which was the first of its kind in the U.S. The new LEED silver certified plant in Tennessee produces the Colgate Total toothpaste.[22]
Colgate Palmolive received the 2012 Safe-in-Sound Excellence in Hearing Loss Prevention Award.[23]
Anti-competitive practices[edit]
Colgate Palmolive was fined by Autorité de la concurrence in France in 2016 for price-fixing on personal hygiene products.[24]
Hill's Colgate (Japan)[edit]
In November 2016, Hill's-Colgate (Japan) Ltd. announced it will change its name to Colgate-Palmolive Japan Ltd. in 2017. However in February 2017 Cook stated that it is considering its first manufacturing plant in Japan. By the beginning of 2019, the 50,000 square feet facility will open while 50,000 jobs or addition install 150 robots annually.

Employment diversity[edit]
Colgate-Palmolive was named one of the "100 Best Companies for Working Mothers" by Working Mother magazine.[25] The 2012 Human Rights Campaign "report card" on American businesses gave Colgate an A for its support of diversity in the workplace.

Notes:
* While detergent brands continue to be manufactured and sold by Colgate-Palmolive in some countries, in the United States they have been sold to another company, Phoenix Brands, and are no longer made by C-P in the U.S.[44] In May 2015, Colgate-Palmolive sold its Australian laundry detergents and pre-wash brands to Henkel for US$245 million (€220 million).[45] Colgate-Palmolive has divested its laundry detergents business in Colombia, which was in turn acquired by Unilever and some Asian countries, which was acquired by Procter & Gamble.[46]
** Still being made by Colgate-Palmolive internationally, but no longer available in the U.S.
Vintage commercials for many of these discontinued C-P products can still be seen on YouTube.
Facilities[edit]
In the U.S., the company operates approximately 60 properties of which 14 are owned.[47] Major U.S. manufacturing and warehousing facilities used by the oral, personal and home care segment of Colgate-Palmolive are located in Morristown, New Jersey (previously the headquarters of the Mennen company prior to their 1991 buyout, and still HQ of the Mennen division); Morristown, Tennessee; and Cambridge, Ohio. The pet nutrition segment has major facilities in Bowling Green, Kentucky; Emporia, Kansas; Topeka, Kansas; Commerce, California; and Richmond, Indiana. The primary research center for oral, personal and home care products is located in Piscataway, New Jersey and the primary research center for pet nutrition products is located in Topeka, Kansas.
Overseas, the company operates approximately 280 properties of which 80 are owned in over 70 countries.[47] Major overseas facilities used by the Oral, Personal and Home Care segment are located in Australia, Brazil, China, Colombia, France, Guatemala, India, Italy, Malaysia, Mexico, Poland, South Africa, Thailand, Venezuela, Vietnam and elsewhere throughout the world.
Colgate-Palmolive has closed or is in the process of phasing out production at certain facilities under a restructuring program initiated in 2004 and has built new state-of-the-art plants to produce toothpaste in the U.S., Mexico and Poland.[48][49]
Colgate-Palmolive's chief manufacturing plant is located in Burlington, New Jersey, producing all of the fragrance and flavor oils for the company's facilities around the world.
Advertising[edit]
The iconic hand on the Palmolive dishwashing soap label belongs to Elizabeth Barbour. The image is an illustration of a photograph taken in 1985 when the Colgate-Palmolive Company updated the image, hiring Barbour, then a hand model with the Ford Agency in New York City.

History[edit]




1922 advertisement for Palmolive soap


In 1806 devout Baptist English immigrant soap and candle maker William Colgate established a starch, soap, and candle factory on Dutch Street in New York City under the name "William Colgate & Company". In 1833 he suffered a severe heart attack, stopping his business' sales; after a convalescence he continued with his business. In the 1840s the firm began selling individual cakes of soap in uniform weights. In 1857 Colgate died and the company was reorganized as "Colgate & Company" under the management of his devout Baptist son Samuel Colgate, who did not want to continue the business but thought it would be the right thing to do. In 1872 he introduced Cashmere Bouquet, a perfumed soap. In 1873 the firm introduced its first Colgate Toothpaste, an aromatic toothpaste sold in jars.[4] In 1896, the company sold the first toothpaste in a tube, Colgate Ribbon Dental Cream (invented by dentist Washington Sheffield). Also in 1896, Colgate hired Martin Ittner and under his direction founded one of the first applied research labs.[5] By 1908 they initiated mass sales of toothpaste in tubes. William's other son, James Boorman Colgate, was a primary trustee of Colgate University (formerly Madison University).




1915 magazine ad


In Milwaukee, Wisconsin, the B.J. Johnson Company was making a soap entirely of palm oil and olive oil, the formula of which was developed by B.J. Johnson in 1898. The soap was popular enough to rename their company after it — "Palmolive".[6] Around the start of the 20th century Palmolive, which contained both palm and olive oils, was the world's best-selling soap. Extensive advertising included the radio programs The Palmolive Hour (1927-1931) and Palmolive Beauty Box Theater (1934-1937). A Missouri-based soap manufacturer known as Peet Brothers merged with Palmolive to become Palmolive-Peet. In 1928, Palmolive-Peet bought the Colgate Company to create the Colgate-Palmolive-Peet Company. In 1953 "Peet" was dropped from the title, leaving only "Colgate-Palmolive Company", the current name.
Colgate-Palmolive has long been in competition with Procter & Gamble, the world's largest soap and detergent maker. P&G introduced its Tide laundry detergent shortly after World War II, and thousands of consumers turned from Colgate's soaps to the new product. Colgate lost its number one place in the toothpaste market when P&G added fluoride to its toothpaste. In the beginning of TV, Colgate-Palmolive wished to compete with P&G as a sponsor of soap operas and sponsored many soaps in full or in part including The Doctors.
George Henry Lesch, president, CEO, and chairman of the board of Colgate-Palmolive in the 1960s and 1970s, during that time transformed it into a modern company with major restructuring.
In 2005, Colgate sold the under-performing brands Fab, Dynamo, Arctic Power, ABC, Cold Power and Fresh Start, as well as the license of the Ajax brand for laundry detergents in the US, Canada and Puerto Rico, to Phoenix Brands, LLC as part of their plan to focus on their higher margin oral, personal, and pet care products.[7][8]
In 2006, Colgate-Palmolive announced the intended acquisition of Tom's of Maine, a leading maker of natural toothpaste, for US $100 million.[9] Tom's of Maine was founded by Tom Chappell in 1970.
Today, Colgate has numerous subsidiary organizations spanning 200 countries, but it is publicly listed in only two, the United States and India.
On October 25, 2012, the company announced it would cut 2,310 workers, or 6% of its workforce, by the end of 2016 in a push to make the consumer products company more efficient.[10][11]
Educational and community involvement[edit]
In 1890, Madison University in New York State was renamed Colgate University in honor of the Colgate family following decades of financial support and involvement.[12]
The Colgate-Palmolive Company has sponsored a non-profit track meet open to women of all ages called the Colgate Women's Games.[13] The Colgate Women's Games is the nation's largest amateur track series open to all girls from elementary school through college. Held at Brooklyn's Pratt Institute, competitors participate in preliminary meets and semi-finals over five weekends throughout January. Finalists compete for trophies and educational grants-in-aid from Colgate-Palmolive Company at New York City's Madison Square Garden in February. For more than 20 years, the company supports the Starlight Children Foundation which is a non profit organization dedicated to help seriously ill children and their families. The mission is to help children to cope with pain, fear and isolation through entertainment, family activities and education.(2012)
Ethical record[edit]
The Ethical Consumer Research Association once recommended that its readers not buy Colgate because of its use of animal testing, though this is no longer the case.[citation needed] In 2011, Colgate-Palmolive was one of the first companies recognized by PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) under the new "working for regulatory change" category for companies that test on animals only when mandated by government regulations and are actively seeking alternatives to animal testing.[14] This relates to the corporation's decision to continue to participate in the profitable Chinese market, where some animal testing is still a regulatory requirement.[15] Other ethical companies have chosen to decline entry to this market.[16]
In 2006 Colgate-Palmolive acquired an 84% stake in Tom's of Maine.[9][17]
In 2011 the company chose to retain the use of the antibacterial agent triclosan in its market-leading Total toothpaste range, despite withdrawing it from several other product ranges, following concerns about triclosan's impact on health and the environment.[18]
Environmental record[edit]
Products of the Colgate-Palmolive company, specifically "Total" brand toothpaste contain triclosan. This ingredient has a questionable impact on waterways and marine life.
Colgate consumes approximately 0.2 percent of the combined palm oil output of Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand,[19] the cultivation of which is known for environmental impacts on a global level including: deforestation, loss of natural habitats of critically endangered species, and increased greenhouse gas emissions.
Colgate-Palmolive, as a successor to The Mennen Company, is one of about 300 companies held potentially responsible for hazardous waste at the Chemsol federal Superfund site in Piscataway, New Jersey.[20] Their involvement in this site may have contributed to the contamination of an estimated 18,500 cubic yards (14,100 m3) of soil with volatile organic compounds (VOCs), PCBs, and lead off-site. A proposed $23 million agreement with the government and state of New Jersey would require Colgate-Palmolive and the other involved companies to pay for the cleanup of this hazardous waste that is contaminating the soil as well as the groundwater.[21] The company completed a LEED Silver certified manufacturing plant in Morristown, Tennessee in March 2008 which was the first of its kind in the U.S. The new LEED silver certified plant in Tennessee produces the Colgate Total toothpaste.[22]
Colgate Palmolive received the 2012 Safe-in-Sound Excellence in Hearing Loss Prevention Award.[23]
Anti-competitive practices[edit]
Colgate Palmolive was fined by Autorité de la concurrence in France in 2016 for price-fixing on personal hygiene products.[24]
Hill's Colgate (Japan)[edit]
In November 2016, Hill's-Colgate (Japan) Ltd. announced it will change its name to Colgate-Palmolive Japan Ltd. in 2017. However in February 2017 Cook stated that it is considering its first manufacturing plant in Japan. By the beginning of 2019, the 50,000 square feet facility will open while 50,000 jobs or addition install 150 robots annually.

Employment diversity[edit]
Colgate-Palmolive was named one of the "100 Best Companies for Working Mothers" by Working Mother magazine.[25] The 2012 Human Rights Campaign "report card" on American businesses gave Colgate an A for its support of diversity in the workplace.

Notes:
* While detergent brands continue to be manufactured and sold by Colgate-Palmolive in some countries, in the United States they have been sold to another company, Phoenix Brands, and are no longer made by C-P in the U.S.[44] In May 2015, Colgate-Palmolive sold its Australian laundry detergents and pre-wash brands to Henkel for US$245 million (€220 million).[45] Colgate-Palmolive has divested its laundry detergents business in Colombia, which was in turn acquired by Unilever and some Asian countries, which was acquired by Procter & Gamble.[46]
** Still being made by Colgate-Palmolive internationally, but no longer available in the U.S.
Vintage commercials for many of these discontinued C-P products can still be seen on YouTube.
Facilities[edit]
In the U.S., the company operates approximately 60 properties of which 14 are owned.[47] Major U.S. manufacturing and warehousing facilities used by the oral, personal and home care segment of Colgate-Palmolive are located in Morristown, New Jersey (previously the headquarters of the Mennen company prior to their 1991 buyout, and still HQ of the Mennen division); Morristown, Tennessee; and Cambridge, Ohio. The pet nutrition segment has major facilities in Bowling Green, Kentucky; Emporia, Kansas; Topeka, Kansas; Commerce, California; and Richmond, Indiana. The primary research center for oral, personal and home care products is located in Piscataway, New Jersey and the primary research center for pet nutrition products is located in Topeka, Kansas.
Overseas, the company operates approximately 280 properties of which 80 are owned in over 70 countries.[47] Major overseas facilities used by the Oral, Personal and Home Care segment are located in Australia, Brazil, China, Colombia, France, Guatemala, India, Italy, Malaysia, Mexico, Poland, South Africa, Thailand, Venezuela, Vietnam and elsewhere throughout the world.
Colgate-Palmolive has closed or is in the process of phasing out production at certain facilities under a restructuring program initiated in 2004 and has built new state-of-the-art plants to produce toothpaste in the U.S., Mexico and Poland.[48][49]
Colgate-Palmolive's chief manufacturing plant is located in Burlington, New Jersey, producing all of the fragrance and flavor oils for the company's facilities around the world.
Advertising[edit]
The iconic hand on the Palmolive dishwashing soap label belongs to Elizabeth Barbour. The image is an illustration of a photograph taken in 1985 when the Colgate-Palmolive Company updated the image, hiring Barbour, then a hand model with the Ford Agency in New York City.

 Trade

gained 1.32% to close at $73.00. On the day, Colgate-Palmolive Company saw 6.02 million shares trade hands on 40,777 trades. 
Considering that the stock averages only a daily volume of 3.01 million shares a day over the last month, this represents a pretty significant bump in volume over the norm.

Generally speaking, when a stock experiences a sudden spike in trading volume, it may be seen as a bullish signal for investors. An increase in volume means more market awareness for the 
company, potentially setting up a more meaningful move in stock price. The added volume also provides a level of support and stability for price advances.

The stock has traded between $77.27 and $63.43 over the last 52-weeks, its 50-day SMA is now $74.23, and its 200-day SMA $70.30. Colgate-Palmolive Company 
has a P/B ratio of -270.37. It also has a P/E ratio of 26.8.  


Colgate-Palmolive Co is a consumer products company. It provides services such as oral care, personal care, home care and pet nutrition. Its business segments are Oral, Personal and Home Care, and Pet Nutrition.

Rating and target price
Most of the analysts covering Colgate-Palmolive (CL) continue to maintain a “neutral” outlook on the stock. Through its productivity savings and cost-cutting initiatives, CL managed to drive its bottom-line growth amid a soft sales environment. The company’s management remains upbeat and expects new, innovative products in its natural and premium segments to help drive its top-line growth in the coming quarters.

However, a slowdown in demand in major markets such as the United States (SPY) and Greater China, the volatility in India, the macroeconomic challenges in Brazil, and currency headwinds are likely to restrict the company’s top-line growth. Increased advertising spending, higher raw material costs, and increased competition will continue to hurt its margins and keeps analysts on the sidelines.



Analysts are maintaining a consensus score of 2.8 on CL stock on a scale of 1.0 (“strong buy”) to 5.0 (“strong sell”). Of the 22 analysts providing recommendations for Colgate-Palmolive stock, 14.0% have rated it a “buy,” and 86.0% are maintaining a “hold.” CL stock closed at $73.27 on July 21, 2017, representing an implied upside of 3.1% to analysts’ 12-month target price recommendation of $75.53 per share.
Peer comparisons
Analysts are also maintaining a “neutral” outlook on CL’s peers due to moderating category growth and a slowdown in demand. Of the 22 analysts covering Church & Dwight (CHD) stock, 14.0% are maintaining a “buy,” 59.0% have rated it a “hold,” and 27.0% have recommended a “sell.” Of the 21 analysts covering Procter & Gamble (PG) stock, 38.0% are maintaining a “buy,” 52.0% have recommended a “hold,” and 10.0% have rated it a “sell.” As for Kimberly-Clark (KMB) stock, 7.0% of the 15 analysts have rated it a “buy,” 86.0% have recommended a “hold,” and 7.0% are maintaining a “sell.”

			Colgate Palmolive CEO gives nod to Ramdev’s Patanjali market strength
					


			July 26, 2017		


        
			Written by 
						Louise Prance Miles























Ramdev’s Patanjali is still challenging Colgate Palmolive in terms of marketing strategy in the Indian personal care market, according to Colgate Palmolive CEO Ian Cook.



Speaking on an investor call, Cook highlighted Patanjali’s success in targeting the natural market in a bid to cater to consumer desire within the region, a move which boosted the company’s share of the market while Colgate Palmolive India’s share fell 1.8 percent last year. 
While Colgate Palmolive still holds a 55.6 percent share in the toothpaste market, it was the biggest market drop in ten years for the company, with Cook acknowledging that Patanjali was working with the right marketing formula. 
Speaking on the call, he said, “Patanjali in India takes a very nationalist view of its business. These are concepts in the local market. They tend to be premium price oriented and it means that you have to respond with a very specifically constructed offering that attacks the benefit the consumer is looking for. Hence the natural — the natural reaction.”
Colgate Palmolive India has been working on developing its on naturals foothold with the launch of products such as Cibaca Vedshakti - its first ayurvedic brand for the Indian market hoped to challenge the Dant Kanti toothpaste by Patanjali. 
Cook continued, “And in the end, the winner over time in these clashes are going to be the companies that best understand the consumer and serve them offerings that they want over time and of course that’s what we all resourced and focused on doing.”

Our Policy on Ingredient Safety: Earning Your Confidence for Generations, Every Day









Every day, millions of families around the world show their confidence in Colgate-Palmolive. They trust our toothpaste and toothbrushes for their families, rely on our soaps and body washes to stay healthy and fresh, choose our cleaners to care for their homes, and feed our pet foods to the dogs and cats they love. Colgate-Palmolive began earning this confidence more than 200 years ago by offering the highest quality products, and we know the trust we’ve earned over generations has to be earned anew every day. Earning your trust begins with the ingredients we choose.
Committed to Safety and Science
All of the ingredients we use in our products are safe for people and the environment. They meet our strict safety standards and all applicable government regulations everywhere they are sold around the world. The decisions we make on ingredients are based on a thorough evaluation of the latest scientific evidence. When we choose an ingredient – whether to contribute to the performance of a product or to keep it safe against microorganisms – it is first prescreened by a team of Colgate-Palmolive scientists. Every ingredient is assessed alone and within a formula to ensure that nothing unexpected will occur. Our ingredient review assesses not just what happens in our laboratories, but across a range of real-world conditions – during manufacturing, in transportation, at the store, in consumers’ homes, and after consumer use. We continuously monitor and evaluate the safety of our ingredients and we actively engage outside experts and resources to understand emerging science and deepen our knowledge. We seek the facts so that we can make the right decisions.
Listening to Consumers
We want consumers to continue to have confidence in our products and the ingredients we use. Our ingredient information is easily accessible in the Drug Facts labels on our toothpastes and mouthwashes, and on the labels of many other products. We listen to our consumers and the questions they raise about ingredients. Where we see opportunities regarding ingredients that are raising consumer questions, we substitute with other safe ingredients that provide the same or better benefits without sacrificing quality. Through this ongoing effort, we no longer use – or are on our way to eliminating – some of the ingredients currently raising consumer questions. We’re listening and formulating our products with our consumers in mind to keep earning their confidence.
 Ingredient Updates Formaldehyde and Formaldehyde Donors While formaldehyde and formaldehyde donors are safe when used at approved regulatory levels, we recognize that consumers have questions. Colgate-Palmolive does not add formaldehyde to any of our products and is committed to eliminating formaldehyde donors from our formulations. Globally, we do not use formaldehyde donors as a preservative system in any of our Oral Care products and have eliminated their use in our Home Care products. By the end of 2017, we expect to eliminate their use as a preservative in a limited number of remaining Personal Care products in North America and Latin America. Parabens Parabens are widely used preservatives, commonly found in foods, cosmetics and drug products. They are usually easy to identify by name, such as methylparaben, propylparaben, butylparaben or benzylparaben. Parabens inhibit the growth of bacteria and mold to maintain product integrity and protect consumer safety. Parabens have been used for many years, reviewed by regulatory bodies around the world, and are considered safe. However, some consumers have questions about their safety. To maintain consumer confidence, we have reformulated our products using alternative, safe preservative systems and are no longer using parabens as of July 2016. U.S. FDA Parabens Consumer Update: http://www.fda.gov/cosmetics/productsingredients/ingredients/ucm128042.htm Phthalates Phthalates are a group of organic compounds used in hundreds of products. They have been used safely for many years in personal care products, including to improve the performance of fragrances. Although there is no accepted scientific basis for avoiding phthalates, some consumers question their safety, so as of year-end 2014 we stopped stopped using this ingredient.. Triclosan Triclosan is the antibacterial ingredient in Colgate Total toothpaste, where the proven therapeutic benefits it provides as part of our unique copolymer system are unsurpassed. Colgate Total is clinically proven to work better than other toothpastes to reduce the germs that can cause the gum disease gingivitis. In the U.S., the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has recognized the effectiveness and safety of triclosan in Colgate Total toothpaste. We remain strongly committed to Colgate Total, which is the only toothpaste that has undergone the FDA's rigorous New Drug Application process for safety and efficacy. It is supported by more than 90 clinical studies involving over 20,000 people, its clinically proven benefits are unsurpassed, and it is approved by regulators and recommended by the dental profession around the world. Triclosan has been reviewed and approved as safe by regulators around the world, including by an expert European scientific committee that approved the use of triclosan in rinse-off cosmetic products following a full review of the scientific evidence. However, we recognize that some consumers have questions about triclosan and choose to avoid this ingredient in products where they believe it does not deliver a benefit to health. So while the use of triclosan continues to be permitted by regulators around the world, we have reformulated our antibacterial dish liquid and hand soaps with alternate active ingredients that provide the same or superior performance. U.S. FDA Triclosan Update: http://www.fda.gov/forconsumers/consumerupdates/ucm205999.htm Microplastics Colgate-Palmolive used microbeads in a limited number of oral care and personal care products to enhance aesthetics and aid in cleaning. However, some groups raised concerns regarding the potential contribution of microbeads to pollution of the world’s oceans. Recognizing that consumers have questions, as of year-end 2014 we stopped using microbeads. More recently, consumer questions have extended beyond microbeads to some polymer-based materials, many of which dissolve in water and biodegrade. Colgate-Palmolive continues to monitor the science and evaluate our use of polymer-based ingredients to ensure continued improvements in the environmental profile of our products. All exit dates represent the last date of manufacture.

History[edit]




1922 advertisement for Palmolive soap


In 1806 devout Baptist English immigrant soap and candle maker William Colgate established a starch, soap, and candle factory on Dutch Street in New York City under the name "William Colgate & Company". In 1833 he suffered a severe heart attack, stopping his business' sales; after a convalescence he continued with his business. In the 1840s the firm began selling individual cakes of soap in uniform weights. In 1857 Colgate died and the company was reorganized as "Colgate & Company" under the management of his devout Baptist son Samuel Colgate, who did not want to continue the business but thought it would be the right thing to do. In 1872 he introduced Cashmere Bouquet, a perfumed soap. In 1873 the firm introduced its first Colgate Toothpaste, an aromatic toothpaste sold in jars.[4] In 1896, the company sold the first toothpaste in a tube, Colgate Ribbon Dental Cream (invented by dentist Washington Sheffield). Also in 1896, Colgate hired Martin Ittner and under his direction founded one of the first applied research labs.[5] By 1908 they initiated mass sales of toothpaste in tubes. William's other son, James Boorman Colgate, was a primary trustee of Colgate University (formerly Madison University).




1915 magazine ad


In Milwaukee, Wisconsin, the B.J. Johnson Company was making a soap entirely of palm oil and olive oil, the formula of which was developed by B.J. Johnson in 1898. The soap was popular enough to rename their company after it — "Palmolive".[6] Around the start of the 20th century Palmolive, which contained both palm and olive oils, was the world's best-selling soap. Extensive advertising included the radio programs The Palmolive Hour (1927-1931) and Palmolive Beauty Box Theater (1934-1937). A Missouri-based soap manufacturer known as Peet Brothers merged with Palmolive to become Palmolive-Peet. In 1928, Palmolive-Peet bought the Colgate Company to create the Colgate-Palmolive-Peet Company. In 1953 "Peet" was dropped from the title, leaving only "Colgate-Palmolive Company", the current name.
Colgate-Palmolive has long been in competition with Procter & Gamble, the world's largest soap and detergent maker. P&G introduced its Tide laundry detergent shortly after World War II, and thousands of consumers turned from Colgate's soaps to the new product. Colgate lost its number one place in the toothpaste market when P&G added fluoride to its toothpaste. In the beginning of TV, Colgate-Palmolive wished to compete with P&G as a sponsor of soap operas and sponsored many soaps in full or in part including The Doctors.
George Henry Lesch, president, CEO, and chairman of the board of Colgate-Palmolive in the 1960s and 1970s, during that time transformed it into a modern company with major restructuring.
In 2005, Colgate sold the under-performing brands Fab, Dynamo, Arctic Power, ABC, Cold Power and Fresh Start, as well as the license of the Ajax brand for laundry detergents in the US, Canada and Puerto Rico, to Phoenix Brands, LLC as part of their plan to focus on their higher margin oral, personal, and pet care products.[7][8]
In 2006, Colgate-Palmolive announced the intended acquisition of Tom's of Maine, a leading maker of natural toothpaste, for US $100 million.[9] Tom's of Maine was founded by Tom Chappell in 1970.
Today, Colgate has numerous subsidiary organizations spanning 200 countries, but it is publicly listed in only two, the United States and India.
On October 25, 2012, the company announced it would cut 2,310 workers, or 6% of its workforce, by the end of 2016 in a push to make the consumer products company more efficient.[10][11]
Educational and community involvement[edit]
In 1890, Madison University in New York State was renamed Colgate University in honor of the Colgate family following decades of financial support and involvement.[12]
The Colgate-Palmolive Company has sponsored a non-profit track meet open to women of all ages called the Colgate Women's Games.[13] The Colgate Women's Games is the nation's largest amateur track series open to all girls from elementary school through college. Held at Brooklyn's Pratt Institute, competitors participate in preliminary meets and semi-finals over five weekends throughout January. Finalists compete for trophies and educational grants-in-aid from Colgate-Palmolive Company at New York City's Madison Square Garden in February. For more than 20 years, the company supports the Starlight Children Foundation which is a non profit organization dedicated to help seriously ill children and their families. The mission is to help children to cope with pain, fear and isolation through entertainment, family activities and education.(2012)
Ethical record[edit]
The Ethical Consumer Research Association once recommended that its readers not buy Colgate because of its use of animal testing, though this is no longer the case.[citation needed] In 2011, Colgate-Palmolive was one of the first companies recognized by PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) under the new "working for regulatory change" category for companies that test on animals only when mandated by government regulations and are actively seeking alternatives to animal testing.[14] This relates to the corporation's decision to continue to participate in the profitable Chinese market, where some animal testing is still a regulatory requirement.[15] Other ethical companies have chosen to decline entry to this market.[16]
In 2006 Colgate-Palmolive acquired an 84% stake in Tom's of Maine.[9][17]
In 2011 the company chose to retain the use of the antibacterial agent triclosan in its market-leading Total toothpaste range, despite withdrawing it from several other product ranges, following concerns about triclosan's impact on health and the environment.[18]
Environmental record[edit]
Products of the Colgate-Palmolive company, specifically "Total" brand toothpaste contain triclosan. This ingredient has a questionable impact on waterways and marine life.
Colgate consumes approximately 0.2 percent of the combined palm oil output of Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand,[19] the cultivation of which is known for environmental impacts on a global level including: deforestation, loss of natural habitats of critically endangered species, and increased greenhouse gas emissions.
Colgate-Palmolive, as a successor to The Mennen Company, is one of about 300 companies held potentially responsible for hazardous waste at the Chemsol federal Superfund site in Piscataway, New Jersey.[20] Their involvement in this site may have contributed to the contamination of an estimated 18,500 cubic yards (14,100 m3) of soil with volatile organic compounds (VOCs), PCBs, and lead off-site. A proposed $23 million agreement with the government and state of New Jersey would require Colgate-Palmolive and the other involved companies to pay for the cleanup of this hazardous waste that is contaminating the soil as well as the groundwater.[21] The company completed a LEED Silver certified manufacturing plant in Morristown, Tennessee in March 2008 which was the first of its kind in the U.S. The new LEED silver certified plant in Tennessee produces the Colgate Total toothpaste.[22]
Colgate Palmolive received the 2012 Safe-in-Sound Excellence in Hearing Loss Prevention Award.[23]
Anti-competitive practices[edit]
Colgate Palmolive was fined by Autorité de la concurrence in France in 2016 for price-fixing on personal hygiene products.[24]
Hill's Colgate (Japan)[edit]
In November 2016, Hill's-Colgate (Japan) Ltd. announced it will change its name to Colgate-Palmolive Japan Ltd. in 2017. However in February 2017 Cook stated that it is considering its first manufacturing plant in Japan. By the beginning of 2019, the 50,000 square feet facility will open while 50,000 jobs or addition install 150 robots annually.
Corporate governance[edit]
Current members of the board of directors of Colgate-Palmolive are:

Ian M. Cook, Chairman, President and CEO
John T. Cahill
Ellen Hancock
Richard Kogan
Delano Lewis
Pedro Reinhard
Stephen Sadove
Helene Gayle
Nikesh Arora
Joseph Jimenez

Employment diversity[edit]
Colgate-Palmolive was named one of the "100 Best Companies for Working Mothers" by Working Mother magazine.[25] The 2012 Human Rights Campaign "report card" on American businesses gave Colgate an A for its support of diversity in the workplace.
Brands[edit]

Notes:
* While detergent brands continue to be manufactured and sold by Colgate-Palmolive in some countries, in the United States they have been sold to another company, Phoenix Brands, and are no longer made by C-P in the U.S.[44] In May 2015, Colgate-Palmolive sold its Australian laundry detergents and pre-wash brands to Henkel for US$245 million (€220 million).[45] Colgate-Palmolive has divested its laundry detergents business in Colombia, which was in turn acquired by Unilever and some Asian countries, which was acquired by Procter & Gamble.[46]
** Still being made by Colgate-Palmolive internationally, but no longer available in the U.S.
Vintage commercials for many of these discontinued C-P products can still be seen on YouTube.
Facilities[edit]
In the U.S., the company operates approximately 60 properties of which 14 are owned.[47] Major U.S. manufacturing and warehousing facilities used by the oral, personal and home care segment of Colgate-Palmolive are located in Morristown, New Jersey (previously the headquarters of the Mennen company prior to their 1991 buyout, and still HQ of the Mennen division); Morristown, Tennessee; and Cambridge, Ohio. The pet nutrition segment has major facilities in Bowling Green, Kentucky; Emporia, Kansas; Topeka, Kansas; Commerce, California; and Richmond, Indiana. The primary research center for oral, personal and home care products is located in Piscataway, New Jersey and the primary research center for pet nutrition products is located in Topeka, Kansas.
Overseas, the company operates approximately 280 properties of which 80 are owned in over 70 countries.[47] Major overseas facilities used by the Oral, Personal and Home Care segment are located in Australia, Brazil, China, Colombia, France, Guatemala, India, Italy, Malaysia, Mexico, Poland, South Africa, Thailand, Venezuela, Vietnam and elsewhere throughout the world.
Colgate-Palmolive has closed or is in the process of phasing out production at certain facilities under a restructuring program initiated in 2004 and has built new state-of-the-art plants to produce toothpaste in the U.S., Mexico and Poland.[48][49]
Colgate-Palmolive's chief manufacturing plant is located in Burlington, New Jersey, producing all of the fragrance and flavor oils for the company's facilities around the world.
Advertising[edit]
The iconic hand on the Palmolive dishwashing soap label belongs to Elizabeth Barbour. The image is an illustration of a photograph taken in 1985 when the Colgate-Palmolive Company updated the image, hiring Barbour, then a hand model with the Ford Agency in New York City.

History[edit]




1922 advertisement for Palmolive soap


In 1806 devout Baptist English immigrant soap and candle maker William Colgate established a starch, soap, and candle factory on Dutch Street in New York City under the name "William Colgate & Company". In 1833 he suffered a severe heart attack, stopping his business' sales; after a convalescence he continued with his business. In the 1840s the firm began selling individual cakes of soap in uniform weights. In 1857 Colgate died and the company was reorganized as "Colgate & Company" under the management of his devout Baptist son Samuel Colgate, who did not want to continue the business but thought it would be the right thing to do. In 1872 he introduced Cashmere Bouquet, a perfumed soap. In 1873 the firm introduced its first Colgate Toothpaste, an aromatic toothpaste sold in jars.[4] In 1896, the company sold the first toothpaste in a tube, Colgate Ribbon Dental Cream (invented by dentist Washington Sheffield). Also in 1896, Colgate hired Martin Ittner and under his direction founded one of the first applied research labs.[5] By 1908 they initiated mass sales of toothpaste in tubes. William's other son, James Boorman Colgate, was a primary trustee of Colgate University (formerly Madison University).




1915 magazine ad


In Milwaukee, Wisconsin, the B.J. Johnson Company was making a soap entirely of palm oil and olive oil, the formula of which was developed by B.J. Johnson in 1898. The soap was popular enough to rename their company after it — "Palmolive".[6] Around the start of the 20th century Palmolive, which contained both palm and olive oils, was the world's best-selling soap. Extensive advertising included the radio programs The Palmolive Hour (1927-1931) and Palmolive Beauty Box Theater (1934-1937). A Missouri-based soap manufacturer known as Peet Brothers merged with Palmolive to become Palmolive-Peet. In 1928, Palmolive-Peet bought the Colgate Company to create the Colgate-Palmolive-Peet Company. In 1953 "Peet" was dropped from the title, leaving only "Colgate-Palmolive Company", the current name.
Colgate-Palmolive has long been in competition with Procter & Gamble, the world's largest soap and detergent maker. P&G introduced its Tide laundry detergent shortly after World War II, and thousands of consumers turned from Colgate's soaps to the new product. Colgate lost its number one place in the toothpaste market when P&G added fluoride to its toothpaste. In the beginning of TV, Colgate-Palmolive wished to compete with P&G as a sponsor of soap operas and sponsored many soaps in full or in part including The Doctors.
George Henry Lesch, president, CEO, and chairman of the board of Colgate-Palmolive in the 1960s and 1970s, during that time transformed it into a modern company with major restructuring.
In 2005, Colgate sold the under-performing brands Fab, Dynamo, Arctic Power, ABC, Cold Power and Fresh Start, as well as the license of the Ajax brand for laundry detergents in the US, Canada and Puerto Rico, to Phoenix Brands, LLC as part of their plan to focus on their higher margin oral, personal, and pet care products.[7][8]
In 2006, Colgate-Palmolive announced the intended acquisition of Tom's of Maine, a leading maker of natural toothpaste, for US $100 million.[9] Tom's of Maine was founded by Tom Chappell in 1970.
Today, Colgate has numerous subsidiary organizations spanning 200 countries, but it is publicly listed in only two, the United States and India.
On October 25, 2012, the company announced it would cut 2,310 workers, or 6% of its workforce, by the end of 2016 in a push to make the consumer products company more efficient.[10][11]
Educational and community involvement[edit]
In 1890, Madison University in New York State was renamed Colgate University in honor of the Colgate family following decades of financial support and involvement.[12]
The Colgate-Palmolive Company has sponsored a non-profit track meet open to women of all ages called the Colgate Women's Games.[13] The Colgate Women's Games is the nation's largest amateur track series open to all girls from elementary school through college. Held at Brooklyn's Pratt Institute, competitors participate in preliminary meets and semi-finals over five weekends throughout January. Finalists compete for trophies and educational grants-in-aid from Colgate-Palmolive Company at New York City's Madison Square Garden in February. For more than 20 years, the company supports the Starlight Children Foundation which is a non profit organization dedicated to help seriously ill children and their families. The mission is to help children to cope with pain, fear and isolation through entertainment, family activities and education.(2012)
Ethical record[edit]
The Ethical Consumer Research Association once recommended that its readers not buy Colgate because of its use of animal testing, though this is no longer the case.[citation needed] In 2011, Colgate-Palmolive was one of the first companies recognized by PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) under the new "working for regulatory change" category for companies that test on animals only when mandated by government regulations and are actively seeking alternatives to animal testing.[14] This relates to the corporation's decision to continue to participate in the profitable Chinese market, where some animal testing is still a regulatory requirement.[15] Other ethical companies have chosen to decline entry to this market.[16]
In 2006 Colgate-Palmolive acquired an 84% stake in Tom's of Maine.[9][17]
In 2011 the company chose to retain the use of the antibacterial agent triclosan in its market-leading Total toothpaste range, despite withdrawing it from several other product ranges, following concerns about triclosan's impact on health and the environment.[18]
Environmental record[edit]
Products of the Colgate-Palmolive company, specifically "Total" brand toothpaste contain triclosan. This ingredient has a questionable impact on waterways and marine life.
Colgate consumes approximately 0.2 percent of the combined palm oil output of Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand,[19] the cultivation of which is known for environmental impacts on a global level including: deforestation, loss of natural habitats of critically endangered species, and increased greenhouse gas emissions.
Colgate-Palmolive, as a successor to The Mennen Company, is one of about 300 companies held potentially responsible for hazardous waste at the Chemsol federal Superfund site in Piscataway, New Jersey.[20] Their involvement in this site may have contributed to the contamination of an estimated 18,500 cubic yards (14,100 m3) of soil with volatile organic compounds (VOCs), PCBs, and lead off-site. A proposed $23 million agreement with the government and state of New Jersey would require Colgate-Palmolive and the other involved companies to pay for the cleanup of this hazardous waste that is contaminating the soil as well as the groundwater.[21] The company completed a LEED Silver certified manufacturing plant in Morristown, Tennessee in March 2008 which was the first of its kind in the U.S. The new LEED silver certified plant in Tennessee produces the Colgate Total toothpaste.[22]
Colgate Palmolive received the 2012 Safe-in-Sound Excellence in Hearing Loss Prevention Award.[23]
Anti-competitive practices[edit]
Colgate Palmolive was fined by Autorité de la concurrence in France in 2016 for price-fixing on personal hygiene products.[24]
Hill's Colgate (Japan)[edit]
In November 2016, Hill's-Colgate (Japan) Ltd. announced it will change its name to Colgate-Palmolive Japan Ltd. in 2017. However in February 2017 Cook stated that it is considering its first manufacturing plant in Japan. By the beginning of 2019, the 50,000 square feet facility will open while 50,000 jobs or addition install 150 robots annually.
Corporate governance[edit]
Current members of the board of directors of Colgate-Palmolive are:

Ian M. Cook, Chairman, President and CEO
John T. Cahill
Ellen Hancock
Richard Kogan
Delano Lewis
Pedro Reinhard
Stephen Sadove

Employment diversity[edit]
Colgate-Palmolive was named one of the "100 Best Companies for Working Mothers" by Working Mother magazine.[25] The 2012 Human Rights Campaign "report card" on American businesses gave Colgate an A for its support of diversity in the workplace.

Notes:
* While detergent brands continue to be manufactured and sold by Colgate-Palmolive in some countries, in the United States they have been sold to another company, Phoenix Brands, and are no longer made by C-P in the U.S.[44] In May 2015, Colgate-Palmolive sold its Australian laundry detergents and pre-wash brands to Henkel for US$245 million (€220 million).[45] Colgate-Palmolive has divested its laundry detergents business in Colombia, which was in turn acquired by Unilever and some Asian countries, which was acquired by Procter & Gamble.[46]
** Still being made by Colgate-Palmolive internationally, but no longer available in the U.S.
Vintage commercials for many of these discontinued C-P products can still be seen on YouTube.
Facilities[edit]
In the U.S., the company operates approximately 60 properties of which 14 are owned.[47] Major U.S. manufacturing and warehousing facilities used by the oral, personal and home care segment of Colgate-Palmolive are located in Morristown, New Jersey (previously the headquarters of the Mennen company prior to their 1991 buyout, and still HQ of the Mennen division); Morristown, Tennessee; and Cambridge, Ohio. The pet nutrition segment has major facilities in Bowling Green, Kentucky; Emporia, Kansas; Topeka, Kansas; Commerce, California; and Richmond, Indiana. The primary research center for oral, personal and home care products is located in Piscataway, New Jersey and the primary research center for pet nutrition products is located in Topeka, Kansas.
Overseas, the company operates approximately 280 properties of which 80 are owned in over 70 countries.[47] Major overseas facilities used by the Oral, Personal and Home Care segment are located in Australia, Brazil, China, Colombia, France, Guatemala, India, Italy, Malaysia, Mexico, Poland, South Africa, Thailand, Venezuela, Vietnam and elsewhere throughout the world.
Colgate-Palmolive has closed or is in the process of phasing out production at certain facilities under a restructuring program initiated in 2004 and has built new state-of-the-art plants to produce toothpaste in the U.S., Mexico and Poland.[48][49]
Colgate-Palmolive's chief manufacturing plant is located in Burlington, New Jersey, producing all of the fragrance and flavor oils for the company's facilities around the world.
Advertising[edit]
The iconic hand on the Palmolive dishwashing soap label belongs to Elizabeth Barbour. The image is an illustration of a photograph taken in 1985 when the Colgate-Palmolive Company updated the image, hiring Barbour, then a hand model with the Ford Agency in New York City.

History[edit]




1922 advertisement for Palmolive soap


In 1806 devout Baptist English immigrant soap and candle maker William Colgate established a starch, soap, and candle factory on Dutch Street in New York City under the name "William Colgate & Company". In 1833 he suffered a severe heart attack, stopping his business' sales; after a convalescence he continued with his business. In the 1840s the firm began selling individual cakes of soap in uniform weights. In 1857 Colgate died and the company was reorganized as "Colgate & Company" under the management of his devout Baptist son Samuel Colgate, who did not want to continue the business but thought it would be the right thing to do. In 1872 he introduced Cashmere Bouquet, a perfumed soap. In 1873 the firm introduced its first Colgate Toothpaste, an aromatic toothpaste sold in jars.[4] In 1896, the company sold the first toothpaste in a tube, Colgate Ribbon Dental Cream (invented by dentist Washington Sheffield). Also in 1896, Colgate hired Martin Ittner and under his direction founded one of the first applied research labs.[5] By 1908 they initiated mass sales of toothpaste in tubes. William's other son, James Boorman Colgate, was a primary trustee of Colgate University (formerly Madison University).




1915 magazine ad


In Milwaukee, Wisconsin, the B.J. Johnson Company was making a soap entirely of palm oil and olive oil, the formula of which was developed by B.J. Johnson in 1898. The soap was popular enough to rename their company after it — "Palmolive".[6] Around the start of the 20th century Palmolive, which contained both palm and olive oils, was the world's best-selling soap. Extensive advertising included the radio programs The Palmolive Hour (1927-1931) and Palmolive Beauty Box Theater (1934-1937). A Missouri-based soap manufacturer known as Peet Brothers merged with Palmolive to become Palmolive-Peet. In 1928, Palmolive-Peet bought the Colgate Company to create the Colgate-Palmolive-Peet Company. In 1953 "Peet" was dropped from the title, leaving only "Colgate-Palmolive Company", the current name.
Colgate-Palmolive has long been in competition with Procter & Gamble, the world's largest soap and detergent maker. P&G introduced its Tide laundry detergent shortly after World War II, and thousands of consumers turned from Colgate's soaps to the new product. Colgate lost its number one place in the toothpaste market when P&G added fluoride to its toothpaste. In the beginning of TV, Colgate-Palmolive wished to compete with P&G as a sponsor of soap operas and sponsored many soaps in full or in part including The Doctors.
George Henry Lesch, president, CEO, and chairman of the board of Colgate-Palmolive in the 1960s and 1970s, during that time transformed it into a modern company with major restructuring.
In 2005, Colgate sold the under-performing brands Fab, Dynamo, Arctic Power, ABC, Cold Power and Fresh Start, as well as the license of the Ajax brand for laundry detergents in the US, Canada and Puerto Rico, to Phoenix Brands, LLC as part of their plan to focus on their higher margin oral, personal, and pet care products.[7][8]
In 2006, Colgate-Palmolive announced the intended acquisition of Tom's of Maine, a leading maker of natural toothpaste, for US $100 million.[9] Tom's of Maine was founded by Tom Chappell in 1970.
Today, Colgate has numerous subsidiary organizations spanning 200 countries, but it is publicly listed in only two, the United States and India.
On October 25, 2012, the company announced it would cut 2,310 workers, or 6% of its workforce, by the end of 2016 in a push to make the consumer products company more efficient.[10][11]
Educational and community involvement[edit]
In 1890, Madison University in New York State was renamed Colgate University in honor of the Colgate family following decades of financial support and involvement.[12]
The Colgate-Palmolive Company has sponsored a non-profit track meet open to women of all ages called the Colgate Women's Games.[13] The Colgate Women's Games is the nation's largest amateur track series open to all girls from elementary school through college. Held at Brooklyn's Pratt Institute, competitors participate in preliminary meets and semi-finals over five weekends throughout January. Finalists compete for trophies and educational grants-in-aid from Colgate-Palmolive Company at New York City's Madison Square Garden in February. For more than 20 years, the company supports the Starlight Children Foundation which is a non profit organization dedicated to help seriously ill children and their families. The mission is to help children to cope with pain, fear and isolation through entertainment, family activities and education.(2012)
Ethical record[edit]
The Ethical Consumer Research Association once recommended that its readers not buy Colgate because of its use of animal testing, though this is no longer the case.[citation needed] In 2011, Colgate-Palmolive was one of the first companies recognized by PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) under the new "working for regulatory change" category for companies that test on animals only when mandated by government regulations and are actively seeking alternatives to animal testing.[14] This relates to the corporation's decision to continue to participate in the profitable Chinese market, where some animal testing is still a regulatory requirement.[15] Other ethical companies have chosen to decline entry to this market.[16]
In 2006 Colgate-Palmolive acquired an 84% stake in Tom's of Maine.[9][17]
In 2011 the company chose to retain the use of the antibacterial agent triclosan in its market-leading Total toothpaste range, despite withdrawing it from several other product ranges, following concerns about triclosan's impact on health and the environment.[18]
Environmental record[edit]
Products of the Colgate-Palmolive company, specifically "Total" brand toothpaste contain triclosan. This ingredient has a questionable impact on waterways and marine life.
Colgate consumes approximately 0.2 percent of the combined palm oil output of Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand,[19] the cultivation of which is known for environmental impacts on a global level including: deforestation, loss of natural habitats of critically endangered species, and increased greenhouse gas emissions.
Colgate-Palmolive, as a successor to The Mennen Company, is one of about 300 companies held potentially responsible for hazardous waste at the Chemsol federal Superfund site in Piscataway, New Jersey.[20] Their involvement in this site may have contributed to the contamination of an estimated 18,500 cubic yards (14,100 m3) of soil with volatile organic compounds (VOCs), PCBs, and lead off-site. A proposed $23 million agreement with the government and state of New Jersey would require Colgate-Palmolive and the other involved companies to pay for the cleanup of this hazardous waste that is contaminating the soil as well as the groundwater.[21] The company completed a LEED Silver certified manufacturing plant in Morristown, Tennessee in March 2008 which was the first of its kind in the U.S. The new LEED silver certified plant in Tennessee produces the Colgate Total toothpaste.[22]
Colgate Palmolive received the 2012 Safe-in-Sound Excellence in Hearing Loss Prevention Award.[23]
Anti-competitive practices[edit]
Colgate Palmolive was fined by Autorité de la concurrence in France in 2016 for price-fixing on personal hygiene products.[24]
Hill's Colgate (Japan)[edit]
In November 2016, Hill's-Colgate (Japan) Ltd. announced it will change its name to Colgate-Palmolive Japan Ltd. in 2017. However in February 2017 Cook stated that it is considering its first manufacturing plant in Japan. By the beginning of 2019, the 50,000 square feet facility will open while 50,000 jobs or addition install 150 robots annually.

Employment diversity[edit]
Colgate-Palmolive was named one of the "100 Best Companies for Working Mothers" by Working Mother magazine.[25] The 2012 Human Rights Campaign "report card" on American businesses gave Colgate an A for its support of diversity in the workplace.

Notes:
* While detergent brands continue to be manufactured and sold by Colgate-Palmolive in some countries, in the United States they have been sold to another company, Phoenix Brands, and are no longer made by C-P in the U.S.[44] In May 2015, Colgate-Palmolive sold its Australian laundry detergents and pre-wash brands to Henkel for US$245 million (€220 million).[45] Colgate-Palmolive has divested its laundry detergents business in Colombia, which was in turn acquired by Unilever and some Asian countries, which was acquired by Procter & Gamble.[46]
** Still being made by Colgate-Palmolive internationally, but no longer available in the U.S.
Vintage commercials for many of these discontinued C-P products can still be seen on YouTube.
Facilities[edit]
In the U.S., the company operates approximately 60 properties of which 14 are owned.[47] Major U.S. manufacturing and warehousing facilities used by the oral, personal and home care segment of Colgate-Palmolive are located in Morristown, New Jersey (previously the headquarters of the Mennen company prior to their 1991 buyout, and still HQ of the Mennen division); Morristown, Tennessee; and Cambridge, Ohio. The pet nutrition segment has major facilities in Bowling Green, Kentucky; Emporia, Kansas; Topeka, Kansas; Commerce, California; and Richmond, Indiana. The primary research center for oral, personal and home care products is located in Piscataway, New Jersey and the primary research center for pet nutrition products is located in Topeka, Kansas.
Overseas, the company operates approximately 280 properties of which 80 are owned in over 70 countries.[47] Major overseas facilities used by the Oral, Personal and Home Care segment are located in Australia, Brazil, China, Colombia, France, Guatemala, India, Italy, Malaysia, Mexico, Poland, South Africa, Thailand, Venezuela, Vietnam and elsewhere throughout the world.
Colgate-Palmolive has closed or is in the process of phasing out production at certain facilities under a restructuring program initiated in 2004 and has built new state-of-the-art plants to produce toothpaste in the U.S., Mexico and Poland.[48][49]
Colgate-Palmolive's chief manufacturing plant is located in Burlington, New Jersey, producing all of the fragrance and flavor oils for the company's facilities around the world.
Advertising[edit]
The iconic hand on the Palmolive dishwashing soap label belongs to Elizabeth Barbour. The image is an illustration of a photograph taken in 1985 when the Colgate-Palmolive Company updated the image, hiring Barbour, then a hand model with the Ford Agency in New York City.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
