Power Management ICs
Semtech supplies power management ICs used in telecommunications and industrial equipment, portable devices, computers, and networks. Their products include products for the telecom industry, and low power, small-package, high-efficiency products for cell phones, handsets, notebook PCs and other portable devices. In addition, they continue to supply power products that enable architectures from companies such as Intel and AMD.
ESD Protection
Semtech provides TVS (Transient Voltage Suppression) diodes that safeguard low voltage circuits against damage or latch-up caused by electrostatic discharge (ESD), lightning, and other destructive voltage transients. Their circuit protection products feature low clamping voltage, low capacitance, and low leakage current. And, they meet the industry’s toughest transient immunity standards, including those of IEC, ETSI, Bellcore 1089 and FCC part 68.
Wireless & Sensing
Semtech provides integrated, short range wireless connectivity solutions (up to 1 km / 0.6miles) for Personal Area Networks and Home & Building Automation Networks. These ultra-low power, low-voltage products deliver voice, pressure, temperature, acceleration, time, position, speed, and other analog inputs through a short-range wireless link, while delivering data/commands to sensors and actuators to perform the desired function in personal or local networks. Typical applications include home automation, remote metering and control, GPS positioning for asset tracking, hearing aids and wireless headsets.
Advanced Communications
Semtech timing synchronization products, power controllers, power regulators, transient voltage suppressors, high-speed line drivers, and ECL clock/logic devices are employed throughout optical telecom networks.
Test & Measurement
Semtech supplies products and technology to manufacturers of automated testing equipment. They offer pin electronic solutions consisting of driver/comparator/loads, PMUs, DACs, deskews, signal and clock distribution, power, and protection products. And they use a variety of process/design sources to offer products which support a wide range of automated testing equipment.
Power Discretes
Semtech supplies power products in axial or surface-mount discretes, or in various custom assembly configurations. The designs are in packages that are hermetic[citation needed] and varied in their overall function and construction. These products range from single- to multi-phase devices in high-current/high-voltage configurations. Among their uses are power supplies, base stations, motor drives, and medical equipment. Custom devices are available.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.

Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

The new ultra-low-Ron (32mΩ) load-switch is critical in improving power performance by maintaining a negligible voltage drop when the switch is turned on.           New addition to FemtoSwitch that markets to the automotive industry.        A photo accompanying this announcement is available at http://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/f5848f2e-e697-4298-8c0f-fb3f9b40d4c8The new addition extends Semtech’s FemtoSwitch family of high-performance analog load switch ICs with the automotive qualified capability. It offers a very low Quiescent Current (1uA) and Shutdown Current (300nA), ideal for preserving the battery life of certain products such as automotive smart-keys. For higher reliability, the electrostatic discharge (ESD) capability has been hardened to 4kV which is beyond the industry standard.“Consumers are demanding more ease and functionalities in their products including smart-keys,” said Francois Ricodeau, Product Line Manager for Semtech’s Power and High-Reliability Products Group. “By adding the new automotive qualification to FemtoSwitch, Semtech is positioned to meet the industry and consumer trends and demands.”Key Features of the New FemtoSwitchAutomotive AEC-Q100 (Grade 3) qualifiedProvides extremely low turned-on resistance2A continuous output currentOver temperature protectionHardened ESD protectionUltra-small 0.9 x 0.9 mm packagePricing and AvailabilityThe ultra-low-Ron load switch (SKU: SC33020HQ) are available immediately in production quantities and are priced at $0.61 each in 1,000-piece lots.
