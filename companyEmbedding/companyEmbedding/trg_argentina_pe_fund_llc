Investment Strategies & Solutions
TRG offers emerging market-focused products across asset classes in three primary business lines: hedge funds, fixed income, and private markets.  All of TRG's investment strategies employ top-down and bottom-up fundamental research capabilities to develop investment themes and strategies, as well as a broad array of hedging techniques, involving both emerging markets and G7 securities, to reduce volatility and enhance returns.  The firm's multi-product line construct is designed to create synergies across all of the firm's strategies, supporting information flow and overall performance.  TRG is able to leverage these resources to offer investors both traditional forms of exposure to emerging markets as well as customized solutions.  The current product line includes:
Hedge Funds
TRG's hedge funds employ an opportunistic, discretionary macro investment approach with a focus on global emerging markets.  The funds seek returns through investments centered around both fundamental macroeconomic themes and market dislocation opportunities.  Core directional and relative value investments are enhanced by dynamic asset allocation and selective hedging.
Fixed Income
TRG's fixed income products leverage the same comprehensive investment and risk management resources as the firm's hedge funds to provide investors with long-biased access to emerging market currency and fixed income markets.  As a complement to TRG's hedge fund offerings, which pursue absolute returns, the fixed income line of business targets outperformance relative to a variety of emerging market benchmarks.
Private Markets
TRG’s Private Markets team has been investing in private investment transactions in Emerging Markets since 2001, including investments in private equity, real estate, structured credit, and distressed debt.  TRG's private market investments follow a distinct approach that balances global perspective with local insight and execution.  The products are managed by highly experienced investment teams based in local offices with a successful track record of investments across regions and industries in emerging markets. 
TRG has expanded its private investing expertise through three acquisitions.  The first, the purchase of a 50% ownership interest in ARCH Capital Management Company Limited ("ARCH"), was completed in 2011.  Arch is an established Hong Kong based asset management company that invests in residential and commercial real estate projects with a focus on Greater China.  The second transaction was the 2012 purchase of a 60% ownership stake in Capital Advisors Partners Asia Pte. Ltd. ("CapAsia").  CapAsia is a Singapore-based mid-market infrastructure private equity firm focused exclusively on non-BRIC emerging Asia markets. The third transaction was the 2013 acquisition of Citi Venture Capital International, the Emerging Market private equity investment unit formerly owned by Citigroup Inc.

The Rohatyn Group has acquired a majority stake in Eco Minera, an Argentinian mining service company. No financial terms were disclosed.
PRESS RELEASE
NEW YORK–(BUSINESS WIRE)–The Rohatyn Group (“TRG”), an emerging markets asset management firm, announced the successful completion of its acquisition of a majority stake in Eco Minera (the “Company”), one of the largest independent mining services companies in Argentina, through the TRG Argentina Private Equity Fund. Founded in 1996, Eco Minera specializes in drilling and soil movement services, and provides drilling services to exploration and production mining projects located in the largest mining provinces in Argentina.
TRG Managing Director Roberto Chute said, “Eco Minera has an excellent reputation with a successful 20-year track record and extensive industry knowledge. The Company has become one of the largest mining services company in Argentina on the basis of providing timely, reliable and efficient service to its clients. We are excited to further propel Eco Minera’s growth.”
TRG CEO Nick Rohatyn added, “The implementation of economic policy reforms by President Mauricio Macri has marked an important watershed in Argentina’s investment environment. The mining industry, which is still in early stages of development and remains heavily unexplored, shows particular promise for further investments due to the recent transition to a market-friendly administration.”
Enrique Martin, one of Eco Minera’s founders commented, “We are pleased to partner with a firm of TRG’s caliber and feel strongly that their support will be instrumental in our expansion plans. We will also look forward to leveraging their expertise in strengthening corporate governance to further enhance our best practices.”

Investment Approach

The portfolio managers strategically invest and dynamically manage a mix of high grade, high yield and international fixed income sectors.  The managers employ an investment process that combines top-down macro analysis to shape the overall posture of the strategy while empowering individual "sleeve" managers to select securities.  



Risk Management

Our team limits exposure to individual companies, industries and sectors, seeking to limit volatility through company quality and diversification.


Risk Management Overview



We conduct rigorous fundamental research to identify individual companies with asymmetrical risk/return opportunities.


Risk Management Overview



At the portfolio level, our experienced investment personnel closely monitor the strategy's positioning, and the active risk resulting from our security selection process and sector allocations. We evaluate factor and style exposure, as well as the ownership and liquidity profile of each security in the portfolio.


Risk Management Overview



Our team proactively manages risk by constructing diversified portfolios across sectors, industry groups and securities. We manage, monitor and limit sector weights relative to specified benchmarks and security position sizes within each portfolio.


Risk Management Overview



Our team closely monitors position size and sector weights; we have limits on active security weights against the benchmark for each strategy we manage.


Risk Management Overview



Risk is managed at the portfolio, strategy and security levels to identify diversified sources of alpha. We mainly focus on currency, interest rates and credit. Positions are sized and monitored according to established limits.


Risk Management Overview



We focus primarily on senior loans in an effort to maintain product integrity and limit duration risk.


Risk Management Overview



The team manages risk at both a strategy and individual security level to help ensure that, when combined, they act as the ballast in an investor’s overall portfolio.


Risk Management Overview



Risk is managed at the portfolio, strategy and security levels to identify diversified sources of alpha. We seek to identify primary and secondary risks of each investment. Diversification of sectors can potentially reduce volatility.


Risk Management Overview



The team manages risk by administering duration limits, limiting portfolio weighted average maturity and conducting thorough credit analysis on individual securities.


Risk Management Overview



The Rochester team has created diverse portfolios designed to mitigate the types of risks that municipal bond investors may encounter.


Risk Management Overview



The Commodities team manages risk on multiple levels, including individual commodity sector levels and overall fund level.


Risk Management Overview



The Real Estate team monitors and manages risk at the security, sector and strategy levels.


Risk Management Overview



The Global Multi-Asset Group monitors and manages risk on an ongoing basis, both at the asset class and portfolio levels.


Risk Management Overview



We emphasize capital preservation by avoiding companies that may cut distributions. We seek to build diversified portfolios comprised of energy and energy related companies with attractive risk-adjusted total return potential.


Risk Management Overview



The Alternative Strategies team evaluates risk on multiple levels, applying numerous risk analysis methods on an ongoing basis in addition to assessing risk impacts of a position prior to making investment decisions.


Risk Management Overview



Risk is monitored by quantitative risk system and managed at many levels – stock, sector, country, and style factors. We seek to diversify the portfolio across the global listed infrastructure market and adhere to an established risk framework, including constraints imposed by position limits versus a benchmark.


Risk Management Overview



We monitor and manage both security and sector weights to the underlying index to ensure that the portfolio is properly tracking its benchmark. Also, partnering with well-known index providers ensures that we hold only high quality securities that pass very stringent profitability and liquidity screens.


Risk Management Overview




Risk Management


Multi-Sector Fixed Income Team Risk Management
For some portfolios, management decisions are constrained by tracking error and concentration limits versus an internal benchmark. For all of our funds, qualitative and quantitative analysis is utilized to make top-down, macroeconomic decisions affecting the overall allocation.
Enterprise Risk Management
Risk Management is an independent control function at OppenheimerFunds responsible for multiple areas of risk including investment risk, counterparty risk, enterprise risk and performance attribution. The team is headed by the firm's Chief Risk Officer, who reports directly to the CEO. This structure ensures that the entire Risk Management team is independent from the investment process, allowing us to avoid conflicts of interest and providing a valuable second set of eyes on both investment and enterprise-wide risks.
Core Responsibilities of Risk Management Team

Performs comprehensive portfolio reviews with all investment teams
Monitors individual security holdings across the entire firm
Works with investment teams to set specific maximums for the active weights of securities and sectors, as well as for predicted tracking error and other risk metrics
Independently monitors specified team risk metrics

The aim of our Risk Management team is to enable the portfolio managers to make informed decisions on the risk/reward tradeoffs at play in their respective portfolios.
We believe that risk management is not only a responsibility of the firm, but a critical component of our success.

Fixed income investing entails credit risks and interest rate risks. When interest rates rise, bond prices generally fall, and a fund's share prices can fall. Foreign investments may be volatile and involve additional expenses and special risks, including currency fluctuations, foreign taxes and political and economic uncertainties.

1. 
The Fund's investment objective changed from "seeks high current income to "seeks total return" on 6/4/12. 


2. 
Special Risks: Fixed income investing entails credit and interest rate risks. Interest rate risk is the risk that rising interest rates or an expectation of rising interest rates in the near future, will cause the values of the Fund's investments to decline. Risks associated with rising interest rates are heightened given that rates in the U.S. are at or near historic lows. When interest rates rise, bond prices generally fall, and the Fund’s share prices can fall. The Fund may invest in senior floating rate loans that may be collateralized or uncollateralized. Senior loans are subject to credit, interest rate, prepayment and liquidity risk.  Below-investment-grade (“high yield” or “junk”) bonds are more at risk of default and are subject to liquidity risk.  Mortgage-related securities are subject to default risk, prepayment risk, interest rate risk, and credit risk, and may be more volatile and less liquid than other types of securities. Sovereign debt instruments are subject to the risk that a government entity may be unable to pay interest or repay principal on its debt.  Foreign investments may be volatile and involve additional expenses and special risks, including currency fluctuations, foreign taxes, regulatory and geopolitical risks.  Emerging and developing market investments may be especially volatile. Eurozone investments may be subject to volatility and liquidity issues.   Derivative instruments entail higher volatility and risk of loss compared to traditional stock or bond investments.  Regulation S securities are privately offered securities, may be illiquid, and involve a high degree of risk which may result in substantial losses to the Fund. The Fund may also invest through a wholly-owned Cayman Islands subsidiary, which involves the risk that changes to the laws of the Cayman Islands could negatively affect the Fund.   Diversification does not guarantee profit or protect against loss.


3. 
The Manager has contractually agreed to waive expenses in an amount equal to the management fee it receives from its Subsidiary for so long as the Fund invests in the Subsidiary.  This waiver may not be terminated without the prior approval of the Fund's Board of Trustees.


4. 
The net expense ratio (where applicable) also takes into account contractual fee waivers and/or expense reimbursements without which performance would have been less.  These undertakings may not be amended or withdrawn for one year from the date of the current prospectus, unless approved by the Board.


5. 
Access index definitions.


6. 
The dividend (or distribution) yield is based on the pay date immediately preceding the nearest month-end or quarter-end.  The dividend yield for each share class is calculated by annualizing the dividend distributed by the class on that date and dividing that figure by the class's net asset value on that date.  For the Class A dividend yield with sales charge, the annualized Class A dividend distribution is divided by the Class A maximum offering price on that date.  Each result is compounded semiannually and annualized.  Falling share prices artificially increase yields.


7. 
Standardized yield for each share class is based on an SEC standardized formula designed to approximate a Fund's annualized hypothetical current income from securities less expenses for the 30-day period ending and including the most recent month-end or quarter-end and either that date's maximum offering price (Class A shares) or net asset value (for other share classes).  The month-end figure is typically calculated on the fifth business day of the next month. The result is compounded semiannually and annualized.  Falling share prices artificially increase yields.


8. 
Holdings are subject to change, and are dollar weighted based on total net assets. Negative weightings may result from the use of leverage. Leverage involves the use of various financial instruments or borrowed capital in an attempt to increase investment return. Leverage risks include potential for higher volatility, greater decline of the fund's net asset value and fluctuations of dividends and distributions paid by the fund.


9. 
If included in the credit rating breakdown table above, all securities except for those labeled "Treasury", "Agency," and "Unrated," have been rated by at least one Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization ("NRSRO"), such as S&P Global Ratings ("S&P"). For securities rated only by an NRSRO other than S&P, OppenheimerFunds converts that rating to the equivalent S&P rating. If two or more NRSROs have assigned a rating to a security, the highest S&P equivalent rating is used. Unrated securities do not necessarily indicate low credit quality, and may or may not be the equivalent of investment-grade. "Investment-grade" securities are securities rated within the NRSROs four highest rating categories, which include AAA, AA, A and BBB. Please consult the Fund's Prospectus and Statement of Additional Information for further information.


10. 
The table for the top currency positioning is based on the net foreign exchange exposure of each currency after converting all currencies to a common currency, in this case the U.S. dollar. 


A. 
The performance data quoted represents past performance, which does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment in the Fund will fluctuate so that an investor's shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than the original cost. Current performance and expense ratios may be lower or higher than the data quoted. Fund returns include changes in share price, reinvested distributions and a 4.75% maximum sales charge where indicated.

These returns would be lower if sales charges were taken into consideration.  Short-term returns may not be indicative of longer-term performance, which should also be considered when making investment decisions.

Investment Approach

The portfolio manager invests primarily in small- and mid-cap companies domiciled outside the U.S. that offer opportunities for growth. We look to identify future leaders in the early stages of their growth which can also uncover the potential for multi-year gains for investors. 



Risk Management

Our team limits exposure to individual companies, industries and sectors, seeking to limit volatility through company quality and diversification.


Risk Management Overview



We conduct rigorous fundamental research to identify individual companies with asymmetrical risk/return opportunities.


Risk Management Overview



At the portfolio level, our experienced investment personnel closely monitor the strategy's positioning, and the active risk resulting from our security selection process and sector allocations. We evaluate factor and style exposure, as well as the ownership and liquidity profile of each security in the portfolio.


Risk Management Overview



Our team proactively manages risk by constructing diversified portfolios across sectors, industry groups and securities. We manage, monitor and limit sector weights relative to specified benchmarks and security position sizes within each portfolio.


Risk Management Overview



Our team closely monitors position size and sector weights; we have limits on active security weights against the benchmark for each strategy we manage.


Risk Management Overview



Risk is managed at the portfolio, strategy and security levels to identify diversified sources of alpha. We mainly focus on currency, interest rates and credit. Positions are sized and monitored according to established limits.


Risk Management Overview



We focus primarily on senior loans in an effort to maintain product integrity and limit duration risk.


Risk Management Overview

Risk Management Overview




Risk Management


Global Equity Risk Management
We construct diversified portfolios with a bottom-up approach to stock selection, regardless of index orientation. Individual position sizes reflect our confidence in a stock’s risk/reward profile and our understanding of industry dynamics. Sector, industry and country weightings are residuals of our bottom-up stock selection process. Portfolio Managers continuously monitor all holdings to assess any developments that may affect investment theses. An independent Risk Management team also monitors the portfolios, including active security, industry and sector weights, projected volatility and tracking error, exposure to unintended factor bets, and liquidity risk.
Enterprise Risk Management
Risk Management is an independent control function at OppenheimerFunds responsible for multiple areas of risk including investment risk, counterparty risk, enterprise risk and performance attribution.  The team is headed by the firm’s Chief Risk Officer, who reports directly to the CEO.  This structure ensures that the entire Risk Management team is independent from the investment process, allowing us to avoid conflicts of interest and providing a valuable second set of eyes on both investment and enterprise-wide risks.
Core Responsibilities of Risk Management Team

Performs comprehensive portfolio reviews with all investment teams
Monitors individual security holdings across the entire firm
Works with investment teams to set specific maximums for the active weights of securities and sectors, as well as for predicted tracking error and other risk metrics
Independently monitors specified team risk metrics

The aim of our Risk Management team is to enable the portfolio managers to make informed decisions on the risk/reward tradeoffs at play in their respective portfolios.
We believe that risk management is not only a responsibility of the firm, but a critical component of our success.

Special Risks: Foreign investments may be volatile and involve additional expenses and special risks, including currency fluctuations, foreign taxes, regulatory and geopolitical risks. Emerging and developing market investments may be especially volatile. Eurozone investments may be subject to volatility and liquidity issues.  Investments in securities of growth companies may be volatile.  Small and mid-sized company stock is typically more volatile than that of larger company stock.  It may take a substantial period of time to realize a gain on an investment in a small-sized or mid-sized company, if any gain is realized at all. Investing significantly in a particular region, industry, sector or issuer may increase volatility and risk.



3. 
The net expense ratio (where applicable) also takes into account contractual fee waivers and/or expense reimbursements without which performance would have been less.  These undertakings may not be amended or withdrawn for one year from the date of the current prospectus, unless approved by the Board.

Holdings are subject to change, and are dollar weighted based on total net assets. Negative weightings may result from the use of leverage. Leverage involves the use of various financial instruments or borrowed capital in an attempt to increase investment return. Leverage risks include potential for higher volatility, greater decline of the fund's net asset value and fluctuations of dividends and distributions paid by the fund.

Holdings are subject to change, are dollar-weighted based on assets, and may not reflect the use of leverage in the Fund. Market Cap breakdown is calculated using Morningstar's methodology and those capitalization standards may not align with those in the Fund’s prospectus.


8. 
The Morningstar Analyst Rating is not a credit or risk rating but a subjective evaluation performed by the analysts of Morningstar, Inc. (Mstar). Mstar evaluates funds based on five key pillars (process, performance, people, parent and price). Mstar's analysts use this evaluation to identify funds they believe are more likely to outperform over the long term on a risk-adjusted basis. Analysts consider quantitative and qualitative factors and the weightings of each pillar may vary. The Analyst Rating reflects overall assessment and is overseen by Morningstar's Analyst Rating Committee. The analyst rating scale is five-tiered, with three positive ratings (Gold, Silver, Bronze), a Neutral rating and a Negative rating, with Gold being the highest rating and Negative being the lowest rating. The Mstar Analyst Ratings should not be used as the sole basis in evaluating a mutual fund and are based on Mstar's current expectations about future events. Mstar does not represent ratings as a guarantee.  Analyst Ratings involve unknown risks and uncertainties which may cause Mstar's expectations not to occur or to differ significantly.
