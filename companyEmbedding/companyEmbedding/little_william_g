Gucci Founded in Florence in 1921, Gucci has grown from a purveyor of fine leather goods into one of the world’s premiere luxury brands. Sensuality, sophistication, and an always-modern outlook define the label as an exemplar of Italian fashion at its finest. Creative director Alessandro Michele, appointed in 2015, has ushered in a uniquely contemporary vision of luxury with his androgynous, idiosyncratic, and personalized designs. Men’s jewelry and watches adorned with intricate animal motifs and variations on Gucci’s iconic ribbon stripes and logos recontextualize the brand’s legacy of refinement, investing it with an eclecticism suited to the rarefied individuality of today’s menswear devotees.GucciBlack Quilted Embroidered Jacket$1890GucciWhite Quilted Embroidered Jacket$1890GucciRed Oversized Embroidered Wool Cardigan$5495GucciWhite Oversized Vintage 'Blind For Love' Hoodie$2595GucciBlack 'Hollywood' Tiger T-Shirt$1195GucciPink UFO T-Shirt$950GucciBlack Tiger Logo T-Shirt$990GucciMulticolor Lurex Plissé Skirt$1980GucciBlue Embroidered Flared Jeans$1595GucciBlack GG Marmont Backpack$1790GucciBlack Suede GG Marmont Boots$1095GucciBlack Brixton Crushback Loafers$630GucciBlack Bow Suede Ballerina Flats$595GucciPink GG Marmont Backpack$1790GucciPink Princetown Slippers$650GucciWhite Princetown Slippers$650GucciPink Suede GG Marmont Slippers$595GucciBlack Medium 'Gucci Signature' Padlock Bag$1980GucciBlack Fur Princetown Slippers$1050GucciBlack GG Peyton Mules$750GucciBlack Suede GG Marmont Slippers$595GucciBlack & White Queen Margaret Bee Bag$2970GucciRed Small Soho Camera Bag$980GucciPurple Supermini Dionysus Chain Bag$790GucciRed GG Marmont 2.0 Belt Pouch$1050GucciPink Mini GG Marmont 2.0 Camera Bag$980GucciBlack GG Marmont 2.0 Wallet Bag$1395GucciBlack Supermini GG Marmont Chain Bag$890GucciBlack GG Marmont 2.0 Belt Pouch$1050GucciRed GG Marmont Card Holder$230GucciBlack Sequinned UFO Sweatshirt$1495GucciGreen Oversized Rabbit Hoodie$1795GucciWhite 'Hollywood' T-Shirt$990GucciWhite Floral Logo T-Shirt$895GucciBlue & Red Lurex Bow Plissé Skirt$1980GucciBlack & White Jewelled Bee Pouch$790GucciWhite Bow Ace Sneakers$1095GucciWhite Pearls & Studs Ace Sneakers$650GucciBrown Jordaan Loafers$695GucciPink Brixton Loafers$630GucciGold Oversized Square Web Sunglasses$395GucciTortoiseshell Cat-Eye Sunglasses$375GucciBlack 'L'Aveugle Par Amour' Sunglasses$620GucciWhite 'L'Aveugle Par Amour' Sunglasses$620GucciBlack Oversized Square Sunglasses$315GucciBlack Oversized Rectangular Sunglasses$360GucciGold Web Aviator Sunglasses$395GucciBrown Leather GG Belt$420GucciBlack Velvet Medium 'Loved' GG Marmont 2.0 Bag$2695GucciBlue Velvet Medium GG Marmont 2.0 Bag$1790GucciPurple Velvet Small GG Marmont 2.0 Bag$1590GucciRed Broadway Bag$2980GucciBlack Velvet Mini Marmont 2.0 Bag$1290GucciBlack Small GG Signature Padlock Bag$1850GucciBlack Mini Dionysus Bag$1890GucciBeige Medium GG Supreme Padlock Bag$1890GucciBeige Small GG Supreme Camera Bag$950GucciPink Small GG Marmont 2.0 Bag$1890GucciPink Small GG Marmont 2.0 Camera Bag$1195GucciBlack Small GG Marmont 2.0 Bag$1890

Caseyon June 23, 2015Format: Blu-ray|Verified PurchaseThis blu ray transfer (Warners, copyright 2013) is excellent! You can see the fine grain and a million details (except for crossfades and fade outs which are a bit fuzzy, since those always involved second-generation film back in the thirties). I sincerely doubt you'll ever see a better presentation of this classic. I got so much more out of it as compared to the other dozen or so times I've seen this film.Other reviewers can comment on the film itself. Suffice to say that Little Caesar, Public Enemy, and Scarface (1932) are the Frankenstein, Dracula, and Mummys of the gangster film. You NEED to see them. (The "Public Enemy" blu ray from 2013 is just as good as this.)Read more0Comment|

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsA legendary big, big hit -- "Little Caesar" --ByGeorgeon July 26, 2015Format: VHS Tape|Verified PurchaseEdward G. Robinson became an overnight star with this film as "Rico," better known as Little Caesar.  This film also brought Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.to the attention of the American public.  Both actors are very good in their roles and do confirm that "crime does not pay!"  An early "talkie" fromWarner Brothers that was a major box-office success.  Depicts the rise and fall of a notorious gangster.  Along with Paul Muni in "Scarface," and James Cagney in "Public Enemy" this is one of the best-known and best-remembered crime films of the early sound-era in the1930's.  Thesethree films made each actor an overnight major star.  Surprisingly, the films hold up very well and do not only glorify the gangsters portrayed  butalso show their cruelties and vicious behavioral natures.  Cagney;s "Public Enemy" features the immortal Jean Harlow in an early role while HowardHughes "Scarface" features a young George Raft, a middle-aged Boris Karloff (before "Frankenstein") and a rather large co-starring performance by Osgood Perkins  (Anthony Perkin's father).  All highly watchable but "Little Caesar"s the most immortal of the lot.  Eddie Robinson made "Rico" his very own and the rest as they say, is history!Read more0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse4.0 out of 5 starsGreat!ByReviewer from Terraon May 21, 2017Format: DVD|Verified PurchaseReally well done and tightly directed and well acted gangster movie. Has the first drive by shooting in cinematic history. Edward G. steals every scene he was in. Well worth seeing.Read more0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse4.0 out of 5 starsOwn this original classic!ByMichael Drumstixon June 3, 2016Format: Blu-ray|Verified PurchaseLittle Caesar is one of the first of the gangster genre movies. The dialogue is tough, and star, Edward G Robinson gives a bravura performance as a small time hood who moves "East, where things break big!" He quickly rises as head of the mob and has it all, only to lose it just as quickly as he gained it. This performance of Edward G Robinson brought him star status, and can be watched and enjoyed again and again.Restoration and clarity of blu Ray is an added treat. If you're wondering, add it to your collection, and own an original classic!Read more0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse3.0 out of 5 starsIt was OK.ByAmazon Customeron November 11, 2016Format: DVD|Verified PurchaseI thought this was suppose to be one of Edward's best movies.
