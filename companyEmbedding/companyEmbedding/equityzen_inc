NEW YORK, July 18, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- EquityZen Inc., a New York-based FinTech firm that operates a secondary marketplace for company-approved transactions in pre-IPO stock, today announced the closing of a new financing round led by Draper Associates, bringing the company's outside financing to $6.5 million. Their platform has closed over 2,000 company-approved investments in more than 70 large, private firms with low investment minimums. Tim Draper, the legendary venture capitalist who was an early investor in Hotmail, Skype, and Tesla, runs Draper Associates. In addition, he has invested billions across more than 30 countries, including through Draper Fisher Jurvetson and the Draper Venture Network. Among other returning investors is WorldQuant Ventures, backed by the eponymous asset management fund.








"The Draper family nearly invented modern venture capital," said Atish Davda, EquityZen's Chief Executive Officer. "We are excited to partner with them as we expand investment access to tens of thousands more qualified investors who are tired of sitting on the sidelines watching a small number of Silicon Valley insiders profit from the private returns. EquityZen's secure and transparent online investment platform helps private investors diversify their portfolios with blue-chip private companies, not just early stage startups."
Launched in 2013, EquityZen is democratizing access on both sides of the market, always working with the company in which the transactions occur. This latest financing deal comes as private investor interest has picked up in so-called "Unicorn" companies, or private firms valued at $1 billion or more. Technology companies have increasingly deferred initial public offerings (IPO), electing to raise sizable amounts of capital from private markets at high valuations.
"Core to our mission is the belief that to foster robust, liquid secondary markets, you need the buy-in of the company whose shares are being transacted," said Shriram Bhashyam, EquityZen's Co-Founder and Head of Shareholder Relations. "This influences every aspect of how we've built the business and is proven by the 70+ companies we've successfully helped address liquidity needs."
"EquityZen brings private markets to the public," said Phil Haslett, EquityZen's Co-Founder and Head of Investments. "Our platform serves over 15,000 qualified investors from more than 30 countries, spanning high-net-worth-individuals (HNWI), wealth advisors, and institutional money managers. We have successfully completed transactions in more than one-third of the largest 50 unicorns in the US, including AppDynamics, which was purchased by Cisco Systems just prior to its planned IPO."
"The IPO market is no longer feasible," said Tim Draper, Managing Partner of Draper Associates. "Why would any company want to throw away $5 million per year to comply with all those regulations? Or subject themselves to the scrutiny of an increasingly litigious public shareholder base that usually includes a class action lawyer trawler? The private markets are opening up and EquityZen is a great solution to bring liquidity to private companies that want to keep growing without being saddled with the overregulation and fear that comes with being a public company."
"Historically, these high-growth, private companies have been out of reach unless you can write a $20M check. We are making it available to qualified folks for as little as $20,000," says Mr. Davda. "The fresh capital from the Drapers will help us bridge this gap even faster."
About EquityZen EquityZen Inc. (equityzen.com) is a rapidly-growing marketplace for making investments in late-stage private technology companies. EquityZen provides accredited investors, wealth advisors, and institutional money managers access to private markets.
With over 2,000 private placements completed in 70+ premier private companies, EquityZen is building private markets for the public. Investors in the company include behemoths from Silicon Valley and Wall Street, like Draper Associates and WorldQuant Ventures. Press kit available here.
About Draper Associates Draper Associates, founded in 1985, is a premier early-stage venture capital firm that encourages entrepreneurs to drive their businesses to greatness, to transform industries with new technologies, and to build platforms for extraordinary growth, jobs, and wealth creation.

Our Story
EquityZen began with the goal of solving our personal attempts to diversify our holdings. EquityZen eases the pain facing private company employees (and founders, investors, and former employees) that find themselves heavily concentrated in their own company's equity.












































Investments in private placements holding pre-IPO companies are speculative, illiquid, and carry a high degree of risk, including loss of principal.
Investments made on the EquityZen platform are made through pooled investment vehicles, which acquire shares of private technology companies, and are not direct investments in these companies.





We were tired of hearing a recurring story: employees held a majority of their net worth in company stock that was both illiquid and hard to value. Concurrently, investors sought exposure to post-seed, but pre-IPO startups and had nowhere to go for attractive valuations.
As passionate entrepreneurs and experienced investors facing this issue ourselves, we sought to marry two complementary parties. EquityZen was born in 2013. We provide a secure marketplace that matches shareholder offerings with investor demand, through a product that neither adds to shareholder count nor dilutes current investors. (Learn more here.)
Our long term goals are to:

reduce the risk of joining a growing private firm, and
keep employees and employers focused by addressing liquidity and risk concerns.

Let's get you started. Tell us what you're looking for here.

            Offers to sell, or the solicitations of offers to buy, any security can only be made through official offering documents that contain important information about risks, fees and expenses.
            Investing in private companies may be considered highly speculative and involves a high degree of risk, including the risk of substantial loss of investment.

Your privacy is important
At EquityZen INC (the "Company"), your privacy is very important to us. The purpose of this privacy policy (this "Policy") is to provide you with a description of the types of information we collect about you when you visit the EquityZen web site located at equityzen.com, and associated sub-domains (the "Site"), and how we use that information. By visiting or using the Site you agree to the provisions of our Terms of Use and this Policy. If you do not agree to the terms of this Policy, please do not use or access the Site or use the Services (defined below). This Policy only applies to information collected while you are on the Site. For more information on how the Site may redirect you to other web sites, please see the "Links and Redirection to Third Party Sites" section below.
Information We Collect
We collect and store information that you voluntarily provide to us as well as data related to your Site visit.
In some areas of the Site, we request or may request that you provide personally identifiable information, including your name, address, email address, telephone number, username, and other information from which your identity is or may be discernible. We collect personally identifiable information from our users at several different points on the Site. We will also allow you the opportunity to provide information identifying yourself as an investor or borrower and, if you are a borrower, the amount you will be seeking, your desired target rate, the intended use of funds and loan duration. Such information is collected for the purpose of contacting you with information regarding prospective investment or borrowing opportunities (as applicable) based on your specified interests (the "Services"). It is solely up to you whether you furnish such information. If you do provide such information, you are thereby consenting to the use of that information in accordance with the policies and practices described in this Policy. This information may be stored on our servers, and on the servers of third party service providers.
In addition, during your visit we automatically collect certain aggregate information and analytical data related to your Site visit (see "Use of Cookies" below). Aggregate information is non-personally identifiable or anonymous information about you, including the date and time of your visit, the IP address of your computer or mobile device, your computer or mobile device browser information, the Internet address that you visited prior to and after reaching the Site, the name of the domain and host you used to access the Internet, the type of mobile device you use, your mobile device's unique device ID and the features of our Site which you accessed. This data is in no way associated with your personally identifiable information.
How We Use Information
We use collected information to make available and to improve our high standard of reliable services. We use such information to:

respond to inquiries or service requests and monitor such responses;
provide information about and market our Services;
resolve problems; and
manage the Site and assess its usage and usage of the Services.

Disclosure of Information
We do not sell or rent personally identifiable information to third parties who are not affiliates of the Company. Information that you provide will not be shared with any other user of the Site without your consent. We may disclose personally identifiable information to appropriate affiliates of the Company, including strategic alliance affiliates and third party service providers, to respond to a request for service or to provide information about available products or services. We are not limited in our use of non-personal information that does not permit direct association with any specific individual, or non-identifiable aggregate information about our users (such as the number of users of our Services, the geographic distribution of our users, the amount of information located and/or removed, etc.).
We disclose information that we, in good faith, believe is appropriate to cooperate in investigations of fraud or other illegal activity, or to conduct investigations of violations of our Terms of Use. For example, this means that if we conduct a fraud investigation and conclude that one side has engaged in deceptive practices, we can give that person or entity's contact information to victims who request it.
We disclose information in response to a subpoena, warrant, court order, levy, attachment, order of a court-appointed receiver or other comparable legal process, including subpoenas from private parties in a civil action. If the subpoena seeks information about an identified user or limited group of users, we'll make reasonable business efforts to contact the user(s) before providing information to the party that requests it. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to contact the user(s) in all cases, whether because of a time limit, court order, inability to effectively contact a user, or for any other reason.
We may disclose information to your agent or legal representative (such as the holder of a power of attorney that you grant, or a guardian appointed for you).
We share information with companies that provide public relations and marketing services for us. Such information will only be shared by us to customize, measure and improve our products, Services and advertising; it will not be shared with third parties for their marketing purposes. These third parties are obligated to protect your information and are prohibited from using your personally identifiable information for any other purpose.
As with any other business, it is possible that in the future we could merge with or be acquired by another company. If such an acquisition occurs, the successor company would have access to the information maintained by us, including customer account information, but would continue to be bound by this Policy unless and until it is amended.
We share your information with our parent, subsidiaries and joint ventures to help coordinate the Services we provide to you, enforce our terms and conditions, and promote trust and safety.
We may share aggregate (non-personally identifiable) information with certain third parties such as advertisers, national industry organizations, and prospective affiliates. In addition, we reserve the right to disclose aggregate information and personally identifiable information to third parties as required or permitted by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights.
Unsubscribe Options
If you choose to take advantage of the Services by signing up as either an investor or borrower, you will receive periodic emails regarding opportunities which, based on the information you provide, may be of interest. If you no longer wish to receive our communications, you may unsubscribe by following the instructions included in each communication.

Our Story
EquityZen began with the goal of solving our personal attempts to diversify our holdings. EquityZen eases the pain facing private company employees (and founders, investors, and former employees) that find themselves heavily concentrated in their own company's equity.












































Investments in private placements holding pre-IPO companies are speculative, illiquid, and carry a high degree of risk, including loss of principal.
Investments made on the EquityZen platform are made through pooled investment vehicles, which acquire shares of private technology companies, and are not direct investments in these companies.





We were tired of hearing a recurring story: employees held a majority of their net worth in company stock that was both illiquid and hard to value. Concurrently, investors sought exposure to post-seed, but pre-IPO startups and had nowhere to go for attractive valuations.
As passionate entrepreneurs and experienced investors facing this issue ourselves, we sought to marry two complementary parties. EquityZen was born in 2013. We provide a secure marketplace that matches shareholder offerings with investor demand, through a product that neither adds to shareholder count nor dilutes current investors. (Learn more here.)
Our long term goals are to:

reduce the risk of joining a growing private firm, and
keep employees and employers focused by addressing liquidity and risk concerns.

Let's get you started. Tell us what you're looking for here.

For example, this means that if we conduct a fraud investigation and conclude that one side has engaged in deceptive practices, we can give that person or entity's contact information to victims who request it.
We disclose information in response to a subpoena, warrant, court order, levy, attachment, order of a court-appointed receiver or other comparable legal process, including subpoenas from private parties in a civil action. If the subpoena seeks information about an identified user or limited group of users, we'll make reasonable business efforts to contact the user(s) before providing information to the party that requests it. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to contact the user(s) in all cases, whether because of a time limit, court order, inability to effectively contact a user, or for any other reason.
We may disclose information to your agent or legal representative (such as the holder of a power of attorney that you grant, or a guardian appointed for you).
We share information with companies that provide public relations and marketing services for us. Such information will only be shared by us to customize, measure and improve our products, Services and advertising; it will not be shared with third parties for their marketing purposes. These third parties are obligated to protect your information and are prohibited from using your personally identifiable information for any other purpose.
As with any other business, it is possible that in the future we could merge with or be acquired by another company. If such an acquisition occurs, the successor company would have access to the information maintained by us, including customer account information, but would continue to be bound by this Policy unless and until it is amended.
We share your information with our parent, subsidiaries and joint ventures to help coordinate the Services we provide to you, enforce our terms and conditions, and promote trust and safety.
We may share aggregate (non-personally identifiable) information with certain third parties such as advertisers, national industry organizations, and prospective affiliates. In addition, we reserve the right to disclose aggregate information and personally identifiable information to third parties as required or permitted by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights.

                            EquityZen gets shares of companies that others don't. They have interesting ways of getting exposure to shares of companies I really couldn't find anywhere else.
                        

Savneet Singh
Co-Founder, Gold Bullion International^




                            It was great doing business with you guys. You are much better than your competitors who I was dealing with! 10 million times!
                        

S.S.
Shareholder In Multi-billion-dollar Company^




                            Through EquityZen, I got cash for my private stock, at both a better price and larger volume than the company itself offered through SecondMarket. The whole process was very straightforward and efficient.

                            EquityZen is helping us buy a house and is making it much easier to get it done. We are grateful for your service.

            Investment opportunities posted on this website are “private placements” of securities that are not publicly traded, are subject to holding period requirements, and are intended for investors who do not need a liquid investment.
            Private placement investments are NOT bank deposits (and thus NOT insured by the FDIC or by any other federal governmental agency), are NOT guaranteed by EquityZen Securities, and MAY lose value.
            Neither the Securities and Exchange Commission nor any federal or state securities commission or regulatory authority has recommended or approved any investment or the accuracy or completeness of any of the information or materials provided by or through the website.
            Investors must be able to afford the loss of their entire investment.

            Investing in private companies may be considered highly speculative and involves a high degree of risk, including the risk of substantial loss of investment.

Your privacy is important
At EquityZen INC (the "Company"), your privacy is very important to us. The purpose of this privacy policy (this "Policy") is to provide you with a description of the types of information we collect about you when you visit the EquityZen web site located at equityzen.com, and associated sub-domains (the "Site"), and how we use that information. By visiting or using the Site you agree to the provisions of our Terms of Use and this Policy. If you do not agree to the terms of this Policy, please do not use or access the Site or use the Services (defined below). This Policy only applies to information collected while you are on the Site. For more information on how the Site may redirect you to other web sites, please see the "Links and Redirection to Third Party Sites" section below.
Information We Collect
We collect and store information that you voluntarily provide to us as well as data related to your Site visit.
In some areas of the Site, we request or may request that you provide personally identifiable information, including your name, address, email address, telephone number, username, and other information from which your identity is or may be discernible. We collect personally identifiable information from our users at several different points on the Site. We will also allow you the opportunity to provide information identifying yourself as an investor or borrower and, if you are a borrower, the amount you will be seeking, your desired target rate, the intended use of funds and loan duration. Such information is collected for the purpose of contacting you with information regarding prospective investment or borrowing opportunities (as applicable) based on your specified interests (the "Services"). It is solely up to you whether you furnish such information. If you do provide such information, you are thereby consenting to the use of that information in accordance with the policies and practices described in this Policy. This information may be stored on our servers, and on the servers of third party service providers.
In addition, during your visit we automatically collect certain aggregate information and analytical data related to your Site visit (see "Use of Cookies" below). Aggregate information is non-personally identifiable or anonymous information about you, including the date and time of your visit, the IP address of your computer or mobile device, your computer or mobile device browser information, the Internet address that you visited prior to and after reaching the Site, the name of the domain and host you used to access the Internet, the type of mobile device you use, your mobile device's unique device ID and the features of our Site which you accessed. This data is in no way associated with your personally identifiable information.
How We Use Information
We use collected information to make available and to improve our high standard of reliable services. We use such information to:

respond to inquiries or service requests and monitor such responses;
provide information about and market our Services;
resolve problems; and
manage the Site and assess its usage and usage of the Services.

Disclosure of Information
We do not sell or rent personally identifiable information to third parties who are not affiliates of the Company. Information that you provide will not be shared with any other user of the Site without your consent. We may disclose personally identifiable information to appropriate affiliates of the Company, including strategic alliance affiliates and third party service providers, to respond to a request for service or to provide information about available products or services. We are not limited in our use of non-personal information that does not permit direct association with any specific individual, or non-identifiable aggregate information about our users (such as the number of users of our Services, the geographic distribution of our users, the amount of information located and/or removed, etc.).
We disclose information that we, in good faith, believe is appropriate to cooperate in investigations of fraud or other illegal activity, or to conduct investigations of violations of our Terms of Use. For example, this means that if we conduct a fraud investigation and conclude that one side has engaged in deceptive practices, we can give that person or entity's contact information to victims who request it.
We disclose information in response to a subpoena, warrant, court order, levy, attachment, order of a court-appointed receiver or other comparable legal process, including subpoenas from private parties in a civil action. If the subpoena seeks information about an identified user or limited group of users, we'll make reasonable business efforts to contact the user(s) before providing information to the party that requests it. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to contact the user(s) in all cases, whether because of a time limit, court order, inability to effectively contact a user, or for any other reason.
We may disclose information to your agent or legal representative (such as the holder of a power of attorney that you grant, or a guardian appointed for you).
We share information with companies that provide public relations and marketing services for us. Such information will only be shared by us to customize, measure and improve our products, Services and advertising; it will not be shared with third parties for their marketing purposes. These third parties are obligated to protect your information and are prohibited from using your personally identifiable information for any other purpose.
As with any other business, it is possible that in the future we could merge with or be acquired by another company. If such an acquisition occurs, the successor company would have access to the information maintained by us, including customer account information, but would continue to be bound by this Policy unless and until it is amended.
We share your information with our parent, subsidiaries and joint ventures to help coordinate the Services we provide to you, enforce our terms and conditions, and promote trust and safety.
We may share aggregate (non-personally identifiable) information with certain third parties such as advertisers, national industry organizations, and prospective affiliates. In addition, we reserve the right to disclose aggregate information and personally identifiable information to third parties as required or permitted by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights.
Unsubscribe Options
If you choose to take advantage of the Services by signing up as either an investor or borrower, you will receive periodic emails regarding opportunities which, based on the information you provide, may be of interest. If you no longer wish to receive our communications, you may unsubscribe by following the instructions included in each communication.

In Our Clients' Words




                            EquityZen gets shares of companies that others don't. They have interesting ways of getting exposure to shares of companies I really couldn't find anywhere else.

                            It was great doing business with you guys. You are much better than your competitors who I was dealing with! 10 million times!

Shareholder In Multi-billion-dollar Company^




                            Through EquityZen, I got cash for my private stock, at both a better price and larger volume than the company itself offered through SecondMarket. The whole process was very straightforward and efficient.

                            EquityZen is helping us buy a house and is making it much easier to get it done. We are grateful for your service.

Your privacy is important
At EquityZen INC (the "Company"), your privacy is very important to us. The purpose of this privacy policy (this "Policy") is to provide you with a description of the types of information we collect about you when you visit the EquityZen web site located at equityzen.com, and associated sub-domains (the "Site"), and how we use that information. By visiting or using the Site you agree to the provisions of our Terms of Use and this Policy. If you do not agree to the terms of this Policy, please do not use or access the Site or use the Services (defined below). This Policy only applies to information collected while you are on the Site. For more information on how the Site may redirect you to other web sites, please see the "Links and Redirection to Third Party Sites" section below.
Information We Collect
We collect and store information that you voluntarily provide to us as well as data related to your Site visit.
In some areas of the Site, we request or may request that you provide personally identifiable information, including your name, address, email address, telephone number, username, and other information from which your identity is or may be discernible. We collect personally identifiable information from our users at several different points on the Site. We will also allow you the opportunity to provide information identifying yourself as an investor or borrower and, if you are a borrower, the amount you will be seeking, your desired target rate, the intended use of funds and loan duration. Such information is collected for the purpose of contacting you with information regarding prospective investment or borrowing opportunities (as applicable) based on your specified interests (the "Services"). It is solely up to you whether you furnish such information. If you do provide such information, you are thereby consenting to the use of that information in accordance with the policies and practices described in this Policy. This information may be stored on our servers, and on the servers of third party service providers.
In addition, during your visit we automatically collect certain aggregate information and analytical data related to your Site visit (see "Use of Cookies" below). Aggregate information is non-personally identifiable or anonymous information about you, including the date and time of your visit, the IP address of your computer or mobile device, your computer or mobile device browser information, the Internet address that you visited prior to and after reaching the Site, the name of the domain and host you used to access the Internet, the type of mobile device you use, your mobile device's unique device ID and the features of our Site which you accessed. This data is in no way associated with your personally identifiable information.
How We Use Information
We use collected information to make available and to improve our high standard of reliable services. We use such information to:

respond to inquiries or service requests and monitor such responses;
provide information about and market our Services;
resolve problems; and
manage the Site and assess its usage and usage of the Services.

Disclosure of Information
We do not sell or rent personally identifiable information to third parties who are not affiliates of the Company. Information that you provide will not be shared with any other user of the Site without your consent. We may disclose personally identifiable information to appropriate affiliates of the Company, including strategic alliance affiliates and third party service providers, to respond to a request for service or to provide information about available products or services. We are not limited in our use of non-personal information that does not permit direct association with any specific individual, or non-identifiable aggregate information about our users (such as the number of users of our Services, the geographic distribution of our users, the amount of information located and/or removed, etc.).
We disclose information that we, in good faith, believe is appropriate to cooperate in investigations of fraud or other illegal activity, or to conduct investigations of violations of our Terms of Use. For example, this means that if we conduct a fraud investigation and conclude that one side has engaged in deceptive practices, we can give that person or entity's contact information to victims who request it.
We disclose information in response to a subpoena, warrant, court order, levy, attachment, order of a court-appointed receiver or other comparable legal process, including subpoenas from private parties in a civil action. If the subpoena seeks information about an identified user or limited group of users, we'll make reasonable business efforts to contact the user(s) before providing information to the party that requests it. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to contact the user(s) in all cases, whether because of a time limit, court order, inability to effectively contact a user, or for any other reason.
We may disclose information to your agent or legal representative (such as the holder of a power of attorney that you grant, or a guardian appointed for you).
We share information with companies that provide public relations and marketing services for us. Such information will only be shared by us to customize, measure and improve our products, Services and advertising; it will not be shared with third parties for their marketing purposes. These third parties are obligated to protect your information and are prohibited from using your personally identifiable information for any other purpose.
As with any other business, it is possible that in the future we could merge with or be acquired by another company. If such an acquisition occurs, the successor company would have access to the information maintained by us, including customer account information, but would continue to be bound by this Policy unless and until it is amended.
We share your information with our parent, subsidiaries and joint ventures to help coordinate the Services we provide to you, enforce our terms and conditions, and promote trust and safety.
We may share aggregate (non-personally identifiable) information with certain third parties such as advertisers, national industry organizations, and prospective affiliates. In addition, we reserve the right to disclose aggregate information and personally identifiable information to third parties as required or permitted by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights.
Unsubscribe Options
If you choose to take advantage of the Services by signing up as either an investor or borrower, you will receive periodic emails regarding opportunities which, based on the information you provide, may be of interest. If you no longer wish to receive our communications, you may unsubscribe by following the instructions included in each communication.

Redfin: Path to IPO

Charlie Joyce
        |
        July 20, 2017



   Redfin, the Seattle-based real estate brokerage aiming to reshape the industry, recently priced its upcoming IPO between $12 - $14 per share. At this valuation, Redfin would become the latest tech unicorn on the public market. As the company heads towards its public listing, one big question lingers for investors: Should Redfin be valued as a real estate brokerage or as a tech company?

Shriram Bhashyam
        |
        July 06, 2017






   Starting July 10, 2017, all companies seeking an IPO, whether or not they qualify as emerging growth companies (“EGCs”), will be permitted to file their draft IPO registration statements confidentially. This is an important development, as it may lead to more IPOs and is a signal of tone shift at the SEC towards capital formation.

Tech IPO “Down Rounds”: EquityZen Runs the Numbers with Jeremy Abelson and Irving Investors

Phil Haslett
        |
        May 25, 2017



   The
   
    recent Cloudera IPO
   
   has re-ignited a discussion about down rounds. How could a private company
   
    possibly
   
   be valued at $30.92 per share in 2014, and then go public at $15? What could lead to such a corporate phenomenon? Do the valuation techniques of VC firms and Wall Street
   
    really
   
   differ by such a margin?
   


















         Cloudera's valuation was chopped in half between 2014 and 2017
        







   It turns out, down rounds are increasing in regularity, based on data analyzed by EquityZen and
   
    Irving Investors
   
   , a tech-focused hedge fund managed by Jeremy Abelson. But first…

Not So Obvious: Here's What To Know Between NSO and ISO Stock Options

Nat Disston
        |
        May 18, 2017







  The world of startup stock options can be pretty opaque. To outsiders, its seems all one does is join a small company, and, if it works,
  
   everyone becomes millionaires
  
  . For new employees, they often don’t know what
  
   they don’t know
  
  and are faced with piles of new
  
   documents
  
  and
  
   more questions
  
  once they join their budding business. Core to our mission is to help educate employees, companies, and their founders about their
  
   stock options
  
  and what they can do
  
   with their resulting shares

        April 13, 2017






   The change in administrations at the White House has multifold ramifications for startups.

   On January 4, 2017, President-Elect Donald Trump nominated Jay Clayton, a private sector Wall Street lawyer, to serve as the next Chairman of the SEC. While the confirmation hearings will tell us a lot about Mr. Clayton’s background, qualifications, and leanings, I can’t wait that long and preview here what the SEC’s agenda may look like in his tenure.

How to Hedge Against Private Company Valuations

Atish Davda

        January 05, 2017







    "How can I
hedge against private company valuations?"
    





    "Can I short
pre-IPO shares?"
    





    "How do I lock my
shares’ current price?"
    







   I often get variations of these questions. The answer is "no" – but, I usually point out other ways to enhance the private market portfolio. I thought EquityZen’s client base might find them interesting, so below are some ideas. If you have ideas on the matter, please send them my way via a comment or email.

Your privacy is important
At EquityZen INC (the "Company"), your privacy is very important to us. The purpose of this privacy policy (this "Policy") is to provide you with a description of the types of information we collect about you when you visit the EquityZen web site located at equityzen.com, and associated sub-domains (the "Site"), and how we use that information. By visiting or using the Site you agree to the provisions of our Terms of Use and this Policy. If you do not agree to the terms of this Policy, please do not use or access the Site or use the Services (defined below). This Policy only applies to information collected while you are on the Site. For more information on how the Site may redirect you to other web sites, please see the "Links and Redirection to Third Party Sites" section below.
Information We Collect
We collect and store information that you voluntarily provide to us as well as data related to your Site visit.
In some areas of the Site, we request or may request that you provide personally identifiable information, including your name, address, email address, telephone number, username, and other information from which your identity is or may be discernible. We collect personally identifiable information from our users at several different points on the Site. We will also allow you the opportunity to provide information identifying yourself as an investor or borrower and, if you are a borrower, the amount you will be seeking, your desired target rate, the intended use of funds and loan duration. Such information is collected for the purpose of contacting you with information regarding prospective investment or borrowing opportunities (as applicable) based on your specified interests (the "Services"). It is solely up to you whether you furnish such information. If you do provide such information, you are thereby consenting to the use of that information in accordance with the policies and practices described in this Policy. This information may be stored on our servers, and on the servers of third party service providers.
In addition, during your visit we automatically collect certain aggregate information and analytical data related to your Site visit (see "Use of Cookies" below). Aggregate information is non-personally identifiable or anonymous information about you, including the date and time of your visit, the IP address of your computer or mobile device, your computer or mobile device browser information, the Internet address that you visited prior to and after reaching the Site, the name of the domain and host you used to access the Internet, the type of mobile device you use, your mobile device's unique device ID and the features of our Site which you accessed. This data is in no way associated with your personally identifiable information.
How We Use Information
We use collected information to make available and to improve our high standard of reliable services. We use such information to:

respond to inquiries or service requests and monitor such responses;
provide information about and market our Services;
resolve problems; and
manage the Site and assess its usage and usage of the Services.

Disclosure of Information
We do not sell or rent personally identifiable information to third parties who are not affiliates of the Company. Information that you provide will not be shared with any other user of the Site without your consent. We may disclose personally identifiable information to appropriate affiliates of the Company, including strategic alliance affiliates and third party service providers, to respond to a request for service or to provide information about available products or services. We are not limited in our use of non-personal information that does not permit direct association with any specific individual, or non-identifiable aggregate information about our users (such as the number of users of our Services, the geographic distribution of our users, the amount of information located and/or removed, etc.).
We disclose information that we, in good faith, believe is appropriate to cooperate in investigations of fraud or other illegal activity, or to conduct investigations of violations of our Terms of Use. For example, this means that if we conduct a fraud investigation and conclude that one side has engaged in deceptive practices, we can give that person or entity's contact information to victims who request it.
We disclose information in response to a subpoena, warrant, court order, levy, attachment, order of a court-appointed receiver or other comparable legal process, including subpoenas from private parties in a civil action. If the subpoena seeks information about an identified user or limited group of users, we'll make reasonable business efforts to contact the user(s) before providing information to the party that requests it. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to contact the user(s) in all cases, whether because of a time limit, court order, inability to effectively contact a user, or for any other reason.
We may disclose information to your agent or legal representative (such as the holder of a power of attorney that you grant, or a guardian appointed for you).
We share information with companies that provide public relations and marketing services for us. Such information will only be shared by us to customize, measure and improve our products, Services and advertising; it will not be shared with third parties for their marketing purposes. These third parties are obligated to protect your information and are prohibited from using your personally identifiable information for any other purpose.
As with any other business, it is possible that in the future we could merge with or be acquired by another company. If such an acquisition occurs, the successor company would have access to the information maintained by us, including customer account information, but would continue to be bound by this Policy unless and until it is amended.
We share your information with our parent, subsidiaries and joint ventures to help coordinate the Services we provide to you, enforce our terms and conditions, and promote trust and safety.
We may share aggregate (non-personally identifiable) information with certain third parties such as advertisers, national industry organizations, and prospective affiliates. In addition, we reserve the right to disclose aggregate information and personally identifiable information to third parties as required or permitted by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights.

If you no longer wish to receive our communications, you may unsubscribe by following the instructions included in each communication.

Redfin: Path to IPO

Charlie Joyce
        |
        July 20, 2017



   Redfin, the Seattle-based real estate brokerage aiming to reshape the industry, recently priced its upcoming IPO between $12 - $14 per share. At this valuation, Redfin would become the latest tech unicorn on the public market. As the company heads towards its public listing, one big question lingers for investors: Should Redfin be valued as a real estate brokerage or as a tech company?

Shriram Bhashyam
        |
        July 06, 2017






   Starting July 10, 2017, all companies seeking an IPO, whether or not they qualify as emerging growth companies (“EGCs”), will be permitted to file their draft IPO registration statements confidentially. This is an important development, as it may lead to more IPOs and is a signal of tone shift at the SEC towards capital formation.

Tech IPO “Down Rounds”: EquityZen Runs the Numbers with Jeremy Abelson and Irving Investors

Phil Haslett
        |
        May 25, 2017



   The
   
    recent Cloudera IPO
   
   has re-ignited a discussion about down rounds. How could a private company
   
    possibly
   
   be valued at $30.92 per share in 2014, and then go public at $15? What could lead to such a corporate phenomenon? Do the valuation techniques of VC firms and Wall Street
   
    really
   
   differ by such a margin?
   


















         Cloudera's valuation was chopped in half between 2014 and 2017
        







   It turns out, down rounds are increasing in regularity, based on data analyzed by EquityZen and
   
    Irving Investors
   
   , a tech-focused hedge fund managed by Jeremy Abelson. But first…

Not So Obvious: Here's What To Know Between NSO and ISO Stock Options

Nat Disston
        |
        May 18, 2017







  The world of startup stock options can be pretty opaque. To outsiders, its seems all one does is join a small company, and, if it works,
  
   everyone becomes millionaires
  
  . For new employees, they often don’t know what
  
   they don’t know
  
  and are faced with piles of new
  
   documents
  
  and
  
   more questions
  
  once they join their budding business. Core to our mission is to help educate employees, companies, and their founders about their
  
   stock options
  
  and what they can do
  
   with their resulting shares

        April 13, 2017






   The change in administrations at the White House has multifold ramifications for startups. Important among those areas is the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (“SEC”) posture towards Silicon Valley and how that agenda may shift under incoming Chair Jay Clayton. We’ve tapped friend of EquityZen, and former Commissioner at the SEC, Troy A. Paredes to shed some light. You can read Part 1

        January 19, 2017









   On January 4, 2017, President-Elect Donald Trump nominated Jay Clayton, a private sector Wall Street lawyer, to serve as the next Chairman of the SEC. While the confirmation hearings will tell us a lot about Mr. Clayton’s background, qualifications, and leanings, I can’t wait that long and preview here what the SEC’s agenda may look like in his tenure.

    Your Stock Option Agreement. If you work at a startup, you’ve probably got one. It lays out what you can and can’t do with your
    
     stock options

How to Hedge Against Private Company Valuations

Atish Davda

        January 05, 2017







    "How can I
hedge against private company valuations?"
    





    "Can I short
pre-IPO shares?"
    





    "How do I lock my
shares’ current price?"
    







   I often get variations of these questions. The answer is "no" – but, I usually point out other ways to enhance the private market portfolio. I thought EquityZen’s client base might find them interesting, so below are some ideas. If you have ideas on the matter, please send them my way via a comment or email.

Such information is collected for the purpose of contacting you with information regarding prospective investment or borrowing opportunities (as applicable) based on your specified interests (the "Services"). It is solely up to you whether you furnish such information. If you do provide such information, you are thereby consenting to the use of that information in accordance with the policies and practices described in this Policy. This information may be stored on our servers, and on the servers of third party service providers.
In addition, during your visit we automatically collect certain aggregate information and analytical data related to your Site visit (see "Use of Cookies" below). Aggregate information is non-personally identifiable or anonymous information about you, including the date and time of your visit, the IP address of your computer or mobile device, your computer or mobile device browser information, the Internet address that you visited prior to and after reaching the Site, the name of the domain and host you used to access the Internet, the type of mobile device you use, your mobile device's unique device ID and the features of our Site which you accessed.

We disclose information that we, in good faith, believe is appropriate to cooperate in investigations of fraud or other illegal activity, or to conduct investigations of violations of our Terms of Use.

We disclose information in response to a subpoena, warrant, court order, levy, attachment, order of a court-appointed receiver or other comparable legal process, including subpoenas from private parties in a civil action. If the subpoena seeks information about an identified user or limited group of users, we'll make reasonable business efforts to contact the user(s) before providing information to the party that requests it. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to contact the user(s) in all cases, whether because of a time limit, court order, inability to effectively contact a user, or for any other reason.
We may disclose information to your agent or legal representative (such as the holder of a power of attorney that you grant, or a guardian appointed for you).

By visiting or using the Site you agree to the provisions of our Terms of Use and this Policy. If you do not agree to the terms of this Policy, please do not use or access the Site or use the Services (defined below). This Policy only applies to information collected while you are on the Site. For more information on how the Site may redirect you to other web sites, please see the "Links and Redirection to Third Party Sites" section below.
Information We Collect
We collect and store information that you voluntarily provide to us as well as data related to your Site visit.
In some areas of the Site, we request or may request that you provide personally identifiable information, including your name, address, email address, telephone number, username, and other information from which your identity is or may be discernible. We collect personally identifiable information from our users at several different points on the Site. We will also allow you the opportunity to provide information identifying yourself as an investor or borrower and, if you are a borrower, the amount you will be seeking, your desired target rate, the intended use of funds and loan duration. Such information is collected for the purpose of contacting you with information regarding prospective investment or borrowing opportunities (as applicable) based on your specified interests (the "Services"). It is solely up to you whether you furnish such information. If you do provide such information, you are thereby consenting to the use of that information in accordance with the policies and practices described in this Policy. This information may be stored on our servers, and on the servers of third party service providers.
In addition, during your visit we automatically collect certain aggregate information and analytical data related to your Site visit (see "Use of Cookies" below). Aggregate information is non-personally identifiable or anonymous information about you, including the date and time of your visit, the IP address of your computer or mobile device, your computer or mobile device browser information, the Internet address that you visited prior to and after reaching the Site, the name of the domain and host you used to access the Internet, the type of mobile device you use, your mobile device's unique device ID and the features of our Site which you accessed.

How We Use Information
We use collected information to make available and to improve our high standard of reliable services. We use such information to:

respond to inquiries or service requests and monitor such responses;

resolve problems; and
manage the Site and assess its usage and usage of the Services.

Disclosure of Information
We do not sell or rent personally identifiable information to third parties who are not affiliates of the Company. Information that you provide will not be shared with any other user of the Site without your consent. We may disclose personally identifiable information to appropriate affiliates of the Company, including strategic alliance affiliates and third party service providers, to respond to a request for service or to provide information about available products or services. We are not limited in our use of non-personal information that does not permit direct association with any specific individual, or non-identifiable aggregate information about our users (such as the number of users of our Services, the geographic distribution of our users, the amount of information located and/or removed, etc.).
We disclose information that we, in good faith, believe is appropriate to cooperate in investigations of fraud or other illegal activity, or to conduct investigations of violations of our Terms of Use. For example, this means that if we conduct a fraud investigation and conclude that one side has engaged in deceptive practices, we can give that person or entity's contact information to victims who request it.
We disclose information in response to a subpoena, warrant, court order, levy, attachment, order of a court-appointed receiver or other comparable legal process, including subpoenas from private parties in a civil action. If the subpoena seeks information about an identified user or limited group of users, we'll make reasonable business efforts to contact the user(s) before providing information to the party that requests it. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to contact the user(s) in all cases, whether because of a time limit, court order, inability to effectively contact a user, or for any other reason.
We may disclose information to your agent or legal representative (such as the holder of a power of attorney that you grant, or a guardian appointed for you).
We share information with companies that provide public relations and marketing services for us. Such information will only be shared by us to customize, measure and improve our products, Services and advertising; it will not be shared with third parties for their marketing purposes. These third parties are obligated to protect your information and are prohibited from using your personally identifiable information for any other purpose.
As with any other business, it is possible that in the future we could merge with or be acquired by another company. If such an acquisition occurs, the successor company would have access to the information maintained by us, including customer account information, but would continue to be bound by this Policy unless and until it is amended.
We share your information with our parent, subsidiaries and joint ventures to help coordinate the Services we provide to you, enforce our terms and conditions, and promote trust and safety.
We may share aggregate (non-personally identifiable) information with certain third parties such as advertisers, national industry organizations, and prospective affiliates.

        July 20, 2017



   Redfin, the Seattle-based real estate brokerage aiming to reshape the industry, recently priced its upcoming IPO between $12 - $14 per share. At this valuation, Redfin would become the latest tech unicorn on the public market. As the company heads towards its public listing, one big question lingers for investors: Should Redfin be valued as a real estate brokerage or as a tech company?

        July 06, 2017






   Starting July 10, 2017, all companies seeking an IPO, whether or not they qualify as emerging growth companies (“EGCs”), will be permitted to file their draft IPO registration statements confidentially. This is an important development, as it may lead to more IPOs and is a signal of tone shift at the SEC towards capital formation.

Tech IPO “Down Rounds”: EquityZen Runs the Numbers with Jeremy Abelson and Irving Investors

Phil Haslett
        |
        May 25, 2017



   The
   
    recent Cloudera IPO
   
   has re-ignited a discussion about down rounds. How could a private company
   
    possibly
   
   be valued at $30.92 per share in 2014, and then go public at $15? What could lead to such a corporate phenomenon? Do the valuation techniques of VC firms and Wall Street
   
    really
   
   differ by such a margin?
   


















         Cloudera's valuation was chopped in half between 2014 and 2017
        







   It turns out, down rounds are increasing in regularity, based on data analyzed by EquityZen and

Not So Obvious: Here's What To Know Between NSO and ISO Stock Options

Nat Disston

        May 18, 2017







  The world of startup stock options can be pretty opaque. To outsiders, its seems all one does is join a small company, and, if it works,
  
   everyone becomes millionaires
  
  . For new employees, they often don’t know what
  
   they don’t know
  
  and are faced with piles of new
  
   documents
  
  and
  
   more questions
  
  once they join their budding business. Core to our mission is to help educate employees, companies, and their founders about their
  
   stock options
  
  and what they can do

Q&A with Troy Paredes: How the SEC Regulates Silicon Valley (Part 2)

Shriram Bhashyam
        |
        April 13, 2017






   The change in administrations at the White House has multifold ramifications for startups.

        January 05, 2017







    "How can I
hedge against private company valuations?"
    





    "Can I short
pre-IPO shares?"

I thought EquityZen’s client base might find them interesting, so below are some ideas. If you have ideas on the matter, please send them my way via a comment or email.

Your privacy is important
At EquityZen INC (the "Company"), your privacy is very important to us. The purpose of this privacy policy (this "Policy") is to provide you with a description of the types of information we collect about you when you visit the EquityZen web site located at equityzen.com, and associated sub-domains (the "Site"), and how we use that information. By visiting or using the Site you agree to the provisions of our Terms of Use and this Policy. If you do not agree to the terms of this Policy, please do not use or access the Site or use the Services (defined below). This Policy only applies to information collected while you are on the Site. For more information on how the Site may redirect you to other web sites, please see the "Links and Redirection to Third Party Sites" section below.
Information We Collect
We collect and store information that you voluntarily provide to us as well as data related to your Site visit.
In some areas of the Site, we request or may request that you provide personally identifiable information, including your name, address, email address, telephone number, username, and other information from which your identity is or may be discernible. We collect personally identifiable information from our users at several different points on the Site. We will also allow you the opportunity to provide information identifying yourself as an investor or borrower and, if you are a borrower, the amount you will be seeking, your desired target rate, the intended use of funds and loan duration. Such information is collected for the purpose of contacting you with information regarding prospective investment or borrowing opportunities (as applicable) based on your specified interests (the "Services"). It is solely up to you whether you furnish such information. If you do provide such information, you are thereby consenting to the use of that information in accordance with the policies and practices described in this Policy. This information may be stored on our servers, and on the servers of third party service providers.
In addition, during your visit we automatically collect certain aggregate information and analytical data related to your Site visit (see "Use of Cookies" below). Aggregate information is non-personally identifiable or anonymous information about you, including the date and time of your visit, the IP address of your computer or mobile device, your computer or mobile device browser information, the Internet address that you visited prior to and after reaching the Site, the name of the domain and host you used to access the Internet, the type of mobile device you use, your mobile device's unique device ID and the features of our Site which you accessed. This data is in no way associated with your personally identifiable information.
How We Use Information
We use collected information to make available and to improve our high standard of reliable services. We use such information to:

respond to inquiries or service requests and monitor such responses;
provide information about and market our Services;
resolve problems; and
manage the Site and assess its usage and usage of the Services.

Disclosure of Information
We do not sell or rent personally identifiable information to third parties who are not affiliates of the Company. Information that you provide will not be shared with any other user of the Site without your consent. We may disclose personally identifiable information to appropriate affiliates of the Company, including strategic alliance affiliates and third party service providers, to respond to a request for service or to provide information about available products or services. We are not limited in our use of non-personal information that does not permit direct association with any specific individual, or non-identifiable aggregate information about our users (such as the number of users of our Services, the geographic distribution of our users, the amount of information located and/or removed, etc.).
We disclose information that we, in good faith, believe is appropriate to cooperate in investigations of fraud or other illegal activity, or to conduct investigations of violations of our Terms of Use. For example, this means that if we conduct a fraud investigation and conclude that one side has engaged in deceptive practices, we can give that person or entity's contact information to victims who request it.
We disclose information in response to a subpoena, warrant, court order, levy, attachment, order of a court-appointed receiver or other comparable legal process, including subpoenas from private parties in a civil action. If the subpoena seeks information about an identified user or limited group of users, we'll make reasonable business efforts to contact the user(s) before providing information to the party that requests it. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to contact the user(s) in all cases, whether because of a time limit, court order, inability to effectively contact a user, or for any other reason.
We may disclose information to your agent or legal representative (such as the holder of a power of attorney that you grant, or a guardian appointed for you).
We share information with companies that provide public relations and marketing services for us. Such information will only be shared by us to customize, measure and improve our products, Services and advertising; it will not be shared with third parties for their marketing purposes. These third parties are obligated to protect your information and are prohibited from using your personally identifiable information for any other purpose.
As with any other business, it is possible that in the future we could merge with or be acquired by another company. If such an acquisition occurs, the successor company would have access to the information maintained by us, including customer account information, but would continue to be bound by this Policy unless and until it is amended.
We share your information with our parent, subsidiaries and joint ventures to help coordinate the Services we provide to you, enforce our terms and conditions, and promote trust and safety.
We may share aggregate (non-personally identifiable) information with certain third parties such as advertisers, national industry organizations, and prospective affiliates. In addition, we reserve the right to disclose aggregate information and personally identifiable information to third parties as required or permitted by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights.
Unsubscribe Options
If you choose to take advantage of the Services by signing up as either an investor or borrower, you will receive periodic emails regarding opportunities which, based on the information you provide, may be of interest. If you no longer wish to receive our communications, you may unsubscribe by following the instructions included in each communication.

The purpose of this privacy policy (this "Policy") is to provide you with a description of the types of information we collect about you when you visit the EquityZen web site located at equityzen.com, and associated sub-domains (the "Site"), and how we use that information. By visiting or using the Site you agree to the provisions of our Terms of Use and this Policy. If you do not agree to the terms of this Policy, please do not use or access the Site or use the Services (defined below). This Policy only applies to information collected while you are on the Site. For more information on how the Site may redirect you to other web sites, please see the "Links and Redirection to Third Party Sites" section below.
Information We Collect
We collect and store information that you voluntarily provide to us as well as data related to your Site visit.
In some areas of the Site, we request or may request that you provide personally identifiable information, including your name, address, email address, telephone number, username, and other information from which your identity is or may be discernible. We collect personally identifiable information from our users at several different points on the Site. We will also allow you the opportunity to provide information identifying yourself as an investor or borrower and, if you are a borrower, the amount you will be seeking, your desired target rate, the intended use of funds and loan duration. Such information is collected for the purpose of contacting you with information regarding prospective investment or borrowing opportunities (as applicable) based on your specified interests (the "Services"). It is solely up to you whether you furnish such information. If you do provide such information, you are thereby consenting to the use of that information in accordance with the policies and practices described in this Policy. This information may be stored on our servers, and on the servers of third party service providers.
In addition, during your visit we automatically collect certain aggregate information and analytical data related to your Site visit (see "Use of Cookies" below). Aggregate information is non-personally identifiable or anonymous information about you, including the date and time of your visit, the IP address of your computer or mobile device, your computer or mobile device browser information, the Internet address that you visited prior to and after reaching the Site, the name of the domain and host you used to access the Internet, the type of mobile device you use, your mobile device's unique device ID and the features of our Site which you accessed. This data is in no way associated with your personally identifiable information.
How We Use Information
We use collected information to make available and to improve our high standard of reliable services. We use such information to:

respond to inquiries or service requests and monitor such responses;
provide information about and market our Services;
resolve problems; and
manage the Site and assess its usage and usage of the Services.

Disclosure of Information
We do not sell or rent personally identifiable information to third parties who are not affiliates of the Company. Information that you provide will not be shared with any other user of the Site without your consent. We may disclose personally identifiable information to appropriate affiliates of the Company, including strategic alliance affiliates and third party service providers, to respond to a request for service or to provide information about available products or services. We are not limited in our use of non-personal information that does not permit direct association with any specific individual, or non-identifiable aggregate information about our users (such as the number of users of our Services, the geographic distribution of our users, the amount of information located and/or removed, etc.).
We disclose information that we, in good faith, believe is appropriate to cooperate in investigations of fraud or other illegal activity, or to conduct investigations of violations of our Terms of Use. For example, this means that if we conduct a fraud investigation and conclude that one side has engaged in deceptive practices, we can give that person or entity's contact information to victims who request it.
We disclose information in response to a subpoena, warrant, court order, levy, attachment, order of a court-appointed receiver or other comparable legal process, including subpoenas from private parties in a civil action. If the subpoena seeks information about an identified user or limited group of users, we'll make reasonable business efforts to contact the user(s) before providing information to the party that requests it. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to contact the user(s) in all cases, whether because of a time limit, court order, inability to effectively contact a user, or for any other reason.
We may disclose information to your agent or legal representative (such as the holder of a power of attorney that you grant, or a guardian appointed for you).
We share information with companies that provide public relations and marketing services for us. Such information will only be shared by us to customize, measure and improve our products, Services and advertising; it will not be shared with third parties for their marketing purposes. These third parties are obligated to protect your information and are prohibited from using your personally identifiable information for any other purpose.
As with any other business, it is possible that in the future we could merge with or be acquired by another company. If such an acquisition occurs, the successor company would have access to the information maintained by us, including customer account information, but would continue to be bound by this Policy unless and until it is amended.
We share your information with our parent, subsidiaries and joint ventures to help coordinate the Services we provide to you, enforce our terms and conditions, and promote trust and safety.
We may share aggregate (non-personally identifiable) information with certain third parties such as advertisers, national industry organizations, and prospective affiliates. In addition, we reserve the right to disclose aggregate information and personally identifiable information to third parties as required or permitted by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights.

            Investing in private companies may be considered highly speculative and involves a high degree of risk, including the risk of substantial loss of investment.
