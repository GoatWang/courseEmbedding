Product Release Fund
Nov 15Marcin Product Release Fund 11 Comments

With outstanding performance results on the CEB press, we are getting ever closer to the planned product release date of April 1, 2009. We are employing a Product Release Fund as part of our open source product release strategy, with the primary aim of addressing the freeloader dilemma in funding this open source project.
While progress on crowd support funding has been quite satisfactory, it is nowhere near the level where we can afford rapid project acceleration towards the full Global Village Construction Set (GVCS). The point is – we believe that deploying the GVCS will benefit the world immensely – many times over what people are contributing. Thus, fundraising the miniscule quantities (about $2 million for the entire GVCS) that we believe will change the world profoundly – should be no problem. This is not so in practice.
The Product Release Fund encourages people to donate. This Fund is aimed primarily at those who are interested in building the CEB machine themselves or who are interested in fabrication as a small enterprise.
The fund works as follows.

Anyone who donates $20 or more to the project or provides an equivalent in-kind donation receives technical and fabrication drawings as soon as these are complete. We will be completing these drawings after we build our second and third prototypes – at which time the designs have been refined and tested thoroughly. We will be releasing these component-by-component. For example, as soon as the frame or hopper designs are perfected, drawings for these components are made available. These will be explicit milestones achieved in the project.
People have until the product release date of April 1, 2009, to donate. Anyone who misses this deadline will have to wait until the Product Release Fund (PRF) is satisfied.
The PRF quota is set at $15k for the The Liberator High Performance CEB Press. Full technical drawings are released into the public domain as soon as the quota is reached. We are allowing 1 year for this quota to be reached, at which time we release the complete plans even if the quota is not reached.

The above encourages anyone who is really interested in a low-cost Liberator to contribute prior to product release – which is the time when support is needed the most. $20 is peanuts for someone to pay when materials cost $2k, and the next cheapest competition costs $25k. Our quota is less than the price of one CEB machine from any of the cometitors.
The freeloader dilemma is only partially solved with this concept, though. Most people will not be producers of the machine – most will buy it from someone else. Production will happen whether they contribute or not – though it may take longer for us to get there.
We are looking for comments and suggestions on this concept. We are on the untested frontiers of open product development – so your suggestions are welcome. If we can demonstrate that the rewards are worthy – how do we motivate people to contribute? Is it simply about a larger marketing effort?

As we’ve talked over through email, I intend to translate the brochure into Spanish. If and when I do, I’ll also send/publish a small how-to so others may do the same for other languages. This should broaden the contributor base, and maybe even atract folks who’d participate in the technology and/or the wiki.
Regarding contributions, we need to make this atractive for universities and builders. Anyone has contacts? How could they (the people in universities and industry) benefit? Maybe “close enough” industry, as in people who make elements for the designs, that could move towards pieces for DIY? Sellers of components such as electric motors etc?

If I donate $20, will I have to sign a non-disclosure agreement not to divulge the design before the PRF quota is reached? What restrictions will you attach to my use of the design–can I (for example) build a The Liberator for sale to third parties before the design is released?
I’m not sure it makes sense to talk about a “free rider problem” in connection with Open Source. What you are describing sounds more like a closed design during the development phase, with partial rights granted to investors. This will prevent other parties from cooperating on the development until you have finished your third prototype. This is your prerogative–you will still be doing a great service by releasing the designs at a late stage–but you would seem to miss out on any advantages of collaboration during design and testing.
For example, thanks to your influence, I am now tinkering with the idea of helping a newly unemployed friend set up a welding/machine shop (so he can help create equipment for me to use on my farm). We might like to begin working on an XYZ table, but the release schedule in this post implies that the earliest we could collaborate with you (remotely) would be in a year or so and after your third prototype.
Hope this criticism is constructive, because I am enjoying watching your progress!

Mark, these are good comments. Regarding your 3 paragraphs, here are comments.
1. There is no policing. We donâ€™t have any energy for overhead and policing functions. Donors gain access, with no restrictions. You can produce it – we believe in free enterprise – no monpolies. The process is intended to be essentially nonmonopolistic. We do not have fear of the competitiion – if someone else offers a great product – we encourage that. If someone else is offering compromises, weâ€™ll still be in production, and beat them out of business. One part of this is that, as suggested in the GVCS presentation at http://openfarmtech.org/index.php?title=UM_Presentation, is that we are forced to diversify. Diversification is part of our essential strategy – we want to create thousands of diversified fabrication and agroecology producers – as a route to a better future.
Any further suggestions?
Perhaps to avoid this PRF overhead, we could set up a 1000 True Fans mechanism, http://www.kk.org/thetechnium/archives/2008/03/1000_true_fans.php , where people commit to $10 per month donation? With $10,000 per month, we could quadruple our productivity – and then watching progress at Factor e Farm would really be fun as weâ€™re creating a post-scarcity Global Village right before peoplesâ€™ eyes.
2. You make a good point on missing out collaboration opportunities. Also, the fact of the matter at present is that nobody else is making any real, physical developments on the open source CEB that I know of. There are many people who ask me for the design, and we donâ€™t have any tested design. Right now weâ€™re going through field testing before we put energy into making technical drawings of designs that work. 
The design is not closed at present. Anyone interested in collaboration is invited, and weâ€™ll share what we know freely when people want to help. All that we know about the design at present has been documented in simple drawings, fabrication pictures, and video. Short of someone being here, there is nothing more that we have to offer. 
I am looking for suggestions of how to increase involvement of others. It just seems that there are so few people who actually want to get their hands dirty in advanced CEB press development. goes back to the freerider issue, where people take my time, but contribute to no real progress on the actual machine.
3. Release schedule:
http://openfarmtech.org/weblog/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/augmented_program.jpg
shows XYZ table fabrication beginning Dec. 1, 2008. So letâ€™s work together.
The other point is, our program is not a spectator sport. The GVCS development is the overall program – and if any additional resources appear at any time, we parallel our development. For example, Nick is coming here in December, and we plan on doing metal casting and building the first steam engine by January. Progress is nonlinear – when resources appear, other projects get done.
Indeed, we are planning the First World Conference on Open Source Ecology for Summer, 2009 – which is a working conference where invited participants actually build parts of the GVCS. Itâ€™s a crash program for GVCS deployment – more info on this is forthcoming by end of this month.

Tongue in cheek, you could sell bricks.
Seriously, your existing new website http://www.factorefarm.org could possibly host the 1000 True Fans place. Maybe people would subscribe to news, not via a newsfeed aggregator or coming to check the blog, but via a newsletter that would simply include Monthly News and be issued close to Pay Day. Monetary contribution has to be made convenient, not just desirable.
We still need to look for larger donors if possible.
Teaching people to build machines will provide well earned money, but the problem with funding exists not, not so much in Summer 2009.

“All that we know about the design at present has been documented in simple drawings, fabrication pictures, and video. Short of someone being here, there is nothing more that we have to offer.”
From a personal perspective, herein lies part of the problem with getting others to have a go and share ideas. If I was to start work today on a CEB press I’d basically be starting from the same point you started from, and besides the notes and ideas would have to figure a lot of the details out. A good start would be a series of pictures showing all the pertinent details of the device from all angles so at least we could reverse engineer.
Anyhow, I’m willing to put up some money toward this goal, have you got a link to provide it handy, one which means we get on this PRF list?
On the issue of throughput, have you considered a much larger hopper that you can dump a bucket load or three of earth into, with a coarse mesh seive at the bottom, and the rotary hoe component under that, attached to the device, feeding into the original hopper?

at this anchor are some links to basic design drawings and descriptions of the fabrication process. they need more help putting together the designs, as they do not have so much time given the work they do. we are currently trying to develop greater living capacity so that a larger community of collaborators can work there and make these designs more detailed.

Marcin,Brittany and all, Hi from Bosnia, I just want to add my encouragement. I’m thinking that for our Minciu Sodas activities in COMMUNIA http://www.communia-project.eu and our travel funds for the workshops there we could advance support for open source hardware. Please let me know how that might be useful if you have thoughts. Thanks, Andrius

We are currently formulating a 1000 True Fans – 1000 Global Villages Initiative – in which we gather support for rapid deployment of the entire Global Village Construction Set technology base (http://factorefarm.org/view/projects/all). We’ll be publishing information about this soon.

How do I contribute (money) to the Product Release Fund? 
Geoff said, “Anyhow, Iâ€™m willing to put up some money toward this goal, have you got a link to provide it handy, one which means we get on this PRF list?” 
The links provided so far are for product cycle and design and fabrication – how do I send you money for the PRF (so I can get on the PRF list)?
What about transparency – where exactly is the PRF money going?
—
Anyone who donates in general to the CEB project is put on the PRF list. The construction is part of the CEB project – our digital fabrication facility for producing CEB machines. Regarding transparency – the only guidelines we have is that all of the money goes towards accelerating Global Village Construction Set deployment. You can see what we accomplish by following our blog or subscribing to Project News at http://factorefarm.org/view/projects/all . Allocation depends on priorities, which are outlined in our proposal from last year – http://openfarmtech.org/OSE_Proposal.doc . We will be updating the proposal within the next two months based on the learnings from 2008. – Marcin

TORONTO, ONTARIO -- (Marketwire) -- 01/20/11 --   GMP Investment Management L.P. ("GMPIM") is pleased to announce the launch of the Canadian ABCP Fund LP ("ABCP Fund").

GMPIM has successfully traded over $2 billion (face value) in Canadian restructured asset backed commercial paper through its GMP Diversified Alpha Master Fund since April of 2008 - a fund that has garnered a 27.39% return since inception(i). GMPIM has the unique expertise to invest in the securities from the Master Asset Vehicles ("MAV") that were created from the restructuring of the non-bank sponsored Canadian Asset Backed Commercial Paper ("ABCP") market in 2008 - a highly liquid, $10.5 billion market.

"The objective of the ABCP Fund is to capitalize on the attractive risk/return potential of this unique, diversified, deep-value investment opportunity," said Jason Marks, CEO, CIO & Managing Partner of GMPIM. "At GMPIM, we understand structured credit; we understand the fundamental value of the underlying assets; and our experience in trading these assets allows us to successfully identify the most undervalued assets. We believe in this tremendous opportunity and have invested a significant portion of our personal net worth in the Fund."

The ABCP Fund offers investors another alternative to GMPIM's existing fund offerings for their portfolios that is consistent with a firm-wide philosophy of best-in-class opportunities with an appropriate risk-adjusted return.

"Asset backed commercial paper is poorly understood in the market, which creates an opportunity for GMPIM, with its specific expertise and trading experience," added Greg Foss, the Canadian ABCP Fund's Portfolio Manager. "Investors can take comfort in knowing that the MAVs in which we invest are backed by asset pools that have high credit ratings and multiple levels of protection. The risk profile is much lower than market perception - with a targeted return of 9% per annum, which is high relative to the current return of 7.2% investors can receive through in a high yield bond index, or 4.0% in a corporate (investment grade) bond index."

The industry rapidly adopted shorter sprints of work, regular reassessment and so on. So, surely, in 2017 there's no question as to whether we're working in an agile manner? I think you'd be surprised.Jul. 27, 2017 09:00 AM EDT  Reads: 334DXWorldExpo to “Sponsor” Cloud Expo CASYS-CON Events announced today that DXWorldExpo has been named “Global Sponsor” of SYS-CON's 21st International Cloud Expo, which will take place on Oct 31 – Nov 2, 2017, at the Santa Clara Convention Center in Santa Clara, CA.

By Automic BlogWith continuous delivery (CD) almost always in the spotlight, continuous integration (CI) is often left out in the cold. Indeed, it's been in use for so long and so widely, we often take the model for granted. So what is CI and how can you make the most of it? This blog is intended to answer those questions.
Before we step into examining CI, we need to look back. Software developers often work in small teams and modularity, and need to integrate their changes with the rest of the project code b...Jul. 27, 2017 08:00 AM EDT  Reads: 378[video] @Nutanix's DevOps JourneyBy Pat Romanski"At the keynote this morning we spoke about the value proposition of Nutanix, of having a DevOps culture and a mindset, and the business outcomes of achieving agility and scale, which everybody here is trying to accomplish," noted Mark Lavi, DevOps Solution Architect at Nutanix, in this SYS-CON.tv interview at @DevOpsSummit at 20th Cloud Expo, held June 6-8, 2017, at the Javits Center in New York City, NY.Jul. 27, 2017 06:00 AM EDT  Reads: 1,260[session] Demystifying KubernetesBy Liz McMillanKubernetes is an open source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. Kubernetes was originally built by Google, leveraging years of experience with managing container workloads, and is now a Cloud Native Compute Foundation (CNCF) project. Kubernetes has been widely adopted by the community, supported on all major public and private cloud providers, and is gaining rapid adoption in enterprises. However, Kubernetes may seem intimidating and complex ...Jul. 27, 2017 04:00 AM EDT  Reads: 1,599Best 500 Digital Transformation SessionsBy Yeshim Deniz"DX encompasses the continuing technology revolution, and is addressing society's most important issues throughout the entire $78 trillion 21st-century global economy," said Roger Strukhoff, Conference Chair.

However, as enterprise organizations rush to adopt DevOps, moving past experimentation to embrace it at scale, they are in danger of falling into the trap that they have fallen into time and time again. 

Unfortunately, we've seen this movie before, and we know how it ends: badly.
Jul. 26, 2017 10:00 AM EDT  Reads: 756[video] Catchpoint's Digital Experience MonitoringBy Liz McMillan"With Digital Experience Monitoring what used to be a simple visit to a web page has exploded into app on phones, data from social media feeds, competitive benchmarking - these are all components that are only available because of some type of digital asset," explained Leo Vasiliou, Director of Web Performance Engineering at Catchpoint Systems, in this SYS-CON.tv interview at DevOps Summit at 20th Cloud Expo, held June 6-8, 2017, at the Javits Center in New York City, NY.Jul. 26, 2017 06:15 AM EDT  Reads: 1,296The What, Why, and How of APIsBy Mehdi DaoudiFor over a decade, Application Programming Interface or APIs have been used to exchange data between multiple platforms. From social media to news and media sites, most websites depend on APIs to provide a dynamic and real-time digital experience. APIs have made its way into almost every device and service available today and it continues to spur innovations in every field of technology.

Without both, DevOps isn't complete. However, applying the culture to outdated technology is a recipe for disaster; as response times grow and connections between teams are delayed by technology, the culture will die. A Nutanix Enterprise Cloud has many benefits that provide the needed base for a true DevOps paradigm.

Today’s businesses can no longer focus solely on the digital interactions they manage with employees or customers; they must now contend with non-traditional factors. Whether it's the power of brand to make or break a company, the need to monitor across all locations 24/7, or the ability to proactively resolve issues, companies must adapt to...Jul. 17, 2017 06:00 PM EDT  Reads: 2,330Bringing DevOps to Analytics & Data ScienceBy Pete WaterhouseThere’s no shortage of material about DevOps on the Interwebs. But as you sift through mountains of information, it appears mostly skewed toward better and faster web and mobile app development. Look for details on how the thinking can be applied to the wicked world of data science or analytics and you’ll be hard pressed to find much at all. This seems odd, because a sustainable business isn’t just carved out on the back of web and mobile apps. It’s also dependent on intimately understanding cus...Jul. 17, 2017 02:00 PM EDT  Reads: 6,903SourceForge “Media Sponsor” of Cloud ExpoBy Liz McMillanSYS-CON Events announced today that SourceForge has been named “Media Sponsor” of SYS-CON's 21st International Cloud Expo, which will take place on Oct 31 – Nov 2, 2017, at the Santa Clara Convention Center in Santa Clara, CA.

 All the World’s a Cloud
        All of Cloud Is at Cloud Expo!

 Cloud Computing - Big Data | Analytics - Internet of Things 
          Containers - Microservices - WebRTC - DevOps 


Join Us at the Javits Center in New York, NY, June 6-8 

          Cloud computing software is eating the world, and each day is bringing new developments in this world. 

          Yesterday's debate about public vs. private has transformed into the reality of hybrid cloud: a recent survey shows that 74% of enterprises have a hybrid cloud strategy. 

          Meanwhile, 94% of enterprises are using some form of XaaS – software, platform, and Infrastructure as a Service.

          Big Data | Analytics and the emerging Internet of Things (IoT) are driving exponentially increased demands on datacenters and developers alike, as we cross the zettabyte horizon this year.

          Containers and microservices are now part of every PaaS conversation, and IaaS providers are increasingly competing for platform customers. 

          WebRTC continues to reform web communications, and DevOps is pushing its way into an enterprise IT world that is increasingly agile, lean, and continuous.

          Through all this, Cloud Expo remains the single independent event where delegates and technology vendors can meet to experience and discuss the entire world of the cloud.

        Only Cloud Expo brings together all this in a single location: 
        
          •	Cloud Computing
            •	Big Data | Analytics
            •	Internet of Things
            •	Containers | Microservices
            •	WebRTC
            •	DevOps


        Cloud computing budgets worldwide are reaching into the hundreds of billions of dollars, and no organization can survive long without some sort of cloud migration strategy. Each month brings new announcements, use cases, and success stories. 

          Cloud Expo offers the world's most comprehensive selection of technical and strategic Industry Keynotes, General Sessions, Breakout Sessions, and signature Power Panels. The exhibition floor features 100+ exhibitors offering specific solutions and comprehensive strategies. 

          The floor also features a Demo Theater that give delegates the opportunity to get even closer to the technology they want to see and the people who offer it. 

          Attend Cloud Expo. Create your own custom experience. Learn the latest from the world's best technologists. Talk to the vendors you are considering, and put them to the test.

          See you in New York!

Tech giants throw money at OpenSSL in response to Heartbleed





To avert another Heartbleed, group narrows list of projects in need of support

Why You Lost Your Windows 10 Product Key
























When the OpenSSL Heartbleed bug surfaced earlier in April, many people were shocked to discover that one of the most critical pieces of online infrastructure was so poorly supported.

Despite OpenSSL's wide use as a means of securing websites, the OpenSSL Software Foundation had just one full-time employee and received only $2,000 in donations every year.

Arguably, the Heartbleed bug that exposed password and other user data could have been avoided if only OpenSSL had broader financial support. Now, a group of major technology companies is teaming up with the Linux Foundation to do just that.
[ Further reading: How the new age of antivirus software will protect your PC ]
On Thursday, Amazon Web Services, Cisco, Dell, Facebook, Fujitsu, Google, IBM, Intel, Microsoft, NetApp, Rackspace, VMware and The Linux Foundation announced the Core Infrastructure Initiative (CII).

As its name suggests, the CII will work together to identify essential open source projects in desperate need of financing. The group aims to provide funds to these projects to allow lead developers to work full-time on the project. CII support will also be used to pay for security audits, hardware and software infrastructure, travel, and other needs.

While the CII will provide the funding, individual projects will continue to operate "under the community norms that have made open source so successful."

The CII hasn't committed to any specific projects yet, but not surprisingly OpenSSL will be the first project considered for funding. Despite any official announcement of support, it would be shocking if OpenSSL wasn't funded since the Heartbleed bug is what prompted the CII in the first place.  

The Linux Foundation will administer the funds for the CII in cooperation with a steering committee that includes backers of the CII as well as "key open source developers and other industry stakeholders."
 
The Linux Foundation didn't say how much money was involved in the CII, but a report from Ars Technica says the group has committed to at least a three-year initiative and $3.6 million in funding. That works out to about $100,000 per year from each company—a funding level that isn't even a rounding error for most of these corporations, but a massive infusion for open-source projects.

Hopefully, the CII will prove its value over the next three years and convince the member companies to commit to the initiative for the long term, as well as convince other companies to join the cause.

                            Pantera Capital to Raise $100 Million in Investment for ICO Hedge Fund                        

Jun 28, 2017 at 17:59 UTC by Pete Rizzo

The $600m market for initial coin offerings may soon be set to expand.
Announced today, investment firm Pantera Capital is launching a new hedge fund focused on investments solely in tokens that power public blockchain protocols.
Called Pantera ICO Fund LP, the fund intends to raise $100m, with $35m already raised in support from the firm's existing investor base, undisclosed new investors, and according to the company, unnamed venture capital firms. The new fund will complement Pantera Bitcoin Partners, a joint investment fund launched by Pantera, Fortress, Benchmark Capital and Ribbit Capital in early 2014 to invest in the cryptocurrency.
In interview, Pantera's leadership team framed the fund as an extension of its past investments, which have included traditional investments in startups that have sought to incentivize distributed networks through the use of tokens. Included in the Pantera portfolio are Ripple and the Zcash Electric Coin Company, which use the XRP and ZEC tokens, respectively.
Pantera CEO Dan Morehead and Augur co-founder Joey Krug will serve as chief investment officers for the fund. With the move, Krug is also joining Pantera full-time.
The fund is currently open only to US institutions and individuals, though it intends to eventually open up support to non-US participants.
As explained by Paul Veradittakit, venture investor at Pantera Capital, the fund creation was sparked by the recent rapid uptick in interest in tokens and protocols. According to CoinDesk data, funding for ICOs has already surpassed traditional venture capital banking in 2017.

The mechanism has gone so far as to attract mainstream brands, with messenger service Kik announcing it would soon test a network token.
"Six months ago, ICOs were a few million dollars," Morehead told CoinDesk. Even ethereum's crowdsale was only $18m. I think, with Kik, we're at a watershed moment, a company with millions of active users is transitioning to open source."
However, Pantera's investment strategy will be more nuanced than simply working with major brands that may be interested in the concept.
According to Krug, the fund will primarily seek to fund new protocols, ones which they believe will use cryptographically unique data in a way that's integral to their operations.
"If you look at the tokens, they fall into two categories. Rent-seeking tokens, where you can remove the token and the network will be better off, and non-rent seeking tokens, where you remove the token and it doesn't work," he said, adding:
"The latter have the strongest chance of generating longer value."
Market strategy
In interview, Pantera further opened up about how it would seek to inject its capital in the market, comments that shed light on how its movements could impact the day-to-day holdings of retail investors who may also be seeking exposure to crypto assets.
In this way, Morehead said that the market shouldn't expect Pantera to be frequently entering and exiting deals, though he said the fund would take steps to preserve its profitability and maximize opportunity if warranted.
"We're going to make relative value judgements. If the token has reached a fair value and there's a new token that's inexpensive, we would trade," he said. "But, we're investing in tokens, we're not making markets."
Krug also explained a bit about how it will seek to make technical evaluations on the prospects of various projects, evaluating the technical foundations of the designs of proposed protocols, as well as the strength of the team.
It's worth noting that investing in ICOs is still an inexact science, as, owing to the difficulty of changing blockchain infrastructure protocols, its unknown whether pivoting will be as easy for entrepreneurs building on top of the tech.
That's where Pantera is hoping Krug's experience will pay dividends.
Augur raised $5.3m in an ICO for its ethereum-based prediction market platform in 2015 through the sale of tokens that power its reputation system. Today, its network is valued at $305m, with tokens trading for $27 at press time, according to data from Coinmarketcap.
'Bubble' talk
Also discussed was the rapid escalation in value observed in the total cryptocurrency market, which surpassed $100bn earlier this year, up from $18bn on 1st January, and the effect of what some have called a "bubble" forming in the market.
Still, Krug sought to take a more long-term view, asserting that despite short-term fluctuations, he's confident that the ICO process will emerge as a compelling way to fund protocol development, one that will continue to interest investors and entrepreneurs.
"In the long term, we're at the very beginning," he remarked.
Likewise, Morehead said that, as with its bitcoin fund, the ICO fund is likely to see ups and downs. Overall, he focused on the fact that the funds would expand Pantera's investment capabilities while helping to fund and fuel growth in the market.
Krug concluded:
"Hopefully, this will see through corrections."

Lpcompiler - The L+ Compiler

The L+ Compiler (lpc)This project was developed by Emilio Pombo and I (Alejandro Segovia) as a mandatory assignment in 2006. The assignment was part of a Compilers course at the Catholic University of Uruguay and consisted in building a compiler for a C-like programming language from scratch. We believe this project could be useful to anyone attending a compilers course, interested in compilers or just curious about how a compiler might work internally. The language our compiler takes as input, called L+, supports most constructs from C (variables, branches, loops, functions, recursion and I/O) albeit with some limitations and some additions. The L+ compiler generates Java Bytecode. L+ programs can be run on any platform with a Java VM installed. This program was developed a long time ago, and this was both Emilio and I's second largest C++ program at the time. Consequently, the code should not be considered good C++ programming style. This program is Free Software, licensed under the GPLv3. Feel free to download the code, explore how it works, tweak it and redistribute it to your friends. The following section presents some examples of the L+ programming language in action. We also have a Programming Guide available in PDF format. L+Hello WorldL+ should look familiar to regular users of C-like languages. Here's the mandatory "hello world" example in L+: // hello.lpvoid main(){\tprint("Hello, World!");}FibonacciHere's a more elaborate example that reads a number from stdin and calculates it's corresponding Fibonacci number. This example illustrates some core capabilities of L+, including I/O, functions, recursion, branching and string processing: // Calculate the Fibonacci number for nint fibo(int n){\tif (n == 0)\t{\t\treturn 0;\t}\tif (n == 1)\t{\t\treturn 1;\t}\treturn fibo(n-1) + fibo(n-2);}// Program fibo.lp// Read a number, calculate the Fibonacci number for said number// and print a message with the result.void main(){\tprint("Enter number to calculate the Fibonacci number for:");\tstring nStr = read();\tint f = fibo(toInt(nStr));\tstring s = toString(f);\tprint("The Fibonacci number for " + nStr + " is: " + s);}Running this program with an input value of "10" would produce the following output: Enter number to calculate the Fibonacci number for:10The Fibonacci number for 10 is: 55.0Platforms & DependenciesThe L+ compiler is written in pure ANSI/ISO C++ and supports GNU/Linux, Mac OS X and Microsoft Windows. The build system is UNIX-based (using Makefiles), so other UNICES should work fine too. The compiler's build requirements are only GNU Flex (2.5.35), Bison (2.4), a C++ development environment and make. Compiled programs require a Java VM to execute. since 2006The codebase is mostly the untouched assignment we turned in in 2006. I had to perform some minor changes (specially to the build and deployment system) because I basically didn't know how to write sane Makefiles back in 2006. I've also translated most messages from Spanish to English, but code comments and code examples remain in their original language. I might translate these as well at some point. Other than that, all compiler activity is reported in English, so don't be afraid to dig in ;) Special ThanksWe want to thank Leonardo Val and MatÃ­as Hernandez, who were our professors and designed the assignment this program was developed to fullfil.

The Open Source Definition (Annotated)











 Version 1.9
     The indented, italicized sections below appear as annotations to the Open Source Definition (OSD) and are not a part of the OSD. A plain version of the OSD without annotations can be found here.
Introduction
Open source doesn't just mean access to the source code. The distribution terms of open-source software must comply with the following criteria:
1. Free Redistribution
The license shall not restrict any party from selling or giving away the software as a component of an aggregate software distribution containing programs from several different sources. The license shall not require a royalty or other fee for such sale.
Rationale: By constraining the license to require free redistribution, we eliminate the temptation for licensors to throw away many long-term gains to make short-term gains.  If we didn't do this, there would be lots of pressure for cooperators to defect.
2. Source Code
The program must include source code, and must allow distribution in source code as well as compiled form. Where some form of a product is not distributed with source code, there must be a well-publicized means of obtaining the source code for no more than a reasonable reproduction cost, preferably downloading via the Internet without charge. The source code must be the preferred form in which a programmer would modify the program. Deliberately obfuscated source code is not allowed. Intermediate forms such as the output of a preprocessor or translator are not allowed.
Rationale: We require access to un-obfuscated source code because you can't evolve programs without modifying them. Since our purpose is to make evolution easy, we require that modification be made easy.
3. Derived Works
The license must allow modifications and derived works, and must allow them to be distributed under the same terms as the license of the original software.
Rationale: The mere ability to read source isn't enough to support independent peer review and rapid evolutionary selection. For rapid evolution to happen, people need to be able to experiment with and redistribute modifications.
4. Integrity of The Author's Source Code
The license may restrict source-code from being distributed in modified form only if the license allows the distribution of "patch files" with the source code for the purpose of modifying the program at build time. The license must explicitly permit distribution of software built from modified source code. The license may require derived works to carry a different name or version number from the original software.
Rationale: Encouraging lots of improvement is a good thing, but users have a right to know who is responsible for the software they are using. Authors and maintainers have reciprocal right to know what they're being asked to support and protect their reputations.
Accordingly, an open-source license must guarantee that source be readily available, but may require that it be distributed as pristine base sources plus patches. In this way, "unofficial" changes can be made available but readily distinguished from the base source.
5. No Discrimination Against Persons or Groups
The license must not discriminate against any person or group of persons.
Rationale: In order to get the maximum benefit from the process, the maximum diversity of persons and groups should be equally eligible to contribute to open sources. Therefore we forbid any open-source license from locking anybody out of the process.
Some countries, including the United States, have export restrictions for certain types of software. An OSD-conformant license may warn licensees of applicable restrictions and remind them that they are obliged to obey the law; however, it may not incorporate such restrictions itself.
6. No Discrimination Against Fields of Endeavor
The license must not restrict anyone from making use of the program in a specific field of endeavor. For example, it may not restrict the program from being used in a business, or from being used for genetic research.
Rationale: The major intention of this clause is to prohibit license traps that prevent open source from being used commercially. We want commercial users to join our community, not feel excluded from it.
7. Distribution of License
The rights attached to the program must apply to all to whom the program is redistributed without the need for execution of an additional license by those parties.
Rationale: This clause is intended to forbid closing up software by indirect means such as requiring a non-disclosure agreement.
8. License Must Not Be Specific to a Product
The rights attached to the program must not depend on the program's being part of a particular software distribution. If the program is extracted from that distribution and used or distributed within the terms of the program's license, all parties to whom the program is redistributed should have the same rights as those that are granted in conjunction with the original software distribution.
Rationale: This clause forecloses yet another class of license traps.
9. License Must Not Restrict Other Software
The license must not place restrictions on other software that is distributed along with the licensed software. For example, the license must not insist that all other programs distributed on the same medium must be open-source software.
Rationale: Distributors of open-source software have the right to make their own choices about their own software.
Yes, the GPL v2 and v3 are conformant with this requirement. Software linked with GPLed libraries only inherits the GPL if it forms a single work, not any software with which they are merely distributed.
10. License Must Be Technology-Neutral
No provision of the license may be predicated on any individual technology or style of interface.
Rationale: This provision is aimed specifically at licenses which require an explicit gesture of assent in order to establish a contract between licensor and licensee. Provisions mandating so-called "click-wrap" may conflict with important methods of software distribution such as FTP download, CD-ROM anthologies, and web mirroring; such provisions may also hinder code re-use. Conformant licenses must allow for the possibility that (a) redistribution of the software will take place over non-Web channels that do not support click-wrapping of the download, and that (b) the covered code (or re-used portions of covered code) may run in a non-GUI environment that cannot support popup dialogues.
The Open Source Definition was originally derived from the Debian Free Software Guidelines (DFSG).
 
 

























2016 Future of Open Source Survey Results | North Bridge

2016 Survey Results

  
10th Anniversary of the Future of Open Source:
The 2016 North Bridge & Black Duck Future of Open Source Study marks the 10th Anniversary of this survey. The study examines open source software trends on an annual basis. Notably, the 2016 survey findings position open source as today’s preeminent architecture, the foundation for nearly all applications, operating systems, cloud computing, databases, and big data.   Just eight years ago, the 2008 survey predicted that no sectors of the software industry would be invulnerable to disruption from Open Source.
In terms of the strategic influence open source has on their business, respondents see it as an engine for innovation, with 90% reporting they rely on open source for improved efficiency, innovation and interoperability. The most compelling reasons cited in the survey for use of open source included flexibility and freedom from vendor lock-in; competitive features and technical capabilities; ability to customize; and overall quality.
The 2016 results also show that the rapid adoption of open source has outpaced the implementation of effective open source management and security practices.  Nearly half of respondents report they have no formal processes to track their open source, and half reporting that no one has responsibility for identifying known vulnerabilities and tracking remediation.
Key 2016 Insights: 

Open Source Is The Modern Architecture. Open Source is the foundation now for nearly all applications, operating systems, cloud computing, databases, big data and more.  Open Source development has gone from the exception to the rule.   In the area of technologies, tools and processes, continuous integration, deployment, OS has made huge contributions and revamped how software is delivered.
 Source IS the Engine of Innovation.  Open Source is driving business because it facilitates faster, more agile development.   This translates into quicker builds, accelerate time to market and vastly superior interoperability.  It also supports every developer’s right to have an idea and build it in a in a way that was free from the restrictions of the traditional software industry.
There is a new generation of companies and business models emerging. Respondents report that in the next two or three years, the business models that will generate the most revenue for open source vendors are SaaS (46%); Custom Development (42%) and Services/Support (41%).   Relative to previous years, we are not as dependent on SaaS and services/support.
Challenges remain: Open Source security and management practices have not kept pace with rapid adoption. In the wake of high profile breaches, there is likely to be more emphasis on security.
Participation and contribution will secure the future of open source.   Investing in the open source community spurs innovation, delivers exponential value and most of all, it’s fun.   It continues to grow as a key hiring and retention tool in IT shops of enterprises, governments, and startups alike.
    

Survey Participation & Demographics:
The 2016 Future of Open Source Survey drew a record 1,313 respondents from over 64 countries.  78% of the respondents were technical, a shift from early years which skewed toward executives and legal professionals.   The survey has grown three-fold since 2010.   
  There were a record number of 52 collaborators involved from industry leading organizations with 27 participating at the Platinum level.   Among the collaborators were all the North Bridge Open Source portfolio companies including: Acquia, Coolan, Confer, Couchbase, Ravel Law, Rift-io, and WP Engine.   

Collaborators
We'd like to extend a special "thank you" to those who have supported and collaborated with us throughout the years.
