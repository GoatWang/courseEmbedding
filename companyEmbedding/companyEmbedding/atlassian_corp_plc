Atlassian /ətˈlæsiən/ is an enterprise software company that develops products for software developers, project managers, and content management.[2][3][4] It is best known for its issue tracking application, Jira, and its team collaboration and wiki product, Confluence.[3][5] Atlassian serves over 60,000 customers.[2][3][6][7][8]

History[edit]
Mike Cannon-Brookes and Scott Farquhar founded Atlassian in 2002.[2][6] The pair met while studying at the University of New South Wales in Sydney.[9] They bootstrapped the company for several years, financing the startup with a $10,000 credit card debt.[5] The name derives from the Titan Atlas (/ˈætləs/; Ancient Greek: Ἄτλας) from Greek mythology who had been punished to hold up the Heavens after the Greek gods had overthrown the Titans. The logo reflects this through the blue X-shaped figure holding up what is shown to be the bottom of the sky.
Atlassian released its flagship product, Jira – a project and issue tracker, in 2002. In 2004, it released Confluence, a team collaboration platform that lets users work together on projects, co-create content, and share documents and other media assets.[10] In 2006, Cannon-Brookes and Farquhar were named Ernst & Young’s Entrepreneurs of the Year for Australia.[11]
In July 2010, Atlassian raised $60 million in venture capital from Accel Partners.[7]
In June 2011, Atlassian announced revenue of $102 million, up 35% from the year before.[12] In August 2011, Jay Simmons became president, while Cannon-Brookes and Farquhar kept their positions as "co-chief executive".[13] For the June 2014 fiscal year, Atlassian reported $215 million in revenue, up from $144 million in 2013.[14]
In a 2014 restructuring, the parent company became Atlassian Corporation PLC of the UK, with a registered address in London—though the actual headquarters remained in Sydney.[15] Atlassian has offices in five countries: Amsterdam in the Netherlands; Austin, San Francisco, and Mountain View, California,[16] in the United States; Manila in the Philippines; Yokohama in Japan, and Sydney in Australia. The group has over 1,700 employees serving more than 60,000 customers and millions of users.[6][17]
In November 2015, Atlassian announced sales of $320 million,[18] and Shona Brown was added to its board.[13] On 10 December 2015 Atlassian made its initial public offering (IPO) on the NASDAQ stock exchange,[19] under the symbol TEAM, putting the market capitalization of Atlassian at $4.37 billion.
Sales setup[edit]
Atlassian does not have a traditional sales team. Instead, it lists all prices, information about products, documentation, support requests, and training materials on its website.[20][21] Most of their products are available as hosted or installed versions.
Acquisitions and product announcements[edit]
In 2010, Atlassian acquired Bitbucket, a hosted service for code collaboration.[22] In May 2012, the company introduced a website where customers can download plug-ins for various Atlassian products.[23][24][25] That year, Atlassian also released Stash, a Git repository for enterprises, later renamed Bitbucket Server.[26]
Additional products include Crucible, FishEye, Bamboo, and Clover, which target programmers working with a code base. FishEye, Crucible and Clover came into Atlassian's portfolio through the acquisition of another Australian software company, Cenqua, in 2007.[27] In 2012, Atlassian acquired HipChat, an instant messenger for workplace environments. Doug Burgum became chairman of its board of directors in July 2012.[28]
In 2013, Atlassian announced a Jira service desk product with full service-level agreement support.[29]

A small startup called Dogwood Labs in Denver, Colorado which had a product called StatusPage was acquired in July 2016.[31][32] In January 2017 Atlassian announced the purchase of Trello for $425 million.[33]
Philanthropy[edit]
In March 2011, the company raised $1 million for the charity Room to Read from sales of its $10 "Starter" licenses.[34]

History[edit]
Mike Cannon-Brookes and Scott Farquhar founded Atlassian in 2002.[2][6] The pair met while studying at the University of New South Wales in Sydney.[9] They bootstrapped the company for several years, financing the startup with a $10,000 credit card debt.[5] The name derives from the Titan Atlas (/ˈætləs/; Ancient Greek: Ἄτλας) from Greek mythology who had been punished to hold up the Heavens after the Greek gods had overthrown the Titans. The logo reflects this through the blue X-shaped figure holding up what is shown to be the bottom of the sky.
Atlassian released its flagship product, Jira – a project and issue tracker, in 2002. In 2004, it released Confluence, a team collaboration platform that lets users work together on projects, co-create content, and share documents and other media assets.[10] In 2006, Cannon-Brookes and Farquhar were named Ernst & Young’s Entrepreneurs of the Year for Australia.[11]
In July 2010, Atlassian raised $60 million in venture capital from Accel Partners.[7]
In June 2011, Atlassian announced revenue of $102 million, up 35% from the year before.[12] In August 2011, Jay Simmons became president, while Cannon-Brookes and Farquhar kept their positions as "co-chief executive".[13] For the June 2014 fiscal year, Atlassian reported $215 million in revenue, up from $144 million in 2013.[14]
In a 2014 restructuring, the parent company became Atlassian Corporation PLC of the UK, with a registered address in London—though the actual headquarters remained in Sydney.[15] Atlassian has offices in five countries: Amsterdam in the Netherlands; Austin, San Francisco, and Mountain View, California,[16] in the United States; Manila in the Philippines; Yokohama in Japan, and Sydney in Australia. The group has over 1,700 employees serving more than 60,000 customers and millions of users.[6][17]
In November 2015, Atlassian announced sales of $320 million,[18] and Shona Brown was added to its board.[13] On 10 December 2015 Atlassian made its initial public offering (IPO) on the NASDAQ stock exchange,[19] under the symbol TEAM, putting the market capitalization of Atlassian at $4.37 billion.
Sales setup[edit]
Atlassian does not have a traditional sales team. Instead, it lists all prices, information about products, documentation, support requests, and training materials on its website.[20][21] Most of their products are available as hosted or installed versions.
Acquisitions and product announcements[edit]
In 2010, Atlassian acquired Bitbucket, a hosted service for code collaboration.[22] In May 2012, the company introduced a website where customers can download plug-ins for various Atlassian products.[23][24][25] That year, Atlassian also released Stash, a Git repository for enterprises, later renamed Bitbucket Server.[26]
Additional products include Crucible, FishEye, Bamboo, and Clover, which target programmers working with a code base. FishEye, Crucible and Clover came into Atlassian's portfolio through the acquisition of another Australian software company, Cenqua, in 2007.[27] In 2012, Atlassian acquired HipChat, an instant messenger for workplace environments. Doug Burgum became chairman of its board of directors in July 2012.[28]
In 2013, Atlassian announced a Jira service desk product with full service-level agreement support.[29]

History[edit]
Mike Cannon-Brookes and Scott Farquhar founded Atlassian in 2002.[2][6] The pair met while studying at the University of New South Wales in Sydney.[9] They bootstrapped the company for several years, financing the startup with a $10,000 credit card debt.[5] The name derives from the Titan Atlas (/ˈætləs/; Ancient Greek: Ἄτλας) from Greek mythology who had been punished to hold up the Heavens after the Greek gods had overthrown the Titans. The logo reflects this through the blue X-shaped figure holding up what is shown to be the bottom of the sky.
Atlassian released its flagship product, Jira – a project and issue tracker, in 2002. In 2004, it released Confluence, a team collaboration platform that lets users work together on projects, co-create content, and share documents and other media assets.[10] In 2006, Cannon-Brookes and Farquhar were named Ernst & Young’s Entrepreneurs of the Year for Australia.[11]
In July 2010, Atlassian raised $60 million in venture capital from Accel Partners.[7]
In June 2011, Atlassian announced revenue of $102 million, up 35% from the year before.[12] In August 2011, Jay Simmons became president, while Cannon-Brookes and Farquhar kept their positions as "co-chief executive".[13] For the June 2014 fiscal year, Atlassian reported $215 million in revenue, up from $144 million in 2013.[14]
In a 2014 restructuring, the parent company became Atlassian Corporation PLC of the UK, with a registered address in London—though the actual headquarters remained in Sydney.[15] Atlassian has offices in five countries: Amsterdam in the Netherlands; Austin, San Francisco, and Mountain View, California,[16] in the United States; Manila in the Philippines; Yokohama in Japan, and Sydney in Australia. The group has over 1,700 employees serving more than 60,000 customers and millions of users.[6][17]
In November 2015, Atlassian announced sales of $320 million,[18] and Shona Brown was added to its board.[13] On 10 December 2015 Atlassian made its initial public offering (IPO) on the NASDAQ stock exchange,[19] under the symbol TEAM, putting the market capitalization of Atlassian at $4.37 billion.
Sales setup[edit]
Atlassian does not have a traditional sales team. Instead, it lists all prices, information about products, documentation, support requests, and training materials on its website.[20][21] Most of their products are available as hosted or installed versions.
Acquisitions and product announcements[edit]
In 2010, Atlassian acquired Bitbucket, a hosted service for code collaboration.[22] In May 2012, the company introduced a website where customers can download plug-ins for various Atlassian products.[23][24][25] That year, Atlassian also released Stash, a Git repository for enterprises, later renamed Bitbucket Server.[26]
Additional products include Crucible, FishEye, Bamboo, and Clover, which target programmers working with a code base. FishEye, Crucible and Clover came into Atlassian's portfolio through the acquisition of another Australian software company, Cenqua, in 2007.[27] In 2012, Atlassian acquired HipChat, an instant messenger for workplace environments. Doug Burgum became chairman of its board of directors in July 2012.[28]
In 2013, Atlassian announced a Jira service desk product with full service-level agreement support.[29]

We estimate that we will receive net proceeds from this offering of $431.8
million based upon the initial public offering price of $21.00 per Class A
ordinary share, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and
estimated offering expenses payable by us. We will not receive any of the
proceeds from the sale of Class A ordinary shares in this offering by the
selling shareholders.

The principal purposes of this offering are to increase our capitalization and
financial flexibility and create a public market for our Class A ordinary
shares. We intend to use the net proceeds we receive from this offering for
general corporate purposes, including working capital, operating expenses and
capital expenditures. We also may use a portion of the net proceeds to acquire
complementary businesses, products, services or technologies. However, we do not
have agreements or commitments for any specific acquisitions at this time.

We also may use certain of the net proceeds to satisfy tax withholding
obligations related to the vesting of RSUs held by current and former employees,
which will begin to vest after the completion of this offering. Based on the
initial public offering price of $21.00 per Class A ordinary share,
1,678,611 shares underlying RSUs vesting on such date and the applicable income
tax rate for certain of our employees from whom we will withhold taxes, we would
use approximately $7.9 million to satisfy these tax withholding obligations.

We will have broad discretion over the uses of the net proceeds from this
offering. Pending the use of proceeds from this offering as described above, we
intend to invest the net proceeds to us from the offering in short-term,
investment-grade, interest-bearing instruments.


Our software products serve teams of all shapes and sizes, in every industry: 
from software and technical teams, to IT and service teams to the breadth of
business teams across any organization.

We have no single pure play competitor across all these markets. We do have a
number of competitors for individual products, ranging from large technology
vendors to new and emerging businesses in each of the markets we serve:

• Software and Technical Teams—Our competitors include large technology vendors,
  including Microsoft, IBM and Hewlett-Packard and smaller companies like Rally
  Software (acquired by CA, Inc.) and GitHub that offer project management and
  developer tools.

• IT and Service Teams—Our competitors include primarily public cloud vendors 
  including ServiceNow, salesforce.com and Zendesk and legacy vendors such as
  BMC Software (Remedy) that offer service desk solutions.

• Business Teams—Our competitors include large technology vendors, Microsoft,
  IBM and Google, that offer a suite of products, to smaller companies which 
  offer point solutions for enterprise collaboration.

In most cases due to the flexibility and breadth of our products, we co-exist
alongside many of our competitors' products within our own customer base.

The principal competitive factors in our markets include product capabilities,
flexibility, total cost of ownership, ease of access and use, performance and
scalability, integration, customer satisfaction and global reach. Our product
strategy, distribution model and company culture allow us to compete favorably
on all these factors. Through our focus on research and development we are able
to rapidly innovate, offer a breadth of products that are easy to use yet
powerful, are integrated and delivered through multiple deployment options from
cloud, to on-premises software to highly scalable data center solutions. Our
automated distribution model allows us to efficiently reach customers globally
without the need to invest in a traditional salesforce. Our culture enables us
to focus on customer success through superior products, transparent pricing and
world-class customer support.

We realize that our large competitors have greater financial and human
resources, have been operating for longer than we have and have deep product
development expertise. They also have strong relationships with some of our
large customers, and could develop relationships with our smaller enterprise and
consumer customers over time. These large players could move quickly to grow
their competitive solutions, either through organic development or acquisitions.
At the same time, we believe, our smaller competitors will continue to develop
new solutions that could prove more effective than those offered by us
especially in specific market segments and narrow use cases. In order to compete
effectively, we will be relentlessly focused on innovation, in refining and
scaling our high-velocity distribution model, and in preserving our unique
culture.


Company Description
Our mission is to unleash the potential in every team.

Our products help teams organize, discuss and complete their work—delivering
superior outcomes for their organizations.

We believe human advancement has always been driven by teamwork—from the great
explorations of earth and space to


 innovations in industry, medicine, music and
technology. And while it's common to celebrate the individual genius behind a 
breakthrough idea, in nearly every case there is a team of unsung heroes that
actually get the work done.

We also believe that the greatest lever teams have to advance humanity lies in 
the power of software innovation. Through software, contact lenses now monitor
and report on the blood glucose levels of diabetes patients, allowing patient
and doctor to better manage the disease. Through software, cars can monitor and
report on vehicle status, improving driver safety. Through software, people can
read, write and converse with people in languages they do not speak. Each of 
these advances was delivered by teams.

Software's transformational impact is forcing organizations to use software to 
innovate, or face disruption from competitors that do. Today, organizations in 
every industry are becoming software-driven. As a result, the teams that 
imagine, create and deliver that software are more essential than ever.

Our company was founded in 2002 to help software teams work better together.
From the beginning, our products were designed to help developers collaborate
with other non-developer teams involved in software innovation. This 
breakthrough approach separated us from traditional software providers focused
solely on developers.

As more non-developer teams are exposed to our products, they adopt and extend
them to new use cases, bringing our products to other users and other types of 
teams in their organizations. This has created an expansive market opportunity
for us.

Today, our products serve teams of all shapes and sizes, in virtually every
industry—from software and technical teams to IT and service teams, from sales
and marketing teams to HR, finance and legal teams. Our products include JIRA
for team planning and project management, Confluence for team content creation
and sharing, HipChat for team messaging and communications, Bitbucket for team
code sharing and management and JIRA Service Desk for team services and support
applications.

Our products form an integrated system for organizing, discussing and completing
shared work, becoming deeply entrenched in how people work together and how
organizations run. Our products have been used by NASA to design the Mars Rover,
by Cochlear to develop aural implants, and by Runkeeper to create GPS fitness
tracking applications.

We founded our company on the premise that great products could sell themselves
and we have developed a unique approach to the market that is centered on this
belief. We begin with a deep investment in product development to create and 
refine high-quality and versatile products that users love. We make our products
affordable and we transparently share our simple pricing online. We pursue
volume by targeting teams in every organization, regardless of size, industry or
geography.

To reach this expansive market, we distribute and sell our products online
without traditional sales infrastructure where users can get started in minutes
without the need for assistance. We focus on enabling a self-service,
low-friction model that makes it easy for users to try, adopt and use our
products.

Our culture of innovation, transparency and dedication to customer service
drives our success in implementing and refining this unique approach. We believe
this approach fosters innovation, quality, customer happiness, scale and
profitability.

We recognize that users drive the adoption and proliferation of our products 
and, as a result, we are relentlessly focused on measuring and improving user 
satisfaction. However, certain metrics presented in this prospectus related to
user adoption and proliferation, such as daily visitors, monthly active users
and organizations using our products, do not directly drive revenues and changes
in these metrics may not be correlated to, or indicative of, the health of our
underlying business.

We believe that one happy user will beget another, thereby expanding the large
and organic word-of-mouth community that helps drive our growth. We operate at
unusual scale for an enterprise software company, with more than 5 million
monthly active users (those who have actively used our products in the 28-day
period prior to a particular measurement date) and more than 51,000 customers
(organizations that have at least one active and paid license or subscription
for which they paid more than $10 per month) across virtually every industry
sector in more than 160 countries. Our customers range from small organizations
that have adopted one of our products for a small group of users, to 79 of the
Fortune 100 and 273 of the Fortune 500, many of which use a multitude of our 
products across thousands of users.

Our stated number of customers does not include any organizations (identified by
unique domain names) that have only adopted either our free products or licenses
that pay us $10 per month or less. Including such organizations, the active use
of our products extends beyond our more than 51,000 customers to more than 
450,000 organizations, demonstrating the breadth of adoption of our products and
the future opportunity available to us to convert additional organizations
currently using our products into paying customers. With these customers and 
organizations using our software today, we are able to reach a vast number of 
users, gather insights to refine our offerings and generate growing revenue by
expanding within them. While historically only a small segment of users have
converted to paid versions of our products from free trials or limited free 
versions, or upgraded beyond the starter license, we will continue to seek to 
convert this large user base into long-term customers and word-of-mouth 
advocates over time.

To put the conclusions and observations in context, the following is reorganized, edited and summarized from the full S-1 referenced above.

BusinessAtlassian Corp.'s mission is to unleash the potential in every team. Its products help teams organize, discuss and complete their work, and deliver superior outcomes for their organizations.
Driven by teamworkAtlassian believes human advancement has always been driven by teamwork - from the great explorations of earth and space, to innovations in industry, medicine, music and technology. And while it's common to celebrate the individual genius behind a breakthrough idea, in nearly every case there is a team of unsung heroes that actually get the work done.
The company also believes that the greatest lever teams have to advance humanity is the power of software innovation. Through software, contact lenses now monitor and report on the blood glucose levels of diabetes patients, allowing patient and doctor to better manage the disease. Through software, cars can monitor and report on vehicle status, improving driver safety.
Read, write and converse with people in other languagesThrough software, people can read, write and converse with people in languages they do not speak. Each of these advances was delivered by teams.
Software's transformational impact is forcing organizations to use software to innovate, or face disruption from competitors that do. Today, organizations in every industry are becoming software-driven. As a result, the teams that imagine, create and deliver that software are more essential than ever.
The company was founded in 2002 to help software teams work better together. From the beginning, Atlassian's products were designed to help developers collaborate with other non-developer teams involved in software innovation. This breakthrough approach separated Atlassian Corp. from traditional software providers focused solely on developers.
As more non-developer teams are exposed to the company's products, they adopt and extend them to new use cases, bringing the products to other users and other types of teams in their organizations. This has created an expansive market opportunity for Atlassian Corp.

Virtually every industryToday, Atlassian's products serve teams of all shapes and sizes, in virtually every industry - from software and technical teams to IT and service teams, from sales and marketing teams to HR, finance and legal teams. Its products include JIRA for team planning and project management, Confluence for team content creation and sharing, HipChat for team messaging and communications, Bitbucket for team code sharing and management and JIRA Service Desk for team services and support applications.
Integrated systemAtlassian Corp.'s products form an integrated system for organizing, discussing and completing shared work, becoming deeply entrenched in how people work together and how organizations run. Its products have been used by NASA to design the Mars Rover, by Cochlear to develop aural implants and by Runkeeper to create GPS fitness tracking applications.
Intellectual propertyThe company has registered "Atlassian" as a trademark in the United States, Australia, the European Union, Russia, China, Japan, Switzerland, Norway, Singapore, Israel, Korea and Canada. It has also filed other trademark applications in the United States, Australia, the European Union, Brazil, Russia, India and China, and certain other jurisdictions, and will pursue additional trademark registrations to the extent the company believes it would be beneficial and cost effective.
As of September 30, 2015, Atlassian had one issued patent and 22 patent applications pending in the United States, and it had no issued patents or patent applications pending in jurisdictions outside of the United States. These patents and patent applications seek to protect proprietary inventions relevant to its business. The company intends to pursue additional patent protection to the extent it believes it would be beneficial and cost effective.
CompetitionAtlassian has no single pure-play competitor across all these markets. It does have a number of competitors for individual products, ranging from large technology vendors to new and emerging businesses in each of the markets it serves.

Software and Technical Teams: Competitors include large technology vendors, including Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), IBM Corp. (NYSE:IBM) and Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) and smaller companies like Rally Software (acquired by CA, Inc. (NASDAQ:CA)) and GitHub, that offer project management and developer tools.
IT and Service Teams: Competitors include primarily public cloud vendors including ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW), salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) and Zendesk (NYSE:ZEN) and legacy vendors such as BMC Software (Remedy) that offer service desk solutions.
Business Teams: Competitors include large technology vendors Microsoft, IBM and Alphabet (GOOG, [GOOGL]]) that offer a suite of products, to smaller companies which offer point solutions for enterprise collaboration.

Atlassian /ətˈlæsiən/ is an enterprise software company that develops products for software developers, project managers, and content management.[2][3][4] It is best known for its issue tracking application, Jira, and its team collaboration and wiki product, Confluence.[3][5] Atlassian serves over 60,000 customers.[2][3][6][7][8]

History[edit]
Mike Cannon-Brookes and Scott Farquhar founded Atlassian in 2002.[2][6] The pair met while studying at the University of New South Wales in Sydney.[9] They bootstrapped the company for several years, financing the startup with a $10,000 credit card debt.[5] The name derives from the Titan Atlas (/ˈætləs/; Ancient Greek: Ἄτλας) from Greek mythology who had been punished to hold up the Heavens after the Greek gods had overthrown the Titans. The logo reflects this through the blue X-shaped figure holding up what is shown to be the bottom of the sky.
Atlassian released its flagship product, Jira – a project and issue tracker, in 2002. In 2004, it released Confluence, a team collaboration platform that lets users work together on projects, co-create content, and share documents and other media assets.[10] In 2006, Cannon-Brookes and Farquhar were named Ernst & Young’s Entrepreneurs of the Year for Australia.[11]
In July 2010, Atlassian raised $60 million in venture capital from Accel Partners.[7]
In June 2011, Atlassian announced revenue of $102 million, up 35% from the year before.[12] In August 2011, Jay Simmons became president, while Cannon-Brookes and Farquhar kept their positions as "co-chief executive".[13] For the June 2014 fiscal year, Atlassian reported $215 million in revenue, up from $144 million in 2013.[14]
In a 2014 restructuring, the parent company became Atlassian Corporation PLC of the UK, with a registered address in London—though the actual headquarters remained in Sydney.[15] Atlassian has offices in five countries: Amsterdam in the Netherlands; Austin, San Francisco, and Mountain View, California,[16] in the United States; Manila in the Philippines; Yokohama in Japan, and Sydney in Australia. The group has over 1,700 employees serving more than 60,000 customers and millions of users.[6][17]
In November 2015, Atlassian announced sales of $320 million,[18] and Shona Brown was added to its board.[13] On 10 December 2015 Atlassian made its initial public offering (IPO) on the NASDAQ stock exchange,[19] under the symbol TEAM, putting the market capitalization of Atlassian at $4.37 billion.
Sales setup[edit]
Atlassian does not have a traditional sales team. Instead, it lists all prices, information about products, documentation, support requests, and training materials on its website.[20][21] Most of their products are available as hosted or installed versions.
Acquisitions and product announcements[edit]
In 2010, Atlassian acquired Bitbucket, a hosted service for code collaboration.[22] In May 2012, the company introduced a website where customers can download plug-ins for various Atlassian products.[23][24][25] That year, Atlassian also released Stash, a Git repository for enterprises, later renamed Bitbucket Server.[26]
Additional products include Crucible, FishEye, Bamboo, and Clover, which target programmers working with a code base. FishEye, Crucible and Clover came into Atlassian's portfolio through the acquisition of another Australian software company, Cenqua, in 2007.[27] In 2012, Atlassian acquired HipChat, an instant messenger for workplace environments. Doug Burgum became chairman of its board of directors in July 2012.[28]
In 2013, Atlassian announced a Jira service desk product with full service-level agreement support.[29]

SourceTree is a Git and Mercurial desktop client for developers on Mac or Windows.
In 2015 it announced its acquisition of work chat company Hall, with the intention of migrating all Hall's customers across to its own chat product HipChat.[30]
A small startup called Dogwood Labs in Denver, Colorado which had a product called StatusPage was acquired in July 2016.[31][32] In January 2017 Atlassian announced the purchase of Trello for $425 million.[33]
Philanthropy[edit]
In March 2011, the company raised $1 million for the charity Room to Read from sales of its $10 "Starter" licenses.[34]

Atlassian /ətˈlæsiən/ is an enterprise software company that develops products for software developers, project managers, and content management.[2][3][4] It is best known for its issue tracking application, Jira, and its team collaboration and wiki product, Confluence.[3][5] Atlassian serves over 60,000 customers.[2][3][6][7][8]

History[edit]
Mike Cannon-Brookes and Scott Farquhar founded Atlassian in 2002.[2][6] The pair met while studying at the University of New South Wales in Sydney.[9] They bootstrapped the company for several years, financing the startup with a $10,000 credit card debt.[5] The name derives from the Titan Atlas (/ˈætləs/; Ancient Greek: Ἄτλας) from Greek mythology who had been punished to hold up the Heavens after the Greek gods had overthrown the Titans. The logo reflects this through the blue X-shaped figure holding up what is shown to be the bottom of the sky.
Atlassian released its flagship product, Jira – a project and issue tracker, in 2002. In 2004, it released Confluence, a team collaboration platform that lets users work together on projects, co-create content, and share documents and other media assets.[10] In 2006, Cannon-Brookes and Farquhar were named Ernst & Young’s Entrepreneurs of the Year for Australia.[11]
In July 2010, Atlassian raised $60 million in venture capital from Accel Partners.[7]
In June 2011, Atlassian announced revenue of $102 million, up 35% from the year before.[12] In August 2011, Jay Simmons became president, while Cannon-Brookes and Farquhar kept their positions as "co-chief executive".[13] For the June 2014 fiscal year, Atlassian reported $215 million in revenue, up from $144 million in 2013.[14]
In a 2014 restructuring, the parent company became Atlassian Corporation PLC of the UK, with a registered address in London—though the actual headquarters remained in Sydney.[15] Atlassian has offices in five countries: Amsterdam in the Netherlands; Austin, San Francisco, and Mountain View, California,[16] in the United States; Manila in the Philippines; Yokohama in Japan, and Sydney in Australia. The group has over 1,700 employees serving more than 60,000 customers and millions of users.[6][17]
In November 2015, Atlassian announced sales of $320 million,[18] and Shona Brown was added to its board.[13] On 10 December 2015 Atlassian made its initial public offering (IPO) on the NASDAQ stock exchange,[19] under the symbol TEAM, putting the market capitalization of Atlassian at $4.37 billion.
Sales setup[edit]
Atlassian does not have a traditional sales team. Instead, it lists all prices, information about products, documentation, support requests, and training materials on its website.[20][21] Most of their products are available as hosted or installed versions.
Acquisitions and product announcements[edit]
In 2010, Atlassian acquired Bitbucket, a hosted service for code collaboration.[22] In May 2012, the company introduced a website where customers can download plug-ins for various Atlassian products.[23][24][25] That year, Atlassian also released Stash, a Git repository for enterprises, later renamed Bitbucket Server.[26]
Additional products include Crucible, FishEye, Bamboo, and Clover, which target programmers working with a code base. FishEye, Crucible and Clover came into Atlassian's portfolio through the acquisition of another Australian software company, Cenqua, in 2007.[27] In 2012, Atlassian acquired HipChat, an instant messenger for workplace environments. Doug Burgum became chairman of its board of directors in July 2012.[28]
In 2013, Atlassian announced a Jira service desk product with full service-level agreement support.[29]

SourceTree is a Git and Mercurial desktop client for developers on Mac or Windows.
In 2015 it announced its acquisition of work chat company Hall, with the intention of migrating all Hall's customers across to its own chat product HipChat.[30]
A small startup called Dogwood Labs in Denver, Colorado which had a product called StatusPage was acquired in July 2016.[31][32] In January 2017 Atlassian announced the purchase of Trello for $425 million.[33]
Philanthropy[edit]
In March 2011, the company raised $1 million for the charity Room to Read from sales of its $10 "Starter" licenses.[34]

Atlassian /ətˈlæsiən/ is an enterprise software company that develops products for software developers, project managers, and content management.[2][3][4] It is best known for its issue tracking application, Jira, and its team collaboration and wiki product, Confluence.[3][5] Atlassian serves over 60,000 customers.[2][3][6][7][8]

History[edit]
Mike Cannon-Brookes and Scott Farquhar founded Atlassian in 2002.[2][6] The pair met while studying at the University of New South Wales in Sydney.[9] They bootstrapped the company for several years, financing the startup with a $10,000 credit card debt.[5] The name derives from the Titan Atlas (/ˈætləs/; Ancient Greek: Ἄτλας) from Greek mythology who had been punished to hold up the Heavens after the Greek gods had overthrown the Titans. The logo reflects this through the blue X-shaped figure holding up what is shown to be the bottom of the sky.
Atlassian released its flagship product, Jira – a project and issue tracker, in 2002. In 2004, it released Confluence, a team collaboration platform that lets users work together on projects, co-create content, and share documents and other media assets.[10] In 2006, Cannon-Brookes and Farquhar were named Ernst & Young’s Entrepreneurs of the Year for Australia.[11]
In July 2010, Atlassian raised $60 million in venture capital from Accel Partners.[7]
In June 2011, Atlassian announced revenue of $102 million, up 35% from the year before.[12] In August 2011, Jay Simmons became president, while Cannon-Brookes and Farquhar kept their positions as "co-chief executive".[13] For the June 2014 fiscal year, Atlassian reported $215 million in revenue, up from $144 million in 2013.[14]
In a 2014 restructuring, the parent company became Atlassian Corporation PLC of the UK, with a registered address in London—though the actual headquarters remained in Sydney.[15] Atlassian has offices in five countries: Amsterdam in the Netherlands; Austin, San Francisco, and Mountain View, California,[16] in the United States; Manila in the Philippines; Yokohama in Japan, and Sydney in Australia. The group has over 1,700 employees serving more than 60,000 customers and millions of users.[6][17]
In November 2015, Atlassian announced sales of $320 million,[18] and Shona Brown was added to its board.[13] On 10 December 2015 Atlassian made its initial public offering (IPO) on the NASDAQ stock exchange,[19] under the symbol TEAM, putting the market capitalization of Atlassian at $4.37 billion.
Sales setup[edit]
Atlassian does not have a traditional sales team. Instead, it lists all prices, information about products, documentation, support requests, and training materials on its website.[20][21] Most of their products are available as hosted or installed versions.
Acquisitions and product announcements[edit]
In 2010, Atlassian acquired Bitbucket, a hosted service for code collaboration.[22] In May 2012, the company introduced a website where customers can download plug-ins for various Atlassian products.[23][24][25] That year, Atlassian also released Stash, a Git repository for enterprises, later renamed Bitbucket Server.[26]
Additional products include Crucible, FishEye, Bamboo, and Clover, which target programmers working with a code base. FishEye, Crucible and Clover came into Atlassian's portfolio through the acquisition of another Australian software company, Cenqua, in 2007.[27] In 2012, Atlassian acquired HipChat, an instant messenger for workplace environments. Doug Burgum became chairman of its board of directors in July 2012.[28]
In 2013, Atlassian announced a Jira service desk product with full service-level agreement support.[29]

SourceTree is a Git and Mercurial desktop client for developers on Mac or Windows.
In 2015 it announced its acquisition of work chat company Hall, with the intention of migrating all Hall's customers across to its own chat product HipChat.[30]
A small startup called Dogwood Labs in Denver, Colorado which had a product called StatusPage was acquired in July 2016.[31][32] In January 2017 Atlassian announced the purchase of Trello for $425 million.[33]
Philanthropy[edit]
In March 2011, the company raised $1 million for the charity Room to Read from sales of its $10 "Starter" licenses.[34]

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
