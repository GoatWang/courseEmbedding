DISCLOSURE; FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
Information within this website contains certain statements that are “forward-looking” statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements include, among other things, projections of revenues, earnings, earnings per share, capital expenditures or other financial items and discussions of estimated future revenue enhancements and cost savings. These statements also include the Company’s business strategy, goals and expectations concerning the Company’s market position, future operations, refining margins, profitability, liquidity and capital resources.

Although management believes the assumptions upon which these forward-looking statements contained in this site are reasonable, any of these assumptions could prove to be inaccurate and the forward-looking statements based on those assumptions could be incorrect. All phases of the Company’s operations involve risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside the Company’s control, and any one of which, or a combination of which, could materially affect the Company’s results of operations and whether the forward-looking statements ultimately prove to be correct. Actual results and trends in the future may differ materially depending on a variety of factors described in greater detail in the Company’s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and other of the Company’s filings with the SEC. All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to the Company or persons acting on its behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the foregoing. The Company undertakes no obligation to update any information contained within this Site or to publicly release the results of any revisions to any such forward-looking statements that may be made to reflect events or circumstances that occur, or which the Company becomes aware of, after the information has been posted to this Site.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

TLLP owns, operates, develops, and acquires crude oil and refined products logistics assets in the U.S. Many of the assets owned by TLLP have been dropped down by Tesoro Corporation and are integral to the success of Tesoro Corporation’s refining and marketing operations. Note that Tesoro Corporation was born out of a series of acquisitions, which include the British Petroleum (BP) acquisition of Carson Refinery. Other energy players operating in this space include Chesapeake Energy (CHK), Exxon Mobil (XOM), Chevron (CVX), and ConocoPhillips (COP). All these companies can be invested into via the Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLE).Organizational structureTesoro Logistics GP, LLC operates as a general partner (or GP) of the company and along with a 2% GP interest, has ~6% limited partner (LP) interest in TLLP. Tesoro Logistics GP is owned by the Tesoro Corporation which has 28% interest in the partnership. Public unitholders hold the remaining 64%.TLLP has been growing rapidly from successive dropdowns and acquisitions, including the Los Angeles logistics assets, acquired for $650 million in late 2013 and Chevron’s Northwest Products System, acquired for $355 million in 2012.Asset summaryTesoro Logistics operates in two segments, Crude Oil Gathering and Terminalling and Transportation. The Crude Oil Gathering segment operates out of the Williston/Bakken area in North Dakota, Montana, which gathers and transports crude oil from various production locations. The Terminalling and Transportation segment owns and operates the northwest products pipeline and a jet fuel pipeline, along with 20 crude oil and refined products terminals and storage facilities in the Western and Midwestern U.S., as well as four marine terminals in California. TLLP also owns a rail-car unloading facility in Washington, a petroleum coke handling, and storage facility in Los Angeles; and other pipelines, which transport products and crude oil from refineries to nearby facilities in Salt Lake City and Los Angeles.Financial summaryTLLP has a market cap of ~$3 billion and an enterprise value of ~$4.5 billion (as of April 17). The company’s adjusted EBITDA for fiscal year 2013 was $129 million, up 66% compared to fiscal year 2012. The key drivers for the EBITDA growth in 2013 over 2012 were dropdowns from Tesoro, which included Long Beach Marine Terminal and Los Angeles short-haul pipelines. TLLP is currently trading at an EV–to–2014E EBITDA of ~15x and believes that it will continue to benefit from the synergies created by the acquisition it has made in the 2011-2013 time frame.DistributionDistributable cash flow (or DCF) for fiscal year 2013 was $83 million—up 26% over fiscal year 2012, resulting in a full-year coverage ratio of 1.1x.For the fourth quarter of 2013, TLLP increased its distribution to $0.565 per limited partner unit, which represents a growth of 4% over the previous quarter and 20% over the prior year. The amount distributed for fiscal year 2013 was $2.11 compared to $1.71 in 2012, a 23% increase. Tesoro Logistics provides a distribution yield of 4.3% currently.Read the following parts of this series to learn about TLLP’s assets in greater detail.Continue to Part 2Browse this series on Market Realist:Part 2 - Must-know update: Tesoro Logistics’ assets and operationsPart 3 - Why is Tesoro Logistics an integral part of Tesoro Corporation?Part 4 - Tesoro’s outlook for 2014 and 2015: A growth capex of $100 millionReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextTrade of the Day: Phillips 66 (PSX)InvestorPlaceEngineer Finds Pattern; Makes Millions in StocksMoney MorningSponsoredHere are the US targets North Korea most likely wants to nukeBusiness InsiderThe 'two pizza rule' is a secret to productive meetings that helped Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos become one of the world's richest menBusiness InsiderTrump to cops: 'Please don't be too nice' while arresting 'thugs,' and don't worry about their heads when you toss them in the 'paddy wagon'Business InsiderDiscover it: 4.8 out of 5 avg. by 24K+ customersDiscover CardSponsoredTrump administration ends myRA program that helped people save for retirementCNBCChevron and Exxon Mobil have a tough path ahead: NYSE traderYahoo Finance VideoStocks mixed after heavy earnings week3 Must-Own Stocks in 2017Banyan HillSponsoredTrump names John F.
