        LINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMOREFrom the looks of him, Jay Stein is a retailer. He dons circular tortoise-shell glasses that frame his tanned face, a blue shirt with a white collar custom-made in Hong Kong with his initials embroidered on the pocket, a grey flannel suit and preppy bright green and pink-striped tie, a gift from his older daughter, who followed her father's career and works as a buyer at Ralph Lauren.But when he opens his mouth, you realize Stein is something else: a storyteller. Of how his family's chain of department stores, Stein Mart, got its name — the first store in Greenville, Miss., was called Stein's Self Service, but when Stein's father Jake bought more real estate to make the store bigger, he wanted a new name. Stein's uncle said he had a friend in Arkansas named Sam Walton who was opening stores and calling them Walmart.Of his realization while walking through a store shortly after becoming CEO for the second time in 2011 that he didn't have to ask "a frickin' soul" about the changes he wanted to make to the store design.CEO CLOSEUP: What almost getting fired taught Redfin CEO Glenn KelmanAnd of being inspired by other retailers — even calling his Director of Stores Gary Pierce during his interview with USA TODAY to have Pierce tell the story of Stein calling him in excitement from an Anthropologie in Jacksonville, about six months ago after seeing the retailer's hardwood floors. Now the gift departments of newer Stein Mart stores have hardwood floors, and sales are up 20% there since installing them."It looks so damn good," Stein says in his slight Southern accent.Stein is president and CEO of his family's namesake, Stein Mart, a chain of 262 stores — 263 as of Thursday, when another opens in Watchung, N.J. — primarily throughout the Southeast and Texas. It's headquartered in Jacksonville. As Stein says, "Stein Mart does best where the sun shines."The sun has been good to the department store company, which has managed to remain afloat and maintain strong sales at a time when regional department stores have all but disappeared — closed or bought by bigger national players — and struggled to compete with both discounters and the likes of higher-end retailers such as Nordstrom. In the first two quarters of this year, sales at stores open at least a year were up 1.2% and 6% respectively. The company announced a 5% increase in sales in September. Its stock is trading at about $14.90 as of Wednesday afternoon, up more than 127% from its 52-week low.CEO CLOSEUP: Sabre's Sam Gilliland personalizes travelThe chain bills itself as a discount retailer. Stores feel like a smaller version of Macy's, but with the kind of prices you'd find at designer discounters such as TJ Maxx. Stein himself compares the company with Marshall's or Nordstrom Rack. He says pricing strategy is what sets Stein Mart apart."What built this company was values every single day," he says. He inherited that philosophy from his father, and it's the first he reinstated when he returned as CEO of the company two years ago, after stepping down in 2001 for health reasons.Now, Stein is focused both on rebuilding his customer base since losing shoppers as the company went through three CEOs in 10 years before he returned, and expanding his customer base. He plans to open eight to 12 stores next year, many in sunny California. The retailer also launched its first e-commerce site last month.In his bloodStein was born into retailing. His grandfather, Sam Stein, started the company in 1908  with a store in Greenville. By the time Jay was born in 1945, his father, Jake, was running the store (Sam had died in the 1930s)."I can clearly remember myself at the cash register at 10 years old," Stein says. "It was what you did. I didn't think there was anything else to do. When you grow up in a small town and your father has a retail store, it's the center of your life."Stein is an only child, making the question of who would inherit the family business easy to  answer. After graduating from New York University in 1967, Stein returned to Greenville to work for his father for the next 10 years. But they didn't always have the same vision for the company."He was not an easy man to work with because he had very strong opinions and because he was a product of the Depression," Stein says. "He clearly wasn't expansion minded."But when Stein saw how much inventory the store received when high-end retailers such as Saks Fifth Avenue and Neiman Marcus had "sell-offs" of their designer goods, "I said, 'There's got to be other cities that would like this merchandise, as well.' "In what today would be called a pop-up shop, Stein persuaded his father to let him open a temporary store in the closest big city, Memphis, for sell-off merchandise. "For one whole week, the town went wild," he says. "It was very successful." That was in 1977. A year later, the store became a permanent fixture and led Stein Mart's expansion into a retail chain. Stein followed up with a third store in Nashville in 1980.At that point, he also had another goal in mind: become president of the company. Stein wanted to join the Young President's Organization, a professional group that only admits company presidents younger than 40. This proved an easy feat, having no siblings to fight with about titles, and a father who only cared to focus on the  Greenville store. Stein was 36 when he essentially appointed himself president."We didn't have titles," he says, "it was a family business. ...  Nobody objected" when he gave himself the role.In the next 21 years, Stein expanded the family business to include 239 stores in 29 states. The company went public in 1992. But after having bypass surgery in 1999, he decided to step down as CEO in September 2001. He maintained his position on the board of directors and meant to act as an adviser. That didn't go as planned."Nobody would listen," Stein says. "They didn't want to. They thought they had a better plan. They were good people; they just didn't understand the culture."Stein Mart went through three CEOs from 2001 to 2011, when Stein was reinstated as interim CEO. He was officially named as CEO in June."It was just time to make a change," he says of resuming the helm.  "We saw the company was continuing in a direction, on a path that I wasn't comfortable with, and neither were our customers. ... Neither were our stock holders."Stein says merchandise quality had deteriorated, and the company was being "impersonalized."He returned to a warm welcome. "I have never felt as embraced in my life as the day I came back," he says.That personal touchFor Stein, the business is personal. Every customer is sent off from the store with a thank-you note from Stein, printed in his handwriting. It reads, "There is no company more grateful for its friends and customers than we are ...""We have the most loyal base of fans of I think any retailer in America," says Stein, pointing out the company's more than 400,000 Facebook "likes." Stein is on the road nearly every week, traveling frequently to New York City and to visit his stores. But he's not necessarily there to see how things are going."I'm not coming to check on stores, I'm coming to thank people," he says. "We have enough people out there to check on stores."Stein gave up his year-end bonus last year, distributing it to store employees to use for meals out with each other or other activities. He says his bonus was the thank-you letters he received from customers in the months following his return to the company."That meant more to me than anything in this world," he says.Stein Mart's success may have as much to do with offering customers great deals as with its familial roots and personality. Stein has an 87% approval rating on job ratings site Glassdoor.When he returned to the company, his wife Deanie Stein told USA TODAY they would tour stores and could "see on (employees') faces how relieved they were."While at a store in Chantilly, Va., for the USA TODAY interview, several employees asked to have their picture taken with Stein.He says the feeling is mutual: "It's important that I can meet as many people as possible that work with this company and just thank them."CONNECTTWEET

                    • Dean’s List 
                    • Professor’s Research Assistant for law journal article,

Practice Areas
 Intellectual  Property and Trade Secrets 
                Mr. Stein secures his  clients’ intellectual property rights, such as trademarks and copyrights,  through registration and licensing, and he protects them via enforcement before  the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board and in the Federal Courts.  Mr. Stein has developed expertise in  combating threats to his clients’ businesses posed by counterfeit goods and  also works with his clients to safeguard their trade secrets and proprietary  information.  In this  media-dominated business climate, protecting one’s brand is more critical than  ever and requires proactive and aggressive action.     
Business Counseling and Transactions 
  Developing  creative, but sound, business strategies and short-term and long-term planning  are Mr. Stein’s strengths.  By  becoming intimately familiar with his client’s business, Mr. Stein is able to  be most effective in rendering advice to his clients on the full spectrum of  business affairs, including business start-up, employment and consultancy  matters, supplier and customer relations, and consumer product regulation.  Mr. Stein devotes careful attention to  crafting each legal document uniquely to the particular business  transaction.  Envisioning the way  the transaction will ultimately play-out is the key to making the legal  documents “bullet-proof.”  
Antitrust and Competition  
                  In an increasingly  competitive business environment, making certain that a business’s competitors  play by the rules is critical.   Predatory pricing, false advertising and unfair competition are the  harms from which Mr. Stein protects his clients -- even against goliaths.  
Governmental Affairs and Public Relations 
   In  the last quarter-century since Mr. Stein, himself, served as an elected public  official, Mr. Stein has represented his clients’ interests before city  councils, county boards, and commissions on a variety of business and real  estate matters.  Mr. Stein  understands that success before such bodies is a function of both who you know  and how skilled your presentation is.    
Real Estate   
   Mr.  Stein has represented developers, property owners, real estate brokers,  mortgage companies, escrow agents, and appraisers in a wide array of real  property transactions and disputes, including those regarding subdivision  development, sales transactions, title issues, property line issues and  descriptions, easements, investments, and partnerships.

Stein Mart: From $43 to $1.3 billion in three generations | Fortune.comCareersSearchSearchTesla3 Things to Watch for at the Tesla Model 3 Launch EventwealthJeff Bezos Was the Richest Person in the World for a Few Hours. Then He Lost $6 Billion OvernightCOMPARECARDSSPONSOREDJobsEvery State’s Favorite Job Listing BuzzwordJay Stein at a Stein Mart store in Jacksonville Photo: Bob CroslinCareersStein Mart: From $43 to $1.3 billion in three generationsBeth KowittMar 20, 2014Jay Stein's family embodies the American dream. His grandfather immigrated to the U.S. and opened a general store in Greenville, Miss., in the early 1900s. Some 70 years later Stein began transforming the family's single shop into a chain of department stores that sell upscale brands at bargain prices. Stein Mart (smrt) has grown into a publicly traded company with 266 locations in 29 states and $1.3 billion in revenue. Even after coronary bypass surgery, Stein, 68, couldn't make retirement stick. He's back running the company and, seemingly, as ambitious as ever. His story:My grandfather Sam Stein immigrated to New York City in 1905 with $43 in his pocket. He came from what was then Russia, now Poland, to escape all the persecutions of the day. I took the family to Ellis Island 100 years later to the day to celebrate. After, we went to the address listed next to his signature in the logbook, and it's now right by a Louis Vuitton store in downtown Manhattan. He should have bought the building.My grandfather was a runner on Wall Street, delivering paperwork, but he didn't like New York. It was too big and bustling for him. So he saved all his nickel tips until he had enough to leave, and went to Memphis. There was this firm that would give immigrants a bag of merchandise -- things like needles and thread and socks -- and they'd go out, sell, and send the money back. My grandfather would take a steamboat every week down the Mississippi Delta and sell to farmers and farmhands whatever he could carry.RelatedJobsEvery State’s Favorite Job Listing BuzzwordJobsEvery State’s Favorite Job Listing BuzzwordHe got off the steamboat in Greenville, Miss., and saw that the town was building a new synagogue. He said to himself, "They must be good to their Jews here, and it looks like a great town." He settled and kept going out to the farms until someone in town said, "You need a general store," and lent him the money to do that.He married and had four kids, and the store was part of the whole family's life. Life was really good for our family in this great, sweet Southern town. Unfortunately, in 1933, during the Depression, my grandfather had a heart attack and died. My father, Jake, the oldest, was on a football scholarship at the University of Alabama, and he quit school and came back to work in the store.MORE: Planting the seeds for 1-800-Flowers.comEventually the town expanded, and a better location opened up down the street. My father told his brother and sister to open up the new store, and he would take care of selling out the merchandise in their old space. That going-out-of-business sale did so well that a light went on for my father. He told his brother and sister to keep running the new store, and he would make the old space a promotional store. He had stumbled on the off-price model that would make us a hit -- selling to people who needed great merchandise at really deep discounted prices.I came along in 1945, and my early life was based around school, home, and working. I was always in [my dad's] store. Something needed to be done, you did it. We didn't have a lot of job titles. In the late 1950s, early 1960s, we expanded in the same location. My uncle was visiting, and he asked if they had a name for the new building. When my father told him no, my uncle said, "I've got a friend of mine who's opening stores in Arkansas; his name is Sam Walton and he calls his Wal-Mart." That's how Stein Mart got the name. Before that it was Stein's.I went to prep school in Jacksonville, where I live now, and college at New York University. I came back to Greenville in 1967, and I remember the first day. I parked the car, crossed the street, and I said, "What's my life going to be like?" I thought about it for 30 seconds, opened the door, and there it was -- whatever "it" was going to be.MORE: The sweet smell of Jo Malone's successThe arrangement wasn't particularly peaceful. My father wanted to keep the operation small and didn't think we needed records. He felt very comfortable doing business the way he'd been doing it the last 30 years. His work ethic was traumatic for me. He was a workaholic and would never leave the store. When I went on dates on Friday night, they'd have to start at 9 p.m. because my father would still be working and I felt guilty leaving before him. My father was a his-way kind of guy, and if you deviated at all, he wouldn't be pleased. On the other hand, he was sought after in every respect in the community and in the congregation for his enlightenment. But when it came to the store, he wouldn't budge.Part of our merchandise was selloff from Saks Fifth Avenue, and Saks kept trying to get us to take more. For years I kept talking about opening a store in a larger city, and one day my father said, "Let's go look." In 1977 we went to Memphis and found a vacant 30,000-square-foot space. My father looked at it and said, "We'll take half of it." I said, "What are we going to do with half of it? We ought to take the whole thing!" Right in front of everybody we went at it again. The landlord made it economically feasible so we could take all of it.Opening day was magical. Thousands of people showed up. Everyone would go straight to ladies apparel. I said, "Oh, my God, we're going to run out of ladies' goods in three days." I went back to New York to buy more merchandise and didn't know where to begin. I was introduced to Phil Dobular, a buyer who specialized in off-price deals and was in between positions. He knew everyone in the New York market. He was, and still is, the funniest individual who ever lived. The combination of Brooklyn and Greenville was unbeatable. He worked with me for 25 years.MORE: Hobie Alter - founding father of the surfing industryIn Greenville we'd hire our friends' wives who wanted to work during Saks' promotions. They saw the merchandise first and got discounts. On opening day in Memphis this lady Jane Carruthers comes to me. She was right out of the Junior League -- the apex of Memphis culture and society. She said, "Can I work here? I've got a few friends that would like to, too." They were the most charming, lovely four ladies I've ever met. That was the birth of the Boutique Program -- we'd hire local women and they would spread the word. It gave us wonderful credibility, and they enjoyed it. Whenever we'd open a store, the Boutique Program just worked. It was a really important part of our early growth.We started to focus more on systems and processes. Our first hire in Memphis was a fabulous manager, Carl Davis. He helped us enormously and took us to the next level. He started doing inventory management, which my father didn't want in Greenville. At that point we needed more expertise. We hired Jack Williams between stores No. 3 and 4 to handle operations. My father said, "What's he going to do?" My father didn't understand it if he wasn't going to work on the floor selling. But my father would listen to Jack and respected him. Sometimes his most important function was telling my father we were going to open a new store. Jack was a friend, counselor, and partner. He semiretired three years ago, but he still comes into the office almost every day.We hit No. 10 and kept going. We went public in 1992 with about 46 stores. We did the IPO to attain personal liquidity for our family and establish a currency for expansion.MORE: The rise of the TweezermanI had a bypass 15 years ago and thought, Maybe I shouldn't do this day to day, and maybe there's other people who can do it better. We tried with three different CEOs and failed for every available reason. They weren't merchants. You've got to have a merchant running a retail operation. After our third unsuccessful try, I took the position of interim CEO. Sixteen months into it a reporter came to me and asked, "When are you going to drop the interim title?" I said, "Right now." I didn't realize the consequences, and our general counsel came in and said, "We have to make a public announcement!"Our folks really embraced me coming back. It's just been perfect. We've got the best organization we've ever had. I'm a lot happier than I was the first time we built it. I'm more secure, more self-assured. Now we're at 266 stores, and we're going to open about 10 this year and 15 next year. I think we can double our size. One day we'll find a business partner that can keep the same standards and atmosphere, and we'll merge our company. I'm in no hurry, and I'm very particular. We'll do the right thing. It's legacy. It's got our name on it.My advice People work with you, not for you. In the early days if we had made the wrong hire just once, we would have been done. Hire good people who are a lot smarter than you are. Treat them well, love them, and embrace them.Location, location, location. When you make a bad buy as a merchant, it can take six weeks to sell out. But a bad buy in real estate can take 10 years to get out of. Bad locations cost you a lot of money.Grow slowly. We got to 10 stores and said, "Perhaps we can open 10 more." Don't wake up one morning and say you want 100 stores, because you'll stretch yourself and your resources too quickly.This story is from the April 7, 2014 issue of Fortune.
