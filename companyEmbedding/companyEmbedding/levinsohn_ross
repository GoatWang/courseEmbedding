He was Interim Yahoo CEO in 2012 after Carol Bartz left Yahoo suddenly.[5] Nine weeks later, the Board surprised many inside and outside the company by naming Google executive Marissa Mayer to lead Yahoo. Shortly after the Mayer appointment, Levinsohn left the company in August.[6]
Guggenheim[edit]
Following his exit at Yahoo, Levinsohn joined investment manager Guggenheim Securities, where he assumed a new role as CEO of Guggenheim Digital Media. In this role, he was tasked with investing and acquiring media assets, and actively pursued both Hulu and Vevo as potential acquisitions. He also oversaw a portfolio of assets already under management by Guggenheim including The Hollywood Reporter, Billboard, Adweek and the Clio Awards.

Exclusive: Ross Levinsohn Departs Yahoo


July 30, 2012 at 1:46 pm PT

As I previously reported he likely would, top Yahoo exec Ross Levinsohn â who lost the CEO race to former Google exec Marissa Mayer â is leaving the company, according to several sources.
Mayer also just sent a note to the company about the departure, added a multitude of other sources across the company.
(Update: Yahoo just filed regulatory documents about the separation, noting severance agreements that total many millions of dollars. 
And the company also released a statement confirming the departure: âRoss has done a terrific job during his time at Yahoo!. We wish him all the best.â
Levinsohn also had a memo to staff, which is also below.)
Levinsohn, who took over as interim CEO in the wake of the ouster of Scott Thompson earlier this year, had been running the Americas unit of the Silicon Valley Internet giant. That put him in charge of key Yahoo businesses, including its media and advertising sales divisions.
Levinsohn and Mayer have been negotiating his exit for several days, sources said, which is not surprising given the awkward circumstance between them. 
While Mayer might have benefited from Levinsohnâs close ties with key marketing players and his content experience, her intense focus on products and not on media likely means that she will rely on a more tech-heavy leadership team going forward.
It will be interesting to see who she picks going forward. As I previously reported, many think she will pull from the ranks of former and current Google execs, where she worked for her entire career before Yahoo.
Levinsohn does not apparently have any current plans for another gig, but as an experienced and very well-liked online media exec, he will likely have many options.  
He came to Yahoo in late 2010, replacing Hilary Schneider, in the regime of Carol Bartz, who was later fired. 
Levinsohn arrived at Yahoo from Fuse Capital, where he worked with Jon Miller â now chief digital officer at News Corp. â in funding digital media and communications start-ups.
But, until his Yahoo job, Levinsohn was probably best known for his stint running digital operations for News Corp.âs then Fox Interactive Media unit.
It was at FIM that he rose to prominence after he bought Myspace, the social networking site that was once the hottest property on the Web.
At the time, Levinsohn and other execs also struck a gigantically lucrative advertising search deal with Google that garnered Myspace huge revenues.
After leaving News Corp. â after repeated clashes with Myspace co-founder and then CEO Chris DeWolfe â he partnered with Miller in another investment company, Velocity Capital.
Ironically, both Miller and Levinsohn were the top choices of billionaire shareholder activist Carl Icahn as the execs he wanted to run Yahoo when he was agitating for change there a few years back in the midst of the failed takeover attempt by Microsoft.
Fast forward several years, with Levinsohn losing his shot as CEO of Yahoo, after yet another hedge fund manager â Dan Loeb of Third Point, who waged a Yahoo proxy fight that ended in him getting seats on the board â strongly backed Mayer for the job instead of Levinsohn.
Levinsohn never had a chance against the tech-star resume of Mayer, of course. But, for his time of taking over Yahoo after the crisis around the ouster of Thompson over a fake computer science degree on his bio alone â a rocky period for the company, to be sure â Levinsohn probably deserves a lot of kudos from Yahooâs board.
More to come, obviously. 
But here is the Mayer note about Levinsohnâs departure in full:
Subject: Thank You to Ross Levinsohn
Do Not Forward
I am writing to let you know that Ross Levinsohn will be leaving the company at the end of July. 
Ross has been an important and powerful contributor at Yahoo since he joined in 2010. During May and June, Ross stepped into an incredibly tough role as interim CEO and did a terffic job â he really helped keep the company moving, closed important deals, and assembled a very talented team. I am very grateful to Ross for his leadership and work throughout his tenure at Yahoo. His contributions will be missed.
Ross will be in Sunnyvale tomorrow (Tuesday, July 31). Please take the opportunity to drop by and thank him for all he has done for the company. I hope you can join me in wishing Ross well and letting him know how much youâve appreciated him as a colleague. 
â Marissa
I wanted to let you know that my time at Yahoo has come to an end. It has been an incredible journey for me and I could not be prouder of what we accomplished over the past few years helping define Yahoo as a leader in digital media and advertising. Yahoo is an amazing brand and company, and I leave knowing we did all we could to help inform and entertain more than 700 million users each month. Leading this company has been one of the best experiences of my career, but it is time for me to look for the next challenge.
â Ross

NEW YORK, July 31, 2014 /PRNewswire/ --Â Scout Media announced today thatÂ Ross LevinsohnÂ will join its board and take the role of Executive Chairman. The announcement was made by CEO James Heckman, who said Levinsohn will help lead the company's strategic expansion, and work closely with management on key operational initiatives. Today's announcement marks the fourth venture the two media executives have partnered on together.Â Scout also announced today its executive team, which includes four former media CEOs and two Presidents, who will manage the Networks scheduled launch this September.
Levinsohn most recently served as CEO of Guggenheim Digital Media, and previously was Global Media head and interim CEO of Yahoo!, President of Fox Interactive, General Manager Alta Vista, Vice President of Programming for CBSSportsline and Director of Production and Marketing Enterprises for HBO. Heckman was Levinsohn's strategic chief at both Yahoo! and Fox, and they worked together on several other digital media ventures, such as Fox Sports.com, Rivals and Scout.
Heckman and Pilot recently acquired sports media network and techÂ platform Scout.com from Fox/News Corp. and merged Scout with North American Membership Group, which operates several leading male-centric media properties â expected to launch as a single network this September. Scout will debut with over $100 million in assets, consisting of premium, all-owned, highly engaging contentÂ and commerceÂ propertiesÂ for men; with over 300 web properties, 21 million customers, three television shows, 38 magazines and a robust commerce enterprise.
"We believe the choices for major brands to connect efficiently withÂ menÂ are few and expensive," said Heckman.Â "Scout operates in a space this team is quite familiar with and so we plan to compete aggressively. Major brands can count on a quality product, as well as a 100 percent brand-enhancing environment. Ross Levinsohn will provide key leadership to ensure we make that connection."
"There are a number of reasons I'm excited to be a part of this venture," says Levinsohn. "First, James and Bob are great innovators in the media industry; Second, the team we've assembled isÂ proven, loyal and can deliver market-leading results; andÂ finally,Â the male-focused opportunity Scout is focused onÂ is underserved in the market and ripe for expansion.Â  James and I have been great partners for almost a decade, and we work through key issues on a day-to-day basis. Â This can be a big company quickly.
"I'm truly excited to see this great team coming together and the terrific progress they're making in building this digital company," said Pittman. "It's a great combination of leadership, energy and a real understanding of this demographic."
Scout Unveils Executive Team
"Our veteran team is back together, including our best engineers and product people, based again in Seattle â and we've recruited back some of our best-performing media executives as well, now all working in NYC," said Heckman. "We love this place and clearly have the talent to execute. It would be a challenge to find any new venture with this kind of experience, talent and longstanding relationships within the digital media space â especially sports and advertising."
Scout's appointments include executives, content creators, engineers and product pioneers from Yahoo!, AOL, MSN, Google, Amazon, NFL and News Corp, all with deep ties to Heckman, Levinsohn and Pittman. 
The bios for the entire Scout executive team are below:
CEO, Founder and Director, James Heckman, previously served as Head of Global Media Strategy for Yahoo!, leading all significant transactions and revenue strategy under Levinsohn; held the same role as Chief Strategy Officer at FOX Digital/Myspace, and architected the market-changing $900 million social media ad alliance between Google and Myspace; Founder/CEO of 5to1 (sold to Yahoo!), Founder/CEO of Scout.com (sold to Fox), Founder and CEO of Rivals.com (sold to Yahoo!) and President of NFL Exclusive, official publication for all NFL teams.Â  
Chief Operating Officer, Mark Stieglitz, held senior roles in both the business and the product divisions at Yahoo!, shortly after their acquisition of 5to1, where he was co-founder and COO. Previously, he partnered with Heckman on the landmark Google/MySpace ad venture, and before that was GM of the highly successful video gaming network, IGN, which sold to Fox forÂ $600 Million. Stieglitz began his career at IBM and then Oracle. 
Chief Technology Officer, Bill Sornsin, ran MSN's Core Technology team before joining Heckman, in 1999 as co-founder and CTO of Rivals.com. He was also co-founder and CTO/COO for Scout and served as VP Engineering and Operations at News Corp/Fox Interactive Media after Scout's 2005 acquisition. Sornsin heads a world-class technology team out of Scout's Seattle office, with talent assembled from the likes of Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Yahoo!, Zillow, Fox, Disney, Brightcove, ThePlatform and AT&T.
Chief Strategy Officer, Steven Rindner, is a longtime colleague of Pittman, first as a lead dealmaker at AOL as SVP, Corporate development and more recently, was the key lead for Pittman's investment fund, Pilot Group, on the investment in male media properties that merged with Heckman'sÂ Scout.com. Rindner recently worked with private equity firm Louis Dreyfus and served as SVP, Strategic Alliances for Citigroup. Rindner leads all acquisitions and partnerships for theÂ Scout.comÂ media network roll-up.
Chief Revenue Officer, Ben Madden, was most recently President of Maxim, where he previously served as Chief Revenue Officer. Madden joined Alpha Media Group (parent company of Maxim) from Media Networks, a division of Time Inc., where he served as the Vice President of Sales. Previously, Madden was Publisher at Reader's Digest, where he was the youngest publisher in the magazine's storied history. Madden ran sales at Smart Money and Online sales at Rodale after starting his career at Reebok.
EVP, Programmatic and Media Partnerships, Ramsey McGrory,Â led sales at Right Media before running the company at Yahoo!, including oversight of all Yahoo!'s data relationships during Levinsohn's tenure.

UPDATE:Â It's official. Ross Levinsohn is Yahoo's interim CEO.
EARLIER: It's the most thankless job in tech: CEO of Yahoo.
Now Ross Levinsohn is expected to be named Yahoo's CEO on an interim basis,Â with the boardÂ expected to announce Scott Thompson's departureÂ shortly.
He'll be the company's sixth CEO in five years.
So who's Levinsohn?
He's best known for his time running Fox Interactive Media, the News Corp. division which formerly owned MySpace and a host of other online properties.
Under his watch, Fox bought Myspace for $580 millionâthen inked a $900 million search deal with Google. Shortly afterwards, he left News Corp. to become a venture capitalist at Fuse Capital.
So he's got a good sense of timing.
Before News Corp., he worked in positions at CBS and HBO.
He joined Yahoo in November 2010 and oversees the company's North American media and advertising businesses.
So his reputation in the Valley is primarily as a media guy. If he's to be more than just Yahoo's interim CEO, he'll need to convince Yahoo's restive engineers and product managers that he has tech chops, tooâand persuade Wall Street that Yahoo deserves the kind of multiple assigned to tech companies, not slow-growth media concerns.
Some in tech are bullish on Levinsohn.
Former Twitter executive Josh Elman, now a principal at Greylock, thinks Levinsohn is the right person for the job.
"Ross could attract strong [product and engineering] talent" as Yahoo CEO, Elman tweeted over the weekend, before Sunday's news.
"The problem there is overcoming a long time of empty (and changing) promises," Elman added. "That worries me more."

Ross Levinsohn Joins Scout Media as Executive Chairman â Adweek                       FollowfacebooktwitterinstagramlinkedinFeed Subscribe     Brand MarketingAgenciesDigitalTV / VideoCreativity          DigitalRoss Levinsohn Joins Scout Media as Executive ChairmanYahoo veteran teams again with James HeckmanBy Christopher Heine|August 1, 2014ShareBy Christopher Heine|August 1, 2014Share Scout Media, a men's sports and lifestyle digital publisher, has appointed Ross Levinsohn to executive chairman, the company's CEO James Heckman announced. Levinsohn served as CEO of Guggenheim Digital Media, which has recently been renamed Guggenheim Entertainment Media, for 18 months before exiting in June. Adweek is owned by affiliates of Guggenheim Partners. The veteran executive is also known for his Yahoo tenure (2010-12) as well as six years as president of Fox Interactive Media during the early 2000s. The new endeavor marks the fourth occasion in which Heckman and Levinsohn have worked together. Heckman most recently collaborated with Levinsohn at Yahoo and suggested he intends to leverage his old colleague's ad sales chops. "We believe the choices for major brands to connect efficiently with men are few and expensive," Heckman said in a statement. "Scout operates in a space this team is quite familiar with and so we plan to compete aggressively. Major brands can count on a quality product, as well as a 100 percent brand-enhancing environment. Ross Levinsohn will provide key leadership to ensure we make that connection." Heckman is backed by Clear Channel CEO Bob Pittmanâs venture fund, the Pilot Group, which acquired Scout from Fox Sports in 2013. In addition, Scout has merged with Pittmanâs North American Membership Group, which publishes men-focused titles such as North American Hunter and PGA Tours. Thanks to the merger, Scout is effectively rebooting next month as a company that entails 300 Web destinations, 38 magazines and three cable television programs. Levinsohn said his role doesn't involve full-time duties, but he'll advise in concerns to Scout operations. "[Heckman] and I have been great partners for almost a decade, and we work through key issues on a day-to-day basis," he said. "This can be a big company quickly." Pittman added, "I'm truly excited to see this great team coming together and the terrific progress they're making in building this digital company." Levinsohn also has been named to the Scout board of directors. Sharehttp://adweek.it/1s9V0Gq copy    Subscribe to Adweek Today!

His previous experience led him to a new role in 1989 at HBO in marketing and promotions for the pay cable giant and its newly formed unit, Time Warner Sports. Levinsohn was promoted in 1993 to launch a new group that created and oversaw new production, licensing and ventures to expand and monetize the HBO brand across all platforms, which led to his first foray in digital. In 1994, he helped develop content for CompuServe, Prodigy and America Online on behalf of HBO. In 1995, he was recognized as one of the "30 under 30" media execs by GQ Magazine.
Internet[edit]
In early 1996 Levinsohn was recruited by SportsLine USA founder Mike Levy, to join the startup sports website in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida. He oversaw all content and product for the company, which quickly grew to become one of the most important sites in the early days of the internet. In 1997, during the first growth phase of the industry, SportsLine raised money from Kleiner Perkins and then went public through a highly successful IPO. CBS bought a piece of the company and rebranded it CBS Sportsline.com. Levinsohn went on to expand the content and product offerings including building the largest and most successful Fantasy Sports business in the industry at the time, and official websites for superstars Michael Jordan, Wayne Gretzky, Shaq O'Neill, Pete Sampras and the San Francisco 49ers. He and also produced a syndicated television show starring NFL coaches Marv Levy and Sam Wyche, and host Scott Kaplan entitled "Football Playbook" and syndicated radio programming on Westwood One. He is credited with helping launch the careers of personalities including Kaplan and sports "shock jock" Sid Rosenberg.
During the height of the first Internet boom, Levinsohn was recruited to help envision and launch the portal division for online search giant Alta Vista in 1999. At the time, Alta Vista was the leading search engine in the world. Within six months Alta Vista Live was launched and quickly grew to one of the most popular content and services sites in the world. Alta Vista was days away from going public in March 2000, when the first crash of the Internet occurred. Following the crash, Alta Vista was sold to Inktomi, which later was acquired by Yahoo.
News Corporation[edit]
In 2000, Levinsohn joined the internet division of News Corporation, News Digital Media. From 2001 to 2005, he was Senior Vice President and General Manager at Fox Sports Interactive Media where he led the interactive sports business for Fox, including the FoxSports.com site, which grew from a few hundred thousand users to more than 35 million monthly users and competed as the most popular sports site in the United States. In late 2004, he was tasked with developing a broader digital strategy for the global media powerhouse and was named President of Fox Interactive Media. A direct report to Rupert Murdoch and Peter Chernin, Levinsohn assumed day-to-day operating responsibility for the main Fox web properties including Fox Sports.com, Fox.com, and Fox News.com and spearheaded an investment and acquisition strategy that led to the acquisitions of MySpace, IGN, Askmen.com, Scout.com, Newroo and KSolo.[4] In less than a year, Fox's Internet properties went from an also ran to the top of the industry, and were generating more page views than any other sites in the United States, in large part due to the growth of MySpace. Fox acquired MySpace in 2005 long before the social networking boom. MySpace, at the time, was adding roughly 70,000 new users a day. A year later the site was adding more than 15 million new users a month and revenue had grown to over $200 million a year. Capitalizing on this success, in 2006, Fox Interactive signed a search and advertising deal in which Google paid Fox for exclusive rights to certain search and some display inventory for nearly $1 billion. Fox Interactive Media's properties grew to a become one of the most 5 most visited businesses on the web during Levinsohn's tenure and maintained its growth for more than a year after his dismissal by News Corp President Peter Chernin. Chernin and News Corp Chairman Rupert Murdoch quickly had realized that Levinsohn acquisition of MySpace and other smaller properties were poor strategic decisions. News Corp would later take significant write-offs on Fox Interactive Media.
Fuse Capital[edit]
Having acquired and invested in dozens of companies, and finding a passion for fostering entrepreneurs, in December 2007, Levinsohn and former AOL Chairman Jonathan Miller launched Velocity Interactive Group, a media and communications investment fund along with India's Keyur Patel. Levinsohn and Miller failed to raise any capital on their own and eventually joined with Silicon Valley venture firm ComVentures. Re-branded as Fuse Capital, the partners invested in early stage startup in the US, India and China. In India, it led investments in leading media outlets NDTV and India TV, and Fuse+Media, which financed motion pictures, while domestically the company invested in the likes of Generate (sold to Alloy), Broadband Enterprises (sold to Specific Media), Next New Networks (sold to Google) and 5:1 (sold to Yahoo). Through 2016, their fund has failed to return invested capital back to investors. Most limited partners expect it to be amongst the worst returning funds of its vintage.
Yahoo[edit]
In October 2010, Levinsohn was recruited by Yahoo CEO Carol Bartz to lead the company's largest division, Yahoo Americas, where he assumed responsibility for its massive media and advertising businesses. After leadership changes at the top of the company, new CEO Scott Thompson named Levinsohn Head of Global Media for a brief period of time, before Thompson's exit.
He was Interim Yahoo CEO in 2012 after Carol Bartz left Yahoo suddenly.[5] Nine weeks later, the Board surprised many inside and outside the company by naming Google executive Marissa Mayer to lead Yahoo. Shortly after the Mayer appointment, Levinsohn left the company in August.[6]
Guggenheim[edit]
Following his exit at Yahoo, Levinsohn joined investment manager Guggenheim Securities, where he assumed a new role as CEO of Guggenheim Digital Media. In this role, he was tasked with investing and acquiring media assets, and actively pursued both Hulu and Vevo as potential acquisitions. He also oversaw a portfolio of assets already under management by Guggenheim including The Hollywood Reporter, Billboard, Adweek and the Clio Awards.

A direct report to Rupert Murdoch and Peter Chernin, Levinsohn assumed day-to-day operating responsibility for the main Fox web properties including Fox Sports.com, Fox.com, and Fox News.com and spearheaded an investment and acquisition strategy that led to the acquisitions of MySpace, IGN, Askmen.com, Scout.com, Newroo and KSolo.[4] In less than a year, Fox's Internet properties went from an also ran to the top of the industry, and were generating more page views than any other sites in the United States, in large part due to the growth of MySpace. Fox acquired MySpace in 2005 long before the social networking boom. MySpace, at the time, was adding roughly 70,000 new users a day. A year later the site was adding more than 15 million new users a month and revenue had grown to over $200 million a year. Capitalizing on this success, in 2006, Fox Interactive signed a search and advertising deal in which Google paid Fox for exclusive rights to certain search and some display inventory for nearly $1 billion. Fox Interactive Media's properties grew to a become one of the most 5 most visited businesses on the web during Levinsohn's tenure and maintained its growth for more than a year after his dismissal by News Corp President Peter Chernin. Chernin and News Corp Chairman Rupert Murdoch quickly had realized that Levinsohn acquisition of MySpace and other smaller properties were poor strategic decisions. News Corp would later take significant write-offs on Fox Interactive Media.
Fuse Capital[edit]
Having acquired and invested in dozens of companies, and finding a passion for fostering entrepreneurs, in December 2007, Levinsohn and former AOL Chairman Jonathan Miller launched Velocity Interactive Group, a media and communications investment fund along with India's Keyur Patel. Levinsohn and Miller failed to raise any capital on their own and eventually joined with Silicon Valley venture firm ComVentures. Re-branded as Fuse Capital, the partners invested in early stage startup in the US, India and China. In India, it led investments in leading media outlets NDTV and India TV, and Fuse+Media, which financed motion pictures, while domestically the company invested in the likes of Generate (sold to Alloy), Broadband Enterprises (sold to Specific Media), Next New Networks (sold to Google) and 5:1 (sold to Yahoo). Through 2016, their fund has failed to return invested capital back to investors. Most limited partners expect it to be amongst the worst returning funds of its vintage.
Yahoo[edit]
In October 2010, Levinsohn was recruited by Yahoo CEO Carol Bartz to lead the company's largest division, Yahoo Americas, where he assumed responsibility for its massive media and advertising businesses. After leadership changes at the top of the company, new CEO Scott Thompson named Levinsohn Head of Global Media for a brief period of time, before Thompson's exit.
He was Interim Yahoo CEO in 2012 after Carol Bartz left Yahoo suddenly.[5] Nine weeks later, the Board surprised many inside and outside the company by naming Google executive Marissa Mayer to lead Yahoo. Shortly after the Mayer appointment, Levinsohn left the company in August.[6]
Guggenheim[edit]
Following his exit at Yahoo, Levinsohn joined investment manager Guggenheim Securities, where he assumed a new role as CEO of Guggenheim Digital Media. In this role, he was tasked with investing and acquiring media assets, and actively pursued both Hulu and Vevo as potential acquisitions. He also oversaw a portfolio of assets already under management by Guggenheim including The Hollywood Reporter, Billboard, Adweek and the Clio Awards.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.source> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11x1gf2m6>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
