Print This Bio: 




Robert M. Peterson, a founding partner of Carlson, Calladine & Peterson LLP, represents businesses and individuals in high exposure, complex cases, including insurance bad faith, corporate malfeasance, discrimination and civil rights, unfair competition, attorney malpractice and catastrophic injury in accident and product liability cases. Over his thirty-plus year career, Mr. Peterson has tried many high stakes cases, lasting from three weeks to three months, in state and federal courts.
Clients regularly ask Mr. Peterson on the eve of trial to associate or substitute in as trial counsel. Mr. Peterson is nationally known for his trial expertise in insurance bad faith and punitive damages. He has tried or litigated insurance bad faith cases in more than 20 states.
Mr. Peterson is a Life Fellow of the American Board of Trial Advocates (ABOTA), a prestigious invitation only organization which recognizes plaintiff and defense trial lawyers who have consistently demonstrated outstanding trial skills and the highest degree of professionalism. He currently serves on ABOTA’s National Board, ABOTA’s  (S.F. Chapter) Executive Committee, and previously served on ABOTA’s (S.F. Chapter) steering committee on civility and professionalism.
Mr. Peterson has authored over a dozen articles on topics such as punitive damages, class actions, and litigation and trial techniques, and co-authored the chapter on Using Depositions at Trial, in Effective Depositions 2nd Edition (Henry L. Hecht, 2010). He has presented at the ABOTA “Masters in Trial” program, is a frequent speaker at professional organizations and seminars, and has taught trial and deposition techniques to California lawyers and law students. He is a Fellow of Litigation Counsel of America, the Trial Lawyer Honorary Society, and is a member of Who’s Who in America and the Million Dollar Advocates Forum. Mr. Peterson has been recognized as a Northern California “Super Lawyer” since 2004.
