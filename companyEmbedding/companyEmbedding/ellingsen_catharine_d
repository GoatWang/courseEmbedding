Republic Services Inc., Phoenix,  has announced that Catharine D. Ellingsen has been named executive vice president, chief legal officer and corporate secretary. She will report directly to President and CEO Donald W. Slager. She replaces Michael P. Rissman, who is currently on a leave of absence and is leaving the company, effective immediately.
Ellingsen joined the company's legal team in August 2001. During her 15 years at Republic, she held roles of increasing responsibility, including managing corporate counsel, associate general counsel and vice president, deputy general counsel. She most recently held the position of senior vice president (SVP), general counsel, where she directed the company's corporate governance and legal affairs, including litigation, commercial transactions and legal regulatory matters during Rissman's leave of absence. Prior to that, Ellingsen was the SVP of human resources for five years.
 
"Catharine is an experienced attorney with great integrity, leadership skills and a deep knowledge of our industry and company,” Slager says. We expect a seamless transition of duties given our robust succession planning process, which has developed a deep leadership bench across our organization. We look forward to her contributions in further fostering a strong culture of compliance while helping us achieve our vision of becoming America's preferred recycling and waste services partner."  
 
Prior to joining Republic, Ellingsen spent nine years in private practice primarily focused on employment and labor law for international law firms Steptoe & Johnson LLP, Washington, and Bryan Cave LLP, St. Louis.
