West Fargo businesses in the dark about property plans








By Natalie Parsons&nbsp|&nbsp

WEST FARGO, N.D. (Valley News Live) The City of West Fargo and a developer have been working to find the perfect plan to redevelop and revitalize the downtown, but businesses along Sheyenne Street are feeling left in the dark.



Many of the West Fargo businesses located along Sheyenne Street between 4th and 5th Avenue West have been there for over 20-years. 
The ones who spoke to us say the land has been bought by a developer.
Whether they own the property or just rent space in this area, most of the businesses have until the end of the month to get out. 
They also told us that they have seen people do soil samples to see if the property can handle what they say may be planned. 
One business owner, who didn't want to be identified, says a six story building could go up.
If the VFW sells, the main floor of the new building would be for them.
Other parts of the building would be rented professional space or apartments with underground parking.
A park is also in the works that would include ice skating, venders, craft shows and concerts. 



The City of West Fargo's Economic Development Director says that any plans they have for the area are in the very beginning stages and that any land purchasing is being done through the developer Sheyenne Plaza LLC.
However, Matthew Marshall also says that at this time the City of West Fargo has not approved any project.

Epic Management, Sheyenne Plaza – Paid Post by Epic Management From Forum Content Studios
































 

























Skip to content





A new standard of living






Undoubtedly when you search for a new home, preferences have to be prioritized. Some choose location over space, while others pick a spacious layout over a charming neighborhood. The relatively new, community-focused Epic Management refuses to make their residents choose. Instead, this property management team creates lifestyle-focused buildings to empower communities.
“With any of our buildings we are focused on increasing the community’s shared quality of life,” says McKenzy Olson, marketing and public relations director at Epic Management and FiveStone Development.
Olson explains the innovative approach to creating these new, one-of-a-kind spaces through a partnership between longtime friends and business associates. FiveStone Development –the development arm of the company– works with municipalities to renovate downtown areas breathing new life into communities. Epic Management directs their attention in creating comfortable, affordable yet luxurious homes in FiveStone’s signature mixed-use projects.
“Our buildings are lifestyle-focused first so we really think about the type of things our residents will need when designing an apartment building,” she says. “The mixed-use buildings allow us to partner with other businesses so we can provide necessary services to our residents.”
Buildings like Sheyenne Plaza blend residential, commercial and cultural services to create a richer and more convenient way of life. Based on their past success of both McKinley Plaza and Boulevard Square, Sheyenne Plaza was created as a private-public partnership between the City of West Fargo and Sheyenne Plaza, LLC. The main goal was to revitalize the 400 block of Sheyenne Street and downtown West Fargo. The architect, EAPC, and the construction company, Gehrtz Construction Services, also provided expertise and guidance as the project progresses. The result: building and designing the unique,  $12 million, 124,000-square-foot Sheyenne Plaza complex.







							Sheyenne Plaza has become a catalyst, designing a new way to live.						









Convenient, urban lifestyle
“This partnership with the city will create a new standard in the West Fargo downtown area,” Olson says. “Sheyenne Plaza has become a catalyst, designing a new way to live.”
With few of these multi-use buildings in the area, both longtime locals and newcomers are seizing the opportunity to choose this new affordable and comfortable lifestyle.
“We do try to make our apartments feel more like home – whether that’s in the materials that we use to create the apartments, the leasing options we provide or the additional amenities added to satisfy the diversity of our residents,” Olson says.











Work and play
Residents who live in the new building at 444 Sheyenne Street will have a hard time choosing between a relaxing night in or a fun get-together with friends. A prominent community organization – the VFW (Veterans of Foreign Wars) – will be headquartered on the first floor of Sheyenne Plaza, creating a popular meeting place.
“With this building you really do live, work and play in the same area,” Olson says.
Sheyenne Plaza features well-thought-out open floor plans. New residents can choose from 1 to 3 bedrooms ranging from 900 to 1,600 square feet. The 2 and 3 bedroom apartments each feature two stories giving it a more condo-like feel than an apartment. Monthly rent also ranges in price from  $900 to $1,600.
With high-end features as standard offerings, all kitchens in the new building have quartz countertops and movable butcher block islands. Polished concrete floors throughout the entire apartments finish off the look and create a clean and modern feel. All apartments also include underground parking, washer and dryer in unit and central air conditioning.








Oasis of comfort
Below the building the underground parking includes a car wash so residents can take care of their vehicles on-site. It’s easy to maintain an active lifestyle with the fully-equipped workout center and a secure bike rack located inside the building. Additional peace of mind comes from extensive security features at all entrances.











“At Sheyenne, the concept of ‘home’ is more than just four walls,” Olson says. “It turns into the people and places around you.”
Epic Management is excited to show their dedication to developing and creating a comfortable and upscale lifestyle for the West Fargo Community.
“A lifestyle isn’t just where someone sees themselves for a week, a month, or even a year it’s where someone sees themselves for a lifetime,” Olson says.
Sheyenne Plaza opens officially on December 1. Epic Management is already entering into Phase II of revitalizing downtown West Fargo. A similar concept to Sheyenne, Pioneer Plaza will be lifestyle-focused with mixed-use living above retail and commercial spaces.
Although there are still apartments available, only one commercial space remains in Sheyenne Plaza. Residents of Sheyenne Plaza will live next door to Ohnstad Twichell, Moore Engineering, and the aforementioned VFW.

Your Guide to Apartments in West Fargo

Relax, Smile, and Laugh - because finding West Fargo apartments for rent has never been easier.  Hi, I’m Trey, your Official West Fargo apartment living guide. I’ve helped hundreds of residents find West Fargo apartments for rent and I’m looking forward to helping you too! As your West Fargo apartment resource I want to make your apartment shopping experience stress-free by showcasing the most apartments in West Fargo, ND and providing you with accurate information on each one, updated every single day. So I invite you to explore West Fargo apartments below...But Apartment Home Living is about much more than helping you find the right place. It’s also about helping you love your apartment life. Let’s face it, apartment living is AWESOME! The freedom of not living on your parent’s couch or being locked into a 30 year home loan allows for so much extra time having fun, taking adventures and moving when you get that dream job offer in Paris. Living in West Fargo apartments only adds to all that “awesomeness.” Attractions, excellent night-life, shopping and dining are found in every nook and cranny of West Fargo. Find a little adventure with your plethora of apartment-style spare time by finding virtually any type of mischief to match your desires within a few miles from the doorstep of your West Fargo apartment. Not only that, but West Fargo rentals are so massively comfortable and rich with amenities themselves that your friends may be begging you to have them over for movie night, watch the game or to have a little R & R at the pool.  Or heck...if you have a few days off and are feeling really ambitious, why not take advantage of that apartment living freedom and ROAD TRIP to the lake or the coast? It’s not like you have to get back in time for a second job to pay your mortgage. Right? Living in West Fargo apartments helps you maximize your fun while being really efficient on your time and your cash flow.Speaking of cash flow. Because you’re saving money renting an apartment in West Fargo, you’re freeing up some extra spending money to hit up the mall for that new pair of shoes you’ve been drooling over or that superb surround-sound system to give movie night that true theatrical experience. (Remember to be neighbor considerate!) Or...put that extra time and money into decorating your place the coolest way possible! Consider yourself an artist and your apartment a blank canvas and go to town. By the way, Trey posters are available for just $19.95. Proceeds might go to a good cause. Wink, wink. Nudge, nudge.All the benefits of apartment living let you live how you want to live, play how you want to play and do what you truly want to do. So what are you waiting for? Take it from me, your lifestyle in West Fargo apartments will rock the house...er...apartment, so I invite you to explore West Fargo apartment living by finding your new home in one of the many awesome West Fargo apartments for rent and begin the adventure of the rest of your life!

Your Guide to Apartments in West Fargo

Relax, Smile, and Laugh - because finding West Fargo apartments for rent has never been easier.  Hi, I’m Trey, your Official West Fargo apartment living guide. I’ve helped hundreds of residents find West Fargo apartments for rent and I’m looking forward to helping you too! As your West Fargo apartment resource I want to make your apartment shopping experience stress-free by showcasing the most apartments in West Fargo, ND and providing you with accurate information on each one, updated every single day. So I invite you to explore West Fargo apartments below...But Apartment Home Living is about much more than helping you find the right place. It’s also about helping you love your apartment life. Let’s face it, apartment living is AWESOME! The freedom of not living on your parent’s couch or being locked into a 30 year home loan allows for so much extra time having fun, taking adventures and moving when you get that dream job offer in Paris. Living in West Fargo apartments only adds to all that “awesomeness.” Attractions, excellent night-life, shopping and dining are found in every nook and cranny of West Fargo. Find a little adventure with your plethora of apartment-style spare time by finding virtually any type of mischief to match your desires within a few miles from the doorstep of your West Fargo apartment. Not only that, but West Fargo rentals are so massively comfortable and rich with amenities themselves that your friends may be begging you to have them over for movie night, watch the game or to have a little R & R at the pool.  Or heck...if you have a few days off and are feeling really ambitious, why not take advantage of that apartment living freedom and ROAD TRIP to the lake or the coast? It’s not like you have to get back in time for a second job to pay your mortgage. Right? Living in West Fargo apartments helps you maximize your fun while being really efficient on your time and your cash flow.Speaking of cash flow. Because you’re saving money renting an apartment in West Fargo, you’re freeing up some extra spending money to hit up the mall for that new pair of shoes you’ve been drooling over or that superb surround-sound system to give movie night that true theatrical experience. (Remember to be neighbor considerate!) Or...put that extra time and money into decorating your place the coolest way possible! Consider yourself an artist and your apartment a blank canvas and go to town. By the way, Trey posters are available for just $19.95. Proceeds might go to a good cause. Wink, wink. Nudge, nudge.All the benefits of apartment living let you live how you want to live, play how you want to play and do what you truly want to do. So what are you waiting for? Take it from me, your lifestyle in West Fargo apartments will rock the house...er...apartment, so I invite you to explore West Fargo apartment living by finding your new home in one of the many awesome West Fargo apartments for rent and begin the adventure of the rest of your life!

Or heck...if you have a few days off and are feeling really ambitious, why not take advantage of that apartment living freedom and ROAD TRIP to the lake or the coast? It’s not like you have to get back in time for a second job to pay your mortgage. Right? Living in West Fargo apartments helps you maximize your fun while being really efficient on your time and your cash flow.Speaking of cash flow. Because you’re saving money renting an apartment in West Fargo, you’re freeing up some extra spending money to hit up the mall for that new pair of shoes you’ve been drooling over or that superb surround-sound system to give movie night that true theatrical experience. (Remember to be neighbor considerate!) Or...put that extra time and money into decorating your place the coolest way possible! Consider yourself an artist and your apartment a blank canvas and go to town. By the way, Trey posters are available for just $19.95. Proceeds might go to a good cause. Wink, wink. Nudge, nudge.All the benefits of apartment living let you live how you want to live, play how you want to play and do what you truly want to do. So what are you waiting for?
