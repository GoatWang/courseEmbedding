The Fund is a closed-end investment product. Common shares of the Fund are only available for purchase/sale on the NYSE at the current market price. An investment in the Fund is not a deposit of a bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor's shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted. All Investments, domestic and foreign, involve risks including the risk of possible loss of principal. The market value of a fund's portfolio may decline as a result of a number of factors, including adverse economic and market conditions, prospects of stocks in the portfolio, changing interest rates, and real or perceived adverse competitive industry conditions. In addition, the Fund invests in restricted securities and other investments that may be illiquid, which hold the risk that the securities will not be able to be sold at the time desired by the Fund. The Fund is classified as "non-diversified" under the 1940 Act. A non-diversified fund has the ability to invest more of its assets in securities of a single issuer than if it were classified as a "diversified" fund, which may increase volatility.  Trading in Swiss equities involves certain risks and special considerations not usually associated with investing in securities of established U.S. companies, including risks related to the nature of the market for Swiss equities, including the risk that the Swiss equities markets may be affected by market developments in different ways than U.S. securities markets and may be more volatile than U.S. securities markets; political and economic risks with respect to Switzerland, including the possible imposition of, or changes in, currency exchange laws or other Swiss laws or restrictions applicable to investments in Swiss equities; and fluctuations in the rate of exchange between currencies and costs associated with currency conversion. The Swiss securities markets have substantially less trading volume than the U.S. securities markets. Additionally, the capitalization of the Swiss securities markets is highly concentrated. Securities of some companies located in Switzerland will be less liquid and more volatile than securities of comparable U.S. companies. This combination of lower volume and greater concentration in the Swiss securities markets may create a risk of greater price volatility than in the U.S. securities markets.  The market price of common shares of the Fund will be based on factors such as the supply and demand for common shares in the market and general market, economic, political or regulatory conditions. Whether shareholders will realize gains or losses upon the sale of common shares of the Fund will depend on the market price of common shares at the time of the sale, not on the Fund’s net asset value. The market price may be lower or higher than the Fund’s net asset value. Shares of closed-end funds frequently trade at a discount or premium to their net asset value. Schroder Investment Management North America Inc. ("SIMNA Inc.") is an investment adviser registered with the U.S. SEC. It provides asset management products and services to clients in the U.S. and Canada including Schroder Series Trust and Schroder Global Series Trust, investment companies registered with the SEC (the "Schroder Funds").

Outlooks 2017: Global convertible bonds
With the potential for equity market volatility and rising interest rates, 2017 could be a year for convertible bonds to prove their worth.
30/11/2016





Dr. Martin Kuehle
Investment Director, Convertible Bonds






















Convertible bonds offer a potentially attractive combination of low duration and long equity participation
Sudden market setbacks could be triggered by negative shifts in sentiment, swings in market liquidity or unanticipated shocks in fundamental economic data
Investors are so used to low and negative interest rates that they will be in for a surprise when rates turn
Convertible bonds with their in-built stabilisers could be an ideal asset class for these markets

Most investors look at the world through the rear view mirror. Those looking back at 2016 will see a surprising lack of volatility. Global equity markets calmly shrugged off both Brexit and the election of Donald Trump as the new US president. At the same time, rates have remained historically low and the negative rates for government bonds in Germany, Japan, and Switzerland were regularly in the headlines.
Looking ahead, this will change. Volatility can and will come back to equity markets, but it will come back at an unexpected point in time and from an unexpected direction. In risk management there is the idiom of “known unknowns” and “unknown unknowns”, a term going back to Nassim Taleb (and before that, the former US Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld) and his work on so-called “black swan” events).
Elections, rate rises by central banks, or financial rescue packages for European states are known or at least expected events for 2017, even if we do not know the outcome or the market reaction yet. For some of these events markets are prepared. The market reaction to a potential Federal Reserve rate hike in December this year will (hopefully) be different to the one last year. For all other unknown unknowns, the market outlook suggests to us that the downside protection offered convertible bonds will be valuable in 2017.
Investors have short memories
It is important to remember that interest rates can go up as well as down. This does not have to be a general paradigm shift towards widespread rising rates, but we see that interest rates can move upwards suddenly and surprisingly strongly. When that happens, traditional government and corporate bonds face losses. The potential losses on the bond market are higher for bonds with higher maturities. This risk is expressed as duration risk.
Company treasurers have taken the opportunity to refinance and leverage up with the environment of low coupon payments. Overall, fixed income indices show a clear trend. Duration risk is significantly higher for conventional bonds compared to convertible bonds – and this risk position has drastically increased over recent years.

Why are convertibles so insensitive to rates?
First of all, a lot of convertibles are issued with a maturity of just five years. More importantly, they come with a conversion feature. Investors have the right to convert the bonds into stocks. This brings equity upside participation to the asset class. But the hidden gem in this conversion is the put on the bond. A true conversion not only includes receiving equity, it also includes getting rid of the bond.
As a long-running option right, we do not have to exercise this conversion right. As soon as the structure of the convertible moves closer to conversion price and builds up equity exposure, the interest rate part becomes increasingly unimportant.

To verify the practicalities of the structure, we need to go back in time to find longer periods of rising interest rates. There have been five periods with negative performance of government bonds - and hence rising rates - in the last few decades. These periods are different in length as well as in impact, but they have one characteristic in common: convertible bonds performed very well each time.

In our view, 2017 will be a year where protection becomes an important feature for our investors’ asset allocation. At the same time, it continues to make sense to build up smart equity exposure. If we are right, we will see supportive equity markets driven by a general shift from expansive monetary to expansive fiscal politics. In this environment well-structured convertible bond strategies have been shown to participate in a significant 75% to 80% of the equity upside.
Comparing convertible bonds to other asset classes, the advantages are compelling: low duration risk, strong stockmarket participation on the way up and hence an in-built inflation adjustment, effective protection against short-term set-backs, and to top it all, an under-researched and overlooked niche asset which comes at attractive valuations.
