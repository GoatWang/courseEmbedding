Introductory Note 
 
This Amendment No. 1 to Schedule 13D is filed by and on behalf
of each of the Reporting Persons to amend and supplement the Schedule 13D related to the Class A common stock, $0.01 par value
per share of TerraForm Power, Inc. (the “Issuer”), previously filed by the Reporting Persons with the SEC on August
25, 2016 (the “Schedule 13D”). Each capitalized term used and not defined herein shall have the meaning assigned to
such term in the Schedule 13D. Except as provided herein, each Item of the Schedule 13D remains unchanged.
  


Item 4.
Purpose of Transaction

 
Item 4 of the Schedule 13D
is hereby amended and supplemented to add the following:
 
An affiliate of the Reporting Persons is evaluating various
potential transactions with one or both of the Issuer and SunEdison, the controlling stockholder of the Issuer, which transaction
could result in an affiliate of the Reporting Persons controlling or otherwise participating in the management and/or operations
of the Issuer. Such affiliate may make a non-binding proposal with regard to any such transaction as part of the process currently
being overseen by SunEdison, the Issuer, and their respective advisors to explore strategic alternatives involving the Issuer and/or
SunEdison’s stake in the Issuer. No final decision has been made with respect to such a proposal or the possible terms or
conditions thereof, and there can be no assurance that any transaction will occur. The foregoing is subject to change at any time,
and there can be no assurance that any affiliate of the Reporting Persons will take any of the actions set forth above.
 
Except as set forth above, none of the Reporting Persons currently
has any plans or proposals that relate to or would result in any of the actions specified in clause (a) through (j) of Item 4 of
Schedule 13D. The Reporting Persons and their affiliates expect to continue to evaluate their respective investments in the Issuer
on a continuing basis, and in connection with such evaluation the Reporting Persons and/or their affiliates may in the future upon
due consideration of all relevant factors formulate other purposes, plans or proposals regarding the Issuer or the Common Shares,
or take any other actions that could involve one or more of the types of transactions or have one or more of the results described
in paragraphs (a) through (j) of Item 4 of Schedule 13D.
