          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

BBB Accreditation





                BBB Accredited Since 09/11/2007
            

                BBB has determined that EnLink Midstream, LLC meets Standards of BBB Accreditation, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            

                BBB accreditation does not mean that the business's products or services have been evaluated or endorsed by BBB, or that BBB has made a determination as to the business's product quality or competency in performing services.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB: 
1. meet all applicable standards within this Code of Business Practices

                            2. cooperate with BBB's activities and efforts to promote voluntary self- regulation within the business' industry

                    1. Follow federal, state/provincial and local advertising laws.

4. Cooperate with BBB self-regulatory programs for the resolution of advertising disputes.
5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

                    6. Avoid misleading customers by creating the false impression of sponsorship, endorsement, popularity, trustworthiness, product quality or business size through the misuse of logos, trustmarks, pictures, testimonials, or other means

            Address marketplace disputes quickly, professionally, and in good faith.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Promptly respond to all complaints forwarded by BBB by: 
1. Resolving the complaint directly with the complainant and notifying BBB, or

                            2. Providing BBB with a response that BBB determines: 

                                    1. is professional,
                                
2. addresses all of the issues raised by the complainant,

                    2. Make a good faith effort to resolve disputes, which includes mediation if requested by BBB. Other dispute resolution options, including arbitration, may be recommended by BBB when other efforts to resolve a dispute have failed. BBB may consider a business' willingness to participate in recommended dispute resolution options in determining compliance with these standards.
                

                    3. Comply with any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process.
                

                    4. Cooperate with BBB in efforts to eliminate the underlying cause of patterns of customer complaints that are identified by BBB.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

EnLink Midstream - Connecting Energy to Life - Strong. Innovative. Growing.


















































ENLK (MLP)


ENLC (GP)







Investors






Companies keep finding ways to unlock resources. We keep finding ways to move them.






In March 2014, Crosstex Energy and Devon Energy combined substantially all of Devon’s U.S. midstream assets with Crosstex’s assets to create EnLink Midstream Partners, LP, and EnLink Midstream, LLC, collectively “EnLink Midstream.” Together, we have formed one of the largest midstream businesses in the industry. Our increased scale and diversification allows us to capitalize on the significant opportunities in the midstream industry, and with Devon’s strong upstream sponsorship, EnLink Midstream is well positioned for stable long-term growth.
There are two ways to invest in EnLink Midstream: through the purchase of units in EnLink Midstream Partners, LP (NYSE: ENLK), a master limited partnership (MLP), or the purchase of shares in EnLink Midstream, LLC (NYSE: ENLC), the general partner. This business model provides institutions that are unable to make direct MLP investments with a way to participate in EnLink’s growth through common share ownership of the general partner.

EnLink Midstream Signs Definitive Agreement to Acquire Coronado Midstream


02/02/2015

Download this Press Release (PDF 338 KB)

 DALLAS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
The EnLink Midstream companies, EnLink Midstream Partners, LP
(NYSE:ENLK) (the Partnership) and EnLink Midstream, LLC (NYSE:ENLC) (the
General Partner) (together “EnLink”), today announced that the
Partnership signed a definitive agreement to acquire Coronado Midstream
Holdings LLC (“Coronado”), which owns natural gas gathering and
processing facilities in the Permian Basin, for approximately $600
million, subject to certain adjustments.


Coronado operates three cryogenic gas processing plants and a gas
gathering system in the North Midland Basin including approximately 270
miles of gathering pipelines, 175 million cubic feet per day (MMcf/d) of
processing capacity and 35,000 horsepower of compression. Construction
of an additional 100 MMcf/d of processing capacity and gathering system
expansions of the Coronado system are currently underway. Coronado's key
assets have been constructed within the past five years and the system
has current inlet volumes of approximately 100 MMcf/d. EnLink plans to
connect the Coronado system with its Bearkat system to create a
multi-county rich gas gathering and processing system to create
optimization opportunities for its customers and its product marketing
services.


The owners of Coronado will receive $240 million in cash, $180 million
of Partnership common units and $180 million of a new class of
Partnership common units, subject to certain adjustments. The
Partnership will be able to pay distributions on the new class of
Partnership common units in cash or in additional common units of such
new class, at the Partnership’s election. The new class of Partnership
common units will be entitled to receive distributions equal to those
paid on the Partnership common units currently outstanding. After five
quarters of distributions have been paid following the closing of the
transaction, or earlier at the Partnership’s election, the new class of
common units will convert into the same class of common units that are
currently outstanding.


The Coronado system is underpinned by long-term contracts, which include
the dedication of production from over 190,000 acres. Coronado’s key
producer customers include Reliance Energy, Inc. (Reliance), Diamondback
Energy, Inc. (Diamondback), and RSP Permian, Inc. (RSP Permian).
Reliance is currently the largest owner of Coronado, with affiliates of
both Diamondback and RSP Permian owning the remainder of Coronado.


“This transaction builds on EnLink’s growing midstream platform in West
Texas,” said
Barry E. Davis
, EnLink President and Chief Executive
Officer. “The Coronado assets are located in the core of the North
Midland Basin and are supported by the region’s most focused and active
producers. By combining Coronado with our recent LPC acquisition and our
existing footprint, we have the opportunity to create tremendous value
for our producer customers by linking our gas gathering, processing and
crude oil logistics operations to provide a full-service midstream
solution.”


“In just over four months, we have announced approximately $1 billion of
acquisitions, which is consistent with our growth strategy to expand our
platform in key producing areas,” Davis said. “EnLink is a strong
vehicle for sustainable growth, due in large part to our current
financial position, which allows us to effectively expand in times like
these.”


Economics in the North Midland Basin are among the most favorable of all
oil-producing regions in the United States. The region has seen a rapid
transition to horizontal drilling, with producers targeting the Lower
Spraberry, Wolfcamp B, and Wolfcamp D zones among other prospective
intervals. Recent well results from Coronado’s producer customers, as
well as other producers, indicate outstanding resource potential in the
area.


“We have assembled a strong acreage position in the North Midland Basin
that will continue to serve as a key driver of production growth for
many years,” said
Travis D. Stice
, Chief Executive Officer of
Diamondback and Viper Energy Partners. “We are excited about the
development potential for multiple horizontal targets within the area
that has and will continue to serve the Coronado system in the future.
We have been involved with Coronado since its formation and grown
together as business partners. We look forward to working together with
its new owners to support each other’s growth aspirations.”


“Reliance has been focused on expanding and de-risking its acreage
around the Coronado system since 2007,” said
Gary D. McKinney
, President
of Reliance. “We believe we are located in some of the best areas of the
Midland basin and we’re excited about our recent horizontal well results
in the region.”


“RSP Permian has built a premier acreage position in the Northern
Midland Basin that will continue to serve as a cornerstone to our strong
production growth and attractive rates of return,” said
Steve Gray
,
Chief Executive Officer of RSP Permian. “We have relied on Coronado
throughout our development and look forward to working with its new
owners in the future.”


EnLink expects the acquisition of Coronado to be neutral to
distributable cash flow per unit at both the Partnership and the General
Partner in the near-term given the current market environment
and taking into consideration the producers’ current drilling plans.
Over the next few years, EnLink expects increased activity around
Coronado’s system will generate significant accretion in distributable
cash flow per unit. EnLink expects its total investment will be
approximately seven to eight times Coronado’s adjusted EBITDA with the
timing dependent on the recovery of commodity prices and an increase in
producer activity, taking into consideration expected additional capital
investments of $400 million to $600 million. This does not include
synergies with EnLink’s existing Permian assets and the potential for
expansion of the combined systems by securing new customers or
additional dedicated acreage.

update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of
new information, future events or otherwise.

New office reinforces company’s growth in and commitment to the Permian Basin 
DALLAS, July 13, 2016 — EnLink Midstream Partners, LP (NYSE: ENLK) moved into a new regional office this week in Midland, Texas, emphasizing the company’s commitment to the Midland and Odessa communities and the Permian Basin. EnLink now occupies the west wing of the Bank of America Tower at 303 W. Wall St., where the EnLink logo is displayed on the building’s exterior. The move consolidates EnLink’s natural gas, NGL, and crude oil services for the Permian Basin into one location, allowing for seamless and robust service for all customer needs. 

“EnLink is focused on being the premier midstream company in our industry, and this move is just another step in reinforcing our commitment to customers throughout the Permian Basin,” said Barry E. Davis, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer of EnLink Midstream. “The Permian is a significant core growth area for EnLink; in fact, we have invested over $1.1 billion in the Permian over the last 18 months.”
EnLink’s Permian operations consist of natural gas gathering and processing – including approximately 450 million cubic feet per day of processing capacity – and crude oil gathering, transportation, stabilization, treating, and marketing services; the company has over 250 employees in the Permian. 
“EnLink has an experienced, local team that understands the unique needs of Permian producers,” Davis said. “We are committed to Midland. Our Permian employees work and live here, many with deep roots in the community. Like EnLink, Midland has grown significantly but has stayed true to its community values, and we’re thrilled to be a part of that.”
