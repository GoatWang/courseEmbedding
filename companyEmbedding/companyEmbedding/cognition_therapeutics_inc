NEW TARGETS

						Until very recently, the understanding and availability of drug targets in Alzheimer’s has been sparse and concentrated on acetylcholinesterase, NMDA receptors or insoluble amyloid plaque. Cognition Therapeutics has taken a new approach, using the new concept that soluble Abeta oligomers are the primary neurotoxic element causing neuronal degeneration and cognitive decline in Alzheimer’s disease and discovered a brand new drug target, the sigma-2/PGRMC1 receptor.
						
Learn More 



NEW DRUGS

The therapeutic standards of care for Alzheimer’s only treat the cognitive symptoms, do not modify disease progression and at best they are only modestly active, gradually losing their efficacy as the disease becomes more severe. Cognition Therapeutics has applied its innovative drug discovery platform and discovered first in-class small molecule inhibitors of Abeta oligomer binding to neurons that have the potential to modify disease progression in Alzheimer’s disease.

NEW HOPE

					Very recent clinical advances using Abeta monoclonal antibodies that interact with both soluble Abeta oligomers and insoluble fibrillar ABeta, have demonstrated a reduction in Abeta burden correlating with a slowing of cognitive decline in early Alzheimer’s patients and have renewed confidence in the Abeta approach. Cognition Therapeutics has a first candidate in the clinic and has back-up candidates moving through its late preclinical pipeline.

NEW DRUGS
Cognition Therapeutics has discovered first in-class small molecule inhibitors of Abeta oligomer binding to neurons that have the potential to modify disease progression in Alzheimer’s disease.







The therapeutic standard of care for Alzheimer’s has not changed for over 12 years and currently there are effectively only 4 therapies approved for treatment of Alzheimer’s disease. These only treat the cognitive symptoms, do not modify disease progression and at best they are only modestly active, gradually losing their efficacy as the disease becomes more severe. Cognition Therapeutics has applied its innovative drug discovery platform and discovered first in-class small molecule inhibitors of Abeta oligomer binding to neurons that have the potential to modify disease progression in Alzheimer’s disease.
Not only do these drug candidates restore functional competence to neuronal and synaptic processes but also they revive cognitive function in animal models of Abeta-induced cognitive impairment. Since Cognition Therapeutics’ drug discovery platform is optimized for combined drug target and candidate ligand discovery in neurotoxic proteinopathies it can be configured to model a number of other neurodegenerative disorders involving abnormal neuronal protein folding and aggregation. These include Parkinson’s, Lou Gehrig’s and Creutzfeldt-Jakob diseases, each of which represent areas of high unmet medical need.

Until very recently, the understanding and availability of drug targets in Alzheimer’s has been sparse and concentrated on acetylcholinesterase, NMDA receptors or insoluble amyloid plaque. Cognition Therapeutics has taken a new approach, using the new concept that soluble Abeta oligomers are the primary neurotoxic element causing neuronal degeneration and cognitive decline in Alzheimer’s disease and discovered a brand new drug target, the sigma-2/PGRMC1 receptor.
Central to this discovery is Cognition Therapeutics’ information-rich, biological screening platform, designed to mimic elements of brain neuronal circuitry critical to synaptic and neuronal viability. A key aspect of this platform is that it measures a regaining of neuronal function and this together with Cognition Therapeutics’ unique natural product chemistry platform, differentiates Cognition Therapeutics from its competitors. Their scientists have used these two proprietary platforms to characterize sigma-2/PGRMC1 as the only Abeta receptor so far discovered from which Abeta can be displaced pharmacologically.

Cognition Therapeutics Completes Oversubscribed $12 Million Series B Financing

Sep 08, 2015, 12:58 ET
		  		  								
						 from   Cognition Therapeutics Inc. 











 
















































 

 




















 


PITTSBURGH, Sept. 8, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Cognition Therapeutics Inc. (CogRx), a privately held pharmaceutical company focused on discovering and developing disease-modifying therapies for Alzheimer's and related neurodegenerative diseases, announced today that it has completed a Series B preferred stock financing totaling $12 million. Golden Seeds led the investment syndicate, which included, Bios Memory SPV1, Cowtown Angels, Scale Investors, Dolby Family Ventures, Maine Angels, as well as additional life sciences investors. Existing CogRx investors, including Ogden CAP, PLSG Accelerator Fund, Tech Coast Angels, ACE Fund, Ariel Southeast Angel Partners and M5Invest Partners also participated in the financing.
"This latest round of financing is indicative of the growing commitment we are seeing from investors to find new and effective treatments for Alzheimer's disease," said Dr. Hank Safferstein, Chief Executive Officer. "We are emboldened by the recent scientific validation of the soluble Abeta oligomer binding target and the promise that our small molecule Abeta oligomer displacement approach could significantly improve the lives of patients and their families."
CogRx will focus on advancing its first-in-class lead Alzheimer's program into Phase 1 clinical studies by the end of 2015. The Company's small molecule Abeta oligomer displacement drug has the potential to rapidly improve and possibly reverse the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease and to stop disease progression. In addition, the Company is using the funds to advance next generation compounds and unlock the potential of its platform for discovering drugs for other protein misfolding nervous system diseases.  
CogRx also announced two additions to its Medical Advisory Board: Dr. Steven T. DeKosky, MD, Aerts-Cosper Professor of Alzheimer's Research, Deputy Director, McKnight Brain Institute, and Dr. Lon S. Schneider, MD, Professor of Psychiatry, Neurology, and Gerontology, Keck School of Medicine of USC. These experts will bring their extensive experience in Alzheimer's research to help guide the development of CogRx's clinical trial program. 
"I am honored to be a part of this rapidly unfolding and exciting story," said Dr. Steven DeKosky.  "The field has been searching for truly novel therapeutic approaches to treating and preventing Alzheimer's disease. CogRx's oligomer antagonist drug candidate is the first opportunity we have to test this modified amyloid hypothesis, which has been recently strengthened by the public disclosures from two large biopharmaceutical companies. I believe the CogRx drug candidate has the potential to not only improve cognitive function but to affect the course of disease through synaptic protection."  
Alzheimer's is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States and has an economic burden of $214 billion annually. By 2050 the number of people 65 and older with Alzheimer's is expected to nearly triple to a projected 13.8 million barring the development of medical breakthroughs to prevent slow or stop the disease.1 These facts and figures, combined with the lack of any approved drugs that can slow or halt disease progression, make Alzheimer's disease one of the most significant unmet medical needs of the present decade. Small molecule drugs that can significantly block and disrupt the binding and pathogenic signaling of the toxic forms of Abeta protein have the potential to dramatically improve the quality of life for Alzheimer's patients and their caregivers.   
About CogRx's Small Molecule Soluble Abeta Receptor Antagonist ProgramCogRx has discovered small molecule drug candidates that it believes can efficiently displace toxic beta-amyloid oligomers bound to receptor proteins on brain cells at synapses. CogRx drug candidates have been shown to reverse the memory loss seen in genetically engineered transgenic mice expressing human Alzheimer's genes after only one month of treatment and sustain this memory improvement long term.2 
About CogRx Cognition Therapeutics is a privately held Pittsburgh-based pharmaceutical company using disease-relevant screening and novel chemistry platform approaches to produce a pipeline of new small molecule drug candidates for protein misfolding diseases of the nervous system. CogRx's leading clinical candidate-stage program is a highly brain-penetrant, orally bioavailable small molecule receptor antagonist that blocks memory deficits in Alzheimer's disease models.

PITTSBURGH, Dec. 13, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Cognition Therapeutics, Inc., a clinical stage neuroscience company focused on the development of innovative therapeutics for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and other neurocognitive disorders, today announced the initiation of U.S. clinical testing of CT1812, its proprietary first-in-class, orally available small molecule therapeutic being developed for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.  The first US patient was dosed under Cognition's recently submitted US IND in a drug-drug interaction study, which will support Cognition's ongoing clinical testing of CT1812 in patients with Alzheimer's disease in Australia.








"The initiation of US clinical testing of CT 1812 represents an important milestone for Cognition as we expand our understanding of the molecule's potential for the treatment of individuals with Alzheimer's disease," said Kenneth I. Moch, President & CEO of Cognition. "CT1812's unique mechanism of action, coupled with its high bioavailability and significant penetration across the blood brain barrier, has the potential to differentiate the molecule from all other compounds currently under development in this important therapeutic area."
About CT1812 CT1812 is a proprietary first-in-class, orally available small molecule that displaces bound beta amyloid oligomers and inhibits binding of Aβ oligomers to the receptor complex. The molecule was designed by Cognition's scientific team, led by Susan Catalano, Ph.D., to target and displace the toxic beta amyloid oligomers that cause Alzheimer's disease. CT1812 has been shown in multiple Alzheimer's disease models to stop memory loss.
In Cognition's ongoing Study COG0102, patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease are being randomized to one of two doses of CT1812 (280mg patients or 560mg) or placebo, and dosed for 28 days to help evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic profile of CT1812. Cognition has previously conducted single and multiple ascending dose studies in 94 healthy volunteers, 74 of whom received CT1812. Study COG0102 is supported in part under Award Number RF1AG054176 from the National Institute on Aging of the National Institutes of Health.
About Cognition Therapeutics, Inc. Cognition Therapeutics (CogRx) is a privately held biopharmaceutical company whose disease-relevant screening and novel chemistry platforms have produced a pipeline of disease modifying small molecule drug candidates which are being developed to treat Alzheimer's disease and potentially other neurocognitive disorders.

Cognition Therapeutics, Inc. Key Developments

Cognition Therapeutics, Inc. Reports Drug-Drug Interaction Results for CT1812
Jul 19 17
Cognition Therapeutics, Inc. presented results of an open-label Phase 1 study of Cognition’s lead clinical candidate, CT1812. In this study, which was presented at the Alzheimer’s Association International Conference in London, no clinically significant drug-drug interactions were identified with CT1812, suggesting that CT1812 can be administered in current and future clinical trials with few medication exclusions. CT1812 is an orally available small molecule designed to displace the toxic oligomer form of the amyloid beta (Aß) protein and inhibit its binding to the sigma-2/PGRMC1 receptor complex. When bound to this receptor complex, Aß oligomers can disrupt synaptic activity, leading to the destruction of neuronal synapses, memory loss and learning deficits. To determine the potential drug-drug interaction associated with CT1812, the Phase 1 COG01013 study enrolled 14 healthy adults who received six consecutive daily oral doses of CT1812 before and following four probe drugs (dextromethorphan, midazolam, omeprazole and tolbutamide) that represent the activity of specific cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes. CYP450 is a family of isozymes that are responsible for the breakdown of many drugs, and influences on them can lead to drug-drug interactions and toxicities. No interactions between CT1812 and omeprazole or tolbutamide were observed in this study, and only weak interactions were measured with midazolam and dextromethorphan, suggesting the potential for clinically insignificant inhibition of CYP2D6 and induction of CYP3A4 enzymes by CT1812.
