The Inside Story

Jackie loved dragonfly jewelry. She loved one of her earlier pieces so much that she brought it with her on her honeymoon in Acapulco. Over the years, she made an effort to find ones just like it. Coco Chanel made very colorful and delicate renditions of what Jackie called "creature" pins.









Description








                        
	
	
    
    
	
			Buzz-worthy. Designed with articulated wings that actually move slightly, this stunning dragonfly brooch is a gorgeous way to accessorize. Pearlized enamel in shades of purple, light lavender, and green highlight the wings, while the tops of the wings--as well as the body and eyes--are accented with small, clear, round crystals. From the Jacqueline Kennedy Collection.

Important Details








End of an Era
For the past 10 years, we've had the honor & privilege of sharing Jacqueline Kennedy's story with you through the romance of her jewelry & accessories collection. From the start, we always knew that the pieces would be limited in availability & duration. Due to your amazing support & loyalty, we've enjoyed extending the timeline far beyond our original intentions. Now we feel it's time to bring this fabulous chapter to a close. We've rendered all the pieces in her collection that are currently available to us, and we'll continue to offer the line only as long as inventory exists.

 Beautiful and elegant
 I ordered this pin on the last easypay day, not because it's a Jackie Kennedy piece designed by Coco Chanel (much as I admire these ladies) but because I love dragonflies. I also have the Kirk's Folly Dragonflies in the Forest pin and love that one as well, but this one is very dainty and elegant, a little less 'blingy' (much as I hate that word). The blending of colors is masterful and the movement of the wings sets it apart from other pins. When wearing this pin, I really don't need any other jewelry save perhaps a small pair of gold earrings because I want the attention to be focused on the pin. However, sometimes I'll feel like extending the dragonfly motif and will also wear a tiny gold dragonfly charm on a gold chain. Either way, this is a wonderfully versatile pin and I can't imagine anyone being disappointed with this purchase.

 Subtle and very pretty
 I love the delicately muted enamel colors in this brooch. The clear crystals aren't too flashy at all. This piece of jewelry is a nice little detail to add to your outfit. The bit of movement to the wings makes the brooch unusual and fun.
 04-07-12
 Statement without bling
 Sometimes you don't want a lot of bling, but you want to make a subtle statement. As opposed to the other dragonfly pin, which i wear and really like, this is more subtle. The enameling is just the right touch. Lots of detail, so this does not look cheap, but just the right touch for a more casual outfit.
Lovely, large enough to be eye catching, and the moving wings also add to the piece's allure.
Get this one, you won't be sorry. Well done Coco, well done Camrose and Kross.
 01-22-12
 Perfect
 I had previously ordered the Joan Rivers mosaic dragon fly pins...and loved them. When I saw this one, I knew it would be beautiful, but the picture doesn't do it justice. There is nothing I can add to what others have written, but the pin is stunning, feminine, beautifully colored and just perfect. The JR pins are quite striking, but they are bigger, heavier and not at all dainty. This pin is very elegant and I highly recommend it.

 ELEGANT!
 Loved this pin. Purchase this as a Christmas gift for my daughter, who loves jewelry
that has quality and beauty, and this fits the bill 100%
 12-06-11
 Wonderful Pin
 I have been searching for a dragonfly pin for quite some time.. Well, I found it.. This pin is beautiful..Its just the right size and has a wonderful presence to it..I also discovered something that just a left handed person would notice..This pin was made by a left handed person..The stick goes from left to right . Thank You. Thank You Thank you!!!!.. You have to make me more pins!!!!!...
 10-18-11
 LOVELY!!!
 This is what a Dragonfly pin is all about. I love it. I love the way the wings move and give it dimension. My only wish is that it came in a broader variety of color. I know this is based on Jackie's pin, but something in reds or blues - the natural colors of dragonflies - would be wonderful.
Thank you QVC for bringing this charming pin to the rest of us!
 09-29-11
 stunning
 This is a stunning piece and worth every penny. Camrose & Kross have done an excellent job in recreating Jackie's jewelry.
 07-26-11
 Beauty
 I love this dragonfly pin! It is just the perfect size and color. Looks cute with casual clothes.
 06-27-11
 Elegant
 Oh so pretty and elegant, just as Jackie Kennedy was. The movable wings makes this a fun dragonfly to wear.
 06-24-11
 Exquisite Detail!
 I love nature inspired jewelry. This dragonfly is very special and the attention to detail is amazing! I'm hoping to see the JBK tree frog pin that has been in some of the photos shown during the Jacqueline Kennedy jewelry shows.
