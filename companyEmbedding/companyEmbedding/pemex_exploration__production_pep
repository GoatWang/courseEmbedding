Where applicable, a project is considered as such until the end of construction and ramp-up to full capacity (with the exception of mining projects, where the date of commissioning signifies the end of the project). Projects must have a:  a) Start date b) Estimate for completion c) Initial investment estimate  Data For state-owned projects, initial information about the start date and estimates for completion and investment are taken from original signed contracts, along with addendums and annexes. If original contracts cannot be obtained, information is taken from public documents, presentations, news articles from BNamericas archives, and external sources. In cases where contracts are subject to approval by legislators, the start date is the date of the law or legislative approval. In the case of private projects, information is taken from public sources, such as stock exchange filings, annual reports, company presentations, third party research and press releases. In judging the timing of investment decisions for private projects, great care was taken to differentiate between large projects receiving environmental approval and proceeding directly to construction, and smaller projects where the investment decision hinges on securing financing. Best care is taken to ensure that recorded data is correct at the time of entry and that each entry is backed with a relevant source. The greatest care possible was taken to ensure consistency of information in order make a like-for-like comparison in project costs. Insofar as the figures rely on disclosure by the organization or company responsible, the figures can be considered to be conservative in nature. No attempt was made to adjust figures for inflation during the course of research or for consideration of the time value of money. Validation In the case of state-owned projects, validation is carried out where possible with either a member of the consortium, EPC contractor, a relevant state agency or advisors to either party. Currency Projects costs are measured in US dollars. Where project costs are measured in a local currency, amounts are converted to US dollars at the date of the relevant announcement, signature or report.  Severity of deviation from original estimates The severity of deviation from original estimates is defined according to set criteria. Timing    Status Condition     Ahead of time 95% of original estimate or below (measured in months)   On time 95% to 105% of original estimate   Minor changes 105% to 120% of original estimate   Medium changes 120% to 160% of original estimate   Major changes Over 160% of original estimate    Budget    Status Condition     Ahead of budget 95% of original budget estimate or below   To budget 95% to 105% of original budget estimate   Minor changes 105% to 120% of original budget estimate   Medium changes 120% to 140% of original budget estimate   Major changes Over 140% of original budget estimate    Changes in Scope Changes in scope beyond the start date are not accounted for. Language definitions Where guidance is non-specific as to dates for completion, the following is used. Project to be completed by 2018 = December 31, 2017 Project to be completed in 2018 = December 31, 2018

Contenido de la páginaWe are the most important company in Mexico and one of the largest in Latin America, and our success is reflected in our dedication to the future of Mexico. As the largest tax contributor to the Mexican government, the income we generate helps support all three levels of government: federal, state and municipal. We directly and indirectly participate in the economic and social development of our country. Our operations are geographically dispersed throughout Mexico, and we have presence in almost every state.Through its long history, Pemex has become one of the few fully integrated oil companies, developing our entire productive chain: exploration, production, industrial processing/refining, logistics and marketing.We carry out extensive exploration and extraction projects every year, generating approximately 2.5 million barrels of oil daily and more than 6 million of cubic feet of natural gas. We have 6 refineries, 8 petrochemical complexes and 9 gas processing complexes, where we produce multiple refined products in order to attend to our customer’s needs.Logistically, we have 83 land and maritime terminals, as well as oil and gas pipelines, maritime vessels, and varying fleets of ground transportation in order to supply over 10,000 service stations throughout the country.Our business involves a complex myriad of installations and advanced technology, yet the core of the company is its experienced and trained personnel. Pemex is its employees. We recognize the need to protect and invest in our most precious resource that is why we seek to continuously be a socially responsible company that works under stringent safety, job, health and environmental protection standards.As well, the presence of our operations in Mexico is absolute. We understand that our business plays a significant role in the lives of many communities in our country. We actively participate in protecting and contributing to the communities where we operate by making significant donations to public works, environmental protection and community building projects with the goal of improving health and welfare.We look to continuously position ourselves as a competitive oil company worldwide. Our business is fully integrated, and so is our vision for the future of our company and the future of Mexico. We recognize that our potential is intimately linked with that of our people, our industry and our country.

				 Exploration & Production ( E&P) – Gustavo Hernandez, Director General – Mexico			


 08.08.2014  /  Energyboardroom



Pemexexplorationdevelopmentproduction 



The recently appointed Director General for E&P explains the rationale behind Pemex’s Round Zero submission and how the state champion is preparing to counter a predicted human capital flight tendency in certain niche categories such as geoscience. He also passes judgement on the NOC’s ongoing restructuring.
 
You were initially made acting director in February. Then, in June, you were appointed permanent director for PEP. What have been your main focus and priorities so far during this short tenure?
Over those six months, the main focus has been about preparing Pemex for the challenges of reform. Having historically been the sole operator in Mexico by constitutional mandate, we now need to re-establish the company as a productive enterprise that is able to compete in a free market context. We therefore need to communicate this properly to the workers so as to gain broad-base acceptance for the internal restructuring and overhaul that must take place. We also need to clearly understand our revised role in this new perspective. I have been working very hard in preparing our people and compiling the requisite information that PEP has been called upon to submit to the new authorities and regulatory apparatus.
As Pemex embarks on this challenging and complex transition from a state monopoly to productive entity, how are you going to ensure that disruption to E&P activities is minimized and that productivity can be maintained at the 2.5 million b/d mark?
When the energy reform bill was signed off by the president, we embarked upon one of the more interesting periods in Pemex E&P’s history, because, for the first time ever, we had to undertake a thorough evaluation of what we were going to do with our oil and gas assets. This process of analyzing which exploration areas and production fields that we would like to retain represented the first step towards building the new Pemex and transforming our way of thinking. As we have never before needed to fight for acreage, this involved a paradigm shift in mindset. Round zero represents, without doubt, one of the most important decisions in entire lifespan of Pemex.
One structural shift that we were rapidly exposed to was centralization of Pemex’s procurement. Frankly we were a little surprised to be the first division of the company to be subjected to these changes because the synergies to be gained from centrally procured jack-ups and drill bits that are only used in upstream are much more limited than the value-additions to be realized from having single procurer of turbines and valves which are commonly used across the whole value chain. When the changeover came it was a pretty sharp shock.  Nevertheless we handled this smoothly by gaining acceptance on the part of PEP’s personnel and are very much looking forward to the tangible benefits to be accrued from having a single ‘shop window’ for all contractors. Adaptation is a trademark of this industry and that is how we ensure a seamless transition. There is centralized procurement in Shell and Exxon Mobil, but not in Statoil and Ecopetrol. Pemex has to identify the approach best suited to its unique situation and that is exactly what is happening.
Another potentially disruptive by-product of the reform that we are managing positively concerns the possible flight of human capital. Pemex is aware that its recruitment efforts have to be firmly focused on sourcing and retaining PEP personnel in the initial stages because there is going to be a high-risk of losinggeo-scientists, reservoir engineers, geophysicists and geologists who will be in great demand by the new enterprises entering the market and requiring local talent. We are already restructuring our pay-scales to bring them in line with market salaries and have initiatives in place to counter any flight tendency.
Pemex’s internal consolidation plans have been devised to link in harmoniously with the various deadlines of the energy reform and the pace of change has been set at a rhythm whereby we can simultaneously deliver on our production targets. All in all, changes are being enacted in a remarkably stable and smooth manner. Pemex sees a very bright future ahead in which it will be able to concentrate on its core task of being an operator unburdened by having to worry about energy security or providing the bulk of state income.
Can you please explain the rationale behind the selection of fields that you have put forward to SENER in your Round Zero request? And how will this render Pemex stronger, more efficient and more competitive?
The constitution placed the first requirement on Pemex, affording us only 90 days to nominate those fields and exploration areas that we feel we have capacity to operate alone or via assignations. Pemex will remain the only entity to possess assignation titles whereas all other operators will be participating as contractors. By mid-March we had successfully conducted a full analysis of the potential of every field and had held meetings with SENER and the CNH to share this information and present our first draft. SENER’s initial feedback was that we were asking for too much so we resolved to focus on those strategic areas that we felt absolutely had to be granted. Our proposal was submitted to Pemex’s board of directors which referred it to its specialist delegate committee on investments for review. Subsequently our request was formally presented to SENER which has 180 days to unveil their decision.
We have committed to producing 2.5 million b/d. This is an obligation that we have with HACIENDA to provide the taxation income from oil and gas production so naturally we are demanding those assets that will allow us to maintain those levels of production without interruption. According to he constitution, Pemex has the right to retain these productive areas such as  Chicontepec which accounts for roughly 60,000 barrels and Poza Rica-Altamira which accounts for approximately 80,000 barrels. Then, when we were reviewing what else to request, we also took a strategic approach grounded upon the assertion that we intend to grow as an E&P company. The only way this can happen is by retaining both our existing reserves and a variety of new areas to explore.
What do you say to critics who say that Pemex is requesting too much? There is of course a precedent with Petrobras which made a very large request in their equivalent of Round Zero and the ended up giving up approximately 80 percent of their assets within two years.
There is a logical rational behind everything that we have requested. Firstly, we intend to keep those core assets where we know for sure that there are hydrocarbon reserves and which have been in production phase for a while such as Cantarell, Ku-Maloob-Zaap and Chicontepec which is understood to constitute 38 percent of the national reserve base.
Secondly, we are requesting some of the deepwater fields in the north and south belts where there have been important discoveries over the last three years. We appreciate that we need to leave enough room for new players to come and explore deep water basins and are attentive to that requirement.
Thirdly, we want to maintain a proper foothold in the unconventional areas which will be important for securing Pemex’s long term future. Many industry experts believe that gas from Mexico’s unconventional reserves can eventually be harnessed to solve the country’s gas supply problems. Nevertheless we have to remember that these are only prospective resources and need to be properly explored before they can be converted into reserves.
In the unconventional segment, there are prospective resources across five basins: Tampico-Misantla, Burgos, Sabinas, Burros-Picachos and Chihuahua. Of those,Tampico-Misantla is by a long way the most attractive because of the presence of shale oil as opposed to shale gas and our original stance was to claim the entirety of that asset. The feedback that we were getting from CNH and SENER, however, was that they are very keen to allow enough leeway for other players to compete for shale oil too and so, in our official request that we presented to SENER, we reduced somewhat our demands inTampico-Misantla, but simultaneously requested partial space in each of the other four basins. I fully expect now that what we have asked for in unconventional segment will be granted without significant amendment.
Fourthly, we expect to retain those areas where we have already established partnerships with private sector entities such as Petrofac and Schlumberger for ongoing projects. After the 2008 reforms we were permitted to tender some mature blocks and brownfields – three in the south region, six in the north and six in Chicontepec – and also to set up service contracts with third parties for gas production across the Burgos basin. The secondary legislation includes a specific transitory article for these assignations to be smoothly migrated into the new contractual framework outside of the tender process that will be conducted by CNH.
Finally, there are other areas that we hope to be able to farm out because we possess the knowledge, the expertise and have already shouldered the risk associated with the discovery of the reserves , but simply do not have the financial and execution capacity to develop the fields. I am referring to our work on Trion and Supremus in the Perdido fold belt. Our idea would be to farm-out the implementation and development phases.
As director, how are you going about balancing competing priorities to exploit shallow water fields – where Pemex is renowned as a leader – and to develop new capabilities in areas where you could be said to be lagging behind? How do you strike the right balance?
We need to spread our energies over different areas, but at the same time have a very clear idea of prioritizing and sequencing. In shallow water and onshore, providing we have the infrastructure installed it is quite easy for Pemex to progress from first oil discovery to production. For onshore fields, we can successfully complete this process within a year. For shallow offshore fields, we can do it within three years. In short term we are concentrating in the areas of our most productive assets. In the mid-term we will be attentive to the more complicated basins and new frontier exploration such as deep-water.Given the high logistic effort required for developing unconventional plays, the focus there will be on converting prospective resources into reserves rather than on the production side. In the long term, we can expect to be fully engaged in all types of field.
We are confident that the request we have put forward to SENER contains enough in terms of volume and type of assets to keep us busy exploring, discovering and converting into production well into the next decade. After that we will be able to use the experience accrued from farm-outs and partnerships to forge further ahead.
We have a very clear idea of the areas we would like to farm-out and have even identified the types of partners that we would require for their technical and financial input – namely those experienced actors that have already established a positive track-record in the deep-water Gulf of Mexico basin.
What message would you like to send out on behalf of PEP to our international readers?
Mexico is an attractive place to invest. We possess almost 40 free trade agreements with almost every part of the world. What’s more there are a lot of prospective resources just waiting to be discovered.  We are part of a regional energy provider economy that comprises Canada’s tar sands, America’s gas and shale gas and Mexico’s cheap and easy to invest marketplace with bountiful resources to explore. The firm belief of Mexico’s President is that our country possesses huge growth potential if only we allow in additional capacity. That is the essence and spirit of this historic reform.
Finally, I would also like to mention that PEP does not stop and continues forward, because PEP considers the current situation as a unique opportunity to strengthen and prepare the organization with a clear view towards the future, able to overcome the main industry challenges and, certainly be prepared and ready to compete and win.

(BW) Pemex Exploration and Production Adopts iStore Technology for Scheduling, Managing Drilling Activities


Business Editors, (c) 2006 Business Wire


        Published 2:05 pm, Tuesday, November 21, 2006
    



































































HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--

Pemex Exploration and Production (PEP) has adopted software technology developed by The Information Store (iStore) to schedule and manage the activities performed with drilling rigs for exploration prospects, development wells and workovers. Known internally in PEP as SISPAP, the module was configured and tailored to the business needs of the Southern Onshore Region (RSUR) and is based on iStoreâ€™s PetroTrekÂ® Asset Management Solution for Drilling (AMS-D).
The RSUR operational program includes at least 70 drilling land rigs that are scheduled to complete more than 1,200 activities over a period of four to six years.
SISPAP is being used for PEPâ€™s quarterly and annual drilling operational programs. These programs are jointly created by users from three organizations: integrated production and exploration assets, drilling services, and planning. Through the system, users can check the availability of rigs and assign them to specific tasks using scenarios developed by AMS-D. As these scenarios are approved and undertaken, SISPAP is updated in real-time. The system assists with service requirements, provision of equipment like drilling rigs or trucks, and planning.
â€œThe impact of SISPAP has been enormous,â€� said Jaime Gonzalez Alanis, planning general manager for Pemexâ€™s RSUR. â€œUsers now can design effective operational programs based on factual and timely information. Management can track the status of the activities almost to the hour. We can rapidly adjust our planning scenarios because funds are not available, drilling permits have not been obtained, or engineering works have not been completed.â€�
In addition to gathering data on daily operations, SISPAP also retrieves online data from other systems allowing management to rank scenarios based on their incremental impact on reserves, production or profitability.
â€œPriorities are constantly adjusted in response to hydrocarbons markets and business strategies,â€� said Jose Luis Chaves Suarez, investments planning manager for RSUR. â€œAsset managers need to quickly adjust the sequence of activities and budgets. Wells with no approved budget funds rise to the top, while others that have approved funds are postponed to a later date. SISPAP retrieves data from our standard financial systems and gives us reports that allow redirection of available funds. Now, before an operational plan is released, we can easily rank the scenarios prepared by the assets using key performance indicators: incremental expected production, incremental reserves and project profitability.â€�
RSUR spans a large, swampy region in South Central Mexico with waterways that routinely change shape. SISPAP helps PEP work around the challenging topography, as well as a large number of ecological parks and archeological monuments.
â€œSISPAP has given us great flexibility to track and perform last-minute changes,â€� said Gonzalo Rodriguez Aguilar, manager of operational programming for RSUR. â€œEffort that used to take many people very long weekends and very late hours is now completed in just hours. The system is continuously updated, and it alerts asset managers when key activities are late. Furthermore, the quality of our integrated program is now much better because it encapsulates the joint know-how and experience of many PEP professionals working together in a coordinated way.â€�
SISPAP has been extended to interface with a variety of applications across PEP, including financial systems, administrative systems and geospatial applications such as Google Earth. A management dashboard is also being designed to provide key indicators, said Barry Irani, president of iStore.
â€œWe are excited about the development and use of AMS-D,â€� said Irani. â€œThis product is designed to satisfy a much needed business requirement. In todayâ€™s marketplace, companies simply cannot afford to have drilling rigs, workover rigs and other equipment sitting idleÂ evenÂ for a single moment. By interfacing with all areas of PEP operations, including financial systems, administrative systems and geospatial systems such as Google Earth, AMS-D helps ensure that Pemexâ€™s equipment is effectively deployed and is creating value at all times. It gives Pemex the flexibility to manage and optimize their entire drilling and workover portfolio by adjusting their activities in response to changing market conditions and many operational and other variables as they occur.â€�
â€œThe capabilities and flexibility offered by The Information Store have been terrific,â€� said Arturo Rivera, project leader for the implementation of SISPAP. â€œThey work long, tireless hours to give us the functionality and connectivity required by our users.â€�

Its products include petrochemicals, natural gas, liquid gas, sulphur, gasoline, kerosene and diesel. According to the company, Pemex operates 454 production fields; more than 9,000 production wells; 254 offshore platforms; six refineries; eight petrochemical complexes; over 7,000km of gas pipelines; more than 4,700km of oil pipelines; and 19 LPG distribution terminals. It also operates more than 10,400 service stations throughout the country. As a result of Mexico's energy reforms, Pemex restructured its operations and formed new subsidiaries. Four of the company's units were transformed into two productive subsidiaries: an E&P unit (formerly Pemex Exploración y Producción) and an industrial transformation unit (formerly Pemex Petroquímica, Pemex Gas y Petroquímica Básica, and Pemex Refinación). In addition, five non-core subsidiaries were also approved to cover the segments of drilling and services, logistics, cogeneration and services, and fertilizers and ethylene. The company was founded in 1938 and is based in Mexico City, Mexico.

Where applicable, a project is considered as such until the end of construction and ramp-up to full capacity (with the exception of mining projects, where the date of commissioning signifies the end of the project). Projects must have a:  a) Start date b) Estimate for completion c) Initial investment estimate  Data For state-owned projects, initial information about the start date and estimates for completion and investment are taken from original signed contracts, along with addendums and annexes. If original contracts cannot be obtained, information is taken from public documents, presentations, news articles from BNamericas archives, and external sources. In cases where contracts are subject to approval by legislators, the start date is the date of the law or legislative approval. In the case of private projects, information is taken from public sources, such as stock exchange filings, annual reports, company presentations, third party research and press releases. In judging the timing of investment decisions for private projects, great care was taken to differentiate between large projects receiving environmental approval and proceeding directly to construction, and smaller projects where the investment decision hinges on securing financing. Best care is taken to ensure that recorded data is correct at the time of entry and that each entry is backed with a relevant source. The greatest care possible was taken to ensure consistency of information in order make a like-for-like comparison in project costs. Insofar as the figures rely on disclosure by the organization or company responsible, the figures can be considered to be conservative in nature. No attempt was made to adjust figures for inflation during the course of research or for consideration of the time value of money. Validation In the case of state-owned projects, validation is carried out where possible with either a member of the consortium, EPC contractor, a relevant state agency or advisors to either party. Currency Projects costs are measured in US dollars. Where project costs are measured in a local currency, amounts are converted to US dollars at the date of the relevant announcement, signature or report.  Severity of deviation from original estimates The severity of deviation from original estimates is defined according to set criteria. Timing    Status Condition     Ahead of time 95% of original estimate or below (measured in months)   On time 95% to 105% of original estimate   Minor changes 105% to 120% of original estimate   Medium changes 120% to 160% of original estimate   Major changes Over 160% of original estimate    Budget    Status Condition     Ahead of budget 95% of original budget estimate or below   To budget 95% to 105% of original budget estimate   Minor changes 105% to 120% of original budget estimate   Medium changes 120% to 140% of original budget estimate   Major changes Over 140% of original budget estimate    Changes in Scope Changes in scope beyond the start date are not accounted for. Language definitions Where guidance is non-specific as to dates for completion, the following is used. Project to be completed by 2018 = December 31, 2017 Project to be completed in 2018 = December 31, 2018
