Reports Increased Earnings, Loan Growth and Asset Quality Improvement

THOMASVILLE, Ala., July  27, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- First US Bancshares, Inc. (Nasdaq:FUSB) (the "Company") today reported net income of $416,000, or $0.06 per diluted share, for the quarter ended June 30, 2017 and $820,000, or $0.13 per diluted share, for the six months ended June 30, 2017.  The six-month results represent an increase of $0.01 per diluted share compared to the same period of 2016.  The improved six-month results were achieved despite an increase in the provision for loan losses of $388,000 and a reduction in gains on sale and prepayment of securities of $348,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2017, compared to the same period in 2016. 
Financial Highlights 


Interest Income - Interest and fees on loans increased by $707,000 during the six months ended June 30, 2017, compared to the corresponding period of 2016.  The increase resulted from increased average loan volume and was partially offset by a decrease of $188,000 in interest on investment securities as proceeds from the scheduled maturity of investments were redeployed into the loan portfolio.    

Loan Growth - Net loans increased $12.8 million during the second quarter, an increase of 4.0% from March 31, 2017, or 16.2% on an annualized basis.  Growth in the Company's banking subsidiary, First US Bank (the "Bank"), totaled $9.5 million during the quarter, while the Company's finance company subsidiary, Acceptance Loan Company, Inc. ("ALC"), grew its loan portfolio by $3.3 million during the quarter.   Year-to-date growth in net loans as of June 30, 2017 totaled $7.8 million, or 4.8% on an annualized basis.  Of the total growth, $5.3 million and $2.5 million was attributable to the Bank and ALC, respectively. 

Asset Quality Improvement -  Non-performing assets, including loans in non-accrual status and other real estate owned, decreased to $6.2 million, or 1.01% of total assets, as of June 30, 2017, compared to $8.0 million, or 1.33% of total assets, as of June 30, 2016.     

Provision for Loan Loss - The increase in interest income was partially offset by an increase in the Company's provision for loan losses of $388,000, comparing the six months ended June 30, 2017 to the six months ended June 30, 2016.  The lower provision in 2016 was attributable to a reduction in reserves for loan losses at the Bank of$450,000 in 2016 that was not repeated in 2017 due to growth in the loan portfolio over the past year.  Total provision expense, including both the Bank and ALC, was $1.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017, compared to $703,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2016.

"We are pleased to report a modest improvement in earnings during the first half of 2017," stated James F. House, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company. "This is particularly true given that those earnings resulted directly from the loan growth we experienced during 2016 and the first half of 2017. Our management team remains committed to improving revenue through loan growth at the Bank and sustained performance at ALC," continued Mr. House.

Pre-provision net interest income totaled $7.1 million in the second quarter of 2017, compared to $6.9 million in the second quarter of 2016.  The increase in net interest income resulted from loan growth.  Average loans totaled $325.7 million during the second quarter of 2017, compared to $275.9 million during the second quarter of 2016.   Net yield on interest-earning assets was 5.09% for the second quarter of 2017, compared to 5.19% during the second quarter of the previous year.  For the six months ended June 30, 2017, pre-provision net interest income totaled $14.0 million, compared to $13.6 million during the same period of the previous year.  Average loans totaled $325.4 million and $268.0 million during the six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  Net yield on interest-earning assets was 5.07% during the first six months of 2017, compared to 5.15% during the first six months of 2016. 


The provision for loan losses was $576,000 for the second quarter of 2017, compared to $536,000 during the second quarter of 2016.  For the six months ended June 30, 2017, the provision for loan losses totaled $1.1 million, compared to $703,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2016.  The increase in the provision in both periods of 2017 compared to the previous year resulted from reductions in reserves that occurred at the Bank in 2016 that were not repeated in 2017 due to growth in the loan portfolio over the past year.  The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loans was 1.46% as of June 30, 2017, compared to 1.48% as of December 31, 2016.  
Non-interest income totaled $930,000 in the second quarter of 2017, compared to $1.5 million in the second quarter of 2016.   For the six months ended June 30, 2017, non-interest income totaled $2.1 million, compared to $2.5 million for the first six months of the previous year.  The decrease in non-interest income in both the three- and six-month periods of 2017 resulted primarily from gains on sales of securities that occurred in 2016 but were not repeated in 2017.   
Non-interest expense totaled $6.9 million in the second quarter of 2017, compared to $7.3 million in the second quarter of 2016.  For the six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, non-interest expense totaled $13.9 million and $14.3 million, respectively.  The decrease in non-interest expense in both periods presented resulted primarily from reductions in regulatory assessments, insurance expense, and occupancy and equipment expense.  These reductions were partially offset by increases in salaries and benefits expense. 

Balance Sheet Management

Net loans totaled $330.5 million as of June 30, 2017, compared to $322.8 million as of December 31, 2016. The increase in net loans included increases of $5.3 million and $2.5 million at the Bank and ALC, respectively.  The growth in loan volume was funded primarily through cash flows generated from the scheduled maturity of investment securities.  Investment securities totaled $200.8 million as of June 30, 2017, compared to $207.8 million as of December 31, 2016. Investment securities serve to both enhance interest income and provide an additional source of liquidity available to fund loan growth and capital expenditures. Management has structured the investment portfolio to provide cash flows through interest earned and the maturity or payoff of securities in the portfolio on a monthly basis. In the current environment, it is expected that cash flows from the investment portfolio will continue to serve as a significant source of liquidity available for the funding of future loan growth. 
Premises and equipment increased by $7.4 million during the six months ended June 30, 2017 due to capital expenditures associated with the construction of an office complex in the Birmingham, Alabama area.  Construction of the office complex is nearing completion.  The facility will house a retail branch of the Bank, as well as the Birmingham-based commercial lending team and certain members of the Bank's executive management team. 
Liabilities increased to $537.8 million as of June 30, 2017, compared to $530.7 million as of December 31, 2016. The increase resulted primarily from an increase in deposits of $11.7 million, partially offset by decreases in short-term borrowings and long-term debt totaling $4.5 million. Deposits generated through the Bank's branch system are considered the Company's primary funding source to meet short- and long-term liquidity needs. Deposit levels fluctuate throughout the year based on seasonality, as well as specific circumstances impacting deposit customers. In addition to deposits, significant external sources of liquidity are available to the Bank, including access to funding through federal funds lines, Federal Home Loan Bank advances and brokered deposits. 
Shareholders' equity increased to $78.4 million, or $12.91 per outstanding common share, as of June 30, 2017, compared to $76.2 million, or $12.62 per outstanding common share, as of December 31, 2016. The increase in shareholders' equity resulted primarily from continued growth in retained earnings and increases in other comprehensive income resulting from changes in the fair value of investment securities available-for-sale. 
The Company declared a cash dividend of $0.02 per share on its common stock in the second quarter of 2017. This amount is consistent with the Company's quarterly dividend declarations for the first quarter of 2017 and each quarter of 2016. 
During the second quarter, the Bank continued to maintain capital ratios at higher levels than the ratios required to be considered a "well-capitalized" institution under applicable banking regulations. As of June 30, 2017, the Bank's common equity Tier 1 capital and Tier 1 risk-based capital ratios were each 18.88%. Its total capital ratio was 20.13%, and its Tier 1 leverage ratio was 12.23%.

Dr. Hale’s research has resulted in numerous information systems publications and reports. “We are fortunate to have Dr. Hale join our Company. He will be an important contributor, particularly in the area of information technology,” stated James F. House, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company. “I welcome Dr. Hale as a director and look forward to his association and insight as we continue to focus on the improvement and growth of the Bank’s assets as part of our strategy to increase earnings.” About First US Bancshares, Inc.

In addition, First US Bancshares, Inc. (“Bancshares”) and, together with its subsidiaries, (the “Company”), through its senior management, from time to time makes forward-looking statements concerning its expected future operations and performance and other developments. The words “estimate,” “project,” “intend,” “anticipate,” “expect,” “believe,” “continues” and similar expressions are indicative of forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements are necessarily estimates reflecting the Company’s best judgment based on current information and involve a number of risks and uncertainties, and various factors could cause results to differ materially from those contemplated by such forward-looking statements. Such factors could include those identified from time to time in the Company's Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) filings and other public announcements, including the risk factors described in Part I, Item 1A of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K as of and for the year ended December 31, 2016. Specifically, with respect to statements relating to loan demand, growth and earnings potential, geographic expansion and the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses for the Company, these factors include, but are not limited to, the rate of growth (or lack thereof) in the economy generally and in the Company’s service areas, the availability of quality loans in the Company’s service areas, the relative strength and weakness in the consumer and commercial credit sectors and in the real estate markets and collateral values. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and the Company undertakes no obligation to revise forward-looking statements to reflect circumstances or events that occur after the dates on which the forward-looking statements are made, except as required by law.

Testimonials



Access to cash is vital in the busy times as well as when things slow down. A First US Bank Line of Credit helped get us through a big increase in accounts receivables as our business was growing. The availability of cash flow really helped smooth out the crunch and helped foster our growth.




Heating and cooling installation and repair I understand. Finance and loans not so much. The Commercial lending folks at First US Bank took the time to explain to me the advantages of how a Line of Credit could help me to maintain and grow my business. They understand finance.




Having a First US Bank Line of Credit has really helped give us the flexibility to access funds with ease. In our Antique business you never know when you will run across an estate sale or an opportunity to purchase a large inventory for our business.
