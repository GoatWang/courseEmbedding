Equity Analyst

                                    Prior                


Adage Capital Management LP


                  Adage Capital Management (ACM) manages the Adage Capital Partners Fund (ACP). The firm seeks to provide investors with compound annual long-term returns that are superior to the returns of the S&P 500 Index. Their stock selection approach is based mainly on intra-industry fundamental analysis with a specific focus on intra-industry valuation methodologies.ACM's portfolio managers and equity analysts focus on tracking specific sectors within the S&P 500 Index using a stock valuation methodology designed for each specific industry. Investments include long positions and over-weighted positions in securities of companies, both within and outside of the S&P 500 Index, that ACM believes are attractively valued and are likely to outperform other companies within their respective industries. The fund's portfolio also includes underweighted positions, and in some cases, short positions in securities of companies within and outside the S&P 500 Index that ACM believes are overvalued by the market are likely to underperform other companies within their respective industries.Investments include equity and equity-related securities and other financial instruments, as well as international securities and private securities. Derivative instruments, such as options, futures (mainly financial futures), forward contracts and swaps, may be used to attempt to hedge existing long and short positions, as well as for independent profit opportunities. In addition, ACM may engage in other types of investments, such as leveraged trading and/or risk arbitrage or other event driven trading.
