Abstract
Stable, supercharged benzene ions produced in electron impact ionization have been observed by techniques of collisional mass spectrometry in which single electron transfer reactions of incident C6H6 n+ ions at kiloelectronvolt energies give rise to stable C6H6 (n-1)+ product ions. Semiempirical SCF-MO calculations employed for the computation of C6H6 n+ structures indicate that geometry optimized minimum energy C6H6 n+ cyclic ions exhibit a progression of elongation and expansion as n increases. Structural and energetic data have been obtained for the n = 1 to 6 charge states of benzene.
