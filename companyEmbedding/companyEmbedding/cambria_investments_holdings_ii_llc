What would you do with an extra $1.3 million?




We compared two $1,000,000 portfolios growing at 8% per year for 25 years.
Portfolio 1 has Cambria’s average all-in fee of 0.49%–one of the lowest in the entire industry.
Portfolio 2 has the top 11 brokerage’s average all-in fee of 1.52%.
The difference after 25 years? …a fortune.

We’re people-powered…
…it’s a small difference that makes all the difference




Mebane Faber,
Chief Investment Officer and Portfolio Manager




Cambria Digital Advisor is not a “roboadvisor.” We’re people-powered.
Most automated investment services rely on passive, buy-and-hold portfolios. While a good start, we believe you can do far better.




That’s why our professionals start with buy-and-hold, but then apply active strategies too.
Historical market data suggests this could help make a substantial difference in your portfolio’s returns, volatility, and drawdowns.

The Trinity Portfolio – An Investing Framework Tailored to You




“Trinity” is the framework for all our Cambria Digital Advisor portfolios.
The name reflects the three pillars of its approach: globally-diversified assets, weightings toward value and momentum investments, and active trend following.
Though all Trinity Portfolios contain each element, we customize the exact amounts to reflect different goals and risk tolerances. It’s exceptional investing on your terms.
So which Trinity Portfolio is right for me?

Better performance starts with The Trinity Portfolio™




Cambria’s “Trinity” portfolio is named for our three core investing strategies:
1) Global market exposure, 2) Weightings toward value investments exhibiting positive momentum, 3) Active trend-following overlays.




While your Trinity Portfolio will contain each element, the specific amount will be customized to your personal goals.
It’s world-class investing on your terms.

Step 1Step 2Step 3Step 4Step 5Step 1
Start with U.S. equities and bonds
The classic “60/40” portfolio (60% stocks, 40% bonds) is the starting point for nearly all modern portfolios.
Step 2
Add global equities and bonds
This lowers your portfolio’s volatility and helps you avoid the risks of investing too much in just one country.
Step 3
Add real assets
This improves your portfolio’s risk-adjusted return while lowering volatility even further.
Step 4
Add value & momentum tilts
This substantially increases your portfolio’s absolute returns.
Step 5
Add active trend-following strategy
This adds another significant increase in return while also reducing volatility.

What we believe
It’s simple. Our job is to serve you.




At Cambria, we believe everyone should have access to fair and thoughtful investment solutions. We believe fees matter, so we serve you best by helping keep more of your dollars in your own pocket.

How we’re different
Better research. Smarter strategies. Superior investing.





At Cambria, we’re “quants.” This simply means we often spend our days deep in historical market data. We test it, use our findings to create investing models, re-test, improve…
It’s a detailed process, yet one we believe yields better long-term results for our clients. That’s because all our analysis leads to effective, rules-based strategies that eliminate emotional decision-making.





Nearly every investor would agree that emotions are often our own worst enemy. But our rules-based systems provide us valuable protection against those emotions. We believe they’re a framework for good investing, preventing our short-term impulses from derailing our long-term gains.
So what makes Cambria different? The belief that better research and deeper understanding leads to smarter strategies and superior investing.

			What is the relationship between Cambria Investment Management and Cambria Digital Advisor?		


Jeff Remsburg 


			2016-10-28T15:35:14+00:00		
What is the relationship between Cambria Investment Management and Cambria Digital Advisor?Our company is “Cambria Investment Management.” We’re proud to offer many investing products and services to meet the varying needs of our clients, which include individual investors, institutions, and registered investment advisors. Our “Cambria Digital Advisor” service is our managed investment account service for individual investors. Click here to lean more about a Cambria Digital Advisor account.


			Why did you pick Betterment as your partner?		


Jeff Remsburg 


			2016-10-28T15:35:14+00:00		
Why did you pick Betterment as your partner?As a fiduciary, Cambria’s major concern is “how do we best serve our clients?” While we believe our investing approach is the best market strategy for serving our clients, we partnered with Betterment as we believe their operational and technological platforms make trading, rebalancing, and tax loss harvesting simple and efficient. Furthermore, we believe Betterment’s intuitive, beautiful client interface is superior to that of any other current offering.


			But Betterment offers investing portfolios. Does that make them a competitor?		


Jeff Remsburg 


			2016-09-01T11:21:18+00:00		
But Betterment offers investing portfolios. Does that make them a competitor?The asset management business is a $30 trillion+ industry, and most of the low-cost automated investment solutions (such as Betterment) are far better than other options on the market today because of their much lower fees. For instance, many mutual funds and advisors still charge over 2% a year.  While our investing philosophy is different than that of Betterment’s, we think both solutions are reasonable. We’ve recommended Betterment in the past and find them to be a great partner.


			Can I move my current Betterment account to Cambria?		


Jeff Remsburg 


			2016-10-28T15:35:14+00:00		
Can I move my current Betterment account to Cambria?Sure. Email Betterment support at support@Betterment.com to get the process started.  Since you will not be going through the normal onboarding process, we will send you the Cambria client agreements, ADV Part 2A, and Privacy Policy – no signature needed, just an email confirm that you received them.


			If I move my Betterment account to Cambria, will it be a taxable event?		


Jeff Remsburg 


			2016-09-01T11:22:11+00:00		
If I move my Betterment account to Cambria, will it be a taxable event?If your assets with Betterment are held in a taxable account, then yes.


			I’m an independent advisor. Can I invest using the Trinity Portfolio on the Betterment platform?		


Jeff Remsburg 


			2017-01-18T10:59:28+00:00		
I’m an independent advisor. Can I invest using the Trinity Portfolio on the Betterment platform?No. However, we are currently working with Envestnet to offer our Trinity portfolios to advisors on its platform.  We expect this offering to be available sometime in Q1 2017, and will send out an announcement when it is available.  Please keep in mind, you can always replicate the six Trinity allocations in your own practice. We publish the underlying assets found in each Trinity portfolio, as well as the specific allocation amount of each holding, here on this website in on our “Our Portfolios” tab.


			What are the Cambria Digital Advisor fees?		


Jeff Remsburg 


			2016-10-28T15:35:14+00:00		
What are the Cambria Digital Advisor fees?Cambria charges a 0% management fee on all personal investment accounts. The client pays a 15 basis points (0.15%) platform fee which passes through to our technology partner, Betterment. The client will pay no commission on trades, no fees on tax loss harvesting, and no rebalancing fees. The total fee paid by client is 0.15% plus the underlying fund costs, which varies per the ETFs, but we create our portfolios with only low-cost ETFs.


			If Cambria charges a 0% management fee, how does it make money?		


Jeff Remsburg 


			2016-09-01T11:35:45+00:00		
If Cambria charges a 0% management fee, how does it make money?We construct our six Trinity portfolios with what we believe are the best ETFs in the market. Some of these ETFs come from respected providers such as Vanguard, while others are our own (Cambria’s). Whether from Cambria or an outside provider, these ETFs have related expense ratios. Therefore, Cambria generates revenues from the underlying expense ratios of its own ETFs. Cambria’s average underlying ETF fee is 0.54%.


			What is the minimum balance required to open an account?		


Jeff Remsburg 


			2016-07-05T12:03:07+00:00		
What is the minimum balance required to open an account?To open an account, we require an initial account balance of $100,000.


			Can your portfolio minimum investment be spread over more than one account?		


Jeff Remsburg 


			2016-09-05T11:21:27+00:00		
Can your portfolio minimum investment be spread over more than one account?Yes. The $100,000 minimum is an aggregate amount. You can open accounts with smaller balances as long as your total investment with Cambria across all your accounts totals a minimum of $100,000.


			How do I know which Trinity Portfolio is right for me?		


Jeff Remsburg 


			2016-10-28T15:35:14+00:00		
How do I know which Trinity Portfolio is right for me?The right Trinity Portfolio for you will depend primarily upon your investment goals and your personal risk tolerance. Our six unique Trinity portfolios range from most conservative (Trinity 1) to most aggressive (Trinity 6). To read more about each individual Trinity portfolio, just click here. In addition, one of our advisors will share a short phone call with you upon opening your account in order to answer any questions you have, and make sure you’re in the correct Trinity portfolio to match your investing needs.


			How many Trinity Portfolios are there?		


Jeff Remsburg 


			2016-07-28T11:05:49+00:00		
How many Trinity Portfolios are there?We offer six different Trinity portfolios, ranging from most conservative (Trinity 1) to most aggressive (Trinity 6). You can read more about the different portfolios by clicking here.


			How do I change my portfolio’s allocation?		


Jeff Remsburg 


			2016-10-28T15:35:14+00:00		
How do I change my portfolio’s allocation?We work together with clients to build a strategic asset allocation with which they’re comfortable. If a client wants to discuss their portfolio and any potential changes, we’re happy to schedule a call or meeting for such a review. However, clients cannot alter their portfolio themselves prior to this discussion, as this often allows for emotional behavior that negatively affects returns. (However, a client can always terminate the Cambria Investment account at any time.)


			Can investors outside the United States invest in the new offering?		


Jeff Remsburg 


			2016-08-31T16:32:14+00:00		
Can investors outside the United States invest in the new offering?Unfortunately, Betterment is not setup yet for foreign investors.  However, we suggest two options for our international friends:
a) Open an account at Fidelity.  We can implement all of the Trinity portfolios at Fidelity. Unlike Betterment, Fidelity does not charge a platform fee of 0.15%, but does charge their standard commission rates on trades.  Please reach out to sm@cambriainvestments.com if you are interested.  Tax harvesting is not yet available at Fidelity.
b) Simply invest in Cambria ETFs that mimic the Trinity allocations through your local brokerage.


			What are the ETFs you use to build my portfolio?		


Jeff Remsburg 


			2016-09-01T15:06:52+00:00		
What are the ETFs you use to build my portfolio?Cambria is consistently reviewing all ETF offerings for best of breed funds based on methodology and pricing.  Currently, our portfolios consist of approximately 13 ETFs. They come from eight different respected providers such as Vanguard and iShares, as well as Cambria’s own suite of ETFs.


			Should I buy Cambria’s ETFs or open a Cambria Digital Advisor account?		


Jeff Remsburg 


			2016-10-28T15:35:14+00:00		
Should I buy Cambria’s ETFs or open a Cambria Digital Advisor account?Many investors prefer to invest on their own. In such cases, investing in Cambria’s ETFs would be an appropriate course of action. However, many other investors prefer the convenience of opening an investment account, as well as the confidence that comes with knowing experts are behind all market decisions. For these investors, a Cambria Investment account is preferable. Opening an account effectively outsources the trading and rebalancing efforts, so clients can spend their time elsewhere. An account also offers the benefit of giving clients access to an advisor whenever they have questions about their portfolio, the strategy, or the market.


			How do I confirm my checking account?		


Morningtide 


			2016-10-28T15:35:14+00:00		
How do I confirm my checking account?To add a checking account, we need to make sure you own that account by having you confirm two random deposits/withdrawals we put into that account. After entering your bank account information, you will then complete the following steps to confirm your bank account with Cambria:

Log into your checking account at your bank.
Find the two small random amounts under $1.00 we have deposited and immediately withdrawn from your account – please note, you may have to wait up to two business days to see these deposits.
Log into your account at CambriaInvestments.com.
On the Transfer tab, in the Confirm Two Small Deposits window, tell us the values of the two random deposits in your account.
That’s it, you’re ready to start investing!



			How do I add or delete a linked checking account?		


Morningtide 


			2016-06-30T15:17:34+00:00		
How do I add or delete a linked checking account?To change your linked account online, click your name at the top right hand side of your profile, and click “Settings”. You can change your bank account under the “Bank Account” section of the page.
At this time, our customers can only have one active checking account at a time linked to their Cambria account. Multiple linked bank accounts may be something we provide in the future.
Please Note: Because electronic transfer is the primary way to move money to and from your Cambria account, you will not be able to delete the link to your checking account unless you add a new one.


			How do taxes work with Cambria Digital Advisor accounts?		


Morningtide 


			2016-07-27T14:04:21+00:00		
How do taxes work with Cambria Digital Advisor accounts?Individual (“Personal”) or Joint Taxable Accounts
With taxable investment accounts, you generally owe taxes each year on the dividends and other distributions paid to you that year.  You may also owe taxes when you sell shares, depending on whether or not you’ve realized capital gains on the investment.
Taxation of Dividends
Most ETFs pay dividends, reported on Form 1099-DIV. These are generally taxable, typically at your ordinary marginal tax rate (0-39.6%, Federal). For high earners, an additional 3.8% “net investment income tax” applies. Certain ETFs that hold stocks may distribute “qualified” dividends, which are potentially subject to lower tax rates (Box 1b). Some ETFs hold municipal bonds, which pay dividends that are partially or wholly exempt from federal and/or state tax (Box 10 of 1099-DIV).
Other Distributions
Some ETFs make distributions parts of which are not taxed as dividends, but rather as capital gains, or return of capital. Capital gains distributed are reported on Form 1099-DIV as well (Box 2a).   Return of capital is rare, but could apply, for example, to real estate ETFs that sell some of their holdings, and is reported in Box 3, 8 or 9 (See IRS Pub 17 for details).
Foreign Tax Paid
For ETFs with non-US holdings, the 1099-DIV can indicate foreign tax paid. This could happen when such ETFs have already paid foreign taxes on distributions made by companies in foreign jurisdictions, before passing them on to U.S. shareholders. To mitigate double taxation on the same income, the U.S. rules potentially allow for a deduction or tax credit for these amounts (Box 6).
Taxation of Capital Gains
At Cambria Investments, we sell shares on your behalf whenever you withdraw funds, change your allocation, or we rebalance, harvest losses, or assess our fee. When you sell shares that have appreciated, you realize capital gains tax. If the investment has depreciated in value, you realize a capital loss, which is used to offset other gains that you realized that year, and any excess loss may be deductible from your earned income, up to a threshold set by the IRS.  Losses not used that year may be carried forward to future years.  The amount of capital gains tax you owe depends on your net gains (including losses carried over from prior years) and how long you held your investments before selling.  Short-term capital gains tax applies if you sell shares you held for one year or less. The federal short-term capital gains tax rate is the same rate as your income tax rate (0-39.6%). Long-term capital gains tax applies if you sold shares you held longer than a year, and ranges from 0-20%. For high earners, an additional 3.8% “net investment income tax” is added for both. For each ETF across your portfolio, Cambria’s TaxMin algorithm automatically sells losses first (starting with shares which have the highest cost) and if realizing gains is unavoidable, it prefers long-term over short-term, which is likely to reduce your tax burden. All sales, including sale price, cost basis, and holding period, are reported on Form 1099-B.
Traditional IRA or SEP IRA
Traditional and SEP IRAs may afford a deduction against your ordinary income in the tax year during which you contribute funds, if you qualify based on your income.  Any dividends you receive are automatically reinvested by Cambria Investments, and grow tax-free until withdrawal.  When you withdraw from the account, taxes are generally due at your ordinary income tax rate applicable at that time, both on earnings and on all contribution amounts that were previously deducted.  Penalties may also be due if you don’t meet the withdrawal qualifications (e.g., you withdraw before age 59.5).  Read more from the IRS on IRAs and SEP IRAs.
Roth IRA
Roth IRA contributions are made with dollars you’ve already been taxed on — you don’t get a deduction.  However, at retirement, as long as you’ve held the account for at least five years and met the other qualified withdrawal criteria, none of the amount withdrawn is taxed.  Any dividends you receive are automatically reinvested by Cambria Investments, grow tax-free, and are also withdrawn tax-free.  Read more from the IRS on Roth IRAs.
Cambria Investments is not a tax advisor, nor should any information in this article be considered tax advice. Please consult a tax professional.


			When will my tax forms be available?		


Morningtide 


			2016-10-28T15:35:14+00:00		
When will my tax forms be available?Your 1099 tax forms are automatically imported to your Cambria Investments account in mid-February, in both CSV and PDF formats. We will notify you via email when these are ready. We will also integrate with Turbo Tax, H&R Block, and TaxACT. Unlike other online advisors, we make our forms in-house, with clear summaries provided.
To see tax forms from previous years, please review your Activity page, and then click the “Tax Forms” tab.
The forms are not available prior to February due to the 30-day window related to certain TLH+ requirements, which carry through the end of January. Additionally, we need final confirmations on distributions from fund providers regarding their dividend payout classifications. Cambria Investments strives to provide tax forms well in advance of the Feb. 16, 2016 deadline when possible.


			How should I interpret the information on my 1099-DIV?		


Morningtide 


			2016-06-30T15:18:07+00:00		
How should I interpret the information on my 1099-DIV?Your 1099-DIV is a record of all dividends and distributions earned in your Cambria Investments account during 2015. It includes taxable dividends and distributions as well as exempt-interest dividends paid by municipal bond ETFs. There are multiple boxes on your 1099-DIV, each of which reports a different piece of information which must be included in your tax return:
Box 1a Total Ordinary Dividends: The total amount of dividends and short-term capital gain distributions paid in 2015.
Foreign tax paid (reported separately in Box 6) is added to the dividends and distributions reported in Box 1a as well. If you had foreign tax paid in 2015, the total amount reported in Box 1a will be higher than the amount actually received. For more information on foreign tax, please refer to IRS Publication 514.
Tax-exempt dividends (reported separately in Box 10) are not included in Box 1a. If you received tax-exempt dividends in 2015, the total amount reported in Box 1a will be lower than the amount actually received.
Box 1b Qualified Dividends: The amount of dividends included in Box 1a that are subject to applicable long-term capital gains rates.
Box 2a Total Capital Gain Distributions: The total long-term capital gain distributions paid to you in 2015. These differ from long-term sales reported on your 1099-B, and instead come from the distributions paid by some ETFs.
Box 6 Foreign Tax Paid: The total foreign income taxes paid in 2015 on income from the ETFs’ investments in foreign securities. Federal tax law can permit U.S. taxpayers to take either a deduction or credit for these taxes; for more information please refer to IRS Publication 514 or consult with a tax professional.
Box 10 Exempt-Interest Dividends: The total amount of tax-exempt dividends paid by municipal bond ETFs in 2015.

			How long does it take to transfer money?		


Morningtide 


			2016-06-30T15:18:19+00:00		
How long does it take to transfer money?Electronic deposits from your bank to Cambria Investments typically invest the following business day for deposits made before 11PM EST. This includes requests made on Saturday and Sunday. The only exception is auto-deposits that fall on weekends. If your auto-deposit falls on the weekend, it will invest on Tuesday (assuming that Monday is not a market holiday).
Electronic withdrawals from Cambria Investments to your bank generally take 4-5 business days due to the required sale and settlement of securities. For example, if you made a withdrawal on Monday morning, you can expect your funds the following Monday (assuming that there are no market or bank holidays in the interim). Note that your withdrawal time may also be impacted if you have made recent deposits within the previous 5 business days.
Deposits must be initiated by 11PM EST to be invested by the next business day. Withdrawals must be initiated 30 minutes before the stock market closes at 3:30PM EST to be transacted that day. Trade requests initiated after these cutoff times, or during weekends and holidays, will be processed the next business day.
Cambria Investments does not guarantee specific execution timelines. We avoid trading on or around market open or close, as markets have historically been more volatile during this time. Pending wait times are imposed by banking and market rules and cannot be sped up by Cambria Investments.


			How much can I contribute to an IRA?		


Morningtide 


			2016-06-30T15:18:28+00:00		
How much can I contribute to an IRA?The annual limits for 2015 IRA contributions are $5,500 for individuals under 50 years old, and $6,500 for those who are 50 and over. These contribution limits remain the same for 2016.  The limit is assessed across all of your accounts, so if you have reached the limit with one provider you are not allowed to contribute to another account.
There are additional contribution limits to a Roth IRA, and deduction limits to a Traditional IRA, based on your income and other factors. Please speak with your tax advisor.


			What is tax loss harvesting?		


Morningtide 


			2016-06-30T15:18:37+00:00		
What is tax loss harvesting?Tax loss harvesting is selling a security that has experienced a loss—and then buying a similar asset to replace it. The switch does two things: it allows the investor to realize, or “harvest”, a valuable loss while keeping the portfolio balanced at the desired allocation.
Capital losses can lower your tax bill by offsetting other gains or ordinary income up to certain levels.  But the only way to realize a loss is to sell the asset that has experienced a loss. However, in a well-allocated portfolio, each asset plays an essential role in providing a piece of total market exposure. For that reason, an investor should not want to give up the expected returns associated with each asset just to realize a loss.


			How will Tax Loss Harvesting+ affect my tax returns?		


Morningtide 


			2016-06-30T15:18:50+00:00		
How will Tax Loss Harvesting+ affect my tax returns?You will receive a 1099-B corresponding to any tax loss harvests that occur in your account during the year (as harvests involve a sale in order to realize a loss). This is in addition to non-TLH related investment sales generally (e.g. money withdrawals, allocation changes, or portfolio rebalances).


			How do I turn on Tax Loss Harvesting?		


Morningtide 


			2016-10-28T15:35:15+00:00		
How do I turn on Tax Loss Harvesting?To turn on Tax Loss Harvesting+, first log in to your Cambria Investments account. On the Summary tab, click “Get Started” in the Tax Loss Harvesting+ part of the overview section. As part of the enablement process, you will answer a couple questions to ensure you are eligible. Once you have enabled TLH+, it can take up to one business day for your portfolio to transition and for harvest checks to begin.


			What are ETFs?		


Morningtide 


			2016-06-30T15:19:06+00:00		
What are ETFs?An exchange-traded fund (ETF) is a security that tracks an index, a commodity or a basket of assets just like an index fund, but trades like a stock on an exchange. ETFs track fairly closely to the indexes that they follow, such as the S&P 500 or the Dow Jones Industrial Average. ETFs are bought and sold like stocks throughout the day, and therefore experience continually changing prices. Cambria Funds uses ETFs in both our stock and bond portfolios because of the liquidity, diversification, and low management fees they provide.


			What do I need to know about ETF versus mutual fund costs?		


Morningtide 


			2016-06-30T15:19:14+00:00		
What do I need to know about ETF versus mutual fund costs?When you are thinking about buying an ETF, the Expense Ratio is pretty much all you need to know. ETF managers make money by deducting the annual expenses from the dividends they pay out through the year, and they tell you in advance how much that will be. There are no costs to buy or sell ETFs, and no hidden expenses. If you trade through a broker, the broker will charge you a commission to execute the transaction for you. Cambria Investments covers these transactions for you.
Open-end mutual funds have purchase and redemption fees. These fees range from 0.25 percent to 2 percent and are charged by the fund to buy shares or to sell shares within a specified (usually short) period of time. Purchase and redemption fees differ from a commission because the money goes back into the fund rather than to a broker. These fees are meant to discourage short-term market-timing.
Mutual funds also have internal trading fees which are not disclosed on top of the stated fee. They are estimated to range from 0.11% of assets to 2%, with an average of 1.44%. The Wall Street Journal has a good primer on this issue. Many passive index mutual funds’ undisclosed trading fees are likely quite low, but they are non-zero, so that’s something to consider when doing a pure cost comparison.

Both holders of the joint account have full access to the joint account and are able to create goals, transfer funds from the linked checking account, change allocations, and view the account.
Two customers in a joint account have joint ownership of the assets in the account. Upon death of one of the joint account owners, the assets are transferred to the surviving account holder.
Note: At this time goals and assets held in a personal (individual) account are displayed separately from goals and assets held in a joint account. You can switch between your joint and personal accounts by logging into your account and then selecting the account you wish to view from the “Welcome” drop down menu on the upper right.

Will Riskalyze charge any fee on the assets I allocate to a Trinity portfolio beyond the monthly subscription cost?Yes. Though there may be some variability (please discuss with Riskalyze), in general, Riskalyze charges 0.15% on assets totaling $0 – $5M, 0.10% on assets between $5M – $50M, and 0.08% on assets above $50M. Please note, these fees are in addition to the Technology Platform Offset Fee of 0.10%.

All About Our Trinity Portfolios
“How many Trinity Portfolios are there? And how do I know which one is right for me?”
Fortunately, the answers are simple.
In order to meet the varying investing preferences of our clients, we offer six unique Trinity Portfolios. You might think of them as sitting along a continuum, ranging from most conservative (Trinity 1) to most aggressive (Trinity 6).
All six portfolios are similar in that they share the same foundational building blocks of our Trinity strategy: 1) assets diversified across a global investment set, 2) tilts toward investments exhibiting value and momentum traits, and 3) exposure to trend following.
The differences between the portfolios stem from how much of each building block you’ll find in each specific portfolio. In other words:

What’s the specific asset mix in any given portfolio?
How much exposure to trend following is in any given portfolio?





The Differences in Our Six Trinity Portfolios
On the conservative end of our continuum (Trinity 1), you’ll find the asset mix dominated by bonds, an asset that, historically, can be less-volatile. As to the second question above, Trinity 1 contains the least exposure to trend following, and instead, is more of a buy-and-hold portfolio.
Investors who prefer Trinity 1 are likely more conservative in nature, focused less on maximizing returns and more on minimizing portfolio volatility.
On the aggressive end of our continuum (Trinity 6), you’ll find the asset mix dominated by stocks, an asset that, historically, can be more volatile yet able to generate greater gains. Trinity 6 also contains the greatest exposure to trend following.
Investors who prefer Trinity 6 are likely more aggressive in nature, preferring to target greater returns even though they may be accompanied by increased portfolio volatility.
Trinity Portfolios 2 – 5 fill in the continuum from conservative to aggressive. The version we highlight in our Trinity Portfolio research paper most closely resembles Trinity 4. (We encourage you to read this paper if you haven’t done so. You can download it by clicking here.)
If you’re interested in additional information on each Trinity portfolio in order to help you make the right investment choice, we’ll provide more data below. But please know that this isn’t a decision you’ll need to make alone.
You see, our sign-up sequence will ask you a handful of questions designed to help us steer you toward the right Trinity portfolio. Additionally, we’ll share a short phone call with you as you open your account to make sure your specific Trinity portfolio matches your investing goals and style.
That said, below are more details explaining the differences between our six Trinity Portfolios; specifically, the approximate allocations we expect over time. Please take into account that these are averages, and since our portfolios are dynamic, the exact amount will shift.
We’ll start with a chart that compares all six Trinity portfolio for easy side-by-side comparison.
Here’s another way of viewing the same information that’s a bit more visual.




The Allocations of Our Six Trinity Portfolios
Below is a graphical breakdown of each Trinity Portfolio’s asset allocation. The stated percentage of “stocks,” “bonds,” and “real assets” represents the amount of each asset class you’ll find in the portfolios on a fixed “buy-and-hold” basis.
Please note that the “Trend Following” category is also comprised of “stocks,” “bonds,” and “real assets.” However, because trend is an active, dynamic strategy, each Trinity portfolio may allocate more or less to the respective asset classes given market conditions. It’s a fluid, responsive allocation. Therefore, for our purposes here, we present only the total percentage of trend-exposed assets you’ll find in each respective Trinity portfolio.








Trinity 1:
Stocks: 10%
Bonds: 66%
Real Assets: 3%
Trend Following: 20%








Trinity 2:
Stocks: 16%
Bonds: 50%
Real Assets: 5%
Trend Following: 30%








Trinity 3:
Stocks: 21%
Bonds: 33%
Real Assets: 6%
Trend Following: 40%








Trinity 4:
Stocks: 25%
Bonds: 17%
Real Assets: 8%
Trend Following: 50%








Trinity 5:
Stocks: 20%
Bonds: 12%
Real Assets: 6%
Trend Following: 61%








Trinity 6:
Stocks: 15%
Bonds: 7%
Real Assets: 4%
Trend Following: 74%

Market Strategies








The Trinity Portfolio
Does market uncertainty have you concerned about your wealth? If so, you’re not alone.
Many investors today are anxious because they lack a cohesive plan. Their investments are more an assortment of unrelated assets than deliberately-chosen pieces of a unified strategy. Unfortunately, this can leave their wealth exposed.
Our Trinity Portfolio offers a different approach. It’s a holistic investing framework, sturdy, as it’s rooted in respected, wealth-building investment principles, yet also strategic, able to adapt to all sorts of market conditions. The result is a unified framework that we believe can help relieve investors of the anxiety of “what’s the right strategy right now?”
Do you want help generating real investing wealth with less anxiety? Read how the Trinity Portfolio can help.

Think Income and Growth Don’t Exist in this Market? Think Again.
Are you have the following argument with yourself?
“I need an investment that’s going to provide me not only income, but growth too. Unfortunately, investors have been piling into dividend funds for years now in their search for yield. I’m worried that this has left me few reasonably-valued opportunities. If I invest in a potentially overvalued dividend fund today and this 8-year bull market finally runs out of steam tomorrow, then I’m risking serious losses. On the other hand, keeping my money on the sidelines is returning me zero. Is there an answer?”
As I’m about to show you in this paper, yes, I believe there is an answer – and a good one. Income and growth are still possible, even in this market, though admittedly, harder to find.

Invest With The House
Hacking The Top Hedge Funds
by Meb Faber
Picking stocks is hard—and competitive. The most talented investors in the world play this game, and if you try to compete against them, it’s like playing against the house in a casino. Luck can be your friend for a while, but eventually the house wins. But what if you could lay down your bets with the house instead of against it? In the stock market, the most successful large investors—particularly hedge fund managers—represent the house. These managers like to refer to their top investments as their “best ideas.” In this book, you will learn how to farm the best ideas of the world’s top hedge fund managers. You will learn who they are, how to track their funds and stock picks, and how to use that information to help guide your own portfolio. In essence, you will learn how to play more like the house in a casino and less like the sucker relying on dumb luck.

Global Asset Allocation
A Survey of the World’s Top Investment Strategies
by Meb Faber
With all of our focus on assets – and how much and when to allocate them – are we missing the bigger picture? Our book begins by reviewing the historical performance record of popular assets like stocks, bonds, and cash. We look at the impact inflation has on our money. We then start to examine how diversification through combining assets, in this case a simple stock and bond mix, works to mitigate the extreme drawdowns of risky asset classes. But we go beyond a limited stock/bond portfolio to consider a more global allocation that also takes into account real assets. We track 13 assets and their returns since 1973, with particular attention to a number of well-known portfolios, like Ray Dalio’s All Weather portfolio, the Endowment portfolio, Warren Buffett’s suggestion, and others. And what we find is that, with a few notable exceptions, many of the allocations have similar exposures. And yet, while we are all busy paying close attention to our portfolio’s particular allocation of assets, the greatest impact on our portfolios may be something we fail to notice altogether…

Global Value
How to Spot Bubbles, Avoid Market Crashes, and Earn Big Returns in the Stock Market
by Meb Faber
Investment bubbles and speculative manias have existed for as long as humans have been involved in markets. Is it possible for investors to identify emerging bubbles and then profit from their inflation? Likewise, can investors avoid the bursting of these bubbles, and the extreme volatility and losses found in their aftermath to survive to invest another day? Over 70 years ago, Benjamin Graham and David Dodd proposed valuing stocks with earnings smoothed across multiple years. Robert Shiller later popularized this method with his version of the cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings (CAPE) ratio in the late 1990s and correctly issued a timely warning of poor stock returns to follow in the coming years. We apply this valuation metric across more than 40 foreign markets and find it both practical and useful. Indeed, we witness even greater examples of bubbles and busts abroad than in the United States. We then create a trading system to build global stock portfolios, and find significant outperformance by selecting markets based on relative and absolute valuation.

Shareholder Yield
A Better Approach to Dividend Investing
by Meb Faber
Shareholder Yield: A Better Approach to Dividend Investing shows step-by-step how to find returns in a low yield world. Investors have flocked to dividend stocks in search of yield; however, fewer companies are paying out less in dividends due to legal, tax, and structural changes in the US markets. Dividend payments are only one use of a company’s free cash flow; other uses of cash include: share repurchases, debt paydown, reinvestment in the business, and mergers and acquisitions. Consequently, investors in the 21st century must look to all of the direct and indirect ways in which companies distribute their cash to shareholders, a metric commonly referred to as “Shareholder Yield”. In this book, we analyze portfolios based on the various cash flow metrics and find that portfolios of companies with high shareholder yields outperform both broad market indices and high dividend yield portfolios by a substantial margin. With all of the uncertainty in the markets today, Shareholder Yield helps the reader answer one of the most often asked question in investing today – “Where do I find yield”?

Meb Faber’s White Papers








A Quantitative Approach to Tactical Asset Allocation
In this paper we update our 2006 white paper “A Quantitative Approach to Tactical Asset Allocation” with new data from the 2008-2012 period. How well did the purpose of the original paper – to present a simple quantitative method that improves the risk-adjusted returns across various asset classes – hold up since publication? Overall, we find that the models have performed well in real-time, achieving equity like returns with bond like volatility and drawdowns. We also examine the effects of departures from the original system including adding more asset classes, introducing various portfolio allocations, and implementing alternative cash management strategies.

Relative Strength Strategies for Investing
The purpose of this paper is to present simple quantitative methods that improve risk-adjusted returns for investing in US equity sectors and global asset class portfolios. A relative strength model is tested on the French-Fama US equity sector data back to the 1920s that results in increased absolute returns with equity-like risk. The relative strength portfolios outperform the buy and hold benchmark in approximately 70% of all years and returns are persistent across time. The addition of a trend-following parameter to dynamically hedge the portfolio decreases both volatility and drawdown. The relative strength model is then tested across a portfolio of global asset classes with supporting results.

Global Value: Building Trading Models with the 10 Year CAPE
Over seventy years ago Benjamin Graham and David Dodd proposed valuing securities with earnings smoothed across multiple years. Robert Shiller popularized this method with his version of this cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio (CAPE) in the late 1990s, and issued a timely warning of poor stock returns to follow in the coming years. We apply this valuation metric across over thirty foreign markets and find it both practical and useful, and indeed witness even greater examples of bubbles and busts abroad than in the United States. We then create a trading system to build global stock portfolios based on valuation, and find significant outperformance by selecting markets based on relative and absolute valuation.

Where the Black Swans Hide & the 10 Best Days Myth
Below we examine market outliers in financial markets. How much effect do these outliers have on long term performance? Can the investor prepare for these anomalies, or are they truly ‘black swans’ that cannot be managed? In this issue we examine numerous global financial markets on daily and monthly time frames. We find that these rare outliers have a massive impact on returns. However, these outliers tend to cluster and the majority of both good and bad outliers occur once markets have already been declining. We critique the “missing the 10-best-days” argument proffered by advocates of buy and hold investing, demonstrating that a significant majority of the 10 best days and the 10 worst days occur in declining markets. We continue to advocate that investors attempt to avoid declining markets where most of the volatility lies, and conclude that market timing and risk management is indeed possible, and beneficial to the investor.

Learning to Love Investment Bubbles: What if Sir Isaac Newton had been a Trendfollower?
Investment manias and financial bubbles have likely existed for as long as humans have been involved in financial markets. In this research piece we take a look at some of the more famous market bubbles in history and the extreme volatility and drawdowns they experienced. We then examine a simple trendfollowing approach investors could use to manage their risk. Across twelve market bubbles we find that a trendfollowing system would have improved return while reducing volatility. Most importantly, it would have reduced drawdowns significantly leading to the most important rule in all of investing – surviving to invest another day.

Finding Yield in a 2% World
Many investors are surprised to learn that the largest asset class in the world is foreign debt. US investors often allocate very little to foreign bonds, and when they do, it is through capitalization weighted indexes. These indexes allocate the highest weighting to countries with the most debt outstanding. Is there a better way to invest in global bonds? We examine a simple value approach applied to global sovereign bonds and find that it works well across decades. In a world of very low and even negative yields, a value approach could potentially add a well needed source of income to a diversified portfolio.

Learning to Play Offense and Defense: Combining Value and Momentum from the Bottom Up, and the Top Down
Sorting stocks based on value and momentum factors historically has led to outperformance over the broad US stock market. However, any long-only strategy is subject to similar volatility and drawdowns as the S&P 500. Drawdowns of 50%, or even 60-90% make implementation of a stock strategy very challenging. Is there a way to add value on stock selection, but also reduce volatility and drawdowns of a long only strategy with hedging techniques? In this paper we examine the possibility of following a strategy that combines aggressive offense and smart defense to target outsized returns with manageable risk and drawdowns.

What if 8% is Really 0%? Pension Funds Investing with Fingers-Crossed and Eyes Closed
It is well known that pension funds in the United States are underfunded even if they achieve their projected 8% rate of return. The scope of pension underfunding increases to an astonishing level when more probable future rates are employed. A reduction in the future rate of return from 8% to the more reasonable risk-free rate of approximately 4% causes the liabilities to explode by trillions of dollars. As bond yields declined over the past twenty years, pension funds moved toward more aggressive equity-based portfolios in an attempt to reach for this 8% return. By investing in a portfolio with uncertain outcomes, pension funds could experience increasingly volatile and even negative returns. Paradoxically, in an effort to chase the universal 8% rate, pension funds may be laying the groundwork for returns even lower than the risk free rate. In an effort to offer an empirical basis for this possibility, we conclude the paper with a relevant comparison – the return of a hypothetical Japanese pension for the past two decades. We believe that pension funds need to at least prepare for the unfathomable: 0% returns for 20 years. Most pension funds, regrettably, have not adequately stress tested their portfolios for these scenarios.

Global CAPE Model Optimization
We use the Shiller CAPE Model proposed by Mebane Faber as a template for the exploration of a variety of portfolio optimization methods. By virtue of the Model’s systematic allocation to the ‘cheapest’ markets with the highest theoretical risk premia, the model has the potential to extract high costs from ‘behavioural taxes’ related to the model’s extreme volatility and drawdown character. We apply several portfolio optimization techniques with the objective of maximizing portfolio Sharpe ratios and minimizing drawdowns, including dynamic volatility weighting, risk parity, target risk and minimum variance. Consistent with recent published research on robust portfolio optimization, return to risk ratios improve broadly, with the greatest impact achieved from procedures that manage positions and/or portfolios to an ex ante target volatility. A theoretical framework is also proposed.

Politics and Profit: Combining the Presidential Cycle and the January Effect
Does the intersection of two market anomalies set the stage for outsized performance? The first is what is known as the Presidential Cycle. This theory goes that equity returns during the third and fourth years of a President’s term are more favorable than the first two years. A second market bias is the large outperformance of small cap stocks in January. Historically small caps outperformed large caps in 80% of all Januaries by 3 percentage points per year. Historically across the 48 months in the four year cycle the January of Year 3 is the single biggest outperformer with median returns since 1927 of nearly 8% a month for small caps. Does this mean that January is guaranteed to be great? Again, nothing is guaranteed – Year 3 Januaries have varied from 27% to down 10%. While many of these tendencies are just that, investors can view them as head or tailwinds that could give bulls and bears pause.

To determine if this Fund is an appropriate investment for you, carefully consider the Fund's investment objectives, risk factors, charges and expense before investing. This and other information can be found in the Fund's full or summary prospectus which may be obtained by calling 855-383-4636 (ETF INFO) or visiting our website at www.cambriafunds.com. Read the prospectus carefully before investing or sending money.

	SYLD, GMOM and VAMO are actively managed using proprietary investment strategies and processes. There can be no guarantee that these strategies and processes will produce the intended results and no guarantee that the Fund will achieve its investment objective. This could result in the Fund's underperformance compared to other funds with similar investment objectives.

	ETFs are subject to commission costs each time a "buy" or "sell" is executed. Depending on the amount of trading activity, the low costs of ETFs may be outweighed by commissions and related trading costs. Shares are bought and sold at market price (closing price) not net asset value (NAV) are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Market price returns are based on the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4:00 pm Eastern Time (when NAV is normally determined), and do not represent the return you would receive if you traded at other times.

	There is no guarantee that the Fund will achieve its investment goal. Investing involves risk, including the possible loss of principal. In addition to the normal risks associated with investing, international investments may involve risk of capital loss from unfavorable fluctuation in currency values, from differences in generally accepted accounting principles, or from social, economic, or political instability in other nations. Emerging markets involve heightened risks related to the same factors as well as increased volatility and lower trading volume. Bonds and bond funds are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value as interest rates rise.

	Investments in sovereign and quasi-sovereign debt obligations involve special risks not present in corporate debt obligations. The issuer of the sovereign debt or the authorities that control the repayment of the debt may be unable or unwilling to repay principal or interest when due, and the Fund may have limited recourse in the event of a default. Investments in commodities are subject to higher volatility than more traditional investments. The fund may invest in derivatives, which are often more volatile than other investments and may magnify the Fund's gains or losses. The use of leverage by the fund managers may accelerate the velocity of potential losses. The Fund employs a "momentum" style of investing that emphasizes investing in securities that have had higher recent price performance compared to other securities. This style of investing is subject to the risk that these securities may be more volatile than a broad cross-section of securities or that the returns on securities that have previously exhibited price momentum are less than returns on other styles of investing or the overall stock market. Investments in smaller companies typically exhibit higher volatility. Diversification may not protect against market loss. Emerging markets involve heightened risks related to the same factors as well as increased volatility and lower trading volume.

	Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Buying and selling shares will result in brokerage commissions. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns.

	There are special risks associated with margin investing. As with stocks, you may be called upon to deposit additional cash or securities if your account equity declines.

Please remember there's always the potential of losing money when you invest in securities. 
			
			Before you invest in a Section 529 plan, request the plan's official statement from your Financial Solutions Advisor and read it carefully. The official statement contains more complete information, including investment objectives, charges, expenses and risks of investing in the 529 plan, which you should consider carefully before investing. You should also consider whether your home state or your beneficiary's home state offers any state tax or other benefits that are only available for investments in such state's 529 plan. Section 529 plans are not guaranteed by any state or federal agency.

1 To be eligible for favorable tax treatment afforded to any earnings portion of withdrawals from Section 529 accounts, such withdrawals must be used for "qualified higher education expenses," as defined in the Internal Revenue Code. Any earnings withdrawn that are not used for such expenses are subject to federal income tax and may be subject to a 10% additional federal tax, as well as applicable state and local income taxes. 
			
2 Section 529 plans are established by various states and are offered to residents of all states. Depending on the laws of the customer's home state, favorable tax treatment for investing in a Section 529 plan may be limited to investments made in a Section 529 plan offered by the customer's home state. Neither Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated nor any of its subsidiaries are tax or legal advisors. We suggest you consult your personal tax or legal advisor before making tax or legal-related investment decisions.

Frequently Asked Questions 




What is an IRA?


							An Individual Retirement Account (IRA) may provide either a tax-deferred or tax-free way for you to save for retirement.  There are many different types of IRAs but Roth, Traditional and Rollover IRAs are the most common.
						






How does an IRA work?


							IRAs rely on long-term, tax-deferred compounding to provide your retirement savings the opportunity to grow more quickly than in a taxable account.  When you earn interest, receive a dividend or sell an investment (such as a mutual fund) for a gain, you don't pay taxes that year on the earnings.  Instead, all taxes are deferred until you withdraw those earnings in retirement.
						






Why is an IRA important now?


							In retirement you may need as much as 100% of your current after-tax income (take-home pay) minus any amount you are saving for retirement each year.  This makes it all the more important to start saving sooner rather than later, and an IRA can help you get started.
						






What are the ways I can invest in an IRA?


							You can choose from investment products such as mutual funds, stocks, bonds and ETFs, as well as bank products like CDs and money market savings.
						






What are the contribution deadlines?

You can make contributions to an IRA for a given tax year until the tax return filing deadline of the following year.






How do I convert to a Roth IRA?

A Roth IRA Conversion could help grow your retirement assets federally income tax-free. To help you convert to a Merrill Edge Roth IRA, call us at 888.637.3343 for one-on-one assistance and we'll guide you every step of the way. We're here 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.






What are my options for converting a 401(k) to an IRA?

You have several choices when it comes to your old 401(k). Typically known as a rollover IRA, you can opt to transfer your money into an IRA. Another option is keeping the current 401(k) with your old employer or transfer it to a new employer plan.

Frequently Asked Questions 




SEP IRA



Do I have to contribute annually?
                                No. A SEP IRA gives you the flexibility to decide each year whether to contribute and at what rate. That could mean contributing more during profitable years and less or nothing at all during less profitable years.
                            
Is it difficult to administer a SEP IRA?
                                SEP IRAs have little to no paperwork and administration and don't require filing with the IRS. Plus, a Small Business Financial Solutions Advisor can help you get started.
                            
Is there investment research I can review? 
                                Yes. As a Merrill Edge client, you get access to BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research (rated #1 by Institutional InvestorFootnote 2)-as well as research from other industry leaders-to gain investing knowledge and market
                                insights that can help inform your investment strategy.
                            




SIMPLE IRA



Is there a mandatory employer match? 
                                Yes. With a SIMPLE IRA, you must contribute either 2% of compensation for each eligible employee, regardless of participation, or a dollar-for-dollar match of employee salary deferral contributions, capped at 3% of compensation (which may be reduced to as low as 1% in any two years during a 5-year period).
                            
What if my business grows beyond 100 employees?
                                You may need to consider establishing a small business 401(k) plan when your business grows to more than 100 employees. A Small Business Financial Solutions Advisor can help you consider your options. Please note: If you decide to establish a 401(k) plan, you would stop contributions to the SIMPLE IRA plan and then start the 401(k). Participants that have been in the SIMPLE IRA plan for over two years may roll their SIMPLE IRA assets over to the new 401(k) if it allows for rollovers. Before making any decisions, you should speak with your tax and legal advisor about your situation and the requirements for terminating a plan and establishing a new one.
                            
Is it difficult to administer a SIMPLE IRA? 
                                We have many ways to make managing your retirement plan easier. Our Merrill Lynch E-Contribs for Small Business Retirement Accounts™ provides small business owners with a convenient web-based solution for making contributions to retirement plan accounts, while the Automated Investment Program provides a systematic way to invest in mutual funds on a schedule based on your needs.
                                
                                SIMPLE IRA contributions will be made through your payroll company and you will be required to send an annual notice to your employees. You do not file IRS Form 5500 as you would with a 401(k) plan.

Each choice may offer different investment options and services, fees and expenses, withdrawal options, required minimum distributions, tax treatment and provide different protection from creditors and legal judgments. These are complex choices and should be considered with care.
