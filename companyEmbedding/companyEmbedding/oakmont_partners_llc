Oakmont Brochure










Comprehensive and coordinated accurately describe the holistic suite of services Oakmont Partners can offer our clients. Consider these examples:

A Stable Frame of Mind...

Laura, age 55, and husband Brian, age 63, are an active couple with adult children from his prior marriage. A former insurance executive, Laura has served as a consultant and board member within the insurance industry. Her true passion, however, is horses, and most recently she founded a riding stable. Oakmont not only manages her retirement portfolio, but has also assisted in securing a construction loan and established a realty trust for the stable. We also provide ongoing tax advice and counsel to Laura as she expands her business. Brian is the owner of a technical school, part owner of a family business, and owner/landlord of commercial properties in trust with Laura. Oakmont has assisted with financing for the purchase of industrial property, advised on the sale of a substantial coin collection, and will consult on the future sale of the technical school and commercial properties. We have also developed, in partnership with the couple’s attorney, a complete estate plan in addition to providing tax preparation and general tax counsel. 

Dream Boat...

Alan and Janet, age 60, are principals in separate architectural firms.  The couple has two adult children and would like to scale back their professional lives and pursue several avocations. Alan  is currently planning to sell his share of the practice back to his partners and retire in order to spend his time fulfilling a life-long ambition of building a wooden boat.  Janet plans on working until she is 66, and will sell her share in her firm at that point and travel. Oakmont has provided financial planning, eldercare advice for an aging parent, investment management services, and retirement planning for both Alan and Janet. We have also developed, along with their attorney, an estate plan for Alan, Janet, and an elderly parent. In addition to ongoing counsel to Alan and Janet, we also provide  investment advice to their two children.

Simplify...

Geoff, 50, is a dual US-Jamaican citizen.  When Geoff came to Oakmont, he had multiple business interests in  Jamaica and the United States. Through working with Oakmont, we have been able to provide succession planning for his several businesses to preserve the accretive value of those private assets for the benefit of his family.  Oakmont was also able to structure and implement several investment programs as well as handle many complicated tax matters that arise from being a dual citizen.
