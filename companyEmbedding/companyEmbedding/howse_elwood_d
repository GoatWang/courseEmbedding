Title: Director
               Company: Orthologic Corp.
Job Details
               Capstone Therapeutics Corp. (the "Company" or "we"), is traded on the OTCQB under the ticker symbol "CAPS". We are a biotechnology company committed to developing a pipeline of novel peptides and other molecules aimed at helping patients with underserved medical conditions. Our primary asset is ownership in a joint venture development company, called LipimetiX Development, Inc. ("LipimetiX" or "JV") based in Natick, Massachusetts. In 2012, Capstone invested $6 million in the joint venture for 60% ownership. Our partners in the venture include three PhD drug developers, The University of Alabama at Birmingham Research Foundation ("UABRF") and scientists at The University of Alabama at Birmingham ("UAB"). Both Capstone (with two full time employees) and the joint venture (managed under consulting contract by Benu Biopharma) operate virtual business models to maintain capital efficiency for our shareholders. Through funding provided by Capstone, LipimetiX developed its first candidate peptide molecule, AEM-28, through pre-clinical and human clinical Phase 1a, 1b and 2a studies. 51 patients were enrolled in double-blinded, placebo-controlled studies at a clinical site in Perth, Australia. AEM-28 was delivered in single ascending dose and multiple ascending dose formats to test safety, tolerability and efficacy. The Medical Safety Committee, reviewing all safety-related aspects of the clinical trial, observed a generally acceptable safety profile. Of the first-in-man study, the primary endpoint was safety; yet, efficacy measurements analyzing pharmacodynamics yielded statistical significance in the pooled data set favoring AEM-28 vs. placebo in multiple lipid biomarker endpoints, especially VLDL cholesterol and triglycerides.
