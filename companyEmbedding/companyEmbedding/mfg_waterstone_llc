Made in the USA Kitchen Faucet Manufacturing | Waterstone Faucets



































41180 Raintree Court, Murrieta, CA 92562 | Phone: 888-304-0660 | Fax: 951-304-0525

















Made in America Since 1999







They said it couldn’t be done that manufacturing in the United States is impossible. “You can’t compete,” they say. Well what do “they” know? Waterstone Faucets was up for the challenge. To us, it’s important to keep quality manufacturing and jobs in the U.S. where they belong. Since 1999, we have made it all right here - in our factory in California. We take great pride in being able to say that we are truly Made in America.

Since our country’s beginning, we have been a land of innovators and dreamers. We were the misfits who were crazy enough to hop on a boat and sail for the New World. America was built on dreams, hard work and the ingenuity of it’s people. Our dreams turned into the telephone, the light bulb, TV, the smart phone and put a man on the moon. Our creativity has led to blue jeans, rock and roll, muscle cars and baseball. At Waterstone, we love what we do. Our dreamers take great pride in creating a piece of art in the form of a kitchen faucet and calling it their own. The craftsmanship and attention to detail cannot be duplicated anywhere else. That is why our products are so sought after by designers, architects, high end builders, and homeowners that want the best.
Made in the USA is making a comeback. Increased consumer awareness for products made in the United States has risen dramatically. Waterstone founder Chris Kuran, a Naval Academy graduate and former Marine, is determined to keep the dream here at home. Chris, his wife, four children and Zoey the dog were born and raised right here in sunny Southern California. Why would we go anywhere else? We want to put people to work. American manufacturing jobs are important and have a positive impact on the U.S. economy. We admit it isn’t easy. It’s tough, but we found a way to create record sales every year. This led to a building expansion and more importantly - more workers! It can be done and we shouldn’t let anyone tell us otherwise. That dream is still alive and Waterstone is determined to help Americans get there.
So, when they say it can’t be done, they might be giving up on the American Dream. They say overseas manufacturing is good enough. Well, good enough doesn’t cut it with us. You just cannot create a quality product 5000 miles away. Everyday, our team arrives to work from the local neighborhoods and communities. They grab some coffee, roll up the sleeves and get their hands dirty. No lattes here. We love what we do and it shows in our faucets. Our faucets are built to last forever. We guarantee it!
Thank you for your support!

Warranty Info

Waterstone Limited Lifetime WarrantyAll Waterstone, LLC products carry a LIMITED LIFETIME GUARANTEE against defect in material or workmanship. Waterstone does not, however, guarantee its products against defects due to improper installation, the failure to perform proper maintenance or uses for which they were not designed. Waterstone has no liability for consequential or indirect damages and its only liability is to repair or replace, at its option, any of its products determined by Waterstone to have a manufacturing defect. Products must be returned within one year of purchase. Waterstone shall not pay any repair costs performed on its products by other than its authorized representatives unless Waterstone has given prior written approval to incur costs on its behalf. The rate of deterioration of finishes will vary either from exposure to chemicals, perspiration, climate conditions, or other factors. Tarnishing or excessive wear of finishes is therefore, not a defect, but a normal process which is unavoidable. Under these circumstances, finishes can not be guaranteed and, therefore, products will not be repaired or replaced under warranty for normal tarnishing or wear finishes.
