(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OR PLAN OF OPERATION  FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS  Certain statements in this report contain or may contain forward-looking statements that are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements were based on various factors and were derived utilizing numerous assumptions and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. These factors include, but are not limited to, our ability to generate revenues, economic, political and market conditions and fluctuations, government and industry regulation, interest rate risk, U.S. and global competition, and other factors. Most of these factors are difficult to predict accurately and are generally beyond our control. You should consider the areas of risk described in connection with any forward-looking statements that may be made herein. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this report. Readers should carefully review this report in its entirety, including but not limited to our financial statements and the notes thereto. Except for our ongoing obligations to disclose material information under the Federal securities laws, we undertake no obligation to release publicly any revisions to any forward-looking statements, to report events or to report the occurrence of unanticipated events. For any forward-looking statements contained in any document, we claim the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  GENERAL INFORMATION  Lake Forest Minerals was incorporated in the State of Nevada on June 23, 2008. We are a development stage company with no revenues or operating history.  We have sold $42,000 in equity securities since inception, $12,000 from the sale of 8,000,000 shares of stock to our officer and director and $30,000 from the sale of 3,000,000 shares registered pursuant to our S-1 Registration Statement which became effective on August 18, 2008. The offering was completed on September 11, 2008.  Our financial statements from inception through the period ended December 31, 2016 report no revenues and a net loss of $134,964. AMC Auditing, LLC, our independent auditor, has issued an audit opinion for Lake Forest Minerals which includes a statement expressing substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern.  Effective June 26, 2008, the Company entered into a Mineral Property Option Agreement with T.L. Sadlier-Brown, whereby the Company obtained an option to acquire the VIN Mineral Claim located in the Princeton Mining Division of British Columbia.  Prior to completing the payments required under the Agreement, the Company had the right to conduct exploration and development activities on the property at its sole discretion and, having provided notice to the vendor, had the option to terminate the Agreement and relieve itself from any obligations thereunder. On February 22, 2010 the Company provided notice to Mr. Sadlier-Brown, and terminated the Option Agreement and relieved itself from any obligations thereunder.  Our plan is to seek, investigate, and consummate a merger or other business combination, purchase of assets or other strategic transaction (i.e. a merger) with a corporation, partnership, limited liability company or other operating business entity (a "Merger Target") desiring the perceived advantages of becoming a publicly reporting and publicly held corporation. We have no operating business, and conduct minimal operations necessary to meet regulatory requirements. Our ability to commence any operations is contingent upon obtaining adequate financial resources. We are currently considered a "shell" company inasmuch as we are not generating revenues, do not own an operating business, and have no specific plan other than to engage in a merger or acquisition transaction with a yet-to-be identified operating company or business. We have no employees and no material assets.  We currently have no definitive agreements or understandings with any prospective business combination candidates and there are no assurances that we will find a suitable business with which to combine. The implementation of our business objectives is wholly contingent upon a business combination and/or the successful sale of our securities. We intend to utilize the proceeds of any offering, any sales of equity securities or debt securities, bank and other borrowings or a combination of those sources to effect a business combination with a target business which we believe has significant growth potential. While we may, under certain circumstances, seek to effect business combinations with more than one target business, unless additional financing is obtained, we will not have sufficient proceeds remaining after an initial business combination to undertake additional business combinations.  A common reason for a target company to enter into a merger with a shell company is the desire to establish a public trading market for its shares. Such a company would hope to avoid the perceived adverse consequences of undertaking a public offering itself, such as the time delays and significant expenses incurred to comply with the various federal and state securities law that regulate initial public offerings.  As a result of our limited resources, unless and until additional financing is obtained we expect to have sufficient proceeds to effect only a single business combination. Accordingly, the prospects for our success will be entirely dependent upon the future performance of a single business. Unlike certain entities that have the resources to consummate several business combinations or entities operating in multiple industries or multiple segments of a single industry, we will not have the resources to diversify our operations or benefit from the possible spreading of risks or offsetting of losses. A target business may be dependent upon the development or market acceptance of a single or limited number of products, processes or services, in which case there will be an even higher risk that the target business will not prove to be commercially viable.  Our officer is only required to devote a small portion of his time to our affairs on a part-time or as-needed basis. We expect to use outside consultants, advisors, attorneys and accountants as necessary, none of which will be hired on a retainer basis. We do not anticipate hiring any full-time employees so long as we are seeking and evaluating business opportunities.  We do not expect our present management to play any managerial role for us following a business combination. Although we intend to scrutinize closely the management of a prospective target business in connection with our evaluation of  a business combination with a target business, our assessment of management may be incorrect.  In evaluating a prospective target business, we will consider several factors, including the following:  - experience and skill of management and availability of additional personnel of the target business;  - costs associated with effecting the business combination;  - equity interest retained by our stockholders in the merged entity;  - growth potential of the target business;  - capital requirements of the target business;  - capital available to the target business;  - stage of development of the target business;  - proprietary features and degree of intellectual property or other protection of the target business;  - the financial statements of the target business; and  - the regulatory environment in which the target business operates.  The foregoing criteria are not intended to be exhaustive and any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular target business will be based, to the extent relevant, on the above factors, as well as other considerations we deem relevant. In connection with our evaluation of a prospective target business, we anticipate that we will conduct a due diligence review which will encompass, among other things, meeting with incumbent management as well as a review of financial, legal and other information.  The time and costs required to select and evaluate a target business (including conducting a due diligence review) and to structure and consummate the business combination (including negotiating and documenting relevant agreements and preparing requisite documents for filing pursuant to applicable corporate and securities laws) cannot be determined at this time. Our president intends to devote only a very small portion of his time to our affairs, and, accordingly, the consummation of a business combination may require a longer time than if he devoted his full time to our affairs. However, he will devote such time as he deems reasonably necessary to carry out our business and affairs. The amount of time devoted to our business and affairs may vary significantly depending upon, among other things, whether we have identified a target business or are engaged in active negotiation of a business combination.  We anticipate that various prospective target businesses will be brought to our attention from various sources, including securities broker-dealers, investment bankers, venture capitalists, bankers and other members of the financial community, including, possibly, the executive officers and our affiliates.  Various impediments to a business combination may arise, such as appraisal rights afforded the stockholders of a target business under the laws of its state of organization. This may prove to be deterrent to a particular combination.  Our shares are quoted on the Over-the-Counter Electronic Bulletin Board (OTCBB) under the symbol "LAKF". There has been no active trading of our securities, and, therefore, no high and low bid pricing. As of the date of this report Lake Forest Minerals had 21 shareholders of record. We have paid no cash dividends and have no outstanding options.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  We are still in our development stage and have not generated any revenue.  We incurred operating expenses of $3,269 and $2,949 for the three month periods ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. These expenses consisted of general operating expenses incurred in connection with the day to day operation of our business and the preparation and filing of our periodic reports.  We incurred operating expenses of $7,196 and $5,930 for the six month periods ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. These expenses consisted of general operating expenses incurred in connection with the day to day operation of our business and the preparation and filing of our periodic reports.  Our net loss from inception (June 23, 2008) through December 31, 2016 was $134,964.  As of December 31, 2016, Jeffrey Taylor, our officer and director, has loaned the Company $89,000 for operating expenses. The loan bears no interest and has no specific terms of repayment.  Our auditors expressed their doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern unless we are able to generate profitable operations.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  Our cash in the bank at December 31, 2016 was $1,756 with $94,720 in current liabilities. We have sold $42,000 in equity securities since inception, $12,000 from the sale of 8,000,000 shares of stock to our officer and director and $30,000 from the sale of 3,000,000 shares registered pursuant to our S-1 Registration Statement which became effective on August 18, 2008. The offering was completed on September 11, 2008.  Since we have no revenue or plans to generate any revenue, if our expenses exceed our cash currently on hand we will be dependent upon loans to fund losses incurred in excess of our cash.  PLAN OF OPERATION  Our plan is to seek, investigate, and consummate a merger or other business combination, purchase of assets or other strategic transaction (i.e. a merger) with a corporation, partnership, limited liability company or other operating business entity (a "Merger Target") desiring the perceived advantages of becoming a publicly reporting and publicly held corporation. We have no  operating business, and conduct minimal operations necessary to meet regulatory requirements. Our ability to commence any operations is contingent upon obtaining adequate financial resources.  We are not currently engaged in any business activities that provide cash flow. The costs of investigating and analyzing business combinations for the next 12 months and beyond such time will be paid with money in our treasury.  During the next twelve months we anticipate incurring costs related to:  (i) filing of Exchange Act reports, and  (ii) costs relating to identifying and consummating a transaction with a Merger Target.  We believe we will be able to meet these costs through use of funds in our treasury and additional amounts, as necessary, to be loaned to or invested in us by our stockholders, management or other investors.  We may consider a business which has recently commenced operations, is a developing company in need of additional funds for expansion into new products or markets, is seeking to develop a new product or service, or is an established business which may be experiencing financial or operating difficulties and is in need of additional capital. In the alternative, a business combination may involve the acquisition of, or merger with, a company which does not need substantial additional capital, but which desires to establish a public trading market for its shares, while avoiding, among other things, the time delays, significant expense, and loss of voting control which may occur in a public offering.  Jeffrey Taylor is our president, secretary and our chief financial officer. Mr. Taylor is only required to devote a small portion of his time to our affairs on a part-time or as-needed basis. No regular compensation has, in the past, nor is anticipated in the future, to be paid to any officer or director in their capacities as such. We do not anticipate hiring any full-time employees as long as we are seeking and evaluating business opportunities.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  We have no off-balance sheet arrangements.

	LAKE FOREST MINERALS INC.




	Notes to the Financial Statements





	 



	1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS, HISTORY AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES






	DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND HISTORY - Lake Forest Minerals Inc., a Nevada corporation, (hereinafter referred to as the "Company" or "Lake Forest Minerals") was incorporated in the State of Nevada on June 23, 2008.  The Company was formed to engage in the acquisition, exploration and development of natural resource properties of merit. During the initial period ending June 30, 2008, the Company entered into an option agreement to acquire certain mineral claims located in British Columbia (refer to Note 3).





	On February 22, 2010 the Company provided notice to the Optionor, and terminated the Option Agreement and relieved itself from any obligations thereunder.





	The Company’s operations have been limited to general administrative operations, initial property staking and investigation, and is considered an Exploration Stage Company in accordance with ASC 915.





	Since February 22, 2010, our purpose has been to serve as a vehicle to acquire an operating business and we are currently considered a “shell” company inasmuch as we are not generating revenues, do not own an operating business, and have no specific plan other than to engage in a merger or acquisition transaction with a yet-to-be identified operating company or business.  We have no employees and no material assets.





	MANAGEMENT OF COMPANY - The Company filed its articles of incorporation with the Nevada Secretary of State on June 23, 2008.  The initial list of officers filed with the Nevada Secretary of State on June 23, 2008, indicates the sole director Jeffrey Taylor as the President, Secretary, and Treasurer.





	YEAR END - The Company's fiscal year end is June 30.





	USE OF ESTIMATES - The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.





	INCOME TAXES - The Company provides for income taxes under ASC 740, Accounting for Income Taxes.  ASC 740 requires the use of an asset and liability approach in accounting for income taxes.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities and the tax rates in effect when these differences are expected to reverse.





	ASC 740 requires the reduction of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.





	The Company has net operating loss carryover to be used for reducing future year’s taxable income. The Company has recorded a valuation allowance for the full potential tax benefit of the operating loss carryovers due to the uncertainty regarding realization.





	REVENUE RECOGNITION - The Company has no current source of revenue; therefore the Company has not yet adopted any policy regarding the recognition of revenue or cost.





	NET LOSS PER COMMON SHARE - Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss available to common stockholders for the period by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period.  The calculation of diluted net loss per share gives effect to common stock equivalents; however, potential common shares are excluded if their effect is anti-dilutive. For the period from June 23, 2008 (Date of Inception) through March 31, 2017 the Company had no potentially dilutive securities.

	Notes to the Financial Statements




	 



	1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS, HISTORY AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)






	STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION - The Company has not adopted a stock option plan and has not granted any stock options.  Accordingly no stock-based compensation has been recorded to date.





	CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS – For purposes of Statements of Cash Flows, the Company considers all highly liquid instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents to the extent the funds are not being held for investment purposes.





	ADVERTISING COSTS - The Company's policy regarding advertising is to expense advertising when incurred.  The Company had not incurred any advertising expenses as of March 31, 2017.





	LONG-LIVED ASSETS - The carrying value of intangible assets and other long-lived assets is reviewed on a regular basis for the existence of facts or circumstances that may suggest impairment.  The Company recognizes impairment when the sum of the expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset.  Impairment  losses, if any, are measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its estimated fair value.





	MINERAL PROPERTY COSTS - The Company has been in the exploration stage since its inception on June 23, 2008 and has not yet realized any revenues from its planned operations, being the acquisition and exploration of mining properties.  Mineral property exploration costs are expensed as incurred.  Mineral property acquisition costs are initially capitalized when incurred. The Company assesses the carrying costs for impairment at each fiscal quarter end.  When it has been determined that a mineral property can be economically developed as a result of establishing proven and probable reserves, the costs then incurred to develop such property, are capitalized.  Such costs will be amortized using the units-of-production method over the estimated life of the probable reserve.  If mineral properties are subsequently abandoned or impaired, any capitalized costs will be charged to operations.





	RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS – From March 31, 2017 through the filing date of these financial statements, the FASB (Financial Accounting Standards Board) issued various Accounting Standards Updates relating to the treatment and recording of certain accounting transactions.  Management has determined that these recent accounting pronouncements will have no impact on the financial statements of Lake Forest Minerals Inc.






	2. PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT






	As of March 31, 2017, the Company does not own any property and/or equipment.






	3. STOCKHOLDER'S EQUITY






	The Company has 75,000,000 common shares and 10,000,000 preferred shares authorized with a par value of $0.001 per share.





	The Company has not issued any preferred shares since inception through March 31, 2017.





	A total of 11,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock have been issued as of March 31, 2017, 8,000,000 of these shares were issued to the sole director of the Company pursuant to a stock subscription agreement at $0.0015 per share for total proceeds of $12,000 on June 26, 2008.  The remaining 3,000,000 shares of the Company’s issued and outstanding common stock were issued at a price of $0.01 per share for gross proceeds of $30,000.

	4. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS






	Jeffrey Taylor, the sole officer and director of the Company was not paid for any underwriting services that he performed on behalf of the Company with respect to the Company's S-1 prospectus offering, filed August 6, 2008.





	To March 31, 2017, Jeffrey Taylor loaned the Company $92,700 for operating expenses, the loan bears no interest and has no specific terms of payment.






	5. GOING CONCERN






	The Company has incurred net losses of approximately $138,181 for the period from June 23, 2008 (Date of Inception) through March 31, 2017 and has commenced limited operations, raising substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.  The Company  will seek  additional  sources of capital  through the issuance  of debt or equity  financing,  but there  can be no  assurance  the Company will be successful in accomplishing its objectives.





	The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on additional sources of capital and the success of the Company's plan.  The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.






	6. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS






	The Company’s management has reviewed all material subsequent events through the filing date of these financial statements in accordance with ASC 885-10, and has determined that there are no material subsequent events to report.

	General Information






	Lake Forest Minerals was incorporated in the State of Nevada on June 23, 2008.  We are a development stage company with no revenues or operating history.





	We have sold $42,000 in equity securities since inception, $12,000 from the sale of 8,000,000 shares of stock to our officer and director and $30,000 from the sale of 3,000,000 shares registered pursuant to our S-1 Registration Statement which became effective on August 18, 2008. The offering was completed on September 11, 2008.





	Our financial statements from inception through the period ended March 31, 2017 report no revenues and a net loss of $138,181.  AMC Auditing, LLC, our independent auditor, has issued an audit opinion for Lake Forest Minerals which includes a statement expressing substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern.





	Effective June 26, 2008, the Company entered into a Mineral Property Option Agreement with T.L. Sadlier-Brown, whereby the Company obtained an option to acquire the VIN Mineral Claim located in the Princeton Mining Division of British Columbia.





	Prior to completing the payments required under the Agreement, the Company had the right to conduct exploration and development activities on the property at its sole discretion and, having provided notice to the vendor, had the option to terminate the Agreement and relieve itself from any obligations thereunder.  On February 22, 2010 the Company provided notice to Mr. Sadlier-Brown, and terminated the Option Agreement and relieved itself from any obligations thereunder.





	Our plan is to seek, investigate, and consummate a merger or other business combination, purchase of assets or other strategic transaction (i.e. a merger) with a corporation, partnership, limited liability company or other operating business entity (a “Merger Target”) desiring the perceived advantages of becoming a publicly reporting and publicly held corporation. We have no operating business, and conduct minimal operations necessary to meet regulatory requirements. Our ability to commence any operations is contingent upon obtaining adequate financial resources.  We are currently considered a “shell” company inasmuch as we are not generating revenues, do not own an operating business, and have no specific plan other than to engage in a merger or acquisition transaction with a yet-to-be identified operating company or business. We have no employees and no material assets.





	We currently have no definitive agreements or understandings with any prospective business combination candidates and there are no assurances that we will find a suitable business with which to combine. The implementation of our business objectives is wholly contingent upon a business combination and/or the successful sale of our securities. We intend to utilize the proceeds of any offering, any sales of equity securities or debt securities, bank and other borrowings or a combination of those sources to effect a business combination with a target business which we believe has significant growth potential. While we may, under certain circumstances, seek to effect business combinations with more than one target business, unless additional financing is obtained, we will not have sufficient proceeds remaining after an initial business combination to undertake additional business combinations.


	 




	8








	 


	A common reason for a target company to enter into a merger with a shell company is the desire to establish a public trading market for its shares. Such a company would hope to avoid the perceived adverse consequences of undertaking a public offering itself, such as the time delays and significant expenses incurred to comply with the various federal and state securities law that regulate initial public offerings.





	As a result of our limited resources, unless and until additional financing is obtained we expect to have sufficient proceeds to effect only a single business combination. Accordingly, the prospects for our success will be entirely dependent upon the future performance of a single business. Unlike certain entities that have the resources to consummate several business combinations or entities operating in multiple industries or multiple segments of a single industry, we will not have the resources to diversify our operations or benefit from the possible spreading of risks or offsetting of losses. A target business may be dependent upon the development or market acceptance of a single or limited number of products, processes or services, in which case there will be an even higher risk that the target business will not prove to be commercially viable.





	Our officer is only required to devote a small portion of his time to our affairs on a part-time or as-needed basis. We expect to use outside consultants, advisors, attorneys and accountants as necessary, none of which will be hired on a retainer basis. We do not anticipate hiring any full-time employees so long as we are seeking and evaluating business opportunities.





	We do not expect our present management to play any managerial role for us following a business combination. Although we intend to scrutinize closely the management of a prospective target business in connection with our evaluation of a business combination with a target business, our assessment of management may be incorrect.





	In evaluating a prospective target business, we will consider several factors, including the following:










	–



	experience and skill of management and availability of additional personnel of the target business;














	–



	costs associated with effecting the business combination;














	–



	equity interest retained by our stockholders in the merged entity;














	–



	growth potential of the target business;














	–



	capital requirements of the target business;














	–



	capital available to the target business;














	–



	stage of development of the target business;














	–



	proprietary features and degree of intellectual property or other protection of the target business;














	–



	the financial statements of the target business; and














	–



	the regulatory environment in which the target business operates.






	 


	The foregoing criteria are not intended to be exhaustive and any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular target business will be based, to the extent relevant, on the above factors, as well as other considerations we deem relevant. In connection with our evaluation of a prospective target business, we anticipate that we will conduct a due diligence review which will encompass, among other things, meeting with incumbent management as well as a review of financial, legal and other information.





	The time and costs required to select and evaluate a target business (including conducting a due diligence review) and to structure and consummate the business combination (including negotiating and documenting relevant agreements and preparing requisite documents for filing pursuant to applicable corporate and securities laws) cannot be determined at this time. Our president intends to devote only a very small portion of his time to our affairs, and, accordingly, the consummation of a business combination may require a longer time than if he devoted his full time to our affairs. However, he will devote such time as he deems reasonably necessary to carry out our business and affairs. The amount of time devoted to our business and affairs may vary significantly depending upon, among other things, whether we have identified a target business or are engaged in active negotiation of a business combination.


	 




	9








	 


	We anticipate that various prospective target businesses will be brought to our attention from various sources, including securities broker-dealers, investment bankers, venture capitalists, bankers and other members of the financial community, including, possibly, the executive officers and our affiliates.





	Various impediments to a business combination may arise, such as appraisal rights afforded the stockholders of a target business under the laws of its state of organization. This may prove to be deterrent to a particular combination.





	Our shares are quoted on the Over-the-Counter Electronic Bulletin Board (OTCBB) under the symbol “LAKF”.  There has been no active trading of our securities, and, therefore, no high and low bid pricing.  As of the date of this report Lake Forest Minerals had 21 shareholders of record.  We have paid no cash dividends and have no outstanding options.






	Results of Operations






	We are still in our development stage and have not generated any revenue.





	We incurred operating expenses of $3,217 and $2,789 for the three month periods ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  These expenses consisted of general operating expenses incurred in connection with the day to day operation of our business and the preparation and filing of our periodic reports.





	We incurred operating expenses of $10,413 and $8,718 for the nine month periods ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  These expenses consisted of general operating expenses incurred in connection with the day to day operation of our business and the preparation and filing of our periodic reports.





	Our net loss from inception (June 23, 2008) through March 31, 2017 was $138,181.





	As of March 31, 2017, Jeffrey Taylor, our officer and director, has loaned the Company $92,700 for operating expenses.  The loan bears no interest and has no specific terms of repayment.





	Our auditors expressed their doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern unless we are able to generate profitable operations.






	Liquidity and Capital Resources






	Our cash in the bank at March 31, 2017 was $2,117 with $98,298 in current liabilities.  We have sold $42,000 in equity securities since inception, $12,000 from the sale of 8,000,000 shares of stock to our officer and director and $30,000 from the sale of 3,000,000 shares registered pursuant to our S-1 Registration Statement which became effective on August 18, 2008. The offering was completed on September 11, 2008.





	Since we have no revenue or plans to generate any revenue, if our expenses exceed our cash currently on hand we will be dependent upon loans to fund losses incurred in excess of our cash.






	Plan of Operation






	Our plan is to seek, investigate, and consummate a merger or other business combination, purchase of assets or other strategic transaction (i.e. a merger) with a corporation, partnership, limited liability company or other operating business entity (a “Merger Target”) desiring the perceived advantages of becoming a publicly reporting and publicly held corporation. We have no operating business, and conduct minimal operations necessary to meet regulatory requirements. Our ability to commence any operations is contingent upon obtaining adequate financial resources.





	We are not currently engaged in any business activities that provide cash flow. The costs of investigating and analyzing business combinations for the next 12 months and beyond such time will be paid with money in our treasury.


	 




	10








	 


	During the next twelve months we anticipate incurring costs related to:










	(i)



	filing of Exchange Act reports, and














	(ii)



	costs relating to identifying and consummating a transaction with a Merger Target.









	We believe we will be able to meet these costs through use of funds in our treasury and additional amounts, as necessary, to be loaned to or invested in us by our stockholders, management or other investors.





	We may consider a business which has recently commenced operations, is a developing company in need of additional funds for expansion into new products or markets, is seeking to develop a new product or service, or is an established business which may be experiencing financial or operating difficulties and is in need of additional capital. In the alternative, a business combination may involve the acquisition of, or merger with, a company which does not need substantial additional capital, but which desires to establish a public trading market for its shares, while avoiding, among other things, the time delays, significant expense, and loss of voting control which may occur in a public offering.





	Jeffrey Taylor is our president, secretary and our chief financial officer. Mr. Taylor is only required to devote a small portion of his time to our affairs on a part-time or as-needed basis. No regular compensation has, in the past, nor is anticipated in the future, to be paid to any officer or director in their capacities as such. We do not anticipate hiring any full-time employees as long as we are seeking and evaluating business opportunities.






	Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements






	We have no off-balance sheet arrangements.








	ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES





	Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures





	We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Based upon that evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that the company’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective, as of March 31, 2017, in ensuring that material information relating to us required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in reports it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including its principal executive officer or officers and principal financial officer or officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.





	Changes in internal control over financial reporting.





	There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rule 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the period covered by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.











	ITEM 5. OTHER INFORMATION





	CHANGES IN REGISTRANT'S CERTIFYING ACCOUNTANT









	(i)




	Seale & Beers, CPAs, LLC ("Seale & Beers"), the independent registered public accounting firm for Lake Forest Minerals Inc. (the "Company"), informed the Company on September 13, 2016 that Seale & Beers was in the process of being acquired by AMC Auditing LLC ("AMC"). As a result, effective October 31, 2016 Seale & Beers resigned as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. The sole Director has engaged AMC to serve as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm effective October 31, 2016.






	 


	 




	11









	 






	(ii)




	The reports of Seale & Beers on the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015, contained no adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion and were not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope, or accounting principles, with the exception that the report did include a going concern paragraph.













	(iii)




	During the Company's fiscal years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 and the subsequent interim period from July 1, 2016 to the date of the Company’s report on Form 8-K, and in connection with the audit of the Company's financial statements for such periods, there were no disagreements between the Company and Seale & Beers on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements, if not resolved to the satisfaction of Seale & Beers, would have caused Seale & Beers to make reference to the subject matter of such disagreements in connection with its audit reports on the Company's financial statements.













	(iv)




	During the Company's fiscal years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, and the subsequent interim period from July 1, 2016 to the date of this report, there were no reportable events within the meaning of Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K.













	(v)




	During the Company's fiscal years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, and the subsequent interim period from July 1, 2016 to the date of this report, the Company did not consult with AMC regarding any of the matters set forth in Items 304(a)(2)(i) and (ii) of Regulation S-K.













	(vi)




	The Company provided Seale & Beers with a copy of the disclosures in the Company’s report on Form 8-K and requested that Seale & Beers furnish it with a letter addressed to the Securities and Exchange Commission stating whether or not Seale & Beers agrees with the statements in this Item 4.01. A copy of the letter was filed as Exhibit 16.1 to the Company’s report on Form 8-K as filed on November 3, 2016.

FOREST MINERALS INC. 
 (An Exploration Stage Company) 

Notes to
the Financial Statements

1.
DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS, HISTORY AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES

DESCRIPTION
OF BUSINESS AND HISTORY - Lake Forest Minerals Inc., a Nevada
corporation, (hereinafter referred to as the "Company" or "Lake
Forest Minerals") was incorporated in the State of Nevada on June
23, 2008. The Company was formed to engage in the acquisition,
exploration and development of natural resource properties of
merit. During the initial period ending June 30, 2008, the Company
entered into an option agreement to acquire certain mineral claims
located in British Columbia (refer to Note 3).

The
Company's operations have been limited to general administrative
operations, initial property staking and investigation, and is
considered an Exploration Stage Company in accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 7.

The
Company will review and further develop the accounting policies as
the business plan is implemented. 

 




The Company
completed a prospectus  offering on September 11, 2008, of
3,000,000
shares  of the  Company's  common  stock at a
price of $0.01 per share for gross
proceeds of $30,000.




 

MANAGEMENT
OF COMPANY - The Company filed its articles of incorporation with
the Nevada Secretary of State on June 23, 2008, indicating Sandra
L. Miller on behalf of Resident Agents of Nevada, Inc. as the sole
incorporator. The initial list of officers filed with the Nevada
Secretary of State on June 23, 2008, indicates the sole director
Jeffrey Taylor as the President, Secretary, and
Treasurer.

GOING
CONCERN - The Company has incurred net losses of approximately
$39,545 for the period from June 23, 2008 (Date of Inception)
through March 31, 2010 and has commenced limited operations,
raising substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue
as a going concern. The Company will seek additional sources of
capital through the issuance of debt or equity financing, but there
can be no assurance the Company will be successful in accomplishing
its objectives.

The
ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent
on additional sources of capital and the success of the Company's
plan. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that
might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going
concern.

YEAR END -
The Company's year end is June 30.

Notes to the Financial Statements

1.
DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS, HISTORY AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING
POLICIES (continued)

USE OF
ESTIMATES - The preparation of the financial statements in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the
United States of America requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of
revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results
could differ from those estimates.

INCOME
TAXES - The Company accounts for its income taxes by recognizing
deferred tax assets and liabilities for future tax consequences
attributable to differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their
respective tax basis and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax
assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates
expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those
temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in
tax rates is recognized in operations in the period that includes
the enactment date.

The
Company has net operating loss carryover to be used for reducing
future year's taxable income. The Company has recorded a valuation
allowance for the full potential tax benefit of the operating loss
carryovers due to the uncertainty regarding realization.

NET LOSS
PER COMMON SHARE - Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing
the net loss available to common stockholders for the period by the
weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding
during the period. The calculation of diluted net loss per share
gives effect to common stock equivalents; however, potential common
shares are excluded if their effect is anti-dilutive. For the
period from June 23, 2008 (Date of Inception) through March 31,
2010, the Company had no potentially dilutive
securities.

STOCK-BASED
COMPENSATION - The Company has not adopted a stock option plan and
has not granted any stock options. Accordingly no stock-based
compensation has been recorded to date.

LONG-LIVED
ASSETS - The carrying value of intangible assets and other
long-lived assets is reviewed on a regular basis for the existence
of facts or circumstances that may suggest impairment. The Company
recognizes impairment when the sum of the expected undiscounted
future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset.
Impairment losses, if any, are measured as the excess of the
carrying amount of the asset over its estimated fair
value.

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS, HISTORY AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING
POLICIES (continued)

MINERAL
PROPERTY COSTS - The Company has been in the exploration stage
since its inception on June 23, 2008 and has not yet realized any
revenues from its planned operations, being the acquisition and
exploration of mining properties. Mineral property exploration
costs are expensed as incurred. Mineral property acquisition costs
are initially capitalized when incurred. The Company assesses the
carrying costs for impairment at each fiscal quarter end. When it
has been determined that a mineral property can be economically
developed as a result of establishing proven and probable reserves,
the costs then incurred to develop such property, are capitalized.
Such costs will be amortized using the units-of-production method
over the estimated life of the probable reserve. If mineral
properties are subsequently abandoned or impaired, any capitalized
costs will be charged to operations.

RECENT
ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS - From September 2008 through April 2010,
the FASB (Financial Accounting Standards Board) issued various
Accounting Standards Updates relating to the treatment and
recording of certain accounting transactions. Management has
determined that these recent accounting pronouncements will have no
impact on the financial statements of Lake Forest Minerals
Inc.

PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT

As of
March 31, 2010, the Company does not own any property and/or
equipment.

3. MINERAL
PROPERTY

Effective
June 26, 2008, the Company entered into a Mineral Property Option
Agreement (the "Agreement") with T.L. Sadlier-Brown, whereby the
Company obtained an option to acquire the VIN Mineral Claim located
in the Princeton Mining Division of British Columbia (the "VIN
Mining Claim").

Under the
terms of the Agreement, the Company paid $2,500 by June 30, 2008
and, paid a further $5,000 by August 15, 2009 and in order to
maintain the option is required to pay an additional $7,500 by June
30, 2010. Upon completion of the required payments, which may be
accelerated at the Company's option, the Company will own an
undivided 100% interest in the VIN Mineral Claim subject to a 2%
net smelter returns royalty reserved in favour of the
Optionor.

Prior to
completing the payments required under the Agreement, the Company
has the right to conduct exploration and development activities on
the property at its sole discretion and may, having provided notice
to the vendor, terminate the Agreement and relieve itself from any
obligations thereunder.

PART
I 

ITEM 1.
BUSINESS

You should
read the following summary together with the more detailed business
information and the financial statements and related notes that
appear elsewhere in this annual report. In this annual report,
unless the context otherwise denotes, references to "we", "us",
"our", "the Company", "Lake Forest" and "Lake Forest Minerals" are
to Lake Forest Minerals Inc.

Lake
Forest Minerals was incorporated in the State of Nevada on June 23,
2008. We are a development stage company with no revenues or
operating history.

We have
sold $42,000 in equity securities since inception, $12,000 from the
sale of 8,000,000 shares of stock to our officer and director and
$30,000 from the sale of 3,000,000 shares registered pursuant to
our S-1 Registration Statement which became effective on August 18,
2008. The offering was completed on September 11, 2008.

Our
financial statements from inception through the year ended June 30,
2010 report no revenues and a net loss of $45,834. Seale and Beers,
Certified Public Accountants, our independent auditor, has issued
an audit opinion for Lake Forest Minerals which includes a
statement expressing substantial doubt as to our ability to
continue as a going concern.

Effective
June 26, 2008, the Company entered into a Mineral Property Option
Agreement with T.L. Sadlier-Brown, whereby the Company obtained an
option to acquire the VIN Mineral Claim located in the Princeton
Mining Division of British Columbia.

Under the
terms of the Agreement, the Company paid $2,500 by June 30, 2008,
paid a further $5,000 by August 15, 2009 and in order to maintain
the option was required to pay an additional $7,500 by June 30,
2010. Upon completion of the required payments the Company would
have owned an undivided 100% interest in the VIN Mineral Claim
subject to a 2% net smelter returns royalty reserved in favour of
the Optionor.

Prior to
completing the payments required under the Agreement, the Company
had the right to conduct exploration and development activities on
the property at its sole discretion and, having provided notice to
the vendor, had the option to terminate the Agreement and relieve
itself from any obligations thereunder.

On
February 22, 2010 the Company provided notice to Mr. Sadlier-Brown,
and terminated the Option Agreement and relieved itself from any
obligations thereunder.

Our plan
is to seek, investigate, and consummate a merger or other business
combination, purchase of assets or other strategic transaction
(i.e. a merger) with a corporation, partnership, limited liability
company or other operating business entity (a "Merger Target")
desiring the perceived advantages of becoming a publicly reporting
and publicly held corporation. We have no operating business, and
conduct minimal operations necessary to meet regulatory
requirements. Our ability to commence any operations is contingent
upon obtaining adequate financial resources. We are currently
considered a "shell" company inasmuch as we are not generating
revenues, do not own an operating business, and have no specific
plan other than to engage in a merger or acquisition transaction
with a yet-to-be identified operating company or business. We have
no employees and no material assets.

We
currently have no definitive agreements or understandings with any
prospective business combination candidates and there are no
assurances that we will find a suitable business with which to
combine. The implementation of our business objectives is wholly
contingent upon a business combination and/or the

3

  

successful
sale of our securities. We intend to utilize the proceeds of any
offering, any sales of equity securities or debt securities, bank
and other borrowings or a combination of those sources to effect a
business combination with a target business which we believe has
significant growth potential. While we may, under certain
circumstances, seek to effect business combinations with more than
one target business, unless additional financing is obtained, we
will not have sufficient proceeds remaining after an initial
business combination to undertake additional business
combinations.

A common
reason for a target company to enter into a merger with a shell
company is the desire to establish a public trading market for its
shares. Such a company would hope to avoid the perceived adverse
consequences of undertaking a public offering itself, such as the
time delays and significant expenses incurred to comply with the
various federal and state securities law that regulate initial
public offerings.

As a
result of our limited resources, unless and until additional
financing is obtained we expect to have sufficient proceeds to
effect only a single business combination. Accordingly, the
prospects for our success will be entirely dependent upon the
future performance of a single business. Unlike certain entities
that have the resources to consummate several business combinations
or entities operating in multiple industries or multiple segments
of a single industry, we will not have the resources to diversify
our operations or benefit from the possible spreading of risks or
offsetting of losses. A target business may be dependent upon the
development or market acceptance of a single or limited number of
products, processes or services, in which case there will be an
even higher risk that the target business will not prove to be
commercially viable.

Our
officer is only required to devote a small portion of his time to
our affairs on a part-time or as-needed basis. We expect to use
outside consultants, advisors, attorneys and accountants as
necessary, none of which will be hired on a retainer basis. We do
not anticipate hiring any full-time employees so long as we are
seeking and evaluating business opportunities.

We do not
expect our present management to play any managerial role for us
following a business combination. Although we intend to scrutinize
closely the management of a prospective target business in
connection with our evaluation of a business combination with a
target business, our assessment of management may be
incorrect.

In
evaluating a prospective target business, we will consider several
factors, including the following:

-
experience and skill of management and availability of additional
personnel of the target business;

- costs
associated with effecting the business combination;

- equity
interest retained by our stockholders in the merged
entity;

- growth
potential of the target business;

- capital
requirements of the target business;

- capital
available to the target business;

- stage of
development of the target business;

-
proprietary features and degree of intellectual property or other
protection of the target business;

- the
financial statements of the target business; and

- the
regulatory environment in which the target business
operates.

4

  

The
foregoing criteria are not intended to be exhaustive and any
evaluation relating to the merits of a particular target business
will be based, to the extent relevant, on the above factors, as
well as other considerations we deem relevant. In connection with
our evaluation of a prospective target business, we anticipate that
we will conduct a due diligence review which will encompass, among
other things, meeting with incumbent management as well as a review
of financial, legal and other information.

The time
and costs required to select and evaluate a target business
(including conducting a due diligence review) and to structure and
consummate the business combination (including negotiating and
documenting relevant agreements and preparing requisite documents
for filing pursuant to applicable corporate and securities laws)
cannot be determined at this time. Our president intends to devote
only a very small portion of his time to our affairs, and,
accordingly, the consummation of a business combination may require
a longer time than if he devoted his full time to our affairs.
However, he will devote such time as he deems reasonably necessary
to carry out our business and affairs. The amount of time devoted
to our business and affairs may vary significantly depending upon,
among other things, whether we have identified a target business or
are engaged in active negotiation of a business
combination.

We
anticipate that various prospective target businesses will be
brought to our attention from various sources, including securities
broker-dealers, investment bankers, venture capitalists, bankers
and other members of the financial community, including, possibly,
the executive officers and our affiliates.

Various
impediments to a business combination may arise, such as appraisal
rights afforded the stockholders of a target business under the
laws of its state of organization. This may prove to be deterrent
to a particular combination.

BANKRUPTCY
OR SIMILAR PROCEEDINGS

There has
been no bankruptcy, receivership or similar proceeding.

REORGANIZATIONS,
PURCHASE OR SALE OF ASSETS

There have
been no material reclassifications, mergers, consolidations, or
purchase or sale of a significant amount of assets not in the
ordinary course of business.

PATENTS,
TRADEMARKS, FRANCHISES, ROYALTY AGREEMENTS OR LABOR
CONTRACTS

We have no
current plans for any registrations such as patents, trademarks,
copyrights, franchises, concessions, royalty agreements or labor
contracts. We will assess the need for any copyright, trademark or
patent applications on an ongoing basis.

NEED FOR
GOVERNMENT APPROVAL OF PRODUCTS OR SERVICES

We are not
required to apply for or have any government approval for our
products or services.

RESEARCH
AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS DURING THE LAST TWO YEARS

We have
not expended funds for research and development costs since
inception.

EMPLOYEES
AND EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS

Our only
employee is our sole officer, Jeffrey Taylor. Mr. Taylor currently
devotes 10 hours per week to company matters and he will continue
to devote as much time as the board of directors determines is
necessary to manage the affairs of the company. There are no formal
employment agreements between the company and our current
employee.

REPORTS
TO SECURITIES HOLDERS

We provide
an annual report that includes audited financial information to our
shareholders. We make our financial information equally available
to any interested parties or investors through compliance with the
disclosure rules for a small business issuer under the Securities
Exchange Act. We are subject to disclosure filing requirements,
including filing Form 10-K annually and Form 10-Q quarterly. In
addition, we will file Form 8-K and other proxy and information
statements from time to time as required. We do not intend to
voluntarily file the above reports in the event that our obligation
to file such reports is suspended under the Exchange Act. The
public may read and copy any materials that we file with the
Securities and Exchange Commission, ("SEC"), at the SEC's Public
Reference Room at 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 20549. The public
may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference
Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. The SEC maintains an
Internet site (http://www.sec.gov) that contains reports, proxy and
information statements, and other information regarding issuers
that file electronically. 

ITEM 1A.
RISK FACTORS

YOU SHOULD
CAREFULLY CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING KNOWN RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES IN
ADDITION TO OTHER INFORMATION IN THIS REPORT IN EVALUATING OUR
COMPANY. OUR BUSINESS, OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
COULD BE SERIOUSLY HARMED DUE TO ANY OF THE FOLLOWING KNOWN RISKS.
THE RISKS DESCRIBED BELOW ARE NOT THE ONLY ONES FACING OUR COMPANY.
ADDITIONAL RISKS NOT PRESENTLY KNOWN TO US MAY ALSO IMPAIR OUR
BUSINESS OPERATIONS.

WE HAVE NO
RECENT OPERATING HISTORY OR BASIS FOR EVALUATING
PROSPECTS.

We
currently have no operating business or plans to develop one. We
are seeking to enter into a merger or business combination with
another operating company. To date, our efforts have been limited
to meeting our regulatory filing requirements and searching for a
merger target.

WE HAVE
LIMITED RESOURCES AND NO REVENUES FROM OPERATIONS, AND WILL NEED
ADDITIONAL FINANCING IN ORDER TO EXECUTE ANY BUSINESS
PLAN.

We have
limited resources, no revenues from operations to date and our cash
on hand may not be sufficient to satisfy our cash requirements
during the next twelve months. In addition, we will not achieve any
revenues (other than insignificant investment income) until, at the
earliest, the consummation of a merger and we cannot ascertain our
capital requirements until such time. There can be no assurance
that determinations ultimately made by us will permit us to achieve
our business objectives.

WE WILL BE
ABLE TO EFFECT AT MOST ONE MERGER, AND THUS MAY NOT HAVE A
DIVERSIFIED BUSINESS.

Our
resources are limited and we will most likely have the ability to
effect only a single merger. This probable lack of diversification
will subject us to numerous economic, competitive and regulatory
developments, any or all of which may have a material adverse
impact upon the particular industry in which we may operate
subsequent to the consummation of a merger. We will become
dependent upon the development or market acceptance of a single or
limited number of products, processes or services.

WE DEPEND
SUBSTANTIALLY UPON OUR PRESIDENT, WHOSE EXPERIENCE IS LIMITED, TO
MAKE ALL MANAGEMENT DECISIONS.

Our
ability to effect a merger will be dependent upon the efforts of
our president, Jeffrey Taylor. Notwithstanding the importance of
Mr. Taylor, we have not entered into any employment agreement or
other understanding with Mr. Taylor

6

  

concerning
compensation or obtained any "key man" life insurance on any of his
life. The loss of the services of Mr. Taylor will have a material
adverse effect on achieving our business objectives and success. We
will rely upon the expertise of Mr. Taylor and do not anticipate
that we will hire additional personnel.

THERE IS
COMPETITION FOR THOSE PRIVATE COMPANIES SUITABLE FOR A MERGER
TRANSACTION OF THE TYPE CONTEMPLATED BY MANAGEMENT.

We are in
a highly competitive market for a small number of business
opportunities which could reduce the likelihood of consummating a
successful business combination. We are and will continue to be an
insignificant participant in the business of seeking mergers with,
joint ventures with and acquisitions of small private and public
entities. A large number of established and well-financed entities,
including small public companies and venture capital firms, are
active in mergers and acquisitions of companies that may be
desirable target candidates for us. Nearly all these entities have
significantly greater financial resources, technical expertise and
managerial capabilities than we do; consequently, we will be at a
competitive disadvantage in identifying possible business
opportunities and successfully completing a business combination.
These competitive factors may reduce the likelihood of our
identifying and consummating a successful business
combination.

FUTURE
SUCCESS IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON THE ABILITY OF MANAGEMENT TO LOCATE
AND ATTRACT A SUITABLE ACQUISITION.

The nature
of our operations is highly speculative. The success of our plan of
operation will depend to a great extent on the operations,
financial condition and management of the identified business
opportunity. While management intends to seek business
combination(s) with entities having established operating
histories, we cannot assure you that we will be successful in
locating candidates meeting that criterion. In the event we
complete a business combination, the success of our operations may
be dependent upon management of the successor firm or venture
partner firm and numerous other factors beyond our
control.

WE HAVE NO
AGREEMENT FOR A BUSINESS COMBINATION OR OTHER
TRANSACTION.

We have no
definitive agreement with respect to engaging in a merger with,
joint venture with or acquisition of, a private or public entity.
No assurances can be given that we will successfully identify and
evaluate suitable business opportunities or that we will conclude a
business combination. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to
negotiate a business combination on favorable terms, and there is
consequently a risk that funds allocated to the purchase of our
shares will not be invested in a company with active business
operations.

MANAGEMENT
WILL CHANGE UPON THE CONSUMMATION OF A MERGER.

After the
closing of a merger or business combination, it is likely our
current management will not retain any control or managerial
responsibilities. Upon such event, Mr. Taylor intends to resign
from his positions with us.

CURRENT
STOCKHOLDERS WILL BE IMMEDIATELY AND SUBSTANTIALLY DILUTED UPON A
MERGER OR BUSINESS COMBINATION.

Our
Articles of Incorporation authorized the issuance of 75,000,000
shares of Common Stock. There are currently 64,000,000 authorized
but unissued shares of Common Stock available for issuance. To the
extent that additional shares of Common Stock are authorized and
issued in connection with a merger or business

7

  

combination,
our stockholders could experience significant dilution of their
respective ownership interests. Furthermore, the issuance of a
substantial number of shares of Common Stock may adversely affect
prevailing market prices, if any, for the Common Stock and could
impair our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of
equity securities.

CONTROL BY
EXISTING STOCKHOLDER.

Mr. Taylor
beneficially owns 72% of the outstanding shares of our Common
Stock. As a result, this stockholder is able to exercise control
over matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election
of directors, and the approval of mergers, consolidations and sales
of all or substantially all of our assets.

OUR COMMON
STOCK IS A "PENNY STOCK" WHICH MAY RESTRICT THE ABILITY OF
STOCKHOLDERS TO SELL OUR COMMON STOCK IN THE SECONDARY
MARKET.

The SEC
has adopted regulations which generally define "penny stock" to be
an equity security that has a market price, as defined, of less
than $5.00 per share, or an exercise price of less than $5.00 per
share, subject to certain exceptions, including an exception of an
equity security that is quoted on a national securities exchange.
Our Common Stock is not now quoted on a national exchange but is
traded on FINRA's OTC Bulletin Board ("OTCBB"). Thus, they are
subject to rules that impose additional sales practice requirements
on broker-dealers who sell these securities. For example, the
broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for the
purchaser of such securities and have received the purchaser's
written consent to the transactions prior to the purchase.
Additionally, the rules require the delivery, prior to the
transaction, of a disclosure schedule prepared by the SEC relating
to the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must disclose the
commissions payable to both the broker-dealer and the registered
underwriter, and current quotations for the securities, and, if the
broker-dealer is the sole market maker, the broker-dealer must
disclose this fact and the broker-dealer's presumed control over
the market. Finally, among other requirements, monthly statements
must be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny
stock held in the account and information on the limited market in
penny stocks. The "penny stock" rules, may restrict the ability of
our stockholders to sell our Common Stock and warrants in the
secondary market.

LIQUIDITY
IS LIMITED, AND WE MAY BE UNABLE TO OBTAIN LISTING OF OUR COMMON
STOCK ON A MORE LIQUID MARKET.

Our Common
Stock is quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board ("OTCBB"), which provides
significantly less liquidity than a securities exchange (such as
the American or New York Stock Exchange) or an automated quotation
system (such as the Nasdaq Global Market or Capital Market). There
is uncertainty that we will ever be accepted for a listing on an
automated quotation system or national securities exchange.


ITEM 1B.
UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS

None.


ITEM 2.
PROPERTIES

We do not
currently own any property. The company's corporate documents are
stored at the home of our president for no charge. The telephone
number is (206)203-4100. The mailing address for the company is 711
S. Carson Street, Suite 4, Carson City, NV 89701. This is the
address of our resident agent in Nevada. Due to the company's
limited capital resources and the nature of its business we
determined this was the best arrangement for the company.
Management believes the current arrangement is sufficient for its
needs at this time.

We
currently have no investment policies as they pertain to real
estate, real estate interests or real estate mortgages.


ITEM 3.
LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

We are not
currently involved in any legal proceedings and we are not aware of
any pending or potential legal actions.

[REMOVED AND RESERVED] 

PART
II 

ITEM 5.
MARKET FOR REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS
AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES

Our shares
are quoted on the Over-the-Counter Electronic Bulletin Board
(OTCBB) under the symbol "LAKF". The OTCBB is a regulated quotation
service that displays real-time quotes, last sale prices and volume
information in over-the-counter securities. The OTCBB is not an
issuer listing service, market or exchange. Although the OTCBB does
not have any listing requirements per se, to be eligible for
quotation on the OTCBB issuers must remain current in their filings
with the SEC or applicable regulatory authority. Securities quoted
on the OTCBB that become delinquent in their required filings will
be removed following a 30 or 60 day grace period if they do not
make their required filing during that time. We cannot guarantee
that we will continue to have the funds required to remain in
compliance with our reporting obligations.

There has
been no active trading of our securities, and, therefore, no high
and low bid pricing. As of the date of this report Lake Forest
Minerals had 21shareholders of record. We have paid no cash
dividends and have no outstanding options.

PENNY
STOCK RULES

The
Securities and Exchange Commission has also adopted rules that
regulate broker-dealer practices in connection with transactions in
penny stocks. Penny stocks are generally equity securities with a
price of less than $5.00 (other than securities registered on
certain national securities exchanges or quoted on the Nasdaq
system, provided that current price and volume information with
respect to transactions in such securities is provided by the
exchange or system).

A
purchaser is purchasing penny stock which limits the ability to
sell the stock. Our shares constitute penny stock under the
Securities and Exchange Act. The shares will remain penny stocks
for the foreseeable future. The classification of penny stock makes
it more difficult for a broker-dealer to sell the stock into a
secondary market, which makes it more difficult for a purchaser to
liquidate his/her investment. Any broker-dealer engaged by the
purchaser for the purpose of selling his or her shares in us will
be subject to Rules 15g-1 through 15g-10 of the Securities and
Exchange Act. Rather than creating a need to comply with those
rules, some broker-dealers will refuse to attempt to sell penny
stock.

The penny
stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a
penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules, to deliver a
standardized risk disclosure document, which:

9

  

-
contains a description of the nature and level of risk in the
market for penny stock in both public offerings and secondary
trading;

- contains
a description of the broker's or dealer's duties to the customer
and of the rights and remedies available to the customer with
respect to a violation of such duties or other requirements of the
Securities Act of 1934, as amended;

- contains
a brief, clear, narrative description of a dealer market, including
"bid" and "ask" price for the penny stock and the significance of
the spread between the bid and ask price;

- contains
a toll-free telephone number for inquiries on disciplinary
actions;

- defines
significant terms in the disclosure document or in the conduct of
trading penny stocks; and

- contains
such other information and is in such form (including language,
type, size and format) as the Securities and Exchange Commission
shall require by rule or regulation;

The
broker-dealer also must provide, prior to effecting any transaction
in a penny stock, to the customer:

- the bid
and offer quotations for the penny stock;

- the
compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the
transaction;

- the
number of shares to which such bid and ask prices apply, or other
comparable information relating to the depth and liquidity of the
market for such stock; and

- monthly
account statements showing the market value of each penny stock
held in the customer's account.

In
addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction
in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules; the
broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the
penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive
the purchaser's written acknowledgment of the receipt of a risk
disclosure statement, a written agreement to transactions involving
penny stocks, and a signed and dated copy of a written suitability
statement. These disclosure requirements will have the effect of
reducing the trading activity in the secondary market for our stock
because it will be subject to these penny stock rules. Therefore,
stockholders may have difficulty selling their
securities.

REPORTS

We are
subject to certain filing requirements and will furnish annual
financial reports to our stockholders, certified by our independent
accountant, and will furnish un-audited quarterly financial reports
in our quarterly reports filed electronically with the SEC. All
reports and information filed by us can be found at the SEC
website, www.sec.gov.

TRANSFER
AGENT

The
company has retained Holladay Stock Transfer, Inc. of 2939 North
67th Place, Suite C, Scottsdale, Arizona as transfer
agent.

ITEM 7.
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS

We are
still in our development stage and have not generated any
revenue.

We
incurred operating expenses of $19,582 and $20,013 for the years
ended June 30, 2010 and 2009, respectively. For the year ended June
30, 2010 these expenses consisted of $2,854 in general operating
expenses, $11,728 in professional fees incurred in connection with
the day to day operation of our business and the preparation and
filing of our periodic reports and $5,000 in impairment of mineral
property. For the year ended June 30, 2009 these expenses included
$4,276 in general operating expenses, $10,737 in professional fees
and $5,000 in exploration costs.

Our net
loss from inception (June 23, 2008) through June 30, 2010 was
$45,834.

Our
auditors expressed their doubt about our ability to continue as a
going concern unless we are able to generate profitable
operations. 

LIQUIDITY
AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Our cash
in the bank at June 30, 2009 was $1,766 with $5,600 in current
liabilities. We have sold $42,000 in equity securities since
inception, $12,000 from the sale of 8,000,000 shares of stock to
our officer and director and $30,000 from the sale of 3,000,000
shares registered pursuant to our S-1 Registration Statement which
became effective on August 18, 2008. The offering was completed on
September 11, 2008.

OFF-BALANCE
SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

We have no
off-balance sheet arrangements.

SUMMARY OF
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

YEAR END -
The Company's fiscal year end is June 30.

USE OF
ESTIMATES - The preparation of the financial statements in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the
United States of America requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of
revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results
could differ from those estimates.

INCOME
TAXES - The Company provides for income taxes under ASC 740,
Accounting for Income Taxes. ASC 740 requires the use of an asset
and liability approach in accounting for income taxes. Deferred tax
assets and liabilities are recorded based on the differences
between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and
liabilities and the tax rates in effect when these differences are
expected to reverse.

ASC 740
requires the reduction of deferred tax assets by a valuation
allowance if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more
likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will
not be realized.

11

  

The
provision for income taxes differs from the amounts which would be
provided by applying the statutory federal income tax rate of 39%
to the net loss before provision for income taxes for the following
reasons:

REVENUE
RECOGNITION - The Company has no current source of revenue;
therefore the Company has not yet adopted any policy regarding the
recognition of revenue or cost.

NET LOSS
PER COMMON SHARE - Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing
the net loss available to common stockholders for the period by the
weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding
during the period. The calculation of diluted net loss per share
gives effect to common stock equivalents; however, potential common
shares are excluded if their effect is anti-dilutive. For the
period from June 23, 2008 (Date of Inception) through June 30,
2010, the Company had no potentially dilutive
securities.

STOCK-BASED
COMPENSATION - The Company has not adopted a stock option plan and
has not granted any stock options. Accordingly no stock-based
compensation has been recorded to date.

LONG-LIVED
ASSETS - The carrying value of intangible assets and other
long-lived assets is reviewed on a regular basis for the existence
of facts or circumstances that may suggest impairment. The Company
recognizes impairment when the sum of the expected undiscounted
future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset.
Impairment losses, if any, are measured as the excess of the
carrying amount of the asset over its estimated fair
value.

MINERAL
PROPERTY COSTS - The Company has been in the
exploration/development stage since its inception on June 23, 2008
and has not yet realized any revenues from its planned operations,
being the acquisition and exploration of mining properties. Mineral
property exploration costs are expensed as incurred. Mineral
property acquisition costs are initially capitalized when incurred.
The Company assesses the carrying costs for impairment at each
fiscal quarter end. When it has been determined that a mineral
property can be economically developed as a result of establishing
proven and probable reserves, the costs then incurred to develop
such property, are capitalized. Such costs will be amortized using
the units-of-production method over the estimated life of the
probable reserve. If mineral properties are subsequently abandoned
or impaired, any capitalized costs will be charged to
operations.

RECENT
ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS - From June 30, 2010 through the filing
date of these financial statements, the FASB (Financial Accounting
Standards Board) issued various Accounting Standards Updates
relating to the treatment and recording of certain accounting
transactions. Management has determined that these recent
accounting pronouncements will have no impact on the financial
statements of Lake Forest Minerals Inc.

PLAN OF
OPERATION

Our plan
is to seek, investigate, and consummate a merger or other business
combination, purchase of assets or other strategic transaction
(i.e. a merger) with a corporation, partnership, limited liability
company or other operating business entity (a "Merger Target")
desiring the perceived adv
