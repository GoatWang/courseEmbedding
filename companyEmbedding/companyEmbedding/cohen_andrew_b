That was it – that was the beginning.” READ MORE       Who is Andrew Cohen?“Andrew Cohen is the most precise teacher of the essence of spiritual conscious evolution and its social contribution. He has identified the impulse of evolution as our own subjective yearning to create, and he has given us ways of cultivating that creativity as a spiritual path toward authentic selfhood.” Barbara Marx Hubbard, author of Conscious Evolution“If the fourteen-billion-year cosmic experiment that resulted in our lives is not to end in the next few centuries, it will require brave and brilliant steps in our spiritual evolution. With instruction at once tough and tender, Andrew Cohen gives us the inspiration and the means to accomplish the greatest of all endeavors for the human spirit.”  Jean Houston, author of A Mythic Life“Andrew Cohen has arrived at an insight that is crucial for our historical situation. Enlightenment is not a movement out of the everyday world but is instead a profound entrance into deep participation in the evolution of the universe.” Brian Swimme, author of The Universe Story“Andrew Cohen’s passionate engagement with tensions at the heart of creativity give strength to his call for an individual and collective evolutionary leap forward. He invites us to step beyond being to becoming, to face our own bewilderment and invent a culture of higher consciousness.” Alex Grey, visionary artist and author of Transfigurations“Andrew Cohen made me believe that there has never been a better time to be enlightened.”  Deepak ChopraWhat is Evolutionary Enlightenment?READ MOREFeatured ContentReadContinuity is Evolutionary Nirvana (Part 2)ReadContinuity is Evolutionary Nirvana (Part 1)ReadIs the Next Buddha a Sangha?ReadThe Guru Who Learned to DriveReadFullness and EmptinessReadMortality and ImmortalityReadReaching Beyond the KnownReadThe Truth of SufferingReadGoing All The WayReadThe Man and the MasterReadWhat is the Ultimate Destination?ReadEnlightenNext Magazine: 1992-2011
