Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
Agreement and Plan of Merger
On June 30, 2017, Sun Bancorp, Inc. ("Sun"), the parent company of Sun National
Bank, entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement") with
OceanFirst Financial Corp. ("OceanFirst"), the parent company of OceanFirst
Bank, and Mercury Merger Sub Corp. ("Merger Sub"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of
OceanFirst. Pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions of the Merger
Agreement, Merger Sub will merge (the "First-Step Merger") with and into Sun,
with Sun as the surviving entity, and immediately following the effective time
of the First-Step Merger, Sun will merge with and into OceanFirst, with
OceanFirst as the surviving entity (together with the First-Step Merger, the
"Integrated Mergers"). It is anticipated that immediately following the
consummation of the Integrated Mergers, Sun National Bank will merge with and
into OceanFirst Bank, with OceanFirst Bank as the surviving bank (together with
the Integrated Mergers, the "Transaction").
The Merger Agreement has been unanimously approved by the boards of directors of
each of Sun and OceanFirst. Subject to the approval of the Merger Agreement by
Sun's shareholders in accordance with the New Jersey Business Corporations Act,
the approval of the issuance of the Stock Consideration (as defined below) by
OceanFirst's stockholders, as required by applicable NASDAQ rules, the receipt
of all required regulatory approvals and the fulfillment of other customary
closing conditions, the parties anticipate that the Transaction will close early
in the first quarter of 2018.
On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, at
the effective time of the First-Step Merger, each share of Sun common stock, par
value $5.00 per share ("Sun Common Stock"), issued and outstanding, other than
shares of Sun Common Stock held by OceanFirst or Sun, will be converted into the
right to receive either:



    (i) an amount in cash (the "Cash Consideration") equal to the sum of (A) $3.78
        plus (B) the product of 0.7884 multiplied by the volume-weighted average
        trading price of shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
        OceanFirst (the "OceanFirst Common Stock") for the five trading days
        immediately prior to the day on which the First-Step Merger occurs (the
        "OceanFirst Share Closing Price"); or




    (ii) a number of shares of OceanFirst Common Stock equal to the quotient of
         (A) the Cash Consideration divided by (B) the OceanFirst Share Closing
         Price (such quotient, the "Exchange Ratio" and such number of shares, the
         "Stock Consideration", and together with the Cash Consideration, the
         "Merger Consideration"),


in each case at the election of the holder of such share of Sun Common Stock,
subject to the allocation and proration provisions of the Merger Agreement. The
aggregate amount of Cash Consideration will not exceed the product of (x) $3.78
and (y) the total number of shares of Sun Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the effective time of the First-Step Merger.
Additionally, each outstanding and unexercised option to purchase Sun Common
Stock will convert into an option to purchase from OceanFirst a number of shares
of OceanFirst Common Stock (rounded down to the nearest whole share) determined
by multiplying (i) the number of shares of Sun Common Stock subject to such Sun
stock option immediately prior to the effective time of the First-Step Merger by
(ii) the Exchange Ratio; and the exercise price per share of the new option will
be equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (a) the per share exercise price
for the shares of Sun Common Stock subject to such Sun stock option by (b) the
Exchange Ratio (rounded up to the nearest whole cent). Each outstanding Sun
restricted stock award will vest at the effective time of the First-Step Merger
and will convert into the right to receive the Merger Consideration with respect
to each share of Sun Common Stock subject thereto. Each outstanding Sun
restricted stock unit award will be cancelled at the effective time of the
First-Step Merger, and the holders thereof shall receive the Merger
Consideration with respect to each share of Sun Common Stock subject thereto.
Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, two current members of the board
of directors of Sun will be appointed to the boards of directors of OceanFirst
and OceanFirst Bank at the effective time of the First-Step Merger.
The Merger Agreement contains customary representations and warranties from both
Sun and OceanFirst, each with respect to its and its subsidiaries' businesses.
Each party has also agreed to customary covenants, including, among others,
covenants relating to the conduct of its business during the interim period
between the execution of the Merger Agreement and the effective time of the
First-Step Merger and each party's obligation to call a meeting of its
shareholders to adopt and approve the Merger Agreement, in the case of Sun, and
to approve the issuance of the shares of OceanFirst Common Stock in connection
with the First-Step Merger, in the case of OceanFirst. Subject to certain
exceptions, Sun has agreed to recommend
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
that its shareholders adopt and approve the Merger Agreement and OceanFirst has
agreed to recommend that its stockholders approve the issuance of shares of
OceanFirst Common Stock in connection with the First-Step Merger. In addition,
Sun has agreed that, subject to certain exceptions, it will not, and will cause
its subsidiaries and their representatives not to, solicit, initiate or
knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate (including by providing non-public
information) any inquiries or proposals with respect to any other acquisition
proposals. The Merger Agreement provides certain termination rights for each of
OceanFirst and Sun, and further provides that if the Merger Agreement is
terminated under certain circumstances, Sun or OceanFirst, as applicable, will
be obligated to pay the other party a termination fee equal to $17.045 million.
As described above, the consummation of the Integrated Mergers is subject to
customary closing conditions, including (i) receipt of the requisite approvals
of the Sun shareholders and the OceanFirst stockholders, (ii) receipt of all
required regulatory approvals, (iii) the absence of any law or order prohibiting
the closing, (iv) the effectiveness of the registration statement to be filed by
OceanFirst with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") with respect
to the OceanFirst Common Stock to be issued in the First-Step Merger and
(v) authorization for listing on the NASDAQ Global Select Market of the shares
of OceanFirst Common Stock to be issued in the First-Step Merger. In addition,
each party's obligation to consummate the Integrated Mergers is subject to
certain other customary conditions, including (a) the accuracy of the
representations and warranties of the other party, subject to certain
materiality standards, (b) compliance in all material respects by the other
party with its covenants and (c) receipt by such party of an opinion from such
. . .
Item 5.02. Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors;

           Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain
           Officers.



On June 27, 2017, Sun entered into an employment agreement and change in control
continuity agreement with its President and Chief Executive Officer Thomas M.
O'Brien. The new agreements supersede Mr. O'Brien's prior employment agreement
with Sun.
Pursuant to the employment agreement, Mr. O'Brien will continue to serve as
President and Chief Executive Officer of Sun and Sun National Bank, with an
annual base salary of no less than $750,000 and a target annual bonus
opportunity of no less than 75% of his annual base salary and will be eligible
for annual equity-based award grants with a grant date fair market value of no
less than 75% of his annual base salary. If Mr. O'Brien's employment were
terminated by Sun without cause or by him for good reason prior to a change in
control, he would be entitled to (a) cash severance equal to the product of
(i) the sum of his annual base salary and the average of his annual cash bonus
for the two fiscal years prior to his termination, multiplied by (ii) the
greater of (x) 18 and (y) the number of whole and partial months remaining in
the term of the agreement up to a maximum of 24 months (the number of months
equal to such greater number, the "severance period"), divided by 12; (b) a
prorated annual bonus for the year of termination; (c) a payment equal to the
monthly premium for health insurance continuation for a number of months equal
to the severance period; and (d) vesting of any equity-based awards that would
have vested within 18 months following his termination (other than certain
matching equity-based awards that were granted to Mr. O'Brien upon his date of
hire, which would vest in full). The severance benefits are subject to
Mr. O'Brien's execution of a release of claims in favor of Sun. In addition, the
employment agreement subjects Mr. O'Brien to noncompetition and nonsolicitation
covenants until the first anniversary of his date of termination and perpetual
confidentiality and nondisparagement covenants.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Upon a change in control, Mr. O'Brien's employment agreement would be superseded
by his change in control continuity agreement. Pursuant to the terms of his
change in control continuity agreement, if, during the period immediately prior
to and two years following a change in control of Sun, Mr. O'Brien's employment
were terminated by Sun without cause or by him for good reason, he would be
entitled to (a) cash severance equal to the product of (i) three multiplied by
(ii) the sum of his annual base salary and highest annual bonus earned or
payable over a multi-year period preceding the date of termination; (b) a
prorated annual bonus for the year of termination; (c) a payment in lieu of
employer retirement plan contributions that would have been made during the
three-year period following the date of termination; (d) a payment equal to 125%
of the expected cost of premiums for coverage under Sun's welfare plans for such
three-year period; and (e) vesting of any unvested equity-based awards. In
addition, upon a change in control, Mr. O'Brien would be entitled to automatic
vesting of any unvested equity compensation awards. The change in control
continuity agreement subjects Mr. O'Brien to a perpetual confidentiality
covenant. If any payments or benefits under the change in control continuity
agreement would be subject to Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code, such
payments or benefits would be reduced to the extent that such reduction would
place Mr. O'Brien in a better after-tax position.
The foregoing summary of the employment agreement and change in control
continuity agreement with Mr. O'Brien does not purport to be complete and is
qualified in its entirety by reference to the employment agreement (included as
Exhibit 10.1 hereto) and the change in control continuity agreement (included as
Exhibit 10.2 hereto), each of which is incorporated herein by reference.
Item 8.01 Other Events
Voting and Support Agreements
Simultaneous with the execution of the Merger Agreement, OceanFirst entered into
separate voting and support agreements with (i) Bernard Brown and Sidney Brown,
along with certain other members of the Brown family and certain of their
affiliates and (ii) WLR SBI AcquisitionCo, LLC and its ultimate controlling
affiliate, WL Ross & Co, LLC, in which each such shareholder has agreed, among
other things, to vote the shares of Sun Common Stock owned beneficially or of
record by such shareholder in favor of the First-Step Merger. In addition, each
such shareholder has agreed to vote against any proposal made in competition
with the First-Step Merger, as well as certain other restrictions with respect
to the voting and transfer of such shareholder's shares of Sun Common Stock.

Forward-Looking Statements
This Current Report on Form 8-K contains "forward-looking statements" within the
meaning of the federal securities laws, including Section 27A of the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended. These forward-looking statements may include: management plans
relating to the proposed transaction; the expected timing of the completion of
the proposed transaction; the ability to complete the proposed transaction; the
ability to obtain any required regulatory, shareholder or other approvals; any
statements of the plans and objectives of management for future operations,
products or services, including the execution of integration plans relating to
the proposed transaction and the recently completed acquisitions of Cape
Bancorp, Inc ("Cape") and Ocean Shore Holding Co. ("Ocean Shore") by OceanFirst;
any statements of expectation or belief; projections related to certain
financial metrics; and any statements of assumptions underlying any of the
foregoing. Forward-looking statements are typically identified by words such as
"believe," "expect," "anticipate," "intend," "seek", "plan", "will", "would",
"target" "outlook," "estimate," "forecast," "project" and other similar words
and expressions or negatives of these words. Forward-looking statements are
subject to numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties, which change over time
and are beyond our control. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date
they are made. Neither OceanFirst nor Sun assumes any duty and does not
undertake to update any forward-looking statements. Because forward-looking
statements are by their nature, to different degrees, uncertain and subject to
assumptions, actual results or future events could differ, possibly materially,
from those that OceanFirst or Sun anticipated in its forward-looking statements,
and future results could differ materially from historical performance. Factors
that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited
to, those included under Item 1A "Risk Factors" in OceanFirst's Annual Report on
Form 10-K, those included under Item 1A "Risk Factors" in Sun's Annual Report on
Form 10-K, those disclosed in OceanFirst's and Sun's respective other periodic
reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), as well
as the possibility that expected benefits of the proposed transaction and the
Cape and Ocean Shore acquisitions may not materialize in the timeframe expected
or at all, or may be more costly to achieve; that the proposed transaction may
not be timely completed, if at all; that prior to the completion of the proposed
transaction or thereafter, OceanFirst's and Sun's respective businesses may not
perform as expected due to transaction-related uncertainty or other factors;
that the parties are unable to successfully implement integration strategies
related to the proposed transaction and the Cape and Ocean Shore acquisitions;
that required regulatory, shareholder or other approvals are not obtained or
other customary closing conditions are not satisfied in a timely manner or at
all; reputational risks and the reaction of the companies' shareholders,
customers, employees and other constituents to the proposed transaction; and
diversion of management time on merger-related matters. These risks, as well as
other risks associated with the proposed transaction, will be more fully
discussed in the joint proxy statement/prospectus that will be included in the
registration statement on Form S-4 that will be filed with the SEC in connection
with the proposed transaction. While the list of factors presented here is, and
the list of factors to be presented in the registration statement on Form S-4
will be, considered representative, no such list should be considered to be a
complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties. Unlisted factors
may present significant additional obstacles to the realization of forward
looking statements. For any forward-looking statements made in this Form 8-K or
in any documents, OceanFirst and Sun claim the protection of the safe harbor for
forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform
Act of 1995. Annualized, pro forma, projected and estimated numbers are used for
illustrative purposes only, are not forecasts and may not reflect actual
results.
