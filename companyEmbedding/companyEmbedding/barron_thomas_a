						Placed a deposit on an advertised airplane at the asking price. The plane was sold to someone else (despite the deposit) and Barron Thomas did not return my deposit. His excuse for not returning the deposit was that he was cash short. After having my attorney contact him, he agreed to a payment plan to pay back the deposit but has still not made restitution, now 3 years later.

Barron Thomas sells Four Lear Jets in Six months; Says Price is Key Today



Share Article


















Barron Thomas, Scottsdale, Arizona based airplane dealer and broker, reports the successful sale and closing of four Lear Jets in the last six months, in what is considered the worst aviation economy since World War II.







Barron Thomas

"Price is everything today; A seller must be prepared to face the realities of today's economy, not the economy of 2007"


Scottsdale, AZ (PRWEB)
June 20, 2011
 Barron Thomas, Scottsdale, Arizona based airplane dealer and broker, reports the successful sale and closing of four Lear Jets in the last six months, in what is considered the worst aviation economy since World War II.
"Price is everything today", says Barron Thomas, who has been actively selling airplanes for four decades.  See http://www.barronthomas.com
"A seller must be prepared to face the realities of today's economy, not the economy of 2007", he adds. More airplanes are chasing fewer buyers, and financing is still very difficult except for the most sterling of credits, and banks are a lot pickier about the collateral.
Also, a seller must be able to act promptly when a realistic offer is presented.
If a seller is hesitant, or tries to extend the process through endless price posturing, it opens the door for the buyer to find a better deal and the sale is lost.
Barron Thomas adds that buyers recognize that it's a buyer's market, but he cautions buyers not to be "too-empowered" and miss a truly good deal.
Barron can point to examples of where a buyer tried to endlessly haggle, trying to beat an already good price. The result of the extended haggling was that the buyer was left empty-handed. While the buyer relentlessly pushed and pushed for a "better deal", another buyer recognized the merits of the airplane and the price, and swooped in and bought it.
Mr. Endless-Haggler was left with a lot of wasted time and no airplane.
Barron Thomas owns some airplanes and as a broker generally represents only sellers. He feels his job is to widely expose the airplane to a large pool of potential buyers, both through advertising and through his "Golden Rolodex" of previous clients accumulated over a 40 year period, plus to dispassionately advise the seller on the real-world realities of today's market and prices, and then guide the seller through a sale that is in the best interest of all parties.
Barron feels that any significant turn-around is still in the future, and how far in the future is hard to determine, so he recommends a serious seller should focus on the real objective of selling the airplane, and a buyer should do likewise. No one can predict the exact date and time the market will turn, but he who hesitates, be it buyer or seller, according to Barron, often misses the deal.
Barron Thomas also advises sellers to lead with price, rather than constantly chase the market down. A sale and money-in-the-bank today is worth more than a possibly slightly higher price six months from now after the seller has spent that six months' worth of money on hangar, maintenance, insurance and taxes.  If you are the best deal, on a good airplane, even in this economy, you will get a buyer. But Barron cautions all sellers to remember the two key words: Best Deal.
That's how you sell four Lear jets in one of the worst economies in aviation history.

Licensing









                        Licensing information is provided in the BBB Business Profiles to inform the public about industries that may require professional licensing, bonding, or registration. Better Business Bureau encourages you to check with the appropriate agency to be certain any requirements are currently being met.
                    





Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.
                    





Government Actions









                        BBB reports on known significant government actions involving the business's marketplace conduct.
                    





Out of Business









                        BBB reports on a company that is out of business for three years from the date the company closes its doors or ceases to do business.
                    





Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo









                        BBB reports on unauthorized use of the Better Business Bureau's name and/or logo for as long as the business continues to use it in any advertising, or for one year after the business ceases any repeated unauthorized uses.
                    





Bankruptcy









                        BBB reports on a business’s bankruptcy as long as the business remains in bankruptcy.
                    





Mail Returned

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'

 Live Your Life as a Story


These remarks were given as part of my address to the graduating class of the University of California Santa Barbara in June 2017.

If you folks like a good story, as I do – then try this: Think of your life as a story. A Story You Create Yourself 
My own story is one with an especially bizarre plot: lots of drama, excitement, struggle, surprise, and comedy. Growing up in Colorado, I always dreamed of becoming a wr

 My Favorite Villain


Kulwych as he appears in ‘The Book of Magic’ (Merlin Saga, Book 12) 
Much of the focus of my stories is on the path of heroes, since, as Joseph Campbell so wisely taught, every great and enduring adventure involves the journey of a hero who works toward a worthy goal. But some of the most memorable stories have another very important character…. the villain. 
Villains are hugely important in a compelling story. Too often they’re painted in quick brush strokes, making shallow, un

 Nature: the Ultimate Source of Balance, Inspiration, and Magic


I remember the very first time I saw the stars on a high mountain ridge in Colorado. It was a clear summer night; no artificial lights distracted from the vista. The evening was calm, but I could feel a gentle breeze, lighter than an owl’s feather, tousling my hair as I gazed up at the vast sky. There were so many stars, all so bright, I almost had to squint just to look at them. That vision filled me with wonder, awe, and mystery—what William Wordsworth called “a presence that disturbs me wi

 More Magical Origin Stories… By Fans Like You!


In my last blog entry I shared a few of the entries from my recent Origin Story contest. The competition invited fans of my books to imagine the background of any character from one of my books, and write a short piece of fiction outlining their history. I can’t tell you how pleased I am that so many of my readers took up the challenge… and did it so well! 
In Tree Girl, young Rowanna lives in a cottage by the seaside, but and longs to see the great forest, and especially the mysteriou

 Magical Origin Stories Written by Readers


Exploring stories of untold beginnings has always appealed to me as a writer. My Merlin Saga began after I wondered about the early life of the man who became the wise and powerful old wizard we know so well from the tales of Arthurian legend. And instead of focusing solely on the mystery of the magical island’s disappearance, my recent Atlantis Saga begins by imagining what may have happened to trigger its creation. 
With this in mind, I recently invited fans of my books to dig deep i

 Giving Birth to a New Book


The very first time I hold a new book that I’ve written, I gently give it a loving hug… just as if it were a newborn baby. 
And maybe, in a way, it is. For giving a new book to the world is the closest thing to delivering life that I will ever be able to do! (Though I’ve been lucky enough to watch all of our children born and to witness their first breaths…I was still just a cheering onlooker while my wife Currie did all the hard work.) 
The metaphor goes even further. I’ve ofte

 Gratitude: The Path to a Meaningful – and Magical – Life


Long after Thanksgiving is over, two things endure – the feeling that I couldn’t possibly eat another piece of turkey… and, more importantly, a deep sense of gratitude. 
It will come as no surprise, then, to learn that I recently picked up a book called GRATITUDE by Oliver Sacks. It’s a quartet of essays that he wrote in the last two years of his life. Despite his struggles battling cancer, he chose to highlight his immense gratitude — something he felt not only through that ordeal, bu

 Wrapping up my Atlantis Lost Book Tour


As I wrote about in my last blog entry, I’ve been dashing around the country this autumn in celebration of the release of the third and final book of my Atlantis Saga. Last weekend, after an amazing Thanksgiving with family and friends, I joined readers and friends at two local bookstores to wrap up the tour with some appearances close to home. After more than 20 years I’m no stranger to book junkets, but this tour had its own special magic — the thrill of a new book being released, the joy o

 From the Atlantis Lost Book Tour


I’m more than halfway through the book tour for Atlantis Lost – and what an adventure it has been! I’ve been to 6 cities in 5 states and have been thrilled to meet so many of you and sign your books. And I’ve had some fun experiences along the way, too: I did a Writers’ Workshop at the Book Stall in Winnetka, IL, and I went Live on Facebook for the very first time from that event as well as from the event the following day at Anderson’s in Naperville.

 Atlantis Lost Book Tour!


I’m very happy to share that the third book in my Atlantis Saga, Atlantis Lost, is coming to bookstores everywhere on November 8th. In honor of this final installment in the tale of the mysterious, magical island, I’ll be visiting independent bookstores across the United States to do readings, signings, and of course — my favorite part of any book tour — to meet all of you! 
Below is the list of places where I’ll be appearing next month — I sincerely hope that if you’re in or near one
