Fitch Affirms UBSBB 2012-C2 | Business Wire


























































      Fitch Affirms UBSBB 2012-C2
    





May 21, 2015 02:37 PM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has affirmed 12 classes of UBS-Barclays Commercial 
      Mortgage Trust 2012-C2 (UBSBB 2012-C2) commercial mortgage pass-through 
      certificates due to stable performance of the underlying pool. A 
      detailed list of rating actions follows at the end of this press release.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      The affirmations of UBSBB 2012-C2 are based on the stable performance of 
      the underlying collateral pool. As of the May 2015 distribution date, 
      the pool's aggregate principal balance has been reduced by 3.5% to $1.17 
      billion from $1.22 billion at issuance. The pool has experienced no 
      realized losses to date. Approximately 29% of the portfolio consists of 
      regional malls, including five of the top 15 loans. Fitch has not 
      designated any Fitch Loans of Concern, and no loans are currently in 
      special servicing. Per the servicer reporting, two loans (0.9% of the 
      pool) are defeased.
    

      The largest loan in the pool is the 110 William Street loan (11.9% of 
      the pool), which is collateralized by an 874,426 sf, 35-story building 
      located in New York, NY at the intersection of William Street and John 
      Street. The property is located five blocks north of the New York Stock 
      Exchange and has direct access to the newly constructed Fulton Street 
      Transit Center. As of the Feb. 2015 rent roll, the property was 95.3% 
      occupied with approximately 7% tenant roll over the next year. The 
      largest tenants are New York City Economic Development (28.4% of net 
      rentable area [NRA]) and the NYS Superintendent of Insurance (12.6%). 
      The year-end 2014 servicer reported debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) 
      was 1.52x.
    

      The next largest loan is secured by a 518,000 sf portion of the Crystal 
      Mall (8% of the pool), a two-story enclosed regional mall located in 
      Waterford, CT. Per the servicer, the YTD 2014 DSCR and occupancy were 
      2.44x and 88.3%, respectively. There are four anchors at the property, 
      two of which, Macy's and Sear's, are not part of the collateral. The 
      third anchor, JC Penney (17.1% of the collateral NRA), recently renewed 
      its lease through 2019; and Bed Bath & Beyond/Christmas Tree Shops 
      (12.7%) has a lease through 2024. Approximately 24% of the collateral 
      square footage (16% of total mall sf) rolls over the next year. 
      Annualized in-line comparable sales for 2014 were reported at $294 psf, 
      which is in line with the 2013 average.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Rating Outlooks remain Stable for all classes. No rating actions are 
      expected unless there are material changes to property occupancies or 
      cash flows. The pool has maintained performance consistent with 
      issuance. Additional information on rating sensitivity is available in 
      the report 'UBS-Barclays Commercial Mortgage Trust 2012-C2 ' (July 23, 
      2012), available at www.fitchratings.com.
    

      Fitch affirms the following classes as indicated:
    

      --$38 million class A-1 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$174.8 million class A-2 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$116.3 million class A-3 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$479.7 million class A-4 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$94.2 million class A-S-EC at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$63.8 million class B-EC at 'AAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$45.6 million class C-EC at 'Asf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$203.7 class EC at 'Asf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$24.3 million class D at 'BBB+sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$47.1 million class E at 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$22.8 million class F at 'BBsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$24.3 million class G at 'Bsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      The class A-S-EC, class B-EC and class C-EC certificates may be 
      exchanged for class EC certificates, and class EC certificates may be 
      exchanged for class A-S-EC, class B-EC and class C-EC certificates. As 
      of the June 2013 remittance, all of the class A-S-EC, class B-EC and 
      class C-EC certificates had been exchanged for class EC certificates.
    

      Fitch does not rate the interest-only class X-B or class H certificates.
    

      A comparison of the transaction's Representations, Warranties, and 
      Enforcement (RW&E) mechanisms to those of typical RW&Es for the asset 
      class is available in the following report:
    

      --'UBS-Barclays Commercial Mortgage Trust 2012-C2 -- Appendix' (July 23, 
      2012).

      transactions is available in the Dec. 10, 2014 report, 'U.S. Fixed-Rate 
      Multiborrower CMBS Surveillance and Re-REMIC Criteria', which is

Fitch Affirms UBS-Barclays Commercial Mortgage Trust 2012-C4 | Business Wire


























































      Fitch Affirms UBS-Barclays Commercial Mortgage Trust 2012-C4
    





November 03, 2016 03:31 PM Eastern Daylight Time



CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has affirmed all classes of UBS-Barclays Commercial 
      Mortgage Trust 2012-C4 commercial mortgage pass-through certificates 
      series 2012-C4. A detailed list of rating actions follows at the end of 
      this release.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      The affirmations are based on overall stable performance since issuance. 
      As of the October 2016 distribution date, the pool's aggregate principal 
      balance has been reduced by 5.2% to $1.381 billion from $1.456 billion 
      at issuance. Sixteen loans (14.8% of the pool) are currently on the 
      servicer watchlist; however, nine of the loans have issues related to 
      minor deferred maintenance but not considered Fitch loans of concern. 
      Seven (8.6%) of the watchlist loans, which have occupancy and/or 
      performance issues are Fitch loans of concern. Eight loans (2.9%) are 
      fully defeased.
    

      Stable Performance: Based on full-year 2015 financial statements, the 
      pool's overall net operating income has been relatively stable with a 
      2.1% increase since last year's review and an 8.1% increase since 
      issuance for reporting loans. All loans in the pool are current as of 
      the October 2016 distribution and no loans are in special servicing.
    

      Loan Diversity: The largest 10 loans account for 48.6% of the pool by 
      balance. It was also noted at issuance that the loan concentration index 
      (LCI) was lower than average for this transaction compared to the 2012 
      peer set.
    

      Single Tenant Exposure: Two of the 10 largest assets, representing 13.1% 
      of the pool, are occupied by a single tenant or present exposure in 
      excess of 80% of the NRA to a single tenant, creating idiosyncratic risk 
      to property performance.
    

      Loan Amortization: Six loans, representing nearly 19% of the collateral 
      balance, are full-term interest-only loans, above the 2012 average of 
      13%, and one loan (0.5%) has an anticipated repayment date (ARD). The 
      pool is comprised of loans that have maturity dates in 2017 (5.1%), 2020 
      (9.6%), and 2022 (85.3%). This deal is expected to experience 
      amortization of 13.4% between securitization and maturity.
    

      Two top 10 properties had exposure to Sports Authority: Newgate Mall and 
      Clifton Commons (8.1%). Both properties experienced vacancy after the 
      tenant's bankruptcy liquidation. Both properties are considered strong 
      retail centers within its submarket and the sponsors have begun 
      negotiations with replacement tenants. Although Fitch projects 
      short-term decreases in cashflow for each asset, long-term performance 
      issues are not expected due to the sponsors' experience and strong 
      historical asset operating performance.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      The Rating Outlooks on all classes remain Stable. Fitch does not foresee 
      positive or negative ratings migration until a material economic or 
      asset-level event changes the transaction's overall portfolio-level 
      metrics.
    

      USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10
    

      No third-party due diligence was provided or reviewed in relation to 
      this rating action.
    

      Fitch has affirmed the following ratings:

      retransmission in whole or in part is prohibited except by permission. 
      All rights reserved. In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in 
      making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on 
      factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from 
      other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable 
      investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance 
      with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of 
      that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources 
      are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The 
      manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party 
      verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated 
      security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the 
      jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the 
      issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public 
      information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, 
      the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit 
      reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, 
      engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third 
      parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party 
      verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the 
      particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. 
      Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an 
      enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can 
      ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a 
      rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer 
      and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information 
      they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other 
      reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the 
      work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to 
      financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax 
      matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other 
      information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and 
      predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified 
      as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, 
      ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions 
      that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or 
      affirmed.
    

      The information in this report is provided "as is" without any 
      representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or 
      warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the 
      requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion 
      as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made 
      by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch 
      is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports 
      are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of 
      individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating 
      does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, 
      unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the 
      offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. 
      Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not 
      solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are 
      named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is 
      neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, 
      verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in 
      connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or 
      withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. 
      Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a 
      recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not 
      comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security 
      for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of 
      payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from 
      issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for 
      rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 
      (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, 
      Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, 
      or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a 
      single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to 
      US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, 
      publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute 
      a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any 
      registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, 
      the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or 
      the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative 
      efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may 
      be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to 
      print subscribers.
    

      For Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan and South Korea only: Fitch Australia 
      Pty Ltd holds an Australian financial services license (AFS license no. 
      337123) which authorizes it to provide credit ratings to wholesale 
      clients only. Credit ratings information published by Fitch is not 
      intended to be used by persons who are retail clients within the meaning 
      of the Corporations Act 2001.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

A detailed list of rating actions follows at the end of this release.KEY RATING DRIVERSThe affirmations are based on overall stable performance since issuance. As of the October 2016 distribution date, the pool's aggregate principal balance has been reduced by 5.2% to $1.381 billion from $1.456 billion at issuance. Sixteen loans (14.8% of the pool) are currently on the servicer watchlist; however, nine of the loans have issues related to minor deferred maintenance but not considered Fitch loans of concern. Seven (8.6%) of the watchlist loans, which have occupancy and/or performance issues are Fitch loans of concern. Eight loans (2.9%) are fully defeased.Stable Performance: Based on full-year 2015 financial statements, the pool's overall net operating income has been relatively stable with a 2.1% increase since last year's review and an 8.1% increase since issuance for reporting loans. All loans in the pool are current as of the October 2016 distribution and no loans are in special servicing.Loan Diversity: The largest 10 loans account for 48.6% of the pool by balance. It was also noted at issuance that the loan concentration index (LCI) was lower than average for this transaction compared to the 2012 peer set.Single Tenant Exposure: Two of the 10 largest assets, representing 13.1% of the pool, are occupied by a single tenant or present exposure in excess of 80% of the NRA to a single tenant, creating idiosyncratic risk to property performance.Loan Amortization: Six loans, representing nearly 19% of the collateral balance, are full-term interest-only loans, above the 2012 average of 13%, and one loan (0.5%) has an anticipated repayment date (ARD). The pool is comprised of loans that have maturity dates in 2017 (5.1%), 2020 (9.6%), and 2022 (85.3%). This deal is expected to experience amortization of 13.4% between securitization and maturity.Two top 10 properties had exposure to Sports Authority: Newgate Mall and Clifton Commons (8.1%). Both properties experienced vacancy after the tenant's bankruptcy liquidation. Both properties are considered strong retail centers within its submarket and the sponsors have begun negotiations with replacement tenants. Although Fitch projects short-term decreases in cashflow for each asset, long-term performance issues are not expected due to the sponsors' experience and strong historical asset operating performance.RATING SENSITIVITIESThe Rating Outlooks on all classes remain Stable. Fitch does not foresee positive or negative ratings migration until a material economic or asset-level event changes the transaction's overall portfolio-level metrics.USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10No third-party due diligence was provided or reviewed in relation to this rating action.Fitch has affirmed the following ratings:UBS-Barclays Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates Series 2012-C4--$8.6 million class A-1 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$73.3 million class A-2 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$132 million class A-3 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$150 million class A-4 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$476 million class A-5 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$104 million class A-AB 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$145.6 million class A-S at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$1.089 billion* class X-A at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$134.7 million* class X-B at 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;--$69.2 million class B at 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable;--$65.5 million class C at 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;--$61.9 million class D at 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable;--$25.5 million class E at 'BBsf'; Outlook Stable;--$18.2 million class F at 'Bsf'; Outlook Stable.*Notional amount and interest only.Fitch does not rate the $51 million class G.Additional information is available at www.fitchratings.comApplicable CriteriaCounterparty Criteria for Structured Finance and Covered Bonds (pub. 01 Sep 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/886006Criteria for Rating Caps and Limitations in Global Structured Finance Transactions (pub. 16 Jun 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/882401Global Structured Finance Rating Criteria (pub. 27 Jun 2016)Read Morehttps://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/883130U.S. and Canadian Fixed-Rate Multiborrower CMBS Surveillance and U.S. Re-REMIC Criteria (pub. 13 Nov 2015)https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/873395Related ResearchUBS-Barclays Commercial Mortgage Trust 2012-C4 -- Appendixhttps://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/699291Additional DisclosuresDodd-Frank Rating Information Disclosure Formhttps://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/press_releases/content/ridf_frame.cfm?pr_id=1014293Solicitation Statushttps://www.fitchratings.com/gws/en/disclosure/solicitation?pr_id=1014293Endorsement Policyhttps://www.fitchratings.com/regulatoryALL FITCH CREDIT RATINGS ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN LIMITATIONS AND DISCLAIMERS.

In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed.The information in this report is provided "as is" without any representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to print subscribers.For Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan and South Korea only: Fitch Australia Pty Ltd holds an Australian financial services license (AFS license no. 337123) which authorizes it to provide credit ratings to wholesale clients only.
