Young Men's Christian Association Retirement Fund


                  The YMCA Retirement Fund (YRF) seeks to balance risk and return potential. Their investment objectives include: (1) achieve total return of 3% above inflation (2) invest at least 90% of their portfolio in liquid securities to ensure the ability to pay benefits (3) maintain asset diversification through periodic rebalancing, while maintaining conformity with the target policy portfolio and (4) complement the core expertise of their in-house investment managers by hiring outside money management firms. To complement in-house managers, YRF uses several money management firms that specialize in US small-cap growth and value stocks and international stocks. Investment returns are measured against the performance benchmark for each asset class and the entire portfolio over one, three and five-year rolling periods. In addition, performance is measured against a peer group of portfolios from similar organizations over the same time periods. Though not limited by sector, YRF tends to invest in the stocks of large-cap companies in the consumer non-durables, communications, commercial services, energy minerals and non-energy minerals sectors.
