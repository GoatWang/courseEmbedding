        Have you heard the one about the horse and the chicken?
This product is only sold on line!

Most of the brooms I bought at my local Home depot are very poor quality. Some of the thin metal handles have collapsed, the plastic parts seem thin and crack easily, and the bristles become distorted after normal usage.

I had high hopes for Rubbermaid Commercial Products and the Angle Broom with Aluminum Handle. Yes, the handle is good quality and will not collapse with use. But the head is made of cheap plastic!

Rubbermaid had decided to team up a work horse and a chicken. The horse is too big for picking up worms and bugs. The chicken will break its neck and/or damage its feathers when forced to plow the field.

Several of these broom heads broke at the thin plastic screw connection for the handle. The bristles become distorted too soon, especially when the broom is not hung up off the floor.

This broom head is good for cleaning fine dust and debris. So, the less expensive model with the thin wooden handle is a better value.

When the cheap plastic broom head breaks in the costly commercial model, the handles can be reused and are great for painting. That is why it gets a "fair" rating. Nevertheless, it is not suited for commercial use as advertised.

                    Vero Shores is a wonderful, family friendly community, tucked away in the southern region of Vero Beach.  I frequent this small community quite often and it has become one of my most favorite neighborhoods in Vero Beach.  The neighborhood is very active.  Many neighbors participate in "block competitions" such as Christmas house decorating/lightings.  There are many homes in the neighborhood that are waterfront, sitting directly on the canal.  Most of them have docks with direct water access straight from the backyard.  I recently showed a waterfront home on this canal, as the sun was setting and the beauty was remarkable.  I highly recommend this delightful neighborhood!
