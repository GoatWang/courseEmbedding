Jivana Biotechnology Inc, is Pleased to Announce the Addition of Dr. Ajay Maker to Its Advisory Committee
Dr. Maker brings surgical oncology experience with expertise in liver, gallbladder. colon, pancreatic, and other cancers to Jivana Biotechnology's advisory committee.  Chicago, IL,  March 16, 2017 --(PR.com)-- Jivana Biotechnology Inc is pleased to announce the addition of Dr. Ajay Maker to its advisory committee."We are thrilled with this addition to our advisory committee," said Sid Hopps, president and chief executive officer of Jivana Biotechnology." The background and experience Dr. Maker brings to Jivana is invaluable as we move our cancer therapies into clinical development and shape our drug delivery strategies.”Dr. Maker is a surgical oncologist with board certification in general surgery. His expertise includes treating benign and malignant diseases of the liver, bile ducts, gallbladder, and pancreas, as well as colon and other gastrointestinal cancers, melanoma, and sarcoma. He joined the Division of Surgical Oncology and the Department of Microbiology and Immunology at the University of Illinois at Chicago after completing a fellowship in surgical oncology with a focus upon hepatopancreatobiliary surgery at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, and a fellowship in Tumor Immunology and Surgical Oncology at the National Cancer Institute. Dr. Maker cares for patients as part of a multidisciplinary team of medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, gastroenterologists, and radiologists who specialize in treating patients with these specific cancers.Dr. Maker graduated from Brown University with honors in fine arts and biology. Thereafter, he enrolled in the Yale School of Medicine and was selected to enter the Basic Science Research Training Fellowship where he was awarded the Medical Scholars Award from the American Diabetes Association and the Association for Academic Surgery/Novartis Research Award. Upon entering the surgical residency training program at Harvard University’s Brigham and Women’s Hospital, he had already chosen to pursue a career in surgical oncology and was accepted into the post-doctoral surgical oncology fellowship program under Dr. Steven Rosenberg in the Surgery Branch of the National Cancer Institute at the National Institutes of Health (NCI/NIH). Thereafter, he went on to complete a surgical oncology fellowship at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center.Dr. Maker serves as a reviewer for multiple surgery and scientific journals, and is a member of multiple academic and scientific societies, including the Society of Surgical Oncology’s Gastrointestinal Oncology Working Group, the Americas Hepatopancreatobiliary Association’s research committee, and the Association for Academic Surgery’s leadership committee. He currently is Director of Surgical Oncology for the Creticos Cancer Center and Director of Surgical Research for the University of Illinois Metropolitan Group Hospitals General Surgery Residency Training Program. Currently, he serves as the principal investigator on a multi-year federal research grant from the National Cancer Institute/National Institutes of Health to study the immunobiology of GI cancers.Jivana Biotechnology develops RNA interference (RNAi) therapeutics to treat a wide range of cancers including breast, ovarian, liver, lung, thyroid and pancreatic by down modulating a specific gene product that prevents programmed cell death. RNAi is a mechanism present in living cells that inhibits the expression of a specific gene, affecting production of a specific protein. Jivana’s RNAi-based therapeutics help leverage this natural pathway of gene silencing.

RNAi-Based Cancer Therapeutics












siRNA embedded in the Argonaut protein
 
RNA interference (RNAi) is a naturally occurring biological process utilized by cells to regulate and silence gene expression at the RNA level. The discovery of RNAi has been widely recognized as a groundbreaking achievement and represents a major new therapeutic advancement.  With the discovery of RNA interference (RNAi) and its adoption as a new treatment paradigm, undruggable intracellular targets are now accessible via RNAi therapeutics.RNAi has potency that goes far beyond the potency of traditional drug technologies, enabling the effective use of oligonucleotide-based, gene-directed drugs in oncology for the first time.  In addition, RNAi is gene specific, allowing maximal therapeutic effect and minimal off-target side effects.Jivana Biotechnology has exclusive global rights to a patent allowing us to deliver siRNA against a key gene target that is over-expressed in Hepatocellular Carcinomas (HCC),  breast, prostate, pancreatic, ovarian, thyroid, melanoma, and numerous other cancers.Jivana Biotechnology will deliver proprietary siRNA molecules safely and efficiently to cancer cells using various lipid nanoparticle (LNP) formulations and self assembling drug conjugates made available by its drug delivery technology partners.  The delivery formulations are specifically engineered to accumulate in tumors throughout the body and mediate efficient delivery of the siRNAs to the RNAi machinery in the cancer cell cytoplasm.The delivery particles are well tolerated and manufactured by Jivana Biotechnology’s partners using well-established GMP operations to ensure commercial consistency and scalability.Jivana Biotechnology has entered pre clinical trials for Hepatocellular Carcinoma and breast cancer.

We kill cancer cells but don't kill healthy cells

RNAi-based Cancer Drug Development
Jivana Biotechnology is a preclinical-stage biotechnology company bringing cancer therapeutics to market

Jivana Biotechnology is a preclinical stage biotechnology company that down modulates an anti-apoptotic protein in cancer cells through the process of gene silencing (delivering packaged siRNA and shRNA to specific cells to prevent gene translation). Preventing production of our target protein triggers spontaneous cancer cell apoptosis and increases cancer cell sensitivity to a variety of chemotherapeutics and inhibitory drugs.Jivana is rapidly increasing its intellectual property portfolio by filing multiple combination therapy and dosing patents and filing for orphan drug designations.Jivana therapies target greater than $20 billion in addressable markets, including breast, ovarian, pancreatic, liver, lung, thyroid, blood cancers, and more.Using targeted delivery vehicles to deliver our nucleotide sequence to the various tumor sites, Jivana Biotechnology is poised to become a leader in oncology-focused RNAi therapeutics.

webinarExploring ADC Pharmacokinetics using QSP Modeling StrategiesSeptember 13, 2017 | 2pm ET / 11am PT | Presented By Applied BioMath The Pharmacokinetics (PK) of ADC therapeutics typically show a discrepancy between the PK of total antibody and that of conjugated antibody, carrying one or more payload molecules. This will present how quantitative systems pharmacology modeling approaches provide biological insights into the impact of drug-to-antibody ratio and the resulting changes in molecular properties on overall PK and relative payload disposition as observed in preclinical and clinical studies.
