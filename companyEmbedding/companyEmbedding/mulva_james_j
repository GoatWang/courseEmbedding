Career[edit]
Mulva served as president and chief executive officer of ConocoPhillips from 2002 to 2004. Prior to that, he served as chairman and chief executive officer of Phillips Petroleum Company from 1999 to 2002. He had served as Phillips’ president and chief operating officer since May 1994 and executive vice president since January 1994. He had been senior vice president in 1993 and chief financial officer since 1990, at which time he joined the company’s management committee.
Mulva is a member of the National Petroleum Council, which is an oil and natural gas advisory committee to the US Secretary of Energy.
Mulva served as chairman of the American Petroleum Institute in 2005. He was named 2002 Petroleum Executive of the Year in recognition of the aggressive steps he took to grow and position Phillips Petroleum Company to compete in an increasingly difficult business environment.
Mulva earned his bachelor's and master's degrees in business administration from the University of Texas at Austin's McCombs School of Business. Immediately after graduating, Mulva served as a U.S. Navy officer until beginning his career with Phillips in 1973.
Mulva received an honorary Doctor of Engineering degree at the 136th annual commencement ceremony at the Colorado School of Mines on May 14, 2010. At this event, he also gave his keynote address, "Passing the Torch of Responsibility."[1]

      ■ James Mulva served as president and chief executive officer of
      Phillips Petroleum Company. During his tenure at Phillips, Mulva guided
      the company into profitable markets in Europe and Russia and headed the
      successful merger of Phillips with Conoco to form ConocoPhillips.
      Coworkers and industry peers described Mulva as a capable leader who was
      able to implement new technology, learn from other companies'
      mistakes, and direct financial decisions to meet and exceed corporate
      goals.
    

      AN INTRODUCTION TO THE IMPORTANCE OF OIL
    

      After graduating from the University of Texas with a BBA in finance and an
      MBA in business administration, Mulva immediately

      began a tour of duty in the U.S. Navy. During his first two years in the
      Navy, he was stationed on Bahrain Island. At that time, Bahrain and Saudi
      Arabia were producing enormous amounts of oil and natural gas, and Mulva
      was able to learn about the size and importance of the energy industry.
      After exposure to the production side of the sector, Mulva became
      intrigued by the complexity and geopolitical impact of the financial
      aspects of the energy industry.
    

      USING FINANCIAL SKILLS IN A CORPORATE SETTING
    

      In 1973 Mulva completed his tour of duty in the Navy and decided to enter
      the energy industry in the financial end of the business. During his job
      search, Mulva found a position in the treasury department at Phillips
      Petroleum Company that was
       a good entry-level fit. This job provided Mulva with the challenge he was
      looking for as well as practical financial knowledge and an introduction
      to the petroleum industry. Although Mulva had begun at Phillips without a
      plan to become a high-level executive, he was promoted based on his hard
      work and his ability to analyze a situation and determine a solution that
      resulted in profit to the company.
    

      GOING GLOBAL
    

      Mulva worked carefully through successive positions at Phillips to build
      the company's long-term security and assets. This work called for
      an understanding of the global market and culture before many U.S.
      companies in the sector had ventured outside the United States. As vice
      president and treasurer of the Europe/Africa division of Phillips from
      1980 to 1984, Mulva had to make critical oil-related decisions about where
      to focus assets. During a time when many oil companies were drilling in
      the Middle East, Mulva avoided Middle Eastern oil purchases and
      concentrated instead on new finds in other world locations. For example,
      in 1994 Phillips began focusing on the first offshore oil field in China
      to begin oil production. After becoming CEO of Phillips in 1999, Mulva
      continued this trend to keep assets focused in the North Sea, Venezuela,
      Asia, North America, Kazakhstan, and Russia. By concentrating on new
      markets in Europe, South America, and Asia, Mulva made a stable long-term
      investment that avoided acquisition of assets in volatile Middle East
      reserves.
    

      Mulva did not completely avoid volatile markets. In June 2004, when Russia
      began to privatize its oil industry, Mulva strongly pursued a 25 percent
      share of the Russian oil company Lukoil. He believed that he would have
      the ability to make the companies more efficient and profitable and
      increase assets while stabilizing the Russian economy. Although Mulva felt
      that his plan would enhance the business and social climate in Russia, the
      long-term success of Mulva's Russian proposal was still unknown in
      the early 2000s.
    

      Beyond purchasing assets in foreign markets, Mulva tried to pass on to his
      counterparts in foreign oil companies some of the knowledge he gained by
      entering the global market early in its development. Mulva focused on
      executives in foreign oil companies in such countries as Russia and China
      by helping them train their management personnel, handle new technology,
      and cooperate with transnational companies.
    

      NOT JUST GAS
    

      Although Phillips Petroleum Corporation was not immediately associated
      with plastics production, a large portion of the global industry Mulva was
      working with in Asia included production of polyethylene plastics made
      from natural gas liquids. In 1996 Mulva assisted Phillips in creating a
      joint venture agreement to produce polyethylene plastic in China. By the
      time Mulva became CEO in 1999, Phillips was also involved in the
      manufacture of polyolefin plastics and other chemicals.
    

      NEW TECHNOLOGY
    

      Mulva's career in the petroleum industry spanned several
      technological changes in the way the industry obtained oil. The land-based
      oil derricks in Oklahoma discovered by the Phillips brothers had been
      replaced by offshore drilling and creation of pipelines. New refinery
      processes meant application of new technology and, with it, new
      regulations. In the face of these changes, Mulva advocated creation of a
      federal system of regulations that refiners should accept "because
      that is what their customers, stakeholders, and constituents are
      demanding" (
      
        Oil Daily
      
      , March 25, 2003).
    

      In 2004 Mulva led ConocoPhillips to join a U.S. Department of Energy pilot
      project experimenting with the use of hydrogen-based transportation. As
      part of the project, ConocoPhillips planned to equip several fueling
      stations with the ability to dispense liquid and gaseous hydrogen made
      from both fossil fuels and renewable energy sources. Although the
      hydrogen-based technology was in its infancy, the project allowed
      ConocoPhillips and the other members of the project team to evaluate
      hydrogen's potential as a new transportation technology. Mulva
      recognized that to ensure long-term growth for the company, ConocoPhillips
      had to become a leader in the pursuit and implementation of cleaner energy
      sources. Mulva underlined his commitment to new sources of fuel by
      actively seeking out such projects as the U.S. Department of Energy pilot
      project on hydrogen-based technology.
    

      In addition to leading the industry in the examination of new technology,
      Mulva looked toward increased benefits for customers. Mulva and his team
      developed the ConocoPhillips "fleet card," a credit card
      that can be used at Conoco gas stations, Phillips 66 gas stations, and 76
      gas stations. Unlike other gas company cards, it is accepted at many local
      maintenance facilities as well. To assist clients with tracking and paying
      their bills, online account management is available.
    

      MANAGEMENT STYLE
    

      Mulva's financial background allowed him to analyze new ideas and
      proposals carefully, to examine the bottom line, and effectively to
      predict the ideas' long-term financial impact on the firm. This
      methodical approach helped him create a strategic plan to meet and exceed
      corporate goals and decide which new technologies would be profitable.
      Mulva also maintained a level of transparency in his actions that
      emphasized his honesty in business. As he frequently said, "If you
      don't have your health and your integrity, you don't have
      much to offer" (
      
        ConocoPhillips
      

        Newsroom
      
      , May 16, 2003). This transparency increased in importance in 2001, when
      it was learned that energy executives at Enron, an interstate and
      intrastate natural gas pipeline company also involved in trade of
      commodities, had manipulated financial statements to create an illusion of
      success. The discovery of the deception resulted in a financial crash that
      lost investors' money and bankrupted the company. After the Enron
      scandal, regulators took a close look at other energy companies and their
      executives. Mulva's policy of transparency and honesty protected
      Phillips from suspicions of financial mismanagement. In 2002
      Mulva's peers acknowledged his leadership and ability in an
      increasingly difficult business environment by presenting to him the
      Petroleum Executive of the Year award.
    

      COMMUNITY OUTREACH
    

      Given Phillips's global presence, Mulva felt that it was important
      to try to bring something other than jobs and oil to its operation
      locations. Primary among these goals was Mulva's desire to ensure
      that the company's operations did not have an adverse impact on
      community health and safety. This meant that proper safety measures had to
      be put in place to avoid increases in air, water, and land pollution as
      well as to protect the community from product spills. Also important to
      Mulva was the concept of contributing to the communities in which
      Phillips's employees worked. Phillips, and later ConocoPhillips,
      supported business internship programs, continued scholarship programs
      (such as the Phillips 66er's Scholarship Program), and established
      the Phillips Petroleum Endowed Professorships and Exchange Fellowships.
    

      ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS
    

      In 2000 Mulva faced a tragic situation when a K-resin chemical tank
      exploded at a Phillips Petroleum Company chemical plant in Pasadena. The
      explosion killed one worker, seriously burned four workers, and injured 65
      other employees. The resulting fire also produced toxic fumes that spread
      over the surrounding neighborhoods. The blast was especially worrisome
      because it was the third time in 11 years that an explosion had occurred
      at that plant. In the wake of the disaster, Mulva had to answer
      accusations that Phillips's attempts to cut costs had endangered
      their employees, created an unsafe work environment, and resulted in the
      large explosions. To salvage Phillips's reputation for safety and
      its concern for its workers, Mulva and Phillips paid a large Occupational
      Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) fine for safety violations,
      concentrated on improving plant safety, and cooperated with investigators
      to help establish accountability for the explosions.
    

      Following the 1989 Exxon 
      
        Valdez
      
       incident, in which approximately 11 million gallons of oil were spilled
      out of a damaged oil tanker off the coast of Alaska, worldwide public
      attention was focused on petroleum companies and their environmental
      records. Although Mulva's time as CEO did not begin until five
      years after the spill, the 
      
        Valdez
      
      's legacy and legislation were a constant concern that shaped the
      operations of the petroleum company. As Phillips's CEO, Mulva
      focused on the environmental impact of petroleum operations. He was
      determined to learn how to increase Phillips's holdings of oil
      through exploration and production without damaging the environment. Given
      the ability of most of Phillips's products to cause environmental
      destruction if spilled, Mulva directed frequent safety inspections of
      production operations, trained employees in safe practices, and instituted
      more safety measures to ensure that an incident like the 
      
        Valdez
      
       accident would not occur.
    

      CAREFUL ACQUISITIONS AND MERGERS LEAD TO PROFIT
    

      As CEO of Phillips, Mulva created a five-year strategic plan that used
      several mergers and acquisitions to make the company more competitive and
      increase oil exploration and production. Through increasing oil
      exploration and production, Phillips hoped to avoid being taken over by
      the huge companies resulting from the mergers of medium-sized businesses,
      such as Exxon and Mobil and Chevron and Texaco.
    

      In February 2000 Phillips joined its chemical and plastic operations with
      Chevron to create the Chevron Phillips Chemical Company. For Phillips, the
      plastics and chemical portion of the company began to decline in strategic
      importance as an asset as Phillips focused on a new strategic plan for the
      oil-and-gas sector of the business and a series of explosions at Phillips
      plants in 1999 and 2000 created public image problems. Through the
      spin-off and joint venture, Mulva helped create a global chemical
      production company with an excellent financial position, more assets, and
      enhanced growth prospects.
    

      In April 2000 Mulva led Phillips in the acquisition of the Alaskan
      oil-and-gas production assets of the Atlantic Richfield Company in an
      attempt to boost its upstream exploration and production. The Alaskan
      assets were sold to satisfy the terms of a legal settlement that resulted
      from the large BP Amoco/Arco merger. The assets augmented
      Phillips's holdings in a nonvolatile location and increased the
      company's barrels of oil equivalence to 2.2 billion reserve barrels
      of oil and 340 thousand new barrels per day of production.
    

      The 2001 merger with the Tosco Corporation, a refining, marketing, and
      transmission business, helped Phillips grow its refining business to
      become the second largest in the United States and the third-largest
      seller of motor gasoline in the United States. Phillips also added
      Tosco's large convenience
       store market and 6,400 gas stations to its lists of assets. Next came
      Phillips's merger with Conoco to become ConocoPhilips. Nationally,
      this merger moved the combined company to a position as the largest
      refiner in the United States and the third-largest energy company.
      Internationally, the merger put ConocoPhillips into position as the
      sixth-largest energy company in the world. At the time Mulva became CEO in
      1999, the company's assets were about $15 billion; after the merger
      was completed in 2002, the company's assets exceeded $75 billion.
      Mulva had learned more about large oil company mergers by watching
      carefully the successes and failures of the merger of Mobil and Exxon in
      1998 and Chevron and Texaco in 2001. He chose a financial strategy that
      focused more on saving money and cutting capital spending than on growth
      in the first years. The strategy produced enhanced financial returns and
      less debt for ConocoPhillips. By the end of the first quarter of 2004, the
      company had an income of $1.9 billion and had come very close to paring
      its debt down to 32 percent of its capital.

James Mulva

James J. Mulva (born in 1946), is Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of ConocoPhillips. Mr. Mulva served as president and chief executive officer of ConocoPhillips from 2002 to 2004. Prior to that, he served as chairman and chief executive officer of Phillips Petroleum Company from 1999 to 2002. He had served as Phillips’ president and chief operating officer since May 1994 and executive vice president since January 1994. He had been senior vice president in 1993 and chief financial officer since 1990, at which time he joined the company’s management committee. 


Mr. Mulva served as chairman of the American Petroleum Institute in 2005. He was named 2002 Petroleum Executive of the Year in recognition of the aggressive steps he took to grow and position Phillips Petroleum Company to compete in an increasingly difficult business environment.
Mr. Mulva earned his bachelor’s and master’s degrees in business administration from the University of Texas. Immediately after graduating, Mr. Mulva served as a U.S. Navy officer until beginning his career with Phillips in 1973.
Along with his wife, Miriam, Mr. Mulva has pledged $7 million towards the construction of a new library at St. Norbert College in De Pere, WI, the largest gift in the school's history; the library will be named in honor of the Mulvas.

■ James Mulva served as president and chief executive officer of Phillips Petroleum Company. During his tenure at Phillips, Mulva guided the company into profitable markets in Europe and Russia and headed the successful merger of Phillips with Conoco to form ConocoPhillips. Coworkers and industry peers described Mulva as a capable leader who was able to implement new technology, learn from other companies' mistakes, and direct financial decisions to meet and exceed corporate goals.
AN INTRODUCTION TO THE IMPORTANCE OF OIL


After graduating from the University of Texas with a BBA in finance and an MBA in business administration, Mulva immediately
began a tour of duty in the U.S. Navy. During his first two years in the Navy, he was stationed on Bahrain Island. At that time, Bahrain and Saudi Arabia were producing enormous amounts of oil and natural gas, and Mulva was able to learn about the size and importance of the energy industry. After exposure to the production side of the sector, Mulva became intrigued by the complexity and geopolitical impact of the financial aspects of the energy industry.
USING FINANCIAL SKILLS IN A CORPORATE SETTING
In 1973 Mulva completed his tour of duty in the Navy and decided to enter the energy industry in the financial end of the business. During his job search, Mulva found a position in the treasury department at Phillips Petroleum Company that was a good entry-level fit. This job provided Mulva with the challenge he was looking for as well as practical financial knowledge and an introduction to the petroleum industry. Although Mulva had begun at Phillips without a plan to become a high-level executive, he was promoted based on his hard work and his ability to analyze a situation and determine a solution that resulted in profit to the company.
GOING GLOBAL
Mulva worked carefully through successive positions at Phillips to build the company's long-term security and assets. This work called for an understanding of the global market and culture before many U.S. companies in the sector had ventured outside the United States. As vice president and treasurer of the Europe/Africa division of Phillips from 1980 to 1984, Mulva had to make critical oil-related decisions about where to focus assets. During a time when many oil companies were drilling in the Middle East, Mulva avoided Middle Eastern oil purchases and concentrated instead on new finds in other world locations. For example, in 1994 Phillips began focusing on the first offshore oil field in China to begin oil production. After becoming CEO of Phillips in 1999, Mulva continued this trend to keep assets focused in the North Sea, Venezuela, Asia, North America, Kazakhstan, and Russia. By concentrating on new markets in Europe, South America, and Asia, Mulva made a stable long-term investment that avoided acquisition of assets in volatile Middle East reserves.
Mulva did not completely avoid volatile markets. In June 2004, when Russia began to privatize its oil industry, Mulva strongly pursued a 25 percent share of the Russian oil company Lukoil. He believed that he would have the ability to make the companies more efficient and profitable and increase assets while stabilizing the Russian economy. Although Mulva felt that his plan would enhance the business and social climate in Russia, the long-term success of Mulva's Russian proposal was still unknown in the early 2000s.
Beyond purchasing assets in foreign markets, Mulva tried to pass on to his counterparts in foreign oil companies some of the knowledge he gained by entering the global market early in its development. Mulva focused on executives in foreign oil companies in such countries as Russia and China by helping them train their management personnel, handle new technology, and cooperate with transnational companies.
NOT JUST GAS
Although Phillips Petroleum Corporation was not immediately associated with plastics production, a large portion of the global industry Mulva was working with in Asia included production of polyethylene plastics made from natural gas liquids. In 1996 Mulva assisted Phillips in creating a joint venture agreement to produce polyethylene plastic in China. By the time Mulva became CEO in 1999, Phillips was also involved in the manufacture of polyolefin plastics and other chemicals.
NEW TECHNOLOGY
Mulva's career in the petroleum industry spanned several technological changes in the way the industry obtained oil. The land-based oil derricks in Oklahoma discovered by the Phillips brothers had been replaced by offshore drilling and creation of pipelines. New refinery processes meant application of new technology and, with it, new regulations. In the face of these changes, Mulva advocated creation of a federal system of regulations that refiners should accept "because that is what their customers, stakeholders, and constituents are demanding" (Oil Daily, March 25, 2003).
In 2004 Mulva led ConocoPhillips to join a U.S. Department of Energy pilot project experimenting with the use of hydrogen-based transportation. As part of the project, ConocoPhillips planned to equip several fueling stations with the ability to dispense liquid and gaseous hydrogen made from both fossil fuels and renewable energy sources. Although the hydrogen-based technology was in its infancy, the project allowed ConocoPhillips and the other members of the project team to evaluate hydrogen's potential as a new transportation technology. Mulva recognized that to ensure long-term growth for the company, ConocoPhillips had to become a leader in the pursuit and implementation of cleaner energy sources. Mulva underlined his commitment to new sources of fuel by actively seeking out such projects as the U.S. Department of Energy pilot project on hydrogen-based technology.


In addition to leading the industry in the examination of new technology, Mulva looked toward increased benefits for customers. Mulva and his team developed the ConocoPhillips "fleet card," a credit card that can be used at Conoco gas stations, Phillips 66 gas stations, and 76 gas stations. Unlike other gas company cards, it is accepted at many local maintenance facilities as well. To assist clients with tracking and paying their bills, online account management is available.
MANAGEMENT STYLE
Mulva's financial background allowed him to analyze new ideas and proposals carefully, to examine the bottom line, and effectively to predict the ideas' long-term financial impact on the firm. This methodical approach helped him create a strategic plan to meet and exceed corporate goals and decide which new technologies would be profitable. Mulva also maintained a level of transparency in his actions that emphasized his honesty in business. As he frequently said, "If you don't have your health and your integrity, you don't have much to offer" (ConocoPhillips Newsroom, May 16, 2003). This transparency increased in importance in 2001, when it was learned that energy executives at Enron, an interstate and intrastate natural gas pipeline company also involved in trade of commodities, had manipulated financial statements to create an illusion of success. The discovery of the deception resulted in a financial crash that lost investors' money and bankrupted the company. After the Enron scandal, regulators took a close look at other energy companies and their executives. Mulva's policy of transparency and honesty protected Phillips from suspicions of financial mismanagement. In 2002 Mulva's peers acknowledged his leadership and ability in an increasingly difficult business environment by presenting to him the Petroleum Executive of the Year award.
COMMUNITY OUTREACH
Given Phillips's global presence, Mulva felt that it was important to try to bring something other than jobs and oil to its operation locations. Primary among these goals was Mulva's desire to ensure that the company's operations did not have an adverse impact on community health and safety. This meant that proper safety measures had to be put in place to avoid increases in air, water, and land pollution as well as to protect the community from product spills. Also important to Mulva was the concept of contributing to the communities in which Phillips's employees worked. Phillips, and later ConocoPhillips, supported business internship programs, continued scholarship programs (such as the Phillips 66er's Scholarship Program), and established the Phillips Petroleum Endowed Professorships and Exchange Fellowships.
ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS
In 2000 Mulva faced a tragic situation when a K-resin chemical tank exploded at a Phillips Petroleum Company chemical plant in Pasadena. The explosion killed one worker, seriously burned four workers, and injured 65 other employees. The resulting fire also produced toxic fumes that spread over the surrounding neighborhoods. The blast was especially worrisome because it was the third time in 11 years that an explosion had occurred at that plant. In the wake of the disaster, Mulva had to answer accusations that Phillips's attempts to cut costs had endangered their employees, created an unsafe work environment, and resulted in the large explosions. To salvage Phillips's reputation for safety and its concern for its workers, Mulva and Phillips paid a large Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) fine for safety violations, concentrated on improving plant safety, and cooperated with investigators to help establish accountability for the explosions.
Following the 1989 Exxon Valdez incident, in which approximately 11 million gallons of oil were spilled out of a damaged oil tanker off the coast of Alaska, worldwide public attention was focused on petroleum companies and their environmental records. Although Mulva's time as CEO did not begin until five years after the spill, the Valdez 's legacy and legislation were a constant concern that shaped the operations of the petroleum company. As Phillips's CEO, Mulva focused on the environmental impact of petroleum operations. He was determined to learn how to increase Phillips's holdings of oil through exploration and production without damaging the environment. Given the ability of most of Phillips's products to cause environmental destruction if spilled, Mulva directed frequent safety inspections of production operations, trained employees in safe practices, and instituted more safety measures to ensure that an incident like the Valdez accident would not occur.
CAREFUL ACQUISITIONS AND MERGERS LEAD TO PROFIT
As CEO of Phillips, Mulva created a five-year strategic plan that used several mergers and acquisitions to make the company more competitive and increase oil exploration and production. Through increasing oil exploration and production, Phillips hoped to avoid being taken over by the huge companies resulting from the mergers of medium-sized businesses, such as Exxon and Mobil and Chevron and Texaco.
In February 2000 Phillips joined its chemical and plastic operations with Chevron to create the Chevron Phillips Chemical Company. For Phillips, the plastics and chemical portion of the company began to decline in strategic importance as an asset as Phillips focused on a new strategic plan for the oil-and-gas sector of the business and a series of explosions at Phillips plants in 1999 and 2000 created public image problems. Through the spin-off and joint venture, Mulva helped create a global chemical production company with an excellent financial position, more assets, and enhanced growth prospects.
In April 2000 Mulva led Phillips in the acquisition of the Alaskan oil-and-gas production assets of the Atlantic Richfield Company in an attempt to boost its upstream exploration and production. The Alaskan assets were sold to satisfy the terms of a legal settlement that resulted from the large BP Amoco/Arco merger. The assets augmented Phillips's holdings in a nonvolatile location and increased the company's barrels of oil equivalence to 2.2 billion reserve barrels of oil and 340 thousand new barrels per day of production.
The 2001 merger with the Tosco Corporation, a refining, marketing, and transmission business, helped Phillips grow its refining business to become the second largest in the United States and the third-largest seller of motor gasoline in the United States. Phillips also added Tosco's large convenience store market and 6,400 gas stations to its lists of assets. Next came Phillips's merger with Conoco to become ConocoPhilips. Nationally, this merger moved the combined company to a position as the largest refiner in the United States and the third-largest energy company. Internationally, the merger put ConocoPhillips into position as the sixth-largest energy company in the world. At the time Mulva became CEO in 1999, the company's assets were about $15 billion; after the merger was completed in 2002, the company's assets exceeded $75 billion. Mulva had learned more about large oil company mergers by watching carefully the successes and failures of the merger of Mobil and Exxon in 1998 and Chevron and Texaco in 2001. He chose a financial strategy that focused more on saving money and cutting capital spending than on growth in the first years. The strategy produced enhanced financial returns and less debt for ConocoPhillips. By the end of the first quarter of 2004, the company had an income of $1.9 billion and had come very close to paring its debt down to 32 percent of its capital.

Citation styles

									Encyclopedia.com gives you the ability to cite reference entries and articles according to common styles from the Modern Language Association (MLA), The Chicago Manual of Style, and the American Psychological Association (APA).
								

									Within the “Cite this article” tool, pick a style to see how all available information looks when formatted according to that style.  Then, copy and paste the text into your bibliography or works cited list.
								

									Because each style has its own formatting nuances that evolve over time and not all information is available for every reference entry or article, Encyclopedia.com cannot guarantee each citation it generates.  Therefore, it’s best to use Encyclopedia.com citations as a starting point before checking the style against your school or publication’s requirements and the most-recent information available at these sites:
								

Modern Language Association
http://www.mla.org/style
The Chicago Manual of Style
http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/tools_citationguide.html
American Psychological Association
http://apastyle.apa.org/

Notes:


										Most online reference entries and articles do not have page numbers.  Therefore, that information is unavailable for most Encyclopedia.com content.  However, the date of retrieval is often important.  Refer to each style’s convention regarding the best way to format page numbers and retrieval dates.
									

										In addition to the MLA, Chicago, and APA styles, your school, university, publication, or institution may have its own requirements for citations.  Therefore, be sure to refer to those guidelines when editing your bibliography or works cited list.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million
Updated: June 9, 2013
Data Format: CSV
License: CC-BY

2 GB gzip8 GB uncompressed

Download



The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
