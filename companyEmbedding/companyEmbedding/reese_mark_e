DoctorsAlabamaDaphneEndocrinologistsDr. Mark E. ReeseRatings for Dr. Mark E. Reese 5Staff 4Punctuality 5Helpfulness 5KnowledgeI really liked Dr Reese. His staff was nice and Dr Reese was knowledgeable and had a good bedside manner.Was this rating useful? 0 flag | Submitted August 15, 2016 1Staff 1Punctuality 1Helpfulness 1KnowledgeHorrible! Made a app. in three months. They called canceling and rescheduling and 3 months passed again they called again canceling and trying to rescheduling again. I do not recommend this doctor. The office is terrible making a appointment. They just threat people like meat and the you are there for them. Was this rating useful? 1 flag | Submitted December 10, 2015 3Staff 4Punctuality 5Helpfulness 4KnowledgeI would highly recommend Dr. Reese he is very professional he explains your situation so you can understand and when we knew I needed surgery his sweet little nurse took care of making my appointments . I feel like I am in good hands with him, and I have had lots of experiences with doctors .Was this rating useful? 0 flag | Submitted September 12, 2015 3Staff 5Punctuality 5Helpfulness 5KnowledgeAfter having a very bad experience with another endocrinologist, Dr Reese was a breath of fresh air. Was this rating useful? 0 flag | Submitted August 18, 2015 1Staff 2Punctuality 1Helpfulness 1KnowledgeDr. Reese's knowledge is limited for a specialist.Was this rating useful? 1 flag | Submitted September 22, 2014 1Staff 1Punctuality 1Helpfulness 1KnowledgeThe staff were rude and Dr Reese seems to be unconcerned about my case. I'm sorry but I wouldn't recommend him. He always talks about his personal life, that's nothing a good Dr would share with his patients, that's not why I'm there. I am there for help which is not obtained.Was this rating useful? 0 flag | Submitted March 7, 2014 1Staff 1Punctuality 1Helpfulness 1KnowledgeVery unprofessional and unwelcoming staff, and the doctor wasn't much better. Recommend finding someone else!Was this rating useful? 0 flag | Submitted February 13, 2014 4Staff 4Punctuality 5Helpfulness 5KnowledgeI absolutely love Dr. Reese. I have had horrible doctors in the past who were condescending and impersonable. I am diabetic (diagnosed in 2003) and Dr. Reese has been nothing but helpful with providing great care. He has worked with me through 2 pregnancies and helped ensure that both of my children and I were healthy :). I can't rave enough about him.Was this rating useful? 0 Submitted October 22, 2013 5Staff 5Punctuality 5Helpfulness 5KnowledgeI first saw Dr. Reese more than 14 years ago. He was very good at finding my problem with Carcinoid Syndrome. He also discovered my Grave's disease several years later. He is very good at finding out what your problem is. However, on my last visit back in Jan. 2012 he didn't mention he was about to dismiss me. He let the office staff do that and didn't give an explanation. I looked through the yellow pages and checked off Dr after Dr to treat my medical conditions, I still haven't found a Doctor. The whole Facility was unnecessarily aggressive toward me as well as my Father who tried to find out what happened as to why I was dismissed. He left me hung out to dry. I was Shocked. I was left in a terrible state and am very ill due to not being able to find another Dr. There is no compassion as far as I am concerned. I tried to contact him and he refuses to have anything to do with me. I am regarded as being very pleasant in all his notes all these years.I think I need an AttorneyWas this rating useful? 2 flag | Submitted July 5, 2012 3Staff 4Punctuality 5Helpfulness 5KnowledgeGreat doctor, very helpful andi informative. When I was 13 when I stared going to him and he was very understanding and helped tame the fear of health scares at such a young age. My health situation was not normal for most teen and he took the time to figure out everything that was happening instead of trying to put me in a box like so many of my other doctors. Great doctor, I have been with him for ten years and have to say he is one of my favorites that I deal with. I have watched the office staff go from amazing to not so great, but I am hoping that will improve .Was this rating useful? 0 flag | Submitted March 5, 2012 Rate this DoctorDr. Mark E.
