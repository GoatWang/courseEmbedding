In memory of our dear colleague and friend, Kevin Lynch.
Kevin co-founded The Townsend Group with our CEO, Terry Ahern, in 1983. During that time, he was a driving force in the growth of our great company, a friend to us all, and a constant source of encouragement and laughter for those of us who were fortunate to know him well.  Kevin’s energy, light-heartedness and optimism will be missed by all at our firm.
