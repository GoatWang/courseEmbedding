Company Description


Water Oak Advisors (WOA) services involve the development of asset allocation strategies that are implemented using no-load, institutionally based mutual funds. Their asset allocation process involves the development of model portfolios based on each client's time frame, required rate of return and personal tolerance for risk, as well as utilizing modern portfolio theory as a primary tool for portfolio construction. The firm offers both Core and Tactical Managed ETF Portfolios.WOA offers multiple Core ETF Portfolios. These strategies range from conservative to aggressive. Each portfolio is managed separately and tailored to assist respective clients in meeting their safety, liquidity and total return expectations. The investment and research process for the Core ETF Portfolios is based on forward looking market segment (asset class) decisions, as they believe asset allocation has the biggest impact on portfolio performance and risk management. Within fixed income, market segment exposure is driven by duration, yield curve positioning and non-core segment exposure. Within equities, segment exposure is determined by size, style, sector and regional exposure.WOA's Tactical ETF Portfolios seek to outperform the broad US equity market utilizing tactical asset allocation. Adjustments are made to the portfolio based on a combination of cyclical, technical and fundamental measures. Based on market conditions, these strategies can range from 100% fixed income/cash to 100% equity. Within certain strategies, leverage may be applied and overlaid to the portfolio in an attempt to amplify returns.
