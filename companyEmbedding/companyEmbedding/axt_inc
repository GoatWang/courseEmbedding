Submitted by drupaladmin on Thu, 2006-02-09 02:28.

AXT's products include both high-performance semiconductor substrates for major electronic and opto-electronic applications, and a line of industry-critical raw materials. 
In substrates, our main product line consists of gallium arsenide (GaAs) substrates in one-, two-, three-, four-, five-, and six-inch diameters. We offer a second product line of indium phosphide (InP) substrates in two-, three-, and four-inch diameters. We also produce single-element substrates  manufactured from germanium (Ge) in two- and four-inch diameters. We produce our wafers at our Tongmei facility, located in a suburb of Beijing. This large manufacturing complex totals eight buildings with about 300,000 square feet of factory area, making it what we believe is the world's largest III-V wafer production facility. 
Regarding raw materials, we participate in 10 joint ventures in China that offer products critical to the entire substrate manufacturing industry. Those materials include gallium (4N, 6N and 7N Ga), arsenic (4N, 6N and 7N) and germanium, pyrolitic boron nitride (pBN) crucibles for growing crystals, and boron oxide. These raw materials are used in AXT's products and are also sold to third parties.

Packaging and Delivery
Submitted by drupaladmin on Thu, 2006-02-09 02:47.

After manufacturing, we individually inspect all substrates, measuring their flatness, bow and taper, and checking them for surface saw marks, edge chips and cracks. We then package them in a class 100 environment and ship them to customers in inert-atmosphere individually-sealed containers to secure the substrate quality at delivery. 
In order to satisfy customers' just-in-time delivery requirements, we generally keep a consignment supply of as-sliced substrates in inventory for our standard product lines. In most cases, our customers can expect a quick turnaround in 2 to 4 weeks.

AXT, Inc. Announces Next-Generation Green LED Products

Monday 8th January 2001






 
 Source: AXT, Inc.   Higher Brightness Product Now Available in Production Quantities .  Fremont, CA. AXT, Inc. (Nasdaq: AXTI), a leading manufacturer of compound semiconductor substrates and optoelectronic devices, today announced higher brightness green light emitting diode (LED) products, which have twice the output power of the company s earlier generation LEDs. This enhanced technology will enable AXT s high brightness green LEDs to compete favorably in the large and rapidly growing outdoor and indoor display markets. Applications for these markets include video displays, traffic signals and commercial signs. The new 525 nm aluminum indium gallium nitride (AlInGaN) based high brightness green LED has a typical output power of 1.5 milliwatts at 20 milliamps (D-grade brightness). The expected packaged lamp power output for the device is 3.0 milliwatts. "The green LED is among the most challenging AlInGaN-based devices to produce at such high-brightness levels," said Morris Young, president and chief executive officer. "We have quadrupled our brightness in only six months and are very pleased with the results. This technical achievement, coupled with our low-cost manufacturing model will enable us to provide more value to our customers. We will continue to invest in advancing our technology with the goal of becoming a leader in the high-brightness segment," he said. About AXT, Inc. AXT designs, develops, manufactures and markets high-performance compound substrates for the fiber optics and communications industries. The company s proprietary Vertical Gradient Freeze (VGF) crystal growth technology produces low-defect, semi-insulating and semi-conducting gallium arsenide, indium phosphide and germanium wafers. AXT is also a leading producer of light-emitting diodes (LEDs), such as blue, cyan and green LEDs, for the display and lighting industries and vertical cavity surface emitting lasers (VCSELs) for the fiber optics industry. For more information, see AXT s website at www.axt.com. The company can also be reached at 4281 Technology Drive, Fremont, California 94538 or by calling 510-683-5900. AXT is traded on the Nasdaq National Market under the symbol AXTI. Safe Harbor Statement This press release contains forward-looking statements regarding the availability, performance and market acceptance of new LED products, the company s ability to bring these products to market and the current market conditions in the optoelectronic device industry. Forward-looking statements address matters that are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to:  unpredictable fluctuations in our operating results due, among other factors, to our expansion of our China operations, the limited availability and increased cost of raw materials and timing of orders from customers; shortage of critical raw materials, particularly gallium and arsenic, where we depend on a limited number of suppliers; an inability to expand our manufacturing capacity to meet demand for our products;  failure to achieve anticipated sales of our new HB LED and VCSEL products; our substrate and opto-electronic device products have a long sales cycle that makes it difficult to plan our expenses and forecast our results; we may experience low product yields, that might result in delayed shipment of our products;  if we do not comply with environmental regulations we may incur large fines; loss of key substrate customers would hurt our operating results; if our expansion in China is costlier than expected, our operating results will suffer, and we continue to be dependent on revenue from international sales.  Reference is made to AXT s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including AXT s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 1999 and its Form 10-Qs filed for each of the subsequent quarters, and to AXT s Form S-3, for further discussion of risks and uncertainties regarding AXT s business.

AXT, Inc: A Cash Hoard, Share Buybacks, And Other Potential Catalysts Make This $2 Tech Stock Attractive - AXT Inc (NASDAQ:AXTI) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»AXT, Inc: A Cash Hoard, Share Buybacks, And Other Potential Catalysts Make This $2 Tech Stock AttractiveJan.30.14 | About: AXT Inc (AXTI) Hawkinvest Value, growth at reasonable price, contrarian, GrowthEditors' Note: This article covers a stock with less than a $100 million market cap. Please be aware of the risks associated with these stocks.
AXT, Inc. (NASDAQ:AXTI) is a small tech company that appears to have been through some real highs and lows. In the early 2000's, this stock was trading for over $43. The financial crisis took the stock down to about a buck in May 2009, but it then surged to nearly $11 in January 2011. As most investors know, it's not uncommon for tech stocks to go through these boom and bust cycles. It's also well known that it can really pay off big to buy at the lows, if the company has the potential for another "up cycle".
This company primarily designs and manufactures semiconductor substrates which are often used in wireless communication products, fiber optics, and LED applications. AXT, Inc. has annual revenues of about $86 million and the stock appears to be undervalued at current levels due to a large amount of cash. Plus there is always the potential for the company to "reinvent" its business model. While it is hard to say if this stock is poised for a significant move higher any time soon, there are some factors that make this stock worth considering or at least watching.

As the chart shows, this stock has been in an uptrend in recent months. It bottomed out at about $2.15 per share in October, and then went up to about $2.70 in early 2014. The recent market pullback seems to have put pressure on this stock, however, this could be an ideal buying opportunity. As the light blue line on the chart shows, this stock remains in an uptrend and it is now resting at the low end of the recent trading range. In the past few months, investors who have bought the stock when it traded near the blue uptrend line were rewarded, and it has also paid to sell when it touched the high end of the recent trading range which is now around $2.70 per share (as indicated by the purple trend line). It's never a sure thing but these patterns are certainly worth considering.

For a company with a market capitalization of about $75 million, this one has a cash hoard. It has just over $36 million in cash which is equivalent to around $1.12 per share and no debt on the balance sheet. This is a considerable amount of cash for a stock trading at just over $2 per share. It also appears undervalued based on book value which is around $4.18 per share. When you factor in the cash and that it has no debt, it shows that the enterprise value is right around $43 million. This is another sign the company is undervalued, especially when considering the annual revenues of nearly $86 million.
The cash hoard reduces downside risks for investors and gives the company flexibility to develop new products and invest in marketing. One potential downside risk that needs to be considered is the fact that this company has recently posted losses. For the third quarter of 2013, it lost $2.3 million or about 7 cents per share. The loss was partially due to a decline in gross margins, from 12.9% in the second quarter to 11.9% in the third quarter. This gross margin decline was due to a change in the product mix sold in that quarter. However, the potential downside risks from a small quarterly loss seem minimal for a stock trading at these levels, especially since the company has plenty of cash.
Clearly, the company needs to increase sales or increase profit margins in order to return to a level of solid profitability. Another option would be to invest in new product lines and adapt to new market demands in order to create shareholder value. In addition to its main line of business, this company owns stakes in five joint ventures. It is the majority owner in three of these ventures which gives it board level control. In one company, "Nanjing Jin Mei Gallium Co, Ltd." which produces "6N, 7N Ga, and B203" (Gallium), it owns an 83% stake.
The stakes in these businesses may have more value than the current stock price indicates. The 83% stake in the company that produces gallium seems most interesting since gallium can be used like liquid chocolate in 3D printers. While this has not hit the mainstream yet, it could be a potential future business opportunity. 3D printing could revolutionize manufacturing and allow individuals to have a mini factory in their homes. While most 3D printers use thermoplastics, other materials like gallium allow printers to make metal products. An article from Extremetech.com explains the potential for gallium in 3D printing, which states:

"Gallium is the chocolate of metals. With a melting point of 86 degrees, the stuff will literally melt in your hand, and then solidify when you put it down. This melting point can be lowered by alloying with Indium to make a non-toxic substitute for mercury in applications like thermometers and tilt switches. Gallium has another trick up its sleeve, in which it rapidly forms an oxide skin when exposed to air. This property has recently been exploited by researchers at NC State to do something pretty incredible-print stable 3D structures using room temperature liquid metal."
It's far too early to know if gallium usage will grow and if this company will capitalize on 3D printing in the future, but it sure seems to be an interesting point to consider as it could be a game changer. As a high tech company, AXT, Inc. could be positioned to benefit from this potential in the future, if the market for gallium in 3D printing grows. That is a big if, but the fast growth in the emerging 3D printing industry is bound to create many opportunities that the market is not fully aware of now. That potential makes this stock worth watching. The cheap valuation, a cash hoard and the recent pullback make it a stock to consider buying as a turnaround play. Management also seems to think the shares are trading at bargain levels and worth buying since it authorized a $6 million stock buy back just last year.
Here are some key points for AXT, Inc.:Current share price: $2.35The 52 week range is $2.10 to $3.43Annual dividend: n/a

Competition: Primary competition in the market for compound semiconductor substrates includes Beijing Compound Crystal Technology, Ltd.; Freiberger Compound Materials; Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation; and Sumitomo Electric Industries. AXTI believes at least two of its competitors are shipping high volumes of GaAs substrates manufactured using a technique similar to its VGF technique. In addition, it also faces competition from compound semiconductor device manufacturers that produce substrates for their own internal use, including Hitachi (HIT), and from companies such as IBM that are actively developing alternative compound semiconductor materials. AXTI is the only compound semiconductor substrate supplier to offer a full suite of raw materials.

Investment Thesis:
AXTI's business model is attractive for a number of reasons including:
1. High barriers to entry in its industry with a supply chain that is nearly impossible to replicate. It has joint venture ownership interests in numerous Chinese companies that control extremely rare and critical materials called gallium, germanium and indium. These materials are so limited in production that they were labelled as critical materials by the EU.
These JVs were set up over the course of the past 10 years, and represent significant hidden value to shareholders. The JVs ensure critical raw materials in the supply chain and partially insulate the company against the cost pressures facing its competition. The company spent the better part of the decade optimizing its supply chain and seeking high client qualification requirements to win business and slowly take market share. Given China's increasingly tight grip on rare earth elements and critical materials in the past few years, it would be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to reproduce what AXTI has accomplished.
[Click all to enlarge]2. Few competitors and increasing market share. There are very few competitors in the markets AXTI sells to, and none control the supply chain like it does. A few main competitors are located in Japan, and as of this write-up, there are reports that Hitachi Cable has had some severe issues and may be offline for several weeks or even a couple of months. Competitor Sumitomo appears to be nearly unaffected, as its crystal growth is well south of Tokyo. Nevertheless, given the precarious position of having a high concentration of supply in Japan, customers may increasingly turn to AXTI for a more secure/stable source of product supply. Given capacity expansions in recent years and further planned expansion, AXTI may be best positioned to respond to customer demands.

3. Operating leverage: There's tremendous operating leverage in the business due to its low cost operations in China. While sales have grown at a 5yr CAGR of 38%, SG&A has grown at sub 2%. SG&A margin has fallen from almost 50% in 2005 to 14.6% in 2010. Likewise, years of R&D spending are finally paying off and have decreased from 6.5% of sales in 2005 to 2.4% of sales in 2010. Most R&D spending goes to process improvement and manufacturing efficiency research. Gross margin improvement has increased from the mid-20% range in 2008/2009 to a record 39.8% in Q4'10. This margin improvement is despite increasing gallium/germanium/indium raw material costs. Management has guided steady state gross margins in the 35-40% range, so anything above 40% represents material upside.4. Minimal capex requirements to expand capacity to meet growing customer demand: Total manufacturing space in China is ~190,000 square feet, 160,000 square feet of which is currently being used; the company is currently preparing the remaining 30,000 square feet for increased wafer processing. It also expects to begin construction of a new 80,000 sq ft facility in Beijing. Competitors typically purchase crystal growing furnaces from original equipment manufacturers. In contrast, AXTI designs and builds its own VGF crystal growing furnaces, which it believes should allow it to increase production capacity more quickly and cost-effectively. Total capex is estimated to be $11m in 2011 and should easily be covered by cash from operations.
Recent Developments:
AXTI's share price had steadily been rising throughout 2009-2010 as it recovered from the industry downturn and proved capable of consistently delivering earnings ahead of its guidance. The company attracted two research brokers, including Needham and Northland, who each placed $10+ targets and backed the company's outlook for strong secular growth.

In the recent quarter, the company met its quarterly estimates, but offered softer Q1'11 guidance than the overly bullish analysts had hoped for by only 2 cents, due to a seasonally weak Q1 LED market. Even though the company's Q1'11 guidance range of $0.11-0.13 cents/share represents 28-63% growth over Q1'10 results of $0.08 cents/share, analysts aggressively cut estimates for 2011 almost to the point of expecting no EPS growth, and the stock has fallen over 50% from its highs earlier this year.
Part of the precipitous stock decline can be explained by the fact that AXTI's two largest shareholders are quant fund managers, and as short sellers piled in, the selling pressure was exacerbated. As a result, AXTI's stock price is excessively discounted by any extreme valuation measure. To put the current price in perspective, AXTI's share price has fallen to a level it traded at in 2007. Yet in 2007 revenues/eps were $58m/$0.16c vs. today at $95m/$0.59c. Clearly, the price drop is excessive in relation to the tremendous growth and operational improvement AXTI has experienced and will see going forward.
The trading value comparables indicate AXTI has one of the best EBITDA margins, and growth prospects, yet trades at a meaningful discount to peers such as TriQuint (TQNT), Oclaro (NASDAQ:OCLR), Avago, Rubicon Technology (NASDAQ:RBCN), Kopin (NASDAQ:KOPN), Emcore (NASDAQ:EMKR), Anadigics (NASDAQ:ANAD) and IQE.The balance sheet is strong with plenty of cash and no debt. I calculate the working capital per share is $2.78 vs. a $6.45 stock price. Looked at another way, almost 45% of the stock price is in working capital. Alternatively, with $1.27 in cash, ~20% of the stock price is backed by cash. These figures offer exceptional margin of safety at today's price.

On a cash-adjusted basis, AXTI's sub 9x P/E valuation looks even more compelling as does a forward EBITDA multiple below 6x. Catalysts:
AXTI is now in the penalty box with analysts and quant funds after the past quarter; it's now a show-me story and will have to prove out that Q1 is just a seasonal hiccup and not indicative of broken growth prospects. Catalysts will be new client wins, analyst upgrades, LED pick-up, indicatons of increasing market share due to Japan disruption, advancement of CPV solar technology, margin preservation and expansion in the face of rising input costs.
Risks:

Wireless mobile, LED and terrestrial CPV solar markets are not in secular growth period.
LED softness in Q1'11 is more than seasonal correction and will be prolonged.
AXTI's JV ownership does not represent a strategic competitive advantage in its industry and are not hidden value.
JVs in raw material suppliers will not allow AXTI to control input cost inflation and gross margins reduce materially below the 35-40% indicated by management.
Transition to lower cost compound semi substrate technology.
Delays in capacity expansion leading to inability to deliver for clients.
Disruptions in Japan have a net short term negative effect on the company.

AXT, Inc. Announces Fire Damage in Manufacturing Production Area




















March 16, 2017 07:30 ET

 | Source: AXT, Inc.






FREMONT, Calif., March  16, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- AXT, Inc. (Nasdaq:AXTI), a leading manufacturer of compound semiconductor substrates, today announced that an electrical short-circuit fire occurred at its Beijing manufacturing facility on the evening of March 15, 2017, local time.  The fire was located in its gallium arsenide and germanium crystal growth production area and production in that area has stopped.  No injuries occurred and there was no structural damage.  Although indium phosphide crystal growth, as well as the wafer processing areas for gallium arsenide, indium phosphide and germanium were not affected, the processing of all wafer substrates has been halted. The Company is working with the fire department and other local regulatory agencies to identify the cause of the fire and form a plan to resume production as quickly as possible.  Due to the immediacy of this event, no details are yet available.  Morris Young, CEO, and Gary Fischer, CFO, traveled to Beijing earlier in March and remain on site at this time to oversee the situation. As a result of this event, the Company now believes that revenue for the first quarter, ending March 31, 2017, will be in the range of $18.0Mto $18.5M, compared with previous guidance of $19.5M to $20.5M.  About AXT, Inc.  AXT designs, develops, manufactures and distributes high-performance compound and single element semiconductor substrates comprising indium phosphide (InP), gallium arsenide (GaAs) and germanium (Ge) through its manufacturing facilities in Beijing, China.  In addition, AXT maintains its sales, administration and customer service functions at its headquarters in Fremont, California.  The company’s substrate products can be used primarily in fiber optic communications, 3-D sensing, solar cell, lighting display applications and wireless communications. Its vertical gradient freeze (VGF) technique for manufacturing semiconductor substrates provides significant benefits over other methods and enabled AXT to become a leading manufacturer of such substrates. AXT has manufacturing facilities in China and, as part of its supply chain strategy, has partial ownership in ten companies in China producing raw materials. For more information, see AXT’s website at http://www.axt.com.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
