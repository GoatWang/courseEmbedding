Quality. Trust.The best companies put a lot of effort into building and maintaining their brand image. They're attentive to customers' wants and needs, stay current with the latest technology, and of course offer the best products backed up with industry leading customer service and warranties. When you shop for brand names you can buy with the confidence that comes from knowing that you're getting a product with a proven reputation for quality, reliability and performance. We're consumers just like you and brand names are just as important to us. That's why we carry only the top brands in the automotive aftermarket. Check out the extensive list of brands we offer and you'll see names that you know and trust, because we wouldn't sell you anything we wouldn't put on our own vehicles.Our wide range of brands means you'll always be able to get exactly what you need no matter what you're doing to your vehicle or what you're driving. Want a spoiler for your Civic? Choose from 7 different brands, each offering a selection of styles and materials. Need brakes for your Chevy pickup? There are 14 brands to choose from at prices and friction compounds to suit your wallet and driving style. How about a performance exhaust system for your Mustang? We offer 8 different brands so you can get the performance and sound you want in your choice of material and price. These are just a few examples of the tremendous variety you'll find on our digital shelves. When you shop here you'll never have to settle for a color or style you don't really want because "that's all they had".Some retailers buy end lots, closeouts, and fakes and pose as approved dealers, only to leave you in the lurch when there's a problem. You'll never be in that predicament with us because we are authorized dealers for most of the brands we sell and we have ongoing business relationships with those companies. This benefits you because when you shop with us you can be assured that you're getting the genuine article, not some cheap knock-off, and you'll have all the support the company offers including a valid warranty in the unlikely event you have a problem with your purchase. Our status as authorized dealer also allows us to offer sales and promotions sanctioned by the manufacturer, including discounted prices, manufacturers' rebates, and product giveaways.Featured VideosForgiato Difalco Grille01Curt02Kenwood Car Entertainment Systems03Rigid Industries Tortured04Backrack05We don't just sell auto parts and accessories, we're enthusiasts like you and we use the products we carry on our own vehicles. Our staff's automotive interests are as varied as our brands, and they're into everything including lifted 4-wheelers, tuner cars, muscle cars, drag racing, and autocross. We install the brand name products we sell and test them on our own cars and trucks. The employee parking area looks like a product testing lab with plenty of wheel and tire combos, body kits, spoilers, and custom grilles, slammed sports models and sky high 4-wheelers. Under those hoods there's cold air intakes, turbochargers, and performance tunes, and when they're fired up you'll hear the throaty rumble from free-flowing exhaust systems. If we find that a product doesn't measure up to our standards, we won't sell it. When you buy from us you get the best purchasing experience possible because of the familiarity and experience we have with our brands.

Aerial population estimates of wild horses (Equus caballus) in the Adobe Town and Salt Wells Creek Herd Management Areas using an integrated simultaneous double-count and sightability bias correction techniqueProduct Type: Open-file ReportYear: 2007Author(s): Lubow, B.C., and J.I. RansomSuggested Citation: Lubow, B.C., and J.I. Ransom. 2007. Aerial population estimates of wild horses (Equus caballus) in the Adobe Town and Salt Wells Creek Herd Management Areas using an integrated simultaneous double-count and sightability bias correction technique. Open File Report 2007-1274. U.S. Geological Survey. 13 p. An aerial survey technique combining simultaneous double-count and sightability bias correction methodologies was used to estimate the population of wild horses inhabiting Adobe Town and Salt Wells Creek Herd Management Areas, Wyoming. Based on 5 surveys over 4 years, we conclude that the technique produced estimates consistent with the known number of horses removed between surveys and an annual population growth rate of 16.2 percent per year. Therefore, evidence from this series of surveys supports the validity of this survey method. Our results also indicate that the ability of aerial observers to see horse groups is very strongly dependent on skill of the individual observer, size of the horse group, and vegetation cover. It is also more modestly dependent on the ruggedness of the terrain and the position of the sun relative to the observer. We further conclude that censuses, or uncorrected raw counts, are inadequate estimates of population size for this herd. Such uncorrected counts were all undercounts in our trials, and varied in magnitude from year to year and observer to observer. As of April 2007, we estimate that the population of the Adobe Town /Salt Wells Creek complex is 906 horses with a 95 percent confidence interval ranging from 857 to 981 horses.
