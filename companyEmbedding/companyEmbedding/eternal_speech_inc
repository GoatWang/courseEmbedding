Eternal Speech, Inc. has not developed its services yet and has no Market
presence or experience thus far. In order to enter the Market, we must
successfully implement our plan of operations, which is dependent on the success
of this offering.

We will be competing against already established companies in this industry.
There are many sites dedicated to memorial services and they all have the basic
features of pictures, videos, music and virtual gifts such as flowers and
candles. None of these sites offer the interactive, time sensitive features that
we intend to offer. Our product features, from what we have researched, appears
to be unique on the memorial Internet product space.

The top 10 memorial sites are iLastin, Imorial, Legacy, Mem, NeverGone,
Remembered, Sanctri, Tributes, YourTribute and foevermissed.

Our success depends on our ability to differentiate ourselves in the market with
a unique product that offers an effective and reliable service and developing a
successful Marketing campaign.


Company Description
We were incorporated on February 19, 2015 in the State of Nevada. We plan to
provide a subscription service where subscribers can leave texts, voice and/or
video messages to individuals that may receive the messages after the subscriber
has passed away.
---

We plan to set up our services so each


 subscription would allow the subscriber
to leave up to 10 messages, being voice, video files and/or text messages. Each
message will be encrypted and stored in the subscriber’s Microsoft™ One Drive
Cloud Storage Account. The subscriber can decide on specific times when the
messages will be sent to its intended recipient’s email account; up to 10
recipients will be able to receive an individual message each at the same time.

The intention of the Company is to have the messages stored on the system for 10
years. Subscribers could send a birthday message annually for 10 years post
mortem. The subscriber will leave instructions in their Will for their Estate
executor or executrix to login to the Eternal Speech website with a special
login and password that will alert the system of the subscriber’s passing; then,
the system will start its automated timed sequence of events as requested by the
Subscriber.

The service will consist of a Website and an easy to use downloadable 
application that will allow the subscriber to record their voice, video and/or
text messages and easily upload it to the website.  The Subscriber will be shown
how to sign up for a free Microsoft™ One Drive Cloud Storage Account that will
give them 15 gigabytes of free storage, Eternal speech will use the Subscriber’s
free account to store their encrypted messages until their delivery date.

The Company intends to charge $399 dollars for the service and intends to market
its product in partnership with Funeral Homes, Cemeteries, Assisted Living
Facilities and their operators. The Company intends to split the sales revenue
with its partners. Today many individuals purchase their cemetery plots prior to
their death including grave markers and various other services offered by the
Funeral Home, the Eternal Speech Service would become another service offered by
the Funeral Home or Cemeteries. The Company also intends to partner with
Assisted Living Facilities and operators who cater to the Company’s target
market.

	Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements




	 




	1.  Business Description







	Basis of Presentation







	The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements of 4Cable TV International Inc. and its subsidiary have been prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, including the instructions to Form 10-Q and Regulation S-X. Certain information and note disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America have been condensed or omitted from these statements pursuant to such rules and regulations and, accordingly, they do not include all the information and notes necessary for comprehensive consolidated financial statements and should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2014, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on April 15, 2015.







	In the opinion of the management of the Company, all adjustments, which are of a normal recurring nature, necessary for a fair statement of the results for the nine month period have been made.

	Description of Business




	 




	4Cable TV International, Inc., was incorporated in Nevada on November 8, 2007. The Company was engaged in the business of developing, manufacturing, and selling artificial lobster meat specifically for major food retailers in Southeast Asia.







	4Cable TV, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of 4Cable TV, International, Inc.,

	 

	was incorporated on May 19, 2005 as a South Carolina Corporation and has been a specialty solutions provider for the cable television (“CATV”) sector spanning the range of repair, upgrading, and testing. The Company provides service and customized solutions to CATV operators and was founded by two veterans of the cable industry seeking a new challenge to work on diagnostic and repair issues for cable operators.







	When used in these notes, the terms "Company", "we", "us" or "our" mean 4Cable TV International, Inc. (“4Cable”) and all entities included in our consolidated financial statements.

	2. Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)



	 




	Estimates and Assumptions







	Management uses estimates and assumptions in preparing financial statements in accordance with general accepted accounting principles.  Those estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of the assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported revenues and expenses.   Actual results could vary from the estimates that were assumed in preparing these financial statements.







	The most significant estimates and assumptions include the:




	 








	•






	Impairment, useful lives and salvage values of our machinery and equipment




	 








	•






	Reserve for excess and obsolete inventory



	 







	•






	Loss contingencies



	 







	•






	Allowance for doubtful accounts



	 







	•






	Derivative liabilities











	It is reasonably possible that these above significant estimates we make may change in the future and could have a material effect on our financial statements.







	Financial Instruments







	The Company’s financial instruments include cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, convertible debt, notes payable, and related party debt, the carrying amounts of these financial instruments are considered by management to approximate their fair value due to their short term maturities.







	Fair Value of Financial Instruments







	The Company applies fair value accounting for all financial assets and liabilities and non-financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. The Company defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities, which are required to be recorded at fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which the Company would transact and the market-based risk measurements or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, such as risks inherent in valuation techniques, transfer restrictions and credit risk. Fair value is estimated by applying the following hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement:

	4Cable

	TV International Inc.





	Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements



	 





	2. Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)





	 




	Level 1 – Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.







	Level 2 – Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.







	Level 3 – Inputs that are generally unobservable and typically reflect management’s estimate of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.







	The Company’s valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of money market funds and certain marketable equity securities were derived from quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. The valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of all other financial instruments, all of which have counterparties with high credit ratings, were valued based on quoted market prices or model driven valuations using significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.







	Cash and Cash Equivalents







	Cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of cash on deposit, certificates of deposit, money market accounts, and investment grade commercial paper that are readily convertible into cash and purchased with original maturities of three months or less.




	 




	Accounts Receivable







	Accounts receivable represents receivables, net of allowances for doubtful accounts. The allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the accounts receivable balance. As of March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, we had allowance for doubtful accounts of $16,039. We determine the allowance based on historical experience and other currently available information. When a specific account is deemed uncollectible, the account is written off. For the three months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013, we had no write offs of accounts receivable.







	The Company factors substantially all of its invoices for certain customers (approved by the third party factor) without recourse to us and paid factoring fees of $12,536 and $8,547 for the three months ended March 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.







	Under our factoring agreement, invoices for products are generated and transmitted to our customers, with copies to the factor as products are shipped to our customers.  The factor collects the amounts due and remits collected funds to us, less factoring fees. The invoiced amounts are reported as accounts receivable on our balance sheets, generally when the merchandise is shipped to our customer until payment is received from the factor.

	2. Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)




	 




	Concentrations of Risk







	Sales to two customers accounted for 73% of the Company’s total net sales during the three months ended March 31, 2015 compared to 81% for two customers during the three months ended March 31, 2014. Other than the customers mentioned above, no customer accounted for 10% or more of the Company’s total net sales for the three months ended March 31, 2015 and 2014.







	Inventories







	Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Inventory cost is determined on a weighted average cost method. The Company maintains reserves to reduce the value of inventory to the lower of cost or market, including reserves for excess and obsolete inventory.







	Evaluation of Long-Lived Assets







	The Company periodically reviews its long-term assets and makes adjustments, if the carrying value exceeds fair value, based on the undiscounted cash flows expected to be derived from the use and ultimate disposition of the assets. Assets identified as impaired are carried at estimated fair value. Due to the changing technology and market conditions, it is possible that future impairment reviews may indicate additional impairments of our long-lived assets, which could result in charges that are material to the Company’s results of operations.




	  




	Property, Plant and Equipment




	 




	Property and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Expenditures that extend the life, increase the capacity, or improve the efficiency of property and equipment are capitalized, while expenditures for repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. Depreciation is recognized using the straight-line method over the following approximate useful lives:







	Depreciation is recognized using the straight-line method over the following approximate useful lives:




	 








	Machinery and equipment including capitalized leased equipment






	5 to 7 years








	Buildings including capitalized leased buildings






	27.5 years








	 




	Product Warranties







	The Company does not have any written obligation to replace malfunctioning equipment or repair defects.  To-date, such replacement or repair requests from customers have been immaterial in amount and frequency and the Company has dealt with such requests on a case-by-case basis.

	Revenue Recognition







	The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or service has been rendered, the selling price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. Product sales revenue is recognized when the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer and revenue is measurable. Service revenue is recognized at the time the service is complete and the customer has received an invoice. Revenue is recorded at the net amount to be received after deductions for estimated discounts, allowances and returns.







	Advertising and Development







	The Company expenses advertising and market development costs as incurred. Total advertising and marketing costs were $2,261 and $43,684 for the three months ended March 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.







	Research and Development Costs







	Research and development (“R&D”) costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred. R&D costs include materials, equipment and facilities that have no alternative future use, depreciation on equipment and facilities currently used for R&D purposes, personnel costs, contract services and reasonable allocations of indirect costs, if clearly related to an R&D activity. Expenditures in the pre-production phase of an R&D project are recorded as R&D expense. However, costs incurred in the pre-production phase that are associated with output actually used in production are recorded in cost of sales. A project is considered finished with pre-production efforts when management determines that it has achieved acceptable levels of scrap and yield, which vary by project. Expenditures related to ongoing production are recorded in cost of sales. Total R&D costs were $16,391 and $14,434 for the three months ended March 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.







	Income Taxes







	The Company utilizes the liability method of accounting for income taxes.  Under the liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and the tax bases of the assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect, when the differences are expected to be reversed. An allowance against deferred tax assets is recorded, when it is more likely than not, that such tax benefits will not be realized.







	Basic and Diluted Net Loss Per Common Share




	 




	Basic loss per common share equals net loss divided by weighted average common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted loss per share includes the impact on dilution from all contingently issuable shares, including options, warrants and convertible securities. The common stock equivalents from contingent shares are determined by the treasury stock method. The Company incurred net losses for the three months ended March 31, 2015 and 2014, and therefore, basic and diluted loss per share for those periods are the same as all potential common equivalent shares would be anti-dilutive.







	Potential equivalent common shares are as follows:

	2014

	2. Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)




	 




	Stock-Based Compensation







	The Company sometimes grants shares of stock for goods and services and in conjunction with certain agreements. These grants are accounted for based on the grant date fair values.







	Subsequent Events







	The Company has evaluated all transactions from March 31, 2015 through the financial statement issuance date for subsequent event disclosure consideration.







	New Accounting Pronouncements








	In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASU


	2014-09”), which supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP. The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is to recognize revenues


	when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled for those


	goods or services. ASU 2014-09 defines a five step process to achieve this core principle and, in doing so, more judgement and estimates may be required


	within the revenue recognition process than are required under existing U.S. GAAP. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15,


	2016, and interim periods therein, using either of the following transition methods: (i) a full retrospective approach reflecting the application of the standard


	in each prior reporting period with the option to elect certain practical expedients; or (ii) a retrospective approach with the cumulative effect of initially


	adopting ASU 2014-09 recognized at the date of adoption (which includes additional footnote disclosures). The Company is currently evaluating the impact


	of our pending adoption of ASU 2014-09 on our consolidated financial statements and have not yet determined the method by which the Company will


	adopt the standard in 2017.









	In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15, Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern. The new standard


	requires management to assess the company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Disclosures are required if there is substantial doubt as to the company’s


	continuation as a going concern within one year after the issue date of financial statements. The standard provides guidance for making the assessment,


	including consideration of management’s plans which may alleviate doubt regarding the company’s ability to continue as a going concern. ASU 2014-15 is


	effective for years beginning after December 15, 2016. We do not expect the adoption of this pronouncement to have a material impact on our consolidated


	financial statements.








	3. Going Concern







	The Company's financial statements are prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. However, the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations and had a working capital deficit and accumulated deficit at March 31, 2015. These factors raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern.



	 



	Under the going concern assumption, an entity is ordinarily viewed as continuing in business for the foreseeable future with neither the intention nor the necessity of liquidation, ceasing trading, or seeking protection from creditors pursuant to laws or regulations. Accordingly, assets and liabilities are recorded on the basis that the entity will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business.







	The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to raise capital to meet its obligations and attain profitable operations.  The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that may be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.







	The Company’s management is planning to raise funds through sale of equity and long-term debt financing.

	In January 2015, the Company issued a convertible note payable for $54,000 to KBM, due September 2015. The interest on the convertible note payable is 8% per annum.  The note contained an original issue discount of $4,000 which was excluded from the cash proceeds received.  The convertible note payable is convertible into shares of the Company’s common stock at the option of the lender at 59% of the average market price of the three lowest trading prices in the ten trading days preceding conversion.  Unpaid interest is subject to conversion.







	In January 2015, the Company issued a convertible note payable for $26,500 to LG, due January 2015.  The interest on the convertible note payable is 8% per annum.  The note contained an original issue discount of $1,500 which was excluded from the cash proceeds received.  The convertible note payable is convertible into shares of the Company’s common stock at the option of the lender at 58% of the lowest closing price in the fifteen trading days preceding conversion.  Unpaid interest is subject to conversion.







	In January 2015, the Company issued a convertible note payable for $55,750 to Auctus Private Equity Fund, LLC (“Auctus”), due October 2015.  The interest on the convertible note payable is 10% per annum.  The note contained an original issue discount of $5,750 which was excluded from the cash proceeds received.  The convertible note payable is convertible into shares of the Company’s common stock at the option of the lender at 55% of the lowest closing price in the twenty-five trading days preceding conversion.  Unpaid interest is subject to conversion.










	In February 2015, the Company issued a convertible note payable for $31,500 to Adar Bays, LLC (“Adar”), due February 2016.  The interest on the convertible note payable is 8% per annum.  The note contained an original issue discount of $6,000 which was excluded from the cash proceeds received.  The convertible note payable is convertible into shares of the Company’s common stock at the option of the lender at 60% of the lowest closing price in the ten trading days preceding conversion.  Unpaid interest is subject to conversion.

	Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity’s Own Stock

	and determined that the underlying common stock is indexed to the Company’s common stock. The Company determined that the conversion features did meet the definition of a liability and therefore bifurcated the conversion features and accounted for them as separate derivative liabilities (see Note 8). The Company recognized a debt discount in the amount of $431,000 that will be amortized to interest expense of the lives of the notes.  As of March 31, 2015, the amount of discount amortized for these notes was approximately $75,000.

	8. Derivative Liabilities








	Convertible Debt







	Due to the conversion feature contained in some of the notes that the Company has issued, the actual number of shares of common stock that would be required if a conversion of the notes was made through the issuance of the Company’s common stock cannot be predicted, and the Company could be required to issue an amount of shares that may cause it to exceed its authorized share amount. As a result, the conversion feature requires derivative accounting treatment and will be bifurcated from the note and “marked to market” each reporting period through the income statement. The fair value of the conversion feature of these notes was recognized as a derivative liability instrument and will be measured at fair value at each reporting period. In determining the fair value, the Company uses the Black-Scholes Model. In addition, the fair value of freestanding derivative instruments such as warrants, are also valued using the Black-Scholes Model.







	In 2014, the Company issued convertible debt to several companies for an aggregate principal amount of $263,000 (see detail in Note 7), of which the Company received cash proceeds of $235,000. These notes had variable conversion rates. The Company analyzed these conversion options, and determined that these instruments should be classified as liabilities and recorded at fair value due to there being no explicit limit as to the number of shares to be delivered upon settlement of the aforementioned conversion options.







	During the three months ended March 31, 2015, the Company issued convertible debt to several companies for an aggregate principal amount of $168,000 (see detail in Note 7), of which the Company received cash proceeds of $151,000. These notes had variable conversion rates. The Company analyzed these conversion options, and determined that these instruments should be classified as liabilities and recorded at fair value due to there being no explicit limit as to the number of shares to be delivered upon settlement of the aforementioned conversion options.







	The following is a summary of the activity of the derivative liabilities related to the variable conversion feature of the convertible debt for the three months ended March 31, 2015:

	The risk-free interest rate was determined by management using the one year and two year Treasury bill yield as of December 31, 2014 and March 31, 2015.













	(2)







	The volatility was determined by referring to the average historical volatility of a peer group of public companies because we do not have sufficient trade history to determine our historical volatility.











	Warrants







	In connection with the Typenex convertible debt (see Note 7), the Company also issued 437,500 warrants to Typenex to purchase an equivalent number of shares of the Company’s common stock with an exercise price of $0.20. The Company determined that these warrants contain provisions that protected holders from future issuances of the Company’s common stock at prices below the exercise price of these warrants that could result in modification of the exercise price based on a variable that is not an input to the fair value of a “fixed-for-fixed” option as defined under FASB ASC Topic No. 815-40. The warrants were recognized as derivative warrant instruments at issuance and are measured at fair value each reporting period.

	2.          MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS



	 



	DISCLOSURE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS



	 



	This Form 10-Q contains statements that constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933. The words “expect,” “estimate,” “anticipate,” “predict,” “believe,” and similar expressions and variations thereof are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements include statements regarding, among other things, (a) our projected sales and profitability, (b) our growth strategies, including the potential results of any acquisition or similar transaction, (c) anticipated trends in our industry, (d) our future financing plans, (e) our anticipated needs for working capital, and (f) the benefits related to ownership of our common stock. This information may involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance, or achievements to be materially different from the future results, performance, or achievements expressed or implied by any forward-looking statements for the reasons, among others, described within the various sections of this Form 10-Q. In light of these risks and uncertainties, there can be no assurance that the forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-Q will in fact occur as projected. We undertake no obligation to release publicly any updated information about forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this Form 10-Q or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.



	 



	The risks described below are the ones we believe are most important for you to consider. These risks are not the only ones that we face. If events anticipated by any of the following risks actually occur, our business, operating results or financial condition could suffer and the future price of our common stock could decline.



	 



	The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the information contained in the financial statements of 4Cable TV International Inc. (“we”, “us”, “our”, or the ‘Company’) and the notes which form an integral part of the financial statements which are attached hereto.



	 



	The financial statements mentioned above have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and are stated in United States dollars.




	 




	Background



	 



	We were organized under the laws of the State of Nevada on November 8, 2007 under the name “Liberto, Inc.” with a focus on the development, manufacture and sale of artificial lobster meat.  On April 25, 2013, we affected an 11 for 1 forward split of its common stock payable in the form of a stock dividend.








	On September 30, 2013, we closed a voluntary share exchange transaction with 4Cable TV, Inc., a South Carolina corporation (“4Cable TV”) and the shareholders of 4Cable TV (the “Selling Shareholders”) pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement (the “Exchange Transaction”). As a result of the Exchange Transaction, the Selling Shareholders acquired approximately 46.91% of our issued and outstanding common stock, 4Cable TV became our wholly-owned subsidiary, and the Company acquired the business and operations of 4Cable TV. This is treated as a reverse merger because there was a complete change in board of directors to 4Cable TV directors, there was a complete change in management to 4Cable TV management, 4Cable TV had significantly more assets and revenues than the Company, and the Selling Shareholders hold the largest block of stock, clearly garnering a control block.





	 



	Since its founding in 2005, 4Cable TV has been a specialty solutions provider for the cable television (CATV) sector including repair, upgrading, and testing, and service and customized solutions to CATV operators.  The two founders of 4Cable TV have previously owned and operated CATV systems across the United States, directed design validation laboratories, qualified hundreds of amplifier bandwidth upgrades, developed the first satellite block down converter now used in all satellite systems, and were involved in the first voice over IP experiments as International Long Distance Operators.

	Critical Accounting Policies





	 



	Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations, including the discussion on liquidity and capital resources, is based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, management re-evaluates its estimates and judgments.



	 



	The going concern basis of presentation assumes we will continue in operation throughout the next fiscal year and into the foreseeable future and will be able to realize our assets and discharge our liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business.  Certain conditions, discussed below, currently exists which raise substantial doubt upon the validity of this assumption.  The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of the uncertainty.



	 



	Results of Operations



	 



	The following discussion of the financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and changes in our financial position should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and notes included in our 10-K for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2014 filed on April 20, 2015. Such financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP and are stated in United States dollars.



	 



	Comparison of the Three-month Periods Ended March 31, 2015 and 2014



	 



	For the three months ended March 31, 2015, we incurred a net loss of $178,527 compared to a loss of $117,040 for the same period ended March 31, 2014.



	 



	Net sales for the three months ended March 31, 2015 totaled $112,290 a decrease of 53% from $239,319 for the three months ended March 31, 2014.  This decrease was attributable to bad weather conditions. The Company primarily does repairs on equipment that is stored outdoors and due to bad weather conditions, many customers were unable reach the equipment.



	 



	Cost of goods sold for the three months ended March 31, 2015 was $103,569. Cost of goods sold decreased 46%, from $187,944 for the three months ended March 31, 2014. The cost of goods sold decreased due to lower sales and inventory adjustments.



	 



	General and administration expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2015 increased to $243,004 compared to $124,889 for the three months ended March 31, 2014. The increase was due primarily to an increase of $51,000 in stock based compensation and $69,000 in employee salaries.



	 



	Research and development expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2015 increased to $16,391 compared to $14,434 for the three months ended March 31, 2014.  The increase was due primarily to increased efforts in new product development.     







	Interest expense for the three months ended March 31, 2015 increased to $109,633 from $29,092 for the three months ended March 31, 2014, related to an increase from borrowings to finance operations.







	Gain on change in fair value of derivatives for three months ended March 31, 2015 was $181,780, compared to $0 for three months ended March 31, 2014. For the three months ended March 31, 2014, the Company had no derivative liabilities.







	Cash and Cash Equivalents




	 




	As of March 31, 2015, we had cash of $42,490 as compared to $36,734 as of December 31, 2014.  We anticipate that a substantial amount of cash will be used as working capital and to execute our strategy and business plan.  As such, we further anticipate that we will have to raise additional capital of approximately $1,000,000 to fund our operational and research and development needs over the next twelve months.



	 





	 






	5










	 






	Liquidity and Capital Resources







	As of March 31, 2015, we had cash of $42,490 and a working capital deficit of $555,636.  During the three-month period ended March 31, 2015, we funded our operations from advances and loans from third parties.




	 




	For the three-month period ended March 31, 2015, we used net cash of $244,573 in operations compared to $83,694 for the three-month period ended March 31, 2014. The increase was primarily due to the increased operating loss.







	For the three-month period ended March 31, 2015 we used net cash of $4,083 for investing activities compared to $6,065 for the three-month period ended March 31, 2014. The decrease was primarily due to reduced spending on equipment.







	For the three-month period ended March 31, 2015, we had net cash provided by financing activities of $254,412 compared to $68,292 for the three-month period ended March 31, 2014. The increase was primarily due to proceeds from notes payable and proceeds from convertible debt.







	Our current cash requirements are significant based upon our plan to develop and market new product lines to grow our business.  We estimate a need for $1,000,000 in additional capital over the next 12 months which we expect will be provided by the Financing.  While we do not have any short-term plans to conduct any debt or equity financings beyond the financing commitment we presently have, we may in the future use debt and equity financing to fund operations, as we look to expand and fund development of our products and services and changes in our operating plans, increased expenses, acquisitions, or other events, may cause us to seek such financing sooner than anticipated.  There are no assurances that we will be able to raise such required working capital on terms favorable, or that such working capital will be available on any terms when needed.  The terms of such working capital may result in substantial dilution to existing shareholders.  Any failure to secure additional financing may force the Company to modify its business plan.  In addition, we cannot be assured of profitability in the future.







	Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements



	 



	At March 31, 2015, there are no off-balance sheet arrangements.

	3.           QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK



	 



	At this time this is not applicable.




	 





	ITEM 4.           CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES



	 



	Our management with the participation and under the supervision of our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer reviewed and evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined by Rule 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e)) of the Exchange Act Rule 13a-15 as of the end of the period covered by this report.  Based upon that evaluation, our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of such period, our disclosure controls and procedures

	are not effective as of

	March 31, 2015

	in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms.  This conclusion is based on findings that constituted material weaknesses.  A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of control deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company’s interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.

	Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting





	 





	In performing the above-referenced assessment, our management identified the following material weaknesses:






	 









	 i)






	We have insufficient quantity of dedicated resources and experienced personnel involved in reviewing and designing internal controls. As a result, a material misstatement of the interim and annual financial statements could occur and not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.








	  








	 ii)






	We do not have an audit committee or an independent audit committee financial expert. While not being legally obligated to have an audit committee or independent audit committee financial expert, it is the management’s view that to have an audit committee, comprised of independent board members, and an independent audit committee financial expert is an important entity-level control over our financial statements.








	 








	 iii)






	We did not perform an entity level risk assessment to evaluate the implication of relevant risks on financial reporting, including the impact of potential fraud-related risks and the risks related to non-routine transactions, if any, on our internal control over financial reporting. Lack of an entity-level risk assessment constituted an internal control design deficiency which resulted in more than a remote likelihood that a material error would not have been prevented or detected, and constituted a material weakness.








	 








	 iv)



	 





	We lack personnel with formal training to properly analyze and record complex transactions in accordance with U.S. GAAP.















	 v)






	We have not achieved the optimal level of segregation of duties relative to key financial reporting functions.












	We are currently reviewing our disclosure controls and procedures related to these material weaknesses and expect to implement changes as our financial situation allows, including identifying specific areas within our governance, accounting and financial reporting processes to add adequate resources and personnel to potentially mitigate these material weaknesses.







	Our present management will continue to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of our internal controls and procedures and our internal controls over financial reporting on an ongoing basis and are committed to taking further action and implementing additional enhancements or improvements, as necessary and as funds allow.








	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations.  Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.



	 



	Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting



	 



	There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended March 31, 2015 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.
