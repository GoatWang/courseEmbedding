About Us


About Us
Vital Therapies, Inc. is a biotherapeutic company developing ELAD®, an extracorporeal human hepatic cell-based liver treatment. ELAD is designed to improve survival in patients with liver failure by providing hepatic support continuously for up to five days. We believe that use of ELAD allows time for the patient’s native liver to recover from an acute decompensation, stabilize, and then potentially regenerate, or to maintain the patient until liver transplantation can occur.
The ELAD System incorporates approximately 440 grams of our human liver-derived cells, or VTL C3A cells, contained in four hollow-fiber cartridges, that are combined with disposable components and a reusable delivery device. During treatment with ELAD, blood is drawn from the patient via a central venous line and then passes into the delivery device where plasma ultrafiltrate is isolated. The patient’s plasma ultrafiltrate then passes through hollow fibers contained within the four cartridges, where semipermeable fibers permit bidirectional flow between the VTL C3A cells and the ultrafiltrate. In vitro research suggests that VTL C3A cells add proteins to the ultrafiltrate, and may remove substances typically metabolized by the liver. Treatment is expected to consist of a single, continuous session lasting between three and five days, as determined by the treating physician.
The ELAD System is the only liver support system containing human liver-derived cells to enter Phase 3 clinical trials. We designed the ELAD System to supplement key aspects of normal liver function to improve patient survival. Outside of liver transplant, which is severely limited by the availability of organs and not available to many patients, the current standard of care for the treatment of liver failure is primarily focused on the management of complications, which does not restore lost liver function and is associated with a high rate of mortality.
As part of ELAD’s clinical development program, over 250 subjects have received treatment with the ELAD System through prior clinical trials and a compassionate use program. Although VTI-208, our Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating ELAD in alcohol-induced liver decompensation (AILD), failed to reach either the primary or secondary endpoints, data from pre-specified and post-hoc analyses of this study has shown trends that may indicate a potential to increase survival rates in certain subsets of subjects with liver failure due to acute hepatocellular insult and alcohol use.
Based on our analysis of VTI-208 subsets, we are pursuing a new phase 3 clinical trial in AILD, referred to as VTL-308. VTL-308 is a phase 3 randomized, controlled, open-label trial, designed to evaluate the ELAD System in subjects with severe acute alcoholic hepatitis who meet criteria based on learnings from pre-specified and post-hoc analyses of the VTI-208 clinical trial. The Company enrolled the first subject in VTL-308 in May 2016.
ELAD has received orphan designation in the United States and Europe for the treatment of acute liver failure.

About Vital Therapies - A Biotherapeutic Company | Vital Therapies

About Us


About Us
Vital Therapies, Inc. is a biotherapeutic company developing ELAD®, an extracorporeal human hepatic cell-based liver treatment. ELAD is designed to improve survival in patients with liver failure by providing hepatic support continuously for up to five days. We believe that use of ELAD allows time for the patient’s native liver to recover from an acute decompensation, stabilize, and then potentially regenerate, or to maintain the patient until liver transplantation can occur.
The ELAD System incorporates approximately 440 grams of our human liver-derived cells, or VTL C3A cells, contained in four hollow-fiber cartridges, that are combined with disposable components and a reusable delivery device. During treatment with ELAD, blood is drawn from the patient via a central venous line and then passes into the delivery device where plasma ultrafiltrate is isolated. The patient’s plasma ultrafiltrate then passes through hollow fibers contained within the four cartridges, where semipermeable fibers permit bidirectional flow between the VTL C3A cells and the ultrafiltrate. In vitro research suggests that VTL C3A cells add proteins to the ultrafiltrate, and may remove substances typically metabolized by the liver. Treatment is expected to consist of a single, continuous session lasting between three and five days, as determined by the treating physician.
The ELAD System is the only liver support system containing human liver-derived cells to enter Phase 3 clinical trials. We designed the ELAD System to supplement key aspects of normal liver function to improve patient survival. Outside of liver transplant, which is severely limited by the availability of organs and not available to many patients, the current standard of care for the treatment of liver failure is primarily focused on the management of complications, which does not restore lost liver function and is associated with a high rate of mortality.
As part of ELAD’s clinical development program, over 250 subjects have received treatment with the ELAD System through prior clinical trials and a compassionate use program. Although VTI-208, our Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating ELAD in alcohol-induced liver decompensation (AILD), failed to reach either the primary or secondary endpoints, data from pre-specified and post-hoc analyses of this study has shown trends that may indicate a potential to increase survival rates in certain subsets of subjects with liver failure due to acute hepatocellular insult and alcohol use.
Based on our analysis of VTI-208 subsets, we are pursuing a new phase 3 clinical trial in AILD, referred to as VTL-308. VTL-308 is a phase 3 randomized, controlled, open-label trial, designed to evaluate the ELAD System in subjects with severe acute alcoholic hepatitis who meet criteria based on learnings from pre-specified and post-hoc analyses of the VTI-208 clinical trial. The Company enrolled the first subject in VTL-308 in May 2016.
ELAD has received orphan designation in the United States and Europe for the treatment of acute liver failure.

					Full Description



Vital Therapies, Inc., incorporated on January 13, 2004, is a biotherapeutic company. The Company is focused on developing a human hepatic cell-based treatment targeting acute forms of liver failure. Its product candidate, the ELAD System, is an extracorporeal human allogeneic cellular liver therapy designed to allow the patient's liver to regenerate to a healthy state, or to stabilize the patient until transplant. The ELAD System is a liver support system containing immortal human liver-derived cells, or VTL C3A cells. The Company initiated a Phase III clinical trial in severe acute alcoholic hepatitis (sAAH), referred to as VTL-308. VTL-308 is a randomized, open-label, multicenter, controlled, pivotal study, designed to evaluate the ELAD System in subjects with sAAH. It is based on pre-specified and post-hoc analyses of its VTI-208 phase III clinical trial in alcohol-induced liver decompensation (AILD). The Company's ELAD System consists of approximately four disposable ELAD C3A cell cartridges containing its human liver-derived C3A cells attached to a reusable delivery device using customized disposable tubing sets. The delivery device is based on a cardio-pulmonary bypass machine, which it has configured for the ELAD System treatment. This unit and customized disposable sets are attached to the ELAD C3A cell cartridges where the patient's blood plasma is treated by its VTL C3A cells before being returned to the patient. Treatment will generally consist of a single session of continuous allogeneic cellular therapy.The Company's ELAD cartridges contain approximately 8,000 hollow fibers and approximately one pound of VTL C3A cells from its cell bank. During ELAD treatment, an extracorporeal pumping unit draws blood from the subject through a central venous line, which then passes into the system to generate ultra-filtrated plasma (ultrafiltrate). The subject's ultrafiltrate is pumped through the hollow fibers of the cartridge, wherein the semi permeable membrane permits a bidirectional flow between the cells grown between the exterior of the hollow fibers and the ultrafiltrate contained in the lumen of the hollow fibers. Toxins, nutrients and dissolved gases pass from the ultrafiltrate to the cells, while the beneficial macromolecules and other substances synthesized by the cells pass into the subject's ultrafiltrate. After circulation through the ELAD C3A cell cartridges, the ultrafiltrate passes through an approximately 0.2 micrometer (um) pore size filter, is recombined with the cellular components of the subject's blood, and is returned to the subject through the central venous line. VTL C3A cell's metabolic byproducts are returned to the subject to be utilized or to be excreted by the renal or gastrointestinal system. The ELAD System monitors and enables adjustment of glucose and oxygen concentrations in the ultrafiltrate, as well as temperature and other parameters, in order to maintain the viability of the C3A cells. Treatment with the ELAD System is not patient-specific and its VTL C3A cells, which are derived from a single source, are used to treat all patients. The VTL C3A cells, which it grows in its facility produce proteins and other cell products, such as albumin, alpha-fetoprotein, alpha-1 antichymotrypsin, alpha-1 antitrypsin, C3 complement, anti-thrombin 3, factor V, factor VII, fibrinogen and transferrin.The Company competes with Exten Industries, Hepalife Technologies, Fresenius, Hybrid Organ GmbH, the University College London, the University of Amsterdam, Hep-Art Medical Devices, Mayo Clinic, Gambro and Fresenius.

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades. Our calculations are based on comprehensive, delayed quotes.      Stock Money Flow    Uptick/Downtick Trade Ratio  0 2    0.90      Net Money Flow ($)  -2,688    Money flow gives a snapshot of relative buying and selling pressure in a stock.

FlashRatings - All research for my stocks!

The most comprehensive equity research coverage available online.


          Never miss a single piece of research, upgrade, downgrade or target price change by any analyst firm on any stock!
          
          Equity research by professional analysts - especially their rationales more than their forecasts - contains far more interesting and important information about the actual fundamentals of the traded companies than can be gathered from conventional news reports.
          
          Our mission is to unlock access to valuable research on stocks for all retail investors.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
