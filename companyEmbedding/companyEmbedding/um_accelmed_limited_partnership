WHEREAS, pursuant to the Notes, the Company is
required to make payment of Bi-Monthly Amounts until the Notes are
repaid in full on the Maturity Date;
WHEREAS, all Bi-Monthly Amounts due prior to the
date hereof have been paid in full;

      In connection with the private placement, the Board of Directors of OIS 
      appointed Dr. Uri Geiger and Moshe (Mori) Arkin from AccelMed to the 
      Board, effective June 24, 2009.
    

      “The private equity financing announced today will provide OIS with 
      additional resources to successfully market and sell the electronic 
      medical records (EMR) and practice management (PM) solutions OIS and its 
      subsidiary, Abraxas Medical Solutions, introduced over the last eight 
      months. It will also allow OIS to broaden its marketing activities, 
      selling OIS Symphony Image Management systems as well as promoting other 
      innovative products in the development pipeline,” stated Gil Allon, 
      Chief Executive Officer of OIS.
    

      “I am excited to join the Board of Directors for OIS, as I believe in 
      the vision of the Company to be the leading provider of cutting edge 
      technologies for the eye care market. The Company has expanded its own 
      offerings with the launch of EMR and PM solutions for ophthalmologists 
      and expanded into new medical fields with a wide range of EMR and PM 
      solutions through its subsidiary, Abraxas Medical Solutions. I have 
      great confidence in the OIS management team and I believe that together 
      with AccelMed's resources and connections, OIS has a tremendous future,” 
      stated Dr. Geiger, AccelMed's Chairman of the board.
    

MediVision Asset Purchase Agreement and Escrow Agreement


      On June 24, 2009, OIS entered into an asset purchase agreement with 
      MediVision Medical Imaging Ltd. ("MediVision"), an Israeli corporation 
      and the majority shareholder of OIS, to purchase substantially all of 
      MediVision’s assets. As payment for such assets, OIS agreed to assume 
      certain liabilities, including, among other things, a bank loan 
      outstanding in an amount not to exceed $1,500,000 and all intercompany 
      indebtedness owed to OIS with a principal amount not to exceed 
      $4,200,000. The closing of the asset purchase is subject to a number of 
      conditions, including the approval of the asset purchase by the 
      shareholders of MediVision. If approved by MediVision shareholders, and 
      if the other conditions of closing are satisfied, the asset purchase is 
      expected to close in September 2009.
    

      In terms of the $1,500,000 loan agreement OIS assumed on behalf of its 
      agreement with MediVision, on June 24, 2009, OIS entered into a direct 
      letter agreement with United Mizrahi Bank. The new loan accrues interest 
      at LIBOR plus 4.75%. Principal payments will be made in 18 equal monthly 
      installments beginning January 31, 2011.
    

      Pursuant to the asset agreement with MediVision, OIS entered into an 
      escrow agreement pursuant to which MediVision agreed to deposit in an 
      escrow account 3,793,452 shares of OIS common stock it owns on the first 
      installment closing date and, subject to the status of certain 
      indebtedness, another 2,000,000 shares of OIS common stock it owns on 
      the closing date of the asset purchase agreement. Upon MediVision’s 
      failure to meet certain obligations as specified under the asset 
      purchase agreement, the shares of OIS common stock held in escrow will 
      be distributed to OIS or sold and the proceeds thereof distributed to 
      OIS.
    

Extension Agreement for Existing Convertible Notes


      On June 24, 2009, OIS entered into an extension agreement with the 
      holders of its 6.5% convertible notes due April 30, 2010, of which an 
      aggregate principal amount of $1,375,000 remains outstanding. Under the 
      terms of the extension agreement, the holders agreed to extend the 
      payments by 18 months, such that the next payment will be due December 
      31, 2010 and extend the maturity date of the notes to October 31, 2011.

An extension agreement is a document between parties to extend an existing contract. The new document changes the duration of the original contract, and can contain addendum to the original contract upon signing as well. These documents may contain information about the parties in the existing contract, the contract's end date, and the extension's end date.The parties may choose to add clauses regarding additional provisions in the document as well. An agreement may be added to the existing contract so both parties can compare the differences.These agreements may be used between a manufacturer and a distributor to extend the date of their original contract. If both parties are satisfied with the current arrangement, they could alter the date to end at a late time. The manufacturer may also want to change the original quota in the contract, and could do so with a contract extension agreement.

expert, and the third party expert's decision shall be within the
range determined by such proposals. The parties shall split the
cost of the third party expert, provided, that if the third party
expert's final decision is not within 25% of a party's proposal

determine the amount of the payments to be made to Seller
hereunder. All Contingent Asset Purchase Payments payable to Seller

of Seller, and not more than once in any twelve (12) month period,
Buyer shall permit (and shall ensure that its Affiliates permit) an
independent public accounting firm reasonably acceptable to Buyer
engaged by Seller to examine such books and records (insofar as
they relate to such payments) during normal business hours, on
reasonable prior written notice, to audit Buyer’s (and its
Affiliates') Net Sales as utilized to calculate the Contingent
Asset Purchase Payments due Seller hereunder; provided ,
however , that such independent accountants shall not
disclose Buyer’s (or its Affiliates') confidential
information to Seller, except to the extent such disclosure is
necessary to verify the amount of payments due hereunder. If such
accounting firm concludes that Contingent Asset Purchase Payments
have been underpaid, then, unless Buyer’s independent
accounting firm disagrees with such conclusion, Buyer shall pay,
within thirty (30) days of the date that Seller advises Buyer in
writing of such unpaid Contingent Asset Purchase Payments, all such
unpaid Contingent Asset Purchase Payments, plus interest at a rate
of the greater of (a) the U.S. Prime Rate, as reported in The
Wall Street Journal , Eastern Edition, plus five percent (5%),
and (b) seven percent (7%) per annum, for the period between such
unpaid Contingent Asset Purchase Payments should have been paid
until such amounts are actually paid. If such accounting firm
concludes that Contingent Asset Purchase Payments have been
overpaid, then Buyer shall be entitled to offset future Contingent
Asset Purchase Payments by the amount so overpaid. All expenses
relating to such audit shall be borne by Seller, unless such audit
discloses

event shall Buyer be obligated to make aggregate Contingent Asset
Purchase Payments in excess of $43,000,000 and (ii) Buyer shall

Payments upon Buyer’s payment to Seller of a one-time cash
payment of $18,000,000 which Buyer may make at any time from and

purposes of determining whether Buyer has met the payment threshold
set forth in clause (i) of this Section 2.6(d) or the
payment threshold set forth in clause (ii) of this Section
2.6(d) , any amounts set off by Buyer pursuant to its Setoff
Rights (and subject to the limitations thereon set forth herein)

amount paid by Buyer as part of the OCS Transfer Amount to OCS in

in good faith and in accordance with applicable Legal Requirements.
Should Seller have any objections to the Purchase Price Allocation,
Buyer and Seller shall work together in good faith for a period of
thirty (30) days on a mutually acceptable Purchase Price
Allocation. If Buyer and Seller cannot agree on such Purchase Price

such Valid Certificate. If the Buyer so deducts or withholds any

Person in respect of which Buyer made such deduction and
withholding. In the event that Buyer concludes that it is required
to deduct or withhold from any consideration payable to Seller or
any other Person pursuant to this Agreement, Seller agrees to use
commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with Buyer to enable
Buyer to make such withholding or deduction in accordance with any
provision of national, federal, state, local or foreign Tax law or
other Legal Requirement, including, without limitation, by
obtaining any applicable payment documentation from any
Governmental Body. “ Valid Certificate ” means a
valid and applicable (in light of the timing, scope and the nature
of the payment) exemption or confirmation issued by the relevant
Governmental Body with respect to the proposed withholding and with
respect to Seller or such other Person, which is sufficient to
enable Buyer to conclude at its reasonable discretion that no

the contemplated payment to the Seller or such other
Person.

BBB Rating System Overview














Customer Review Rating:









                        The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business.
                        The Customer Review Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive,
                        neutral, and negative reviews posted.

Composite Score:





                        LegalZoom.com has received 3.76 out of 5 stars based on 33 Customer Reviews and a BBB Rating of A+.
                        






                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

This document outlines the terms and conditions of transaction. Information contained in the document includes the names of both parties, the address and description of the property the agreement concerns, and the purchase price. The closing details of the transaction are included in the document outlining where and when closing on the property shall occur. When purchasing a property, particularly with a cash payment, a real estate investor may provide earnest money as a deposit. This information will be present in the contract and will include details on the amount and how it shall be paid to the seller. If a loan is being used to purchase the property, details of the lender and the amount will be included in the document.There may be clauses regarding property taxes and disclosures of potential issues of the property.  If the seller agrees to perform certain repairs before transfer of ownership to the buyer, the repairs may be contained within the agreement. Some buyers may request fixtures or furnishings along with the sale of the property, and these will be listed within the document.  A purchase and sale agreement may also contain warranties, waiver of claims, and information about the title insurance policy.
