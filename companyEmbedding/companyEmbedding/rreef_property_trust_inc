      RREEF Property Trust continues portfolio expansion with acquisition of 
      Class-A student housing property
    





October 01, 2015 09:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--RREEF Property Trust, Inc. (ZRPTAX, ZRPTBX) today announced the 
      acquisition of The Flats at Carrs Hill, a Class-A 138 unit, 316 bed 
      student housing community in Athens, Georgia, for $27.0 million.
    


      The fully-leased property services students of the University of 
      Georgia, and offers a superior amenity package including a full-size, 
      indoor basketball court, multiple lounges, resort-style pool, 24-hour 
      fitness center and on-site parking. The property is located less than a 
      ¼ mile from the University of Georgia campus, and less than one mile 
      from Sanford football stadium, home of the SEC’s Georgia Bulldogs. The 
      Flats at Carrs Hill is one of a small group of modern student housing 
      options in Athens that provides walkable access to the school’s campus. 
      Additionally, the University recently approved an expansion of the North 
      Oconee River Greenway trail, a 3.65 mile walking and biking path, which 
      will provide the student residents direct pedestrian access to 
      additional parts of campus.
    

      “The Flats at Carrs Hill offers a contemporary housing option for the 
      university’s growing student population,” said Todd Henderson, Chairman 
      of the Board of RREEF Property Trust and Head of Real Estate, Americas, 
      at Deutsche Asset & Wealth Management. “Walkable, off- campus housing 
      currently represents only 9% of total student enrollment. With tenancy 
      at full capacity in this vibrant part of the campus community, we 
      believe that the property can produce strong income returns with 
      opportunity to leverage its location and the quality of the product with 
      the potential to increase net income in the future.”

Deutsche Asset Management is one of the largest real estate investment managers in the world with approximately $53 billion (as of 12/31/16) in real estate assets globally and a 30-year track record outperforming the industry, as measured by the NFI-ODCE Index, in the U.S. core asset class.7
Investment overview

Daily valuations using Deutsche Asset Management’s proprietary, time-tested approach
A blended strategy that includes real estate (up to 80% allocation), traded real estate securities (up to 35% allocation) real estate-related debt (up to 15% allocation) and cash and cash equivalents (up to 10% allocation)
Real Estate includes office, retail, industrial and multifamily properties.
Diversified across direct-owned real estate with respect to geography, property types and tenants as well as diversification within the traded real estate securities portfolio. Diversification by asset class or among real estate sectors does not necessarily protect against losses.

Investment objectives8

 to generate an attractive and reasonably stable level of current income for distribution to our stockholders;
to preserve and protect our stockholders’ capital investments;
to achieve appreciation of our Net Asset Value; and
to enable stockholders to allocate a portion of their diversified, long-term investment portfolios to real estate as an alternative asset class


 


7 Past performance is not indicative of future results. 8 There is no guarantee that RREEF Property Trust will pay distributions or achieve its stated objectives. 9 Some states have additional suitability requirements. Please consult RREEF Property Trust’s prospectus for additional information regarding your state’s specific suitability standards. Investors may not invest more than 10% of their liquid net worth. 10  The total amount of redemptions in any calendar quarter will be limited to shares of our common stock whose aggregate value is equal to 5% of our combined NAV for all classes of shares as of the last day of the previous calendar quarter. Due to the illiquid nature of investments in real estate, we may not have sufficient liquid resources to fund redemption requests. Further, our board of directors has the right to modify or suspend the redemption plan if it deems such action to be in the best interest of our stockholders. See the prospectus for additional details. Please see the Redemption Limitations Section of the Prospectus for more information.

Why Commercial Real Estate?
Investments in commercial real estate have historically provided investors: 
Diversification
• Attractive Current Income
• Multi-Sector Exposure
• Lack of Correlation 
• Potential Hedge Against Inflation












 





Diversification by asset class or among real estate sectors does not necessarily protect against losses.

The distributions and income that we pay are uncertain and not guaranteed. The timing and amount of distributions is determined by our board of directors. We may pay distributions from sources other than income including, but not limited to the proceeds of our offering, borrowings, or the sale of properties or other investments. Distributions paid from sources other than cash flow from operations may not be sustainable. Through 12/31/15, our expenses were supported by expense support payments from our advisor, which are subject to repayment in future periods and will reduce cash flows during those periods. If our advisor had not made the expense support payments, a greater proportion of the distributions would have been funded from offering proceeds or borrowings. For the year ended 12/31/16, we paid distributions of $4.5 million, of which $2.6 million, or 58% of total distributions, was paid from cash flow from operations and $1.9 million, or 42% of total distributions, was paid through the issuance of shares pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

(ZRPTAX, ZRPTIX, ZRPTTX) today announced the acquisition of 40 Allied Drive in Dedham, MA, a fully-leased Class-A, 64,127 rentable-square-foot medical office building outside of Boston, Massachusetts. The acquisition continues RREEF Property Trust’s strategy to diversify its holdings based on sector and geography.The property was built in 2013 by the Greater Boston Musculoskeletal Company (GBMC). It houses the New England Baptist Outpatient Care Center which provides a full spectrum of orthopedic-related services including state-of-the-art operating rooms, a post-anesthesia care unit, post-operative physical therapy and imaging space, among other amenities. The Property is anchored by New England Baptist Hospital, a leading provider of orthopedic surgery and musculoskeletal treatment. Situated off Route 128/I-95, the property is less than 20 miles from central Boston, accessible via commuter rail and positioned less than 1 mile from the area’s premier shopping, dining and entertainment center.“Strong demand in the medical office building market has been driven by macro-economic tailwinds, specifically the Affordable Care Act and the aging population. Rising health care costs and technological changes are also pushing outpatient care into medical office buildings, which offer better cost efficiencies compared to hospital facilities,” said Todd Henderson, Chairman of the Board of RREEF Property Trust and Head of Real Estate, Americas, at Deutsche Asset Management. “40 Allied Drive is a high-quality property that is well situated in a region where medical office space supply is generally more constrained due to the high barriers to entry.”RREEF Property TrustRREEF Property Trust is a publicly registered, non-listed, daily NAV real estate investment trust.
