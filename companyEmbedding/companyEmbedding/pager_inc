Got Questions? We’ve Got Answers.












How many users do I need? 






Every person added to your PagerDuty account is a paid user, including those who are receiving notifications or are included in a schedule.














How does the 14-day trial work? 






Our trial is a full-featured free trial for 14 days that you can start using instantly. No credit card required so you won’t be charged until you are ready to buy. When you are ready, select any of the available plans to continue using PagerDuty.














What are my payment options? 






We accept Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Discover, and JCB through your online account. Want to pay via invoice? Sure! We’ll gladly set up an annual invoice. Just call or contact us.














How many systems can I monitor? 






You can monitor as many or as few systems as you want with PagerDuty. Whether you want to monitor Nagios on one computer or Nagios, JIRA, Icinga, and Zenoss on 100 different hosts, we won’t charge you extra. We have pre-built integrations across 200+ services and tools, too.














How many notifications are included in my account*? 






Notifications are sent by phone, SMS, email, or push notification. Customers on our Standard and Enterprise plans get unlimited global notifications via email, SMS, phone, and push notification.
*Not on the Standard or Enterprise plan? All customers receive unlimited SMS & phone notifications in US or Canada, as well as unlimited global push notifications and email notifications. Basic plan customers get 25 global SMS and phone notifications per month per user, and additional global notifications are $0.35/notification.














What if I need more global notifications? 






One of the best parts about our methodology is that we bundle and de-dupe notifications so you’re not paying for extras. The other great news is that we pool the number of global phone and SMS notifications given to each user. For example, if you have 10 users on the Basic plan, you will have 250 global notifications each month. Need more? They’re only $.35 each. By the way, we support notifications to over 170 countries.

When $#IT happens,
You’ve got it covered.
In the digital era, organizations are adopting new technologies to keep up with rising customer expectations — but cannot increase agility at the expense of reliability. PagerDuty helps you modernize your operations while mitigating the risks of business-impacting incidents. Avoid the chaos and get back time for innovation now.
Get a Free Trial






Automate end-to-end incident resolution to ensure great customer experiences.

The stakes of managing complex infrastructure have never been higher. When customer-impacting service degradations or outages can cost businesses upwards of millions of dollars, waiting for customers to file tickets is too late. PagerDuty helps ITOps teams modernize their operations by driving the right processes around faster resolution and learning to prevent future issues.





TheIncident ResponseLifecycle




Get a complete view of all the correlated events in your infrastructure — across your entire toolchain — to quickly identify potential issues, dependencies, incident impact, and root cause.


Group related alerts into incidents and automatically route them to the right person who can act on the problem — while suppressing non-actionable alerts via event rules.


Easily troubleshoot and leverage the right workflows for major incident response by surfacing remediation info, recruiting experts, collaborating to resolve, and keeping business stakeholders informed.


Streamline post-mortems to continually improve system resiliency and future response.



















Modern Operations Best Practice




 Improve your operational agility and maturity with best practice incident resolution
























Drive Faster Resolution

By the time a ticket is generated, it’s already too late. Every minute of service degradation is worth thousands of dollars and drives customers away.


PagerDuty enables you to maximize resolution speed with the right context and powerful automation. We are key to facilitating DevOps best practices, enabling organizations to deliver high-performing services, and protecting your brand.


We make it easy to get complete insight into the performance of your infrastructure to understand root cause, prioritize issues, and automate troubleshooting — minimizing time wasted on manual work when every minute counts.













Prevent Issues And Get Back Time

Prevent issues before the ticket is raised and customers are affected.


Get better at resolving unexpected issues by learning to improve systems and your incident response process. PagerDuty helps automate incident resolution best practices by surfacing the right context, engaging the right resources, and streamlining post-mortems.


By making it easier to institutionalize a culture of learning, your team won’t be caught off-guard when the next outage hits. And improved team productivity means more time spent on business differentiating innovation, instead of on fixing issues.













Knowledge is Power

Optimize people mobilization and democratize agile response, while ensuring consistency with your existing processes.


Aggregate monitoring events and fully control which PagerDuty incidents sync to your ticketing tools. PagerDuty automates processes built on best practices, allowing you to focus on higher value parts of incident response. Granular and scalable permissions enable teams to administer and operate independently while controlling visibility.


By centralizing information without limiting how people work, your organization can eliminate silos between your people, processes, and data.












Start Using PagerDuty Today.

Automate incident resolution and eliminate the chaos when managing unexpected issues. Operate and deliver uninterrupted service at any scale with PagerDuty.

FAQ






























What is PagerDuty? 






PagerDuty is an alarm aggregation and dispatching service for system administrators and support teams. It collects alerts from your monitoring tools, gives you an overall view of all of your monitoring alarms, and alerts an on duty engineer if there’s a problem.














Is PagerDuty right for me? 






You should consider using PagerDuty if:

You want to add the ability to send SMSes and phone calls to your existing monitoring tools.
You want to add on-call scheduling, escalation, and incident tracking to your existing monitoring tools.
You want a single place where you can view the overall health of your system, no matter how many monitoring tools you use.















Can PagerDuty route alerts depending on the source of the problem? 






Yes. PagerDuty uses “services” to integrate with your monitoring systems. Each PagerDuty service has its own associated alerting and escalation rules (these are called “escalation policies”). This feature is used to route alerts to the people best able to handle them. For example, you might want to create an escalation policy for your database administrator team, and use this policy for all services that integrate with database monitoring systems. This ensures that database problems are always forwarded to a db specialist.














What alerting methods do you support? 






We can send alerts using any combination of phone calls, SMSes, push notifications and emails.














How can I be sure my alerts are received? 






PagerDuty asks users to confirm that they’ve received an SMS by replying to it. Similarly, our automated phone calls ask users to make a selection from a voice menu of possible incident options. If an alert isn’t replied to, PagerDuty can be set to repeat the call or message.














What if the on-call engineer doesn’t respond to an alert? 






PagerDuty allows you to specify comprehensive escalation rules. When an incident is triggered, PagerDuty will first try to contact the level-one on-call engineer for the incident. If that person doesn’t answer within the user-specified escalation timeout, PagerDuty will automatically escalate the alert to the level-two engineer, and so on.














Do you support international SMS? 






Yes, we support two-way SMS to virtually every country.














Do you support international phone calls? 






Yes, we support phone calls to over 175 countries. To learn more about international calls in PagerDuty and to view the full list of supported countries, click here.














How do phone alerts show up on my phone’s caller ID? 






All PagerDuty phone alerts will be attempted to be sent from the number 1-415-349-5750. Unfortunately, some providers will change the caller ID which is out of our control, so the number(s) you receive the calls from may be displayed differently.  See the following FAQ entry for SMS alerts.














How do SMS alerts show up on my phone’s caller ID? 






The phone number that will show up on your caller ID for SMS alerts will depend on which SMS provider we use, as well as which country you live in. PagerDuty uses multiple SMS providers per country for availability and redundancy reasons. You can use the below numbers to setup special ringtones on your phone, but please be aware that they might change at any time with little notice. Please also see our vCard for additional numbers.

All Other Countries: Numbers Vary*
*Note: some phone numbers use local SMS numbers that can vary between messages or day-to-day.














What if an engineer receives an alert when they are away from their computer? 






Engineers can escalate alarms directly from their phone by replying to the alert SMS or pressing a key during the automated phone call.














I’ve spent a long time setting up monitoring tools to watch my systems. If I switch to PagerDuty, do I have to redo all that work? 






No. PagerDuty is an alert dispatching tool, not a monitoring system. Think of PagerDuty as an add-on to your existing monitoring tools. PagerDuty provides sophisticated alarm routing, but leaves finding problems with your systems to your existing monitoring tools.














How does it integrate with my existing tools? 






Every service you create in PagerDuty has a unique email address, such as nagios-problem@acme.pagerduty.com. PagerDuty opens a new incident and begins the alerting process at soon as one of your monitoring tools sends email to a service’s address.














What monitoring tools are known to work with PagerDuty? 






The most common monitoring tools used with PagerDuty are Nagios, Zenoss, Pingdom, monit, Munin, Splunk and BasicState. However, any monitoring tool that sends email can be used with PagerDuty.














What other uses are there for PagerDuty? 






PagerDuty can be integrated with any system that sends automated emails. PagerDuty is especially useful when used to deliver alerts for systems that can’t place phone calls or SMSes on their own. Here are some possibilities:

Have your applications call you if an unexpected exception is raised. (If you’re using Ruby on Rails, take a look at ExceptionNotifier.)
Your cron tasks can call you if a critical system maintenance task fails.
Intrusion detection systems can be set to call you if they detect a security breach.
Environmental sensors (e.x. temperature, humidity, etc.) can alert you if they detect an unsafe environment.















What precautions have you taken to ensure that PagerDuty is always ready to deliver my alerts? 






PagerDuty’s infrastructure is fully replicated in three different AWS and Microsoft Azure data centers. We have the capability to rapidly rollover to our backup systems in the event that our main data center loses connectivity. We always have an engineer on-call and near a computer to deal with any unexpected outages.














How will I send PagerDuty triggering emails if my network connection or mail servers fails? 






You should use an external ping service such as BasicState or Wormly to monitor your network connection and mail server. Of course, you can forward the error messages from these monitoring services to one of your PagerDuty services. This way, if your site loses network connectivity or your mail server crashes, the on-call engineer will be immediately notified by PagerDuty.














How much does PagerDuty cost? 






You can find our price schedule here. All new PagerDuty accounts come with fully-featured, risk-free 14 day trial (no credit card required). During the free trial, you’ll be able to send phone calls and SMSes free of charge. If you decide not to register for a paid plan within the 14 day trial window, your account will expire at the end of the trial.

Jobs at Pager



















At Pager, we are on a mission to transform healthcare by offering patients better tools and more access to high quality care.
Based out of NYC, we are a health-tech start-up reinventing the traditional doctor house call with a location-based mobile marketplace. Through Pager, users can save time finding a reputable doctor, waiting for a scheduled appointment, and tackling the crowded emergency room. Board-certified doctors treat a wide variety of primary and urgent care issues, all in the patient’s home, office, or hotel.Founded by an experienced team of serial entrepreneurs from successful start-ups (Uber, Teladoc, Gilt, One Medical Group, Buzzfeed), we are passionate about improving access to high-quality, personal health care.  From long days of perfecting a great product to long nights of happy hours and group dinners, we are looking for someone smart, energetic, and fun to join our tight-knit and growing team. 
A passion for health care is not necessary to apply; however, a passion for improving the lives of people and living a better life through technology is a must.

Virtual Paging






Virtual paging is our fastest 
growing paging option.  Instead of 
carrying a separate pager, your 
pages will display right on your 
cellphone as either a text 
message, email of if you have an 
iphone, you can receive pages via 
the pager app designed 
exclusively for the iPhone.
  Retain the privacy and 
urgency that a separate pager 
phone number offers while only 
carrying one device!  Plus, since 
cellphones receive a signal 
nationwide, your pages will come 
through nationwide at no extra 
charge!

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
