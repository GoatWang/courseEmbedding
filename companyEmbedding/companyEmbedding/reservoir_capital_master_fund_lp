About Us - Reservoir Capital Group





















 





 About Us 
 
 
 
 
 



 
 

 Reservoir was founded in 1998 based upon the belief that patient capital and a flexible investment mandate are competitive advantages in the pursuit of superior, 
	long-term risk-adjusted returns. Reservoir's primary investment objective is to identify or create investment opportunities with asymmetric risk/reward profiles - 
	generally offering enhanced downside protection and meaningful upside optionality. These investment opportunities are frequently found in out-of-favor areas experiencing 
	fundamental change and/or scarcity of capital.

	Reservoir opportunistically invests directly in securities and structured private investments, builds platform companies with industry specialists, 
	and creates new hedge funds and private equity firms in which the Reservoir funds hold ownership or other economic interests. Reservoir currently has over $6 billion of 
	capital under management. 
	
 
 


 
	Daniel H. Stern and Craig A. Huff, Co-Chief Executive Officers, and Gregg M. Zeitlin, a Senior Managing Director, founded Reservoir and 
	have worked together as a team for more than twenty-one years, including their prior tenure managing Ziff Brothers Investments. The founders are joined by Senior Managing Directors Matthew T. 
	Popoli, Anil A. Ranavat, and Eric Engler, in leading Reservoir's investment efforts.

Reservoir has pursued its opportunistic strategy since 1999, initially with the launch of the Opportunistic Fund and subsequently with select capital raisings based on the opportunity set:
 
 






 1998 

 Reservoir Founded; Launch of Opportunistic Fund
"Evergreen" hybrid investment fund

Reservoir Capital Group














Reservoir was founded in 1998 based upon the belief that patient capital and a flexible investment mandate are competitive advantages in the pursuit of superior, long-term risk-adjusted returns. Reservoir's primary investment objective is to identify or create investment opportunities with asymmetric risk/reward profiles - generally offering enhanced downside protection and meaningful upside optionality. These investment opportunities are frequently found in out-of-favor areas experiencing fundamental change and/or scarcity of capital. We also believe a large portion of investment returns are generated by allocating assets to the most attractive asset classes or sectors at opportune times, and that partnering with world-class managers and specialists may provide enhanced risk/reward profiles, superior economics and proprietary deal flow.

              Daniel H. Stern and Craig A. Huff, Co-Chief Executive Officers, and Gregg M. Zeitlin, a Senior Managing Director, founded Reservoir and have worked together as a team for more than nineteen years, including their prior tenure managing Ziff Brothers Investments. The founders are joined by Matthew T. Popoli and Anil A. Ranavat, Senior Managing Directors who have been with Reservoir since 2005, in leading Reservoir's general investment efforts.

Explanation of Responses:


(1)  Under the terms of the PXRE Group Ltd. Non-Employee Director Deferred Stock Plan (the "Plan"), upon the consummation of a merger on August 7, 2007 pursuant to which Argonaut Group, Inc. ("Argonaut") became a wholly owned subsidiary of PXRE Group Ltd. ("PXRE"), each non-employee director received a grant of 2,000 PXRE common shares, par value $1.00 per share ("Common Shares"). Immediately following the merger, the Common Shares split in a 1-for-10 reverse stock split (the "Reverse Stock Split") and PXRE's name was changed to "Argo Group International Holdings, Ltd."


(2)  The Plan permits certain directors to cause Common Shares to be granted directly to their employers (or to affiliates of their employers) subject to the same terms and conditions under the Plan as would apply if the director had retained such Common Shares personally. Reservoir Capital Group, L.L.C., a Delaware limited liability company ("Reservoir Group"), is the employer of Craig Huff. Mr. Huff was granted 200 Common Shares (giving effect to the Reverse Stock Split) and has caused such Common Shares to be granted directly to Reservoir Group. Mr. Huff resigned from the PXRE board as of the effective time of the merger. See Exhibit 99.1 attached hereto for a list of each reporting person.


(3)  RCGM, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("RCGM"), is an investment management firm and is the managing member of Reservoir Group. Reservoir Group is an investment management firm and serves as the general partner of Reservoir Capital Partners, L.P. ("Reservoir Partners"), Reservoir Capital Master Fund, L.P. ("Reservoir Capital Master Fund"), Reservoir Capital Master Fund II, L.P. ("Reservoir Capital Master Fund II"), Reservoir Capital Investment Partners, L.P. ("Reservoir Investment") and Reservoir PCA Fund (Cayman), L.P. ("Reservoir PCA"), which are each private investment partnerships. Reservoir PCA is the managing member of RMF GP, LLC ("RMG GP"), which is in turn the general partner of Reservoir Master Fund, L.P. ("Reservoir Master Fund").


(4)  Each of RCGM, Reservoir Group, Reservoir Partners, Reservoir Capital Master Fund, Reservoir Capital Master Fund II, Reservoir Investment, Reservoir PCA, RMG GP and Reservoir Master Fund disclaims beneficial ownership of the reported Common Shares except to the extent of its pecuniary interest therein, and the inclusion of such Common Shares in this report shall not be deemed an admission of beneficial ownership of such reported Common Shares for purposes of Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or for any other purpose.


(5)  Upon the consummation of the merger on August 7, 2007, the Class B Convertible Voting Common Shares, par value $1.00 per share, of PXRE ("Class B Convertible Common Shares") and the Series B Convertible Voting Preferred Shares, par value $1.00 per share, of PXRE ("Series B Preferred Shares) held by the reporting persons converted into Common Shares.


(6)  The Class B Convertible Common Shares were convertible into Common Shares at any time on a one for one basis, and had no expiration date.


(7)  Includes 204,847, 27,819, 17,582 and 89,654 Common Shares held by Reservoir Partners, Reservoir Capital Master Fund, Reservoir Capital Master Fund II and Reservoir Investment, respectively (after giving effect to the Reverse Stock Split).


(8)  Pursuant to a Voting and Conversion Agreement, dated as of March 14, 2007, certain of the reporting persons agreed to convert the Series B Preferred Shares held by them into Common Shares at a conversion price of $6.24 per Series B Preferred Share, subject to the completion of the merger. The merger and conversion was completed on August 7, 2007. Upon consummation of the merger, the 1,588.492 Series B Preferred Shares held by Reservoir Partners and Reservoir Capital Master Fund were converted into 2,545,660 Common Shares (254,566 after giving effect to the Reverse Stock Split).


(9)  Includes 217,909 and 36,657 Common Shares held by Reservoir Partners and Reservoir Capital Master Fund, respectively (after giving effect to the Reverse Stock Split).


(10)  Includes 1,359.749 and 228.743 Series B Preferred Shares held by Reservoir Partners and Reservoir Capital Master Fund, respectively.


(11)  Includes 2,048,470, 278,187, 175,818 and 896,545 Class B Convertible Common Shares held by Reservoir Partners, Reservoir Capital Master Fund, Reservoir Capital Master Fund II and Reservoir Investment, respectively.
