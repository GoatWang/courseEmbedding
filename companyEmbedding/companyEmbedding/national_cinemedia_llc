What business type is right for you?
When you're starting a new business, you want to determine the business structure that's right for you. What's the difference between a limited liability company (LLC) and a corporation (Inc.)? And how is a C corporation different from an S corporation? Use these charts to help decide what business type is best for your needs.








LLC vs. Corporation






Limited Liability Company (LLC)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my LLCCorporation (Inc)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my Corporation







What is an S corporation?
After you create a corporation or LLC, you also have the opportunity to decide how you'd like your business to be taxed.Single owner LLCs can be taxed either as a sole proprietorship or a corporation.  LLCs with more than one owner can be taxed either as a partnership or a corporation.  Income from LLCs treated as sole proprietorships or partnerships is reported directly on the owner’s individual tax returns.New corporations, as well as LLCs considering corporate taxation can choose between filing taxes as a C corporation ("C corp") or an S corporation ("S corp"). An S corp is considered a "pass-through entity," which means the business itself isn't taxed. Instead, income is reported on the owners' personal tax returns. Businesses taxed as C corporations are not pass through entities.  Income is taxed at the corporate level, and, if dividends are distributed, at the individual level as well.We can help you understand your options so you choose what's best for your business. Talk to one of our network of attorneys today.








C-corp or S-corp 






Here's a comparison of some key characteristics of businesses that choose to be treated as C corps and S corps.C DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensS DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensYou don't have to decide about S corp status right away. You have 75 days after the formation of your business to file with the IRS. If you're still not sure what to do, you may want to consult with one of our attorneys or tax specialists.





Step-by-Step Guide on Starting Your Business













Easy as 1-2-3




1. Select the business structure that's right for you and fill out a simple questionnaire.





2. We'll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state.





3. You'll receive your completed paperwork by mail.








Ask away. We have answers.



Common questions

Can I start a business without creating a corporation or LLC?
You don't need a corporation or LLC to go into business. Many business owners are in partnerships or are sole proprietors. But both a corporation and LLC canshield you from liability and may offer tax advantages.


What are the main differences between an LLC and a sole proprietorship?
You don't need to file any paperwork with your state to create a sole proprietorship (though you may still need business permits and licenses to operate lawfully). But an LLC protects you from personal liability  - a sole proprietorship doesn't.Also, LLCs provide more flexibility as you grow your business.


What are the main differences between an LLC and an S corporation?
An LLC has more flexibility and fewer corporate formalities than an S corporation. S corporations are required to have annual meetings of shareholders and directors, while meetings of LLC member and/or managers are not required..  Also,  LLCs can provide for a flexible management structure by members or managers, while corporations require management by a Board of Directors.Learn more.


Do I need a name or DBA for my business?
You only need a DBA ("doing business as") if you are operating a sole proprietorship or partnership and you want to use a fictitious name for the business. You don't need a DBA for an LLC or a corporation unless you are using a name other than your LLC or corporate name while doing business.Learn more.


Do I need any other licenses or permits to start my business? 
Some cities, counties, and states require businesses to obtain licenses and permits to operate lawfully. We can help you figure out what you need. Learn More.

Compare Business Structures – LLC vs. Corporation, S Corporation and C Corporation 

		 You’ve decided to start a business, but you’re not sure where to begin. You don’t know if you should form an LLC or corporation, and need guidance to help you choose the right business structure. Each business structure has its advantages and disadvantages that are important to understand because choosing the wrong business entity could result in legal and tax implications down the road. The information above will allow you to compare LLC vs. corporation, and learn the difference between an S corporation and C corporation. LLCs and corporations both offer personal liability protection, but the most significant difference between LLC and corporation is that corporations are preferred by outside investors. When comparing LLC vs S corp, there are a few important differences to be aware of which are outlined above. Once you determine which business structure you need, you can start a business with LegalZoom in just three easy steps. The process begins by filling out a simple questionnaire. We’ll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state, and you’ll receive your completed paperwork by mail. If you need help deciding which business structure is right for you, a LegalZoom legal plan attorney can explain how each business entity works and help you decide.

Because our company was created by experienced attorneys, we strive to be the best legal document service on the web. If you are not satisfied with our services, please contact us immediately and we will correct the situation, provide a refund or offer credit that can be used for future LegalZoom orders.
LegalZoom Satisfaction Guarantee Details:

If you're not satisfied, simply call us toll-free at (800) 773-0888 during our normal business hours. All requests made under this guarantee must be made within 60 days of purchase. We will process your request within 5 business days after we've received all of the documents and materials sent to you. Unfortunately, we can't refund or credit any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order. We also cannot refund any money paid by you directly to third parties, such as payments made by you directly to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products.
If you want to exchange the product you ordered for a different one, you must request this exchange and complete your replacement order within 60 days of purchase. The purchase price of the original item, less any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order, will be credited to your LegalZoom account. Any payments made directly by you to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products are not eligible for exchange or credit. Any price difference between the original order and the replacement order or, if a replacement order is not completed within 60 days of purchase, the full original purchase price (in each case less any money paid to government entities or other third parties) will be credited to the original form of payment. If you paid for your original order by check, LegalZoom will mail a check for the applicable amount to your billing address.
Please note that we cannot guarantee the results or outcome of your particular procedure. For instance, the government may reject a trademark application for legal reasons beyond the scope of LegalZoom's service. In some cases, a government backlog can lead to long delays before your process is complete. Similarly, LegalZoom does not guarantee the results or outcomes of the services rendered by our legal plan attorneys or attorney-assisted products. Problems like these are beyond our control and are not covered by this guarantee.
Since we're dedicating time and effort to your legal document preparation, our guarantee only covers satisfaction issues caused by LegalZoom - not changes to your situation or your state of mind.

Corporations Compared to LLCs









Knowledge Center&rtrif;Corporation&rtrif;Corporations Compared to LLCs 













        Corporations Compared to LLCs      
Limited liability companies (LLCs) are one of the newest types of business entities. Like corporations, they offer many benefits over partnerships and sole proprietorships. Whether an LLC or a corporation is better for a small business depends on the type of business. The best comparison here is between an LLC and an S corporation, because an LLC can choose to be taxed as an S corporation.
Social Security Taxes
The owners of the S corporation can take out some profits without Social Security taxes. For a large business in which the owners take out salaries of $118,500 or more plus profits, there would not be much difference, since the Social Security tax cuts out at that level as of 2015. However, for a smaller business, in which an owner could take out a $30,000 salary and $20,000 profit, the extra taxes on the $20,000 would be over $3,000.
Raising Money
If a corporation plans to go public or sell stock to a large group of people, the corporate stock might be easier to sell than membership interests in the LLC.
Liability Protection
An important advantage of an LLC is that in some states, a creditor cannot collect the members’ LLC distributions. With a corporation, creditors cannot collect a shareholder’s personal assets, but can collect the shareholder’s dividends.
Profits, Losses, and Taxes
The other advantages of LLCs are found in certain tax situations. For example, an LLC can make special allocations of profits and losses among members, whereas S corporations cannot. S corporations must have one class of ownership in which profits and losses are allocated according to the percentage ownership. In an LLC, money borrowed by the company can increase the tax basis (and lower the taxes) of the owners, whereas in an S corporation, it does not. Contributing property to set up an LLC is not taxable, even for minority interest owners, whereas for a corporation, regulations only allow it to be tax­ free for the contributors who have control of the business.
Foreign Ownership
The owners of an LLC can be foreign persons, other corporations, or any kind of trust, whereas the owners of S corporations cannot. An LLC may have an unlimited number of members, while an S corporation is limited to one hundred.
Management Options
LLCs are also popular because of their flexible management options, allowing owners to directly managed the business or have others handle the day to day operations. LLCs have fewer formalities than corporations, another advantage for some business owners.
Fringe Benefits
Corporations offer a greater variety of fringe benefit plans than any other business entity. Various retirement, stock option and employee stock purchase plans are available only for corporations. Plus, sole proprietors, partners and employees owning more than 2% of an S corporation must pay taxes on fringe benefits (such as group-term life insurance, medical reimbursement plans, medical insurance premiums and parking). Shareholder-employees of a C corporation do not have to pay taxes on these benefits.

The #1 network on weekends

NCM’s average weekly audience translates to a Nielsen rating of over 7.0 in adults 18 to 49, making FirstLook one of the top 10 primetime shows in the U.S. every week. In terms of average monthly reach, we rank 5th right between the Broadcast and major Cable Networks.  And to no surprise, NCM is the largest reach network on weekends.  And that’s only our movie screens - our reach goes beyond that.
We’ve got integrated, digital video platforms that capture the attention of millions of moviegoers before, during and after the movie. The best part is, we’re not just reaching an audience. We’re reaching the right audience — your target audience.
Do we have your attention? Because we most definitely have theirs.





Bigger really is better

Today, people are in full control of what they watch. As advertisers, you are constantly battling fragmented audiences, declining reach, and ad-skipping technology.  Who’s even watching your ads anymore?
That’s where we come in.
Our audience is in full “show me what you got” mode — staring up at a giant screen in a dark, comfortable movie theater. They are fully focused on your ad and we can prove it. According to Nielsen, NCM gets 33% higher engagement levels than live sports and broadcast prime TV.
Call NCM to harness the power of America’s Movie Network.

About NATIONAL CINEMEDIA, LLC

   National CineMedia (NCM) puts on its show before the real show starts at the movies (and even before the previews of coming attractions). Through its NCM Cinema Network, the company distributes in-theater advertising on about 20,150 movie screens across the US. NCM also produces and distributes
   
    FirstLook
   
   , a pre-show entertainment program and entertainment industry infomercial. Additionally, the company provides advertising to theater lobbies on its Lobby Entertainment Network (LEN). Major NCM shareholders include theater operators Regal Entertainment, AMC Entertainment, and Cinemark.
   Operations

   Nearly all of NCM's revenue comes from its advertising segment. In addition to FirstLook and its LEN, the company sells advertising across a 40-website network and on mobile apps Movie Night Out and CinemaSync.
  

   NCM's advertising network incorporates both satellite and terrestrial distribution technologies, and distributes
   
    FirstLook
   
   to screens across some 1,600 theaters. The company's LEN is a network of more than 3,000 TV and high-definition plasma screens located in about 1,475 theater lobbies. The screens are placed in high-traffic areas such as near concession stands and in other waiting areas and run a 30-minute loop of advertising.
  

   In addition, the company operates the NCM Interactive Network, which offers integrated marketing opportunities through more than 40 entertainment-related websites, online widgets, and mobile apps.

Strategy

   The company has been expanding its mobile apps to reach customers on their smart phones. Physical expansion is also part of NCM's plan for growth. NCM has entered into agreements with multiple new affiliate theater circuits in recent years.
  

   The company also intends to launch an aggressive sales, marketing, and public relations strategy to differentiate its marketing product compared to other national video networks.
  
Mergers and Acquisitions

   In fiscal 2014 NCM acquired Screenvision for $375 million of cash and stock.

What business type is right for you?
When you're starting a new business, you want to determine the business structure that's right for you. What's the difference between a limited liability company (LLC) and a corporation (Inc.)? And how is a C corporation different from an S corporation? Use these charts to help decide what business type is best for your needs.








LLC vs. Corporation






Limited Liability Company (LLC)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my LLCCorporation (Inc)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my Corporation







What is an S corporation?
After you create a corporation or LLC, you also have the opportunity to decide how you'd like your business to be taxed.Single owner LLCs can be taxed either as a sole proprietorship or a corporation.  LLCs with more than one owner can be taxed either as a partnership or a corporation.  Income from LLCs treated as sole proprietorships or partnerships is reported directly on the owner’s individual tax returns.New corporations, as well as LLCs considering corporate taxation can choose between filing taxes as a C corporation ("C corp") or an S corporation ("S corp"). An S corp is considered a "pass-through entity," which means the business itself isn't taxed. Instead, income is reported on the owners' personal tax returns. Businesses taxed as C corporations are not pass through entities.  Income is taxed at the corporate level, and, if dividends are distributed, at the individual level as well.We can help you understand your options so you choose what's best for your business. Talk to one of our network of attorneys today.








C-corp or S-corp 






Here's a comparison of some key characteristics of businesses that choose to be treated as C corps and S corps.C DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensS DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensYou don't have to decide about S corp status right away. You have 75 days after the formation of your business to file with the IRS. If you're still not sure what to do, you may want to consult with one of our attorneys or tax specialists.





Step-by-Step Guide on Starting Your Business













Easy as 1-2-3




1. Select the business structure that's right for you and fill out a simple questionnaire.





2. We'll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state.





3. You'll receive your completed paperwork by mail.








Ask away. We have answers.



Common questions

Can I start a business without creating a corporation or LLC?
You don't need a corporation or LLC to go into business. Many business owners are in partnerships or are sole proprietors. But both a corporation and LLC canshield you from liability and may offer tax advantages.


What are the main differences between an LLC and a sole proprietorship?
You don't need to file any paperwork with your state to create a sole proprietorship (though you may still need business permits and licenses to operate lawfully). But an LLC protects you from personal liability  - a sole proprietorship doesn't.Also, LLCs provide more flexibility as you grow your business.


What are the main differences between an LLC and an S corporation?
An LLC has more flexibility and fewer corporate formalities than an S corporation. S corporations are required to have annual meetings of shareholders and directors, while meetings of LLC member and/or managers are not required..  Also,  LLCs can provide for a flexible management structure by members or managers, while corporations require management by a Board of Directors.Learn more.


Do I need a name or DBA for my business?
You only need a DBA ("doing business as") if you are operating a sole proprietorship or partnership and you want to use a fictitious name for the business. You don't need a DBA for an LLC or a corporation unless you are using a name other than your LLC or corporate name while doing business.Learn more.


Do I need any other licenses or permits to start my business? 
Some cities, counties, and states require businesses to obtain licenses and permits to operate lawfully. We can help you figure out what you need. Learn More.

Compare Business Structures – LLC vs. Corporation, S Corporation and C Corporation 

		 You’ve decided to start a business, but you’re not sure where to begin. You don’t know if you should form an LLC or corporation, and need guidance to help you choose the right business structure. Each business structure has its advantages and disadvantages that are important to understand because choosing the wrong business entity could result in legal and tax implications down the road. The information above will allow you to compare LLC vs. corporation, and learn the difference between an S corporation and C corporation. LLCs and corporations both offer personal liability protection, but the most significant difference between LLC and corporation is that corporations are preferred by outside investors. When comparing LLC vs S corp, there are a few important differences to be aware of which are outlined above. Once you determine which business structure you need, you can start a business with LegalZoom in just three easy steps. The process begins by filling out a simple questionnaire. We’ll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state, and you’ll receive your completed paperwork by mail. If you need help deciding which business structure is right for you, a LegalZoom legal plan attorney can explain how each business entity works and help you decide.

The #1 network on weekends

NCM’s average weekly audience translates to a Nielsen rating of over 7.0 in adults 18 to 49, making FirstLook one of the top 10 primetime shows in the U.S. every week. In terms of average monthly reach, we rank 5th right between the Broadcast and major Cable Networks.  And to no surprise, NCM is the largest reach network on weekends.  And that’s only our movie screens - our reach goes beyond that.
We’ve got integrated, digital video platforms that capture the attention of millions of moviegoers before, during and after the movie. The best part is, we’re not just reaching an audience. We’re reaching the right audience — your target audience.
Do we have your attention? Because we most definitely have theirs.





Bigger really is better

Today, people are in full control of what they watch. As advertisers, you are constantly battling fragmented audiences, declining reach, and ad-skipping technology.  Who’s even watching your ads anymore?
That’s where we come in.
Our audience is in full “show me what you got” mode — staring up at a giant screen in a dark, comfortable movie theater. They are fully focused on your ad and we can prove it. According to Nielsen, NCM gets 33% higher engagement levels than live sports and broadcast prime TV.

National CineMedia (NCM) is an American cinema advertising company. NCM displays ads to U.S. consumers in movie theaters, online and through mobile technology. NCM presents cinema advertising across a digital in-theater network, consisting of theaters owned by AMC Entertainment Inc., Cinemark Holdings, Inc., Regal Entertainment Group and other regional theater circuits.
The publicly-traded National CineMedia, Inc. (NASDAQ: NCMI) owns 43.7% and is the managing partner of NCM. Regal, Cinemark and AMC hold the remainder of NCM shares.
The company is perhaps best known to the general public for its advertising preshow, FirstLook.

FirstLook[edit]
FirstLook is NCM's pre-feature programming. FirstLook consists of pre-show advertising and entertainment,[1] provided by content partners such as ABC Networks, A&E Television Networks, Amazon, Disney, Fandango, Google, Hulu, Microsoft, NBC, Nintendo and Turner Broadcasting System[2] interspersed with advertising. The program is approximately 20 minutes, and is timed to end exactly at the movie's start time, before any trailers. It is delivered via satellite, and several different versions are provided depending on the movie's MPAA rating.
If a 3D movie is showing, a special "FirstLook 3D" is shown after the original version. This consists of 3D advertisements.
If a G or PG movie is showing, a children's version of FirstLook, named "FirstLook Play", is shown in lieu of the original version. This usually is for movies directed at children with those ratings, though some PG movies may still have the regular FirstLook programming.
FirstLook is the successor to Regal's The 2wenty preshow, introduced to that chain in 2003. FirstLook carries largely that same format, the main difference being that while 2wenty was Regal-exclusive, FirstLook is fed to founding members circuits AMC, Cinemark, and Regal, as well as many NCM affiliate circuits such as Goodrich Quality Theaters, Hollywood Theaters, and Kerasotes.
Fathom Events[edit]
Fathom Events, formerly known as NCM Fathom, was a division of National CineMedia that offered alternative entertainment events in movie theaters. In December 2013, it was announced that NCM was restructuring Fathom Events as a new stand-alone entity owned by AMC, Cinemark, Regal Entertainment Group and NCM, with NCM retaining a 4% stake in the company.[3]
Past entertainment events have included:

The Metropolitan Opera live from New York City
Live concerts (The Black Eyed Peas, Queen, Paul Rodgers, Celine Dion, Garth Brooks, David Gilmour, Linkin Park, Kiss, Rod Stewart, Depeche Mode, Korn, Beastie Boys, The Rolling Stones, Bruce Springsteen, Green Day, Bon Jovi, Bowling for Soup, Brooks & Dunn, Eric Clapton's Crossroads Guitar Festival, Rush, Elton John, Peter Gabriel, Aly & AJ, Jesse McCartney, Usher, Jimmy Buffett, One Direction, Aerosmith, Yes, Meat Loaf, Godsmack,Michael Bublé, Carole King, Josh Groban, Phish, Matchbox Twenty, Prince, Kenny Chesney, Elvis Presley, Les Misérables)
Live sporting events (Mayweather/Márquez, UFC 111, Hopkins/Jones 2, Mayweather/Mosley, UFC 115, Final Four Games of the 2010 FIFA World Cup, Márquez/Díaz 2, UFC 118, Mosley/Mora, UFC 121, Mayweather/Ortiz, UFC 143, Mayweather/Cotto, UFC 154, Mayweather/Guerrero, Mayweather/Álvarez, UFC 167, Mayweather/Maidana 1, Mayweather/Maidana 2, UFC 181-185, UFC 187-UFC 189, UFC 192, Cotto/Alvarez)
Various films courtesy of Turner Classic Movies
Live town halls and other original programming[citation needed]
Filmed Broadway Musicals (e.g. Memphis: Direct from Broadway)
National Theatre Live: filmed plays from the National Theatre in London
Anime films
Children's films

NCM Digital[edit]
The NCM Digital offers 360-degree integrated marketing programs in combination with cinema, encompassing thousands of entertainment-related web sites and hundreds of mobile applications.
Firstlookonline.com is a consumer-based initiative targeting movie-going audiences with new movie content, trailers, movie showtimes and extended information.
Rejected merger[edit]
In May 2014, Screenvision entered into a merger agreement with NCM for US$375 million.[4] The merger was blocked by the Department of Justice over anti-trust concerns, since Screenvision and NCM together would supply advertising to 34,000 of the nation's 39,000 movie theaters.[5] In March 2015, Screenvision and NCM terminated their deal and NCM paid Screenvision a $26.8 million termination payment.[6]

National CineMedia (NCM) is an American cinema advertising company. NCM displays ads to U.S. consumers in movie theaters, online and through mobile technology. NCM presents cinema advertising across a digital in-theater network, consisting of theaters owned by AMC Entertainment Inc., Cinemark Holdings, Inc., Regal Entertainment Group and other regional theater circuits.
The publicly-traded National CineMedia, Inc. (NASDAQ: NCMI) owns 43.7% and is the managing partner of NCM. Regal, Cinemark and AMC hold the remainder of NCM shares.
The company is perhaps best known to the general public for its advertising preshow, FirstLook.

FirstLook[edit]
FirstLook is NCM's pre-feature programming. FirstLook consists of pre-show advertising and entertainment,[1] provided by content partners such as ABC Networks, A&E Television Networks, Amazon, Disney, Fandango, Google, Hulu, Microsoft, NBC, Nintendo and Turner Broadcasting System[2] interspersed with advertising. The program is approximately 20 minutes, and is timed to end exactly at the movie's start time, before any trailers. It is delivered via satellite, and several different versions are provided depending on the movie's MPAA rating.
If a 3D movie is showing, a special "FirstLook 3D" is shown after the original version. This consists of 3D advertisements.
If a G or PG movie is showing, a children's version of FirstLook, named "FirstLook Play", is shown in lieu of the original version. This usually is for movies directed at children with those ratings, though some PG movies may still have the regular FirstLook programming.
FirstLook is the successor to Regal's The 2wenty preshow, introduced to that chain in 2003. FirstLook carries largely that same format, the main difference being that while 2wenty was Regal-exclusive, FirstLook is fed to founding members circuits AMC, Cinemark, and Regal, as well as many NCM affiliate circuits such as Goodrich Quality Theaters, Hollywood Theaters, and Kerasotes.
Fathom Events[edit]
Fathom Events, formerly known as NCM Fathom, was a division of National CineMedia that offered alternative entertainment events in movie theaters. In December 2013, it was announced that NCM was restructuring Fathom Events as a new stand-alone entity owned by AMC, Cinemark, Regal Entertainment Group and NCM, with NCM retaining a 4% stake in the company.[3]
Past entertainment events have included:

The Metropolitan Opera live from New York City
Live concerts (The Black Eyed Peas, Queen, Paul Rodgers, Celine Dion, Garth Brooks, David Gilmour, Linkin Park, Kiss, Rod Stewart, Depeche Mode, Korn, Beastie Boys, The Rolling Stones, Bruce Springsteen, Green Day, Bon Jovi, Bowling for Soup, Brooks & Dunn, Eric Clapton's Crossroads Guitar Festival, Rush, Elton John, Peter Gabriel, Aly & AJ, Jesse McCartney, Usher, Jimmy Buffett, One Direction, Aerosmith, Yes, Meat Loaf, Godsmack,Michael Bublé, Carole King, Josh Groban, Phish, Matchbox Twenty, Prince, Kenny Chesney, Elvis Presley, Les Misérables)
Live sporting events (Mayweather/Márquez, UFC 111, Hopkins/Jones 2, Mayweather/Mosley, UFC 115, Final Four Games of the 2010 FIFA World Cup, Márquez/Díaz 2, UFC 118, Mosley/Mora, UFC 121, Mayweather/Ortiz, UFC 143, Mayweather/Cotto, UFC 154, Mayweather/Guerrero, Mayweather/Álvarez, UFC 167, Mayweather/Maidana 1, Mayweather/Maidana 2, UFC 181-185, UFC 187-UFC 189, UFC 192, Cotto/Alvarez)
Various films courtesy of Turner Classic Movies
Live town halls and other original programming[citation needed]
Filmed Broadway Musicals (e.g. Memphis: Direct from Broadway)
National Theatre Live: filmed plays from the National Theatre in London
Anime films
Children's films

NCM Digital[edit]
The NCM Digital offers 360-degree integrated marketing programs in combination with cinema, encompassing thousands of entertainment-related web sites and hundreds of mobile applications.
Firstlookonline.com is a consumer-based initiative targeting movie-going audiences with new movie content, trailers, movie showtimes and extended information.
Rejected merger[edit]
In May 2014, Screenvision entered into a merger agreement with NCM for US$375 million.[4] The merger was blocked by the Department of Justice over anti-trust concerns, since Screenvision and NCM together would supply advertising to 34,000 of the nation's 39,000 movie theaters.[5] In March 2015, Screenvision and NCM terminated their deal and NCM paid Screenvision a $26.8 million termination payment.[6]

FirstLook[edit]
FirstLook is NCM's pre-feature programming. FirstLook consists of pre-show advertising and entertainment,[1] provided by content partners such as ABC Networks, A&E Television Networks, Amazon, Disney, Fandango, Google, Hulu, Microsoft, NBC, Nintendo and Turner Broadcasting System[2] interspersed with advertising. The program is approximately 20 minutes, and is timed to end exactly at the movie's start time, before any trailers. It is delivered via satellite, and several different versions are provided depending on the movie's MPAA rating.
If a 3D movie is showing, a special "FirstLook 3D" is shown after the original version. This consists of 3D advertisements.
If a G or PG movie is showing, a children's version of FirstLook, named "FirstLook Play", is shown in lieu of the original version. This usually is for movies directed at children with those ratings, though some PG movies may still have the regular FirstLook programming.
FirstLook is the successor to Regal's The 2wenty preshow, introduced to that chain in 2003. FirstLook carries largely that same format, the main difference being that while 2wenty was Regal-exclusive, FirstLook is fed to founding members circuits AMC, Cinemark, and Regal, as well as many NCM affiliate circuits such as Goodrich Quality Theaters, Hollywood Theaters, and Kerasotes.
Fathom Events[edit]
Fathom Events, formerly known as NCM Fathom, was a division of National CineMedia that offered alternative entertainment events in movie theaters. In December 2013, it was announced that NCM was restructuring Fathom Events as a new stand-alone entity owned by AMC, Cinemark, Regal Entertainment Group and NCM, with NCM retaining a 4% stake in the company.[3]
Past entertainment events have included:

NCM Digital[edit]
The NCM Digital offers 360-degree integrated marketing programs in combination with cinema, encompassing thousands of entertainment-related web sites and hundreds of mobile applications.
Firstlookonline.com is a consumer-based initiative targeting movie-going audiences with new movie content, trailers, movie showtimes and extended information.
Rejected merger[edit]
In May 2014, Screenvision entered into a merger agreement with NCM for US$375 million.[4] The merger was blocked by the Department of Justice over anti-trust concerns, since Screenvision and NCM together would supply advertising to 34,000 of the nation's 39,000 movie theaters.[5] In March 2015, Screenvision and NCM terminated their deal and NCM paid Screenvision a $26.8 million termination payment.[6]

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
