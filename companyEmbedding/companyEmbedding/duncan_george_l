George L. Duncan













                    
                    George L. Duncan is an avid golfer but his game was no where near good enough to make the pro tour, or even the semi-pro tour, so he turned to writing. A veteran journalist, he has also written several novels. The latest is "At Play in the Seas of the Lord." A native of Florida, he is now in the cold, desolate barren state of Colorado. (OK, it's not that bad and is actually very pleasant and scenic.)www.endtimestavern.com

It is indeed my pleasure to recommend George Duncan. Prior to my retirement from Delphi Corp, I was Director of Human Resources for the Delphi Division located in Kokomo, Indiana responsible for world-wide HR activities. I came in contact with many people and helped shape many careers over my 42 years. George’s skills and abilities are certainly of the type that would be a good benefit to any company. He is a highly respected executive level manager, well known for solving difficult problems.  I know George to be honest, of good report, with strong leadership skills. 

As a professional HR person, I am often asked to write letters such as this, and some are easy and some are difficult. I can honestly tell you that this is not only easy but a real joy. George not only has the talent to fill any type managerial need, but any employer would also be gaining a person with unquestionable moral and ethical behavior traits. In addition, I really appreciate George’s inviting personality, sincere genuineness, and common sense approach to life. George has a very strong work ethic, and I highly recommend George.

I am sure any leadership team would benefit from having such a talented effective person such as George. If I can provide any more detail or answer any of your questions, please call me at 765-628-7909. Thank you for your willingness to read this letter.

It's free!Your colleagues, classmates, and 500 million other professionals are on LinkedIn.View Duncan’s Full ProfileSummaryCareer focus has been the development of large scale, enterprise class IT systems, with sub-specialty on legacy system rehabilitation and re-design.  Subsequently I worked more on the business side understanding and translating requirements into artefacts a development team can profitably work with.  (See recent experience at WSIB, below).  It has been my experience that management of large-scale IT teams is invariably unsuccessful when not informed by an engineering education and practical design experience.  The "big bite" approach taken with conventional large engineering projects, for example skyscraper construction, the Three Gorges Dam and the English Chunnel, does not extend to large IT development projects.  Small teams working under a mandate of progressive ambition following a single corporate vision is a better guide.An important asset I bring to IT projects is the ability to explain to senior managers how business ambition and project schedules must be aligned with the reality of project productivity.  Even with the technologies available in the second decade of the 21st century, organizing, structuring and processing complex information is still very challenging.  Human nature being what it is, changing entrenched patterns of thought is always a demanding challenge.Recent experience in Ontario's and Toronto's public service has been particularly instructive.  Careful analysis of program objectives and project issues, presented in a factual manner, can lead to surprising and productive results.  There is a great deal of opportunity for creative professionals in the public sector as it transitions to web interaction with general society.Specialties: IT project design, planning and managementTeam building and design collaborationCertified coach-mentor, talent identification and developmentMaster system design engineer and solution architectRecognized teacher, facilitator and educatorExperienceBusiness AnalystDigital Embrace Inc.March 2016  –  October 2016 (8 months)Business AnalystWorplace Safety and Insurance BoardMarch 2016  –  October 2016 (8 months)ConsultantLGM Music PublishingJanuary 2012  –  January 2015 (3 years 1 month)ConsultantTangentia ConsultingMay 2012  –  November 2012 (7 months)Business Systems AnalystFrank Cowan Company2012  –  2012 (less than a year)Course FacilitatorCanadian Ski Coaches Federation2005  –  2012 (7 years)Instructor & coachCraigleith, Alpine and Mansfield Ski Clubs2003  –  2012 (9 years)Ski instructorCSIA1991  –  2012 (21 years)Senior business systems analystRevenue Services, City of TorontoFebruary 2010  –  August 2011 (1 year 7 months)ConsultantMinistry of Health and Long-Term CareNovember 2007  –  March 2009 (1 year 5 months)LeadMOHLTCNovember 2007  –  March 2009 (1 year 5 months)Vice President, Product DevelopmentInformiam2004  –  2005 (1 year)Practice ManagerOracle CanadaMay 1998  –  January 2002 (3 years 9 months)Corporate Systems Architect; later, Director of New DevelopmentTeleglobe Insurance SystemsOctober 1995  –  April 1998 (2 years 7 months)VP Software DevelopmentPicture Data Inc.March 1981  –  April 1988 (7 years 2 months)Toronto, Canada AreaVolunteer Experience & CausesCanvasserHeart and Stroke FoundationJanuary 2013HealthCommunity canvasser for annual drive in my town (Whitchurch-Stouffville, Ontario).Systems design engineerSuper Arrow ProjectFebruary 2015Science and TechnologyJoe Green conceived of a successor to the A.V. Roe Arrow interceptor aircraft to fulfill Canada's air defence needs in view of its failed attempt to successfully adapt and acquire the Lockheed-Martin F-35 JSF.  After reviewing several A-2 projects I concluded that Joe had the right concept, and a realistic vision of how to proceed in such a Quixotic enterprise that may one day bear concrete results.  Not the least of Joe's many fine qualities is his team-oriented approach to the project, coupled with a ready willingness to delegate the hard engineering work to partners with the skill and requisite experience.

While probably I'm not in the same league as my hero Robert Tarjan (who I think should have won the Fields medal for his paper describing a linear, planar, embedding algorithm for an arbitrary graph), my thesis opened up an entirely new approach to design algorithms to solve sparse linear systems.  For a masters degree, however, it took far too long (three years), after which I was mentally spent, and abandoned the field to seek fortune and fame in control systems engineering, my first love.Activities and Societies: My thesis provided the first provably efficient algorithm that heuristically partitioned an NP-Complete problem into roughly equal sub-problems.  While this doesn't solve the outstanding theoretical question, it does provide a practical approach to solving large-scale, sparse, linear, engineering systems.  This recasts NP-Completeness as to whether there is a polynomial algorithm that can partition any NP-Complete problem into approximately equal sub-problems.  If yes, NP-Completeness is solved.University of WaterlooB.A.Sc., Systems Design Engineering, A++ (Earned NRC scholarship to graduate school)B.A.Sc., Systems Design Engineering, A++ (Earned NRC scholarship to graduate school)1973  –  1976Fundamental contribution to question of NP-Completeness.  Master's thesis recast the problem as follows: If there is a polynomial algorithm that can partition any member of the class of NP-Complete problems into approximately equal sub-problems, the question of NP-Completeness is resolved as a computable matter.  My thesis did not provide such an algorithm (indeed, in the 35 years since no one else has either), but did provide a provably efficient heuristic algorithm to do just that.  It's gobbledygook to most folks, but a deeply important computational issue for modelling exceedingly complex phenomena such as weather forecasting and micro-tiny integrated circuit design.

It is becoming clear that we are entering the fourth generation of software engineering.  The first three can be summarized as FORTRAN/COBOL/HTML, Unix/C, and C++/Java.  HTML and early web site technologies such as CSS & Javascript are better lumped with first generation technologies.The current challenge is to marry the disciplines of modern software design (e.g. OOSC) with modern software technologies (e.g. TypeScript, Node, ECMAScript 6), then to harness the marriage for industrial use.Team members: Duncan GeorgePublicationsEnterprise Models for Managing Large-Scale Busines Transformations & Enterprise IntegrationKluwer Academic PublishersOctober 2000Case study on using enterprise models to manage business re-engineering and event-based integration of a global supply chain organizationAuthors: Duncan George, Vladimir OrovicRecommendationsA preview of what LinkedIn members have to say about Duncan:Duncan was my boss for a year, which made for a good, if very busy, year.  He maintains a very strong interest in all the gritty details of technology making him easy to communicate with from a developers standpoint.

He's very hands on, and likes to keep track of all the details often getting involved with the design and technology troubleshooting.

Also just to be clear, I only became a rabbit after Duncan left :)  His managment made me feel very much an included and valued member of the team.See moreSee lessI worked for Duncan at Oracle Consulting Canada between the years 2000-2002.  Duncan was a Practice Manager for the Enterprise Architecture team.  Together we wrote a methodology to perform Enterprise Architecture using Messaging Architectures.

Not only was Duncan a great subject matter expert in the area of Enterprise Business Architecture / Application Architecture, but he was also a great mentor.  I learned a lot during my years working for Duncan.

He was also a very effective facilitator at meetings / JAD sessions with clients.  He was a great professional effectively guiding and managing clients through the enitre project lifecycle process.

He will be a valuable asset to any organization that hires him.See moreSee lessSign up to see who recommended DuncanGroupsAPCC - Association of Professional Computer ConsultantsView Duncan’s full profile to...See who you know in commonGet introducedContact Duncan directlyView Duncan’s Full ProfileNot the Duncan you’re looking for?
