PolyMet NorthMet Project at a Glance


Location
We are located in northeastern Minnesota near the community of Hoyt Lakes, within the established Mesabi Iron Range mining district. The project is located south of the Laurentian Divide in the St. Louis River basin, 175 river miles upstream from Lake Superior. The Laurentian Divide separates the St. Louis River basin from the Rainy River basin, where the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness is located.
Ownership and control
We control 100 percent of the NorthMet ore body through perpetually renewable leases with private mineral owners. We also own the Erie Plant site and associated infrastructure, including power, road, rail and existing tailings basin.
Land Exchange
The U.S. Forest Service has authorized a land exchange with PolyMet to consolidate our respective land ownerships. The Forest Service will acquire 6,690 acres of private land from PolyMet to become part of the Superior National Forest; we will acquire 6,650 acres of surface land over the mineral deposit we already control. For more details about the land exchange, download our land exchange booklet.
Acreage
Our project features two significant assets: the deposit itself, and the former LTV Steel processing facilities and infrastructure, which we will repurpose. Together, they cover approximately 19,000 contiguous acres, or nearly 30 square miles of land.
Production
We will annually produce 72 million pounds of copper, 15.4 million pounds of nickel, 720,000 pounds of cobalt and 106,000 troy ounces of precious metals in concentrate – essential metals for our modern lifestyles and national security. See more details on production in the Technical Report (PDF).
Environmental commitment
Our mine and processing facilities are designed to comply with all applicable state and federal standards to protect Minnesota’s water, air and other natural resources. These are some of the strictest standards in the country. We also will clean up legacy water issues left from former taconite mining and processing operations on the property. A comprehensive 10-year environmental review of the project completed by state and federal regulatory agencies demonstrates that the project is capable of meeting standards.
For more details about how we will protect Minnesota’s water, download our water quality fact sheet. You can also read a summary of the environmental review and permitting highlights.
Mining method
Our project will be mined by open pit methods to a depth of approximately 700 feet below surface. Read more details on the mining and processing method.
Permit time frame
We have applied for state and federal permits to operate the mine and processing facilities over a 20 year period, processing approximately 225 million tons of ore.
Processing method
Ore from the mine will be transported approximately six miles west by rail to the existing Erie Plant facilities, which we own and will modernize. We will use existing crushing facilities combined with new milling and flotation circuits to produce copper and nickel concentrates that will be shipped via the existing railhead.
Eventually, we may install an autoclave to upgrade the nickel concentrate. Read more details on the mining and processing method.
NorthMet ore body
The NorthMet deposit, located in the Partridge River Intrusion of the Duluth Complex, is a large, near-surface, disseminated deposit containing copper, nickel, cobalt, platinum, palladium, gold and silver. It holds 275 million tons of Proven and Probable Reserves grading 0.28 percent copper and 0.08 percent nickel. The NorthMet deposit, however, contains a total of 694 million tons of Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources grading 0.27 percent copper and 0.08 percent nickel. [See “Cautionary note to U.S. investors” regarding disclosure on Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources here. Please refer to the Technical Report (PDF) for assumptions and explanations.] Read more details on the deposit’s geology and mineralogy.
Economics
Our project will employ 360 workers directly, create more than 600 indirect jobs, and generate an estimated $515 million annually for St. Louis County according to an independent study (PDF) by the University of Minnesota Duluth Labovitz School of Business and Economics. Approximately $300 million already has been invested in the project. We also must provide bankruptcy-proof financial assurance, the provisions of which are in the Permit to Mine application.
When draft permits are issued, we plan to issue an updated Definitive Feasibility Study including updated capital and operating costs and project economics. Read more details in the latest PolyMet financial report.
Construction
The project will require about 18-24 months for construction and ramp up to full production once permits are in hand. It will require an estimated two million construction hours – about the same number of hours required to build Target Field, home of the Minnesota Twins Major League Baseball team.
Support
We enjoy tremendous local support for the project, receiving resolutions of support from more than 30 local city, county and other government and business institutions. We also have the support of Jobs for Minnesotans, a partnership of statewide business and labor groups formed to advance copper-nickel mining in Minnesota. We are sincerely grateful for the encouragement and support we receive from our local communities. See who has officially endorsed the project.

Company Overview


PolyMet Mining Corp. is a publicly-traded mine development company focused on permitting, building and operating the NorthMet copper-nickel precious metals project through its wholly owned subsidiary, Poly Met Mining, Inc., a Minnesota corporation, together known as PolyMet.
Our stock trades on both the Toronto and New York stock exchanges (TSX: POM; NYSE AMERICAN: PLM.) We have approximately 19,000 shareholders, including Glencore, which owns approximately 30 percent of our issued shares, and nearly 11,000 shareholders in Minnesota who collectively own approximately 21 percent of our issued shares.
We control the NorthMet copper-nickel-precious metals ore body through long-term mineral leases; we own and will repurpose the nearby Erie Plant and associated infrastructure on the former LTV Steel Mining Company site; and we are completing a land exchange with the U.S. Forest Service to obtain surface ownership of land above and around the NorthMet deposit. The Erie Plant is located approximately six miles west of the NorthMet deposit and is connected to it by private rail and road. Upon completion of the land exchange, we will own approximately 19,000 acres (nearly 30 square miles) of contiguous surface rights.
The Erie Plant and associated infrastructure is an iconic fixture on the Iron Range. Originally built in the 1950s to process iron ore, we acquired it indirectly out of LTV Steel’s 2001 bankruptcy. Reutilizing this facility not only improves the economics of the NorthMet Project, it substantially reduces the environmental impact compared with building new facilities, enabling us to extend the rich mining heritage of the region.
Our leadership and development team has decades of experience in mining finance, permitting, environmental compliance and management, community and government relations, and facilities management. Many of our families have been part of the local community in Northeastern Minnesota for generations.
We share a common vision to permit, build and operate the project in a responsible and profitable manner, and strive to foster trust across a wide spectrum of state and federal regulators, elected officials, labor and business leaders, conservationists, vendors and suppliers, communities and private citizens, as well as our shareholders and business partners. We know many are counting on us to create good jobs and produce these essential metals.
We appreciate the encouragement we receive from local communities, labor and business organizations, elected officials and citizens who recognize that jobs and sound environmental stewardship can co-exist.
The project continues to take major steps forward. State and federal agencies have completed a comprehensive environmental review, the U.S. Forest Service has authorized the land exchange with its Final Record of Decision, and the permitting process is underway to develop the new open-pit mine and repurpose and restart the existing processing facilities.

Style Scores:



NA Value | NA Growth | NA Momentum | NA VGM                


The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.


Value Score

Growth Score

Momentum Score

VGM Score

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

The Exchange Traded Funds prospectus contains its investment objectives, risks, charges, expenses and other important information you should read and consider carefully prior to making an investment decision.
        Please review the current prospectus, available from the Prospectus link on www.motifinvesting.com, by phone at 1-855-586-6843, or in writing at Motif Investing, Inc., P.O. Box 3548, Rancho Cordova, CA  95741.
ETFs have unique features that you should be aware of, which can include distribution of any gains, risks related to securities within the portfolio, and tax consequences. The data quoted herein represents past performance and is not indicative of future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that your investment, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original value. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data provided.  Please review the prospectus or other research tools provided on this site for more recent information. Contact Motif Investing at 1-855-586-6843 to obtain the most recent month-end performance data.
The 30-Day SEC Yield reflects the dividends and interest earned during the past 30 days after the deduction of the ETF’s expenses.  The 30-day SEC Yield is an annual percentage rate based on the ETF's share price and is calculated by dividing the net investment income per share for the 30 days ended on the date of calculation by that day’s maximum share price.  The Distribution Yield is the trailing 12-Month End Yield derived by adding the trailing 12-month's income distributions and dividing the total by the last month's ending share price. Income refers to interest payments from fixed-income ETFs and dividend payments from stock-based ETFs.
The ETF prospectus is provided by DFS (http://www.rrdonnelley.com/financial-services/). The use of this prospectus is restricted solely to the website of Motif Investing and may not be redistributed, copied or otherwise made available without the express written consent of DFS. Donnelley Financial, LLC. d/b/a EDGAR Online and the information providers herein make no claims concerning the validity of the information provided hereby and will not be held liable for any use of this information.

Fixed income investments are subject to various unique risks, including changes in credit quality, market valuations, liquidity, prepayments, early redemption,
    corporate events, tax ramifications, and other factors. Fixed income securities are subject to increased loss of principal during periods of rising interest rates.


The 1-Year Return/Return Since Inception indicates the performance of this particular motif over the last 12 months or, if the motif was created within the past 12 months, since the date the motif was created. See how we calculate returns.


The Motif Index level represents the performance of a benchmark motif (a motif in our catalog) over time. It is set at 
1000 on the date of inception of the motif. For example, a Motif Index of 1100 represents a 10% return since inception. Similarly, the change in the Index over a 
specified period represents the period return on the portfolio holding the same share weights as the benchmark motif.
The Motif Index is a measure created and maintained by the firm, which has the discretion to change the holdings that comprise the index and to make alterations to a particular Motif Index.


Popularity shows you how much interest a motif is attracting, compared to other motifs. We base this score on a proprietary formula that uses factors like how many people are viewing the motif, and how much conversation about it is happening in the community, in a range from Low-to-High.
The Volatility measurement for a Motif represents the annualized standard deviation of daily returns on a portfolio holding the same share weights as the Motif, and is measured in a range from Low to High. Since the standard deviation of returns are commonly used as a measure of portfolio risk, a Volatility measurement that is High is indicative of the fact that holding the motif in the past subjected the holder to larger fluctuations or higher risk.
The Valuation metric represents the present valuation of the stocks in the motif relative to the broader equity market. The Valuation metric is calculated as the composite Price-to-Earnings ratio for the stocks in the motif weighted by their respective share weights in a range from Low to High.


Standard pricing: $9.95 total commission per motif transaction. Other fees may apply. For details on fees and commissions, please

        Performance returns, including 1-month Return/Return Since Inception/1-year returns indicates the performance of this particular motif over that stated period of time as of the date provided.

Investing in securities involves risks, you should be aware of prior to making an investment decision, including the possible loss of principal. An investment in individual stocks, or a collection of stocks
    focused on a particular theme or idea, such as a motif, may be subject to increased risk of price fluctuation over more diversified holdings due to adverse developments which can affect a particular industry or sector.
    Investments in ETFs can include those with a narrow or targeted investment strategy and can be subject to similar sector risks than more broadly diversified investments.

Polymet Mining   Erie Plant formerly owned by LTV Steel Mining Company.    Website: www.polymetmining.com/   Tapping the potential of the Duluth Complex The Duluth Complex contains the world's largest undeveloped deposits of non-ferrous metal. These copper-nickel-cobalt-platinum-palladium-gold deposits are in a belt stretching 30 miles just south of the eastern end of the historic Mesabi Iron Range-the major source of iron ore for the domestic steel industry for more than 100 years. PolyMet's project is comprised of two significant assets: the NorthMet deposit and the Erie Plant formerly owned by LTV Steel Mining Company, which is an iron ore processing facility six miles west of the deposit, connected by a private railroad.   DNR: Polymet's Mining Plan Meets Standards  ST. PAUL, Minn. - The Minnesota DNR's final environmental review for Minnesota's proposed PolyMet copper-nickel mine says the company's proposal meets the state's environmental and health standards. The 3,500 page report, known as a final environmental impact statement, or EIS, is a 10 year study that found PolyMet's plan is sound enough to protect the state's natural resources.  KARE 11  Polymet Mining  The document says mine runoff would not reach the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness or Voyageurs National Park, which has been a concern raised by critics. It also said PolyMet would employ state of the art technology to maintain air quality and reduce harmful emissions.   "It's been thoughtful, objective and thorough. We've really turned this upside down, inside out, backward and forward to take a look at it," said Tom Landwehr, MN DNR Commissioner.  Landwehr compared the process to an inspection when someone buys a house, pointing out strengths and weaknesses. He emphasized the environmental review is not a recommendation for the project, neither for nor against the construction of the open pit mine.  "We are truly neutral, either support or are opposed to the project," said Landwehr.  Landwehr said PolyMet would have to make sure that all cleanup costs are covered after the mine closes, which would be determined during the permitting process. The report also said wastewater treatment plans must be kept in place indefinitely.  That's the boiling point for environmental groups opposed to the project.  "We are talking about a water treatment model that is based on data the company built and the DNR has never independently verified – there is a lot to be concerned about here," said Kathryn Hoffman, Minnesota Center for Environmental Advocacy attorney.  As the DNR claims it has acted independently, Hoffman says Minnesotans shouldn't believe it's safe.  "That's right, because that claim is based on faulty data, because it's PolyMet's data," said Hoffman.  PolyMet faces an extensive process, more than 20 permits, according to Landwehr, who said it's still too premature to determine whether the project will move forward.  PolyMet President and CEO Jon Cherry called the final environmental review a huge milestone and in a press release, said "The Final EIS demonstrates that PolyMet can mine and process copper, nickel and platinum group metals in a manner that complies with the law, protects the environment and creates hundreds of high-paying jobs in northern Minnesota while creating value for shareholders."  Governor Mark Dayton visited mines in South Dakota and Michigan ahead of his decision whether to advance copper and nickel mining on the Iron Range and has described the decision as one of the most difficult he'll make in his career. He said he also require an exhaustive financial review of the company.  The $650 million dollar project would be located in the St. Louis River watershed on the eastern edge of the Mesabi Iron Range, about 6 miles south of Babbitt and about 1 mile south of the existing iron-ore Northshore Mine. Processing of the ore would take place at a former industrial site, the LTV steel plant in Hoyt Lakes.  Concerns can be addressed in a 30-day public comment period. The agency will determine early next year, likely in February, whether the review is adequate. Then the company can start applying for permits.      Providing Metals used in daily life After years of environmental research and project development, PolyMet is poised to begin mining in Minnesota's Duluth Complex-which contains one of the world's largest undeveloped non-ferrous metal deposits. PolyMet will mine and process metals used in daily life, including:   Copper - construction, plumbing and electric wiring. 	Nickel - stainless steel and rechargeable batteries. 	Cobalt - household magnets and hybrid vehicles. 	Platinum & palladium - catalytic converters that reduce automobile pollution. 	Gold - jewelry, dental and medical applications, computers and electronics.   PolyMet is working to complete the environmental review and permitting in 2010 and expects to begin construction in 2010.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score
A


Growth Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Common questions

What's the difference between a C corporation and an S corporation?
The IRS allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a "C corporation" or an "S corporation." Income from C corporations are subject to double taxation; that is, the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporation.S corporations have only one level of taxation. The shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation, but an S corporation does not pay taxes on its net income. While the S corporation is popular among small business owners, C corporations have greater tax planning flexibility.


How does a corporation protect my personal assets?
If a business operates as a corporation, the business owners, called shareholders, are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation. That's because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners. If a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity, then anyone seeking to collect a debt from, or enforce a claim against, a corporation, would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves. They would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation.


Why do many people choose to form their corporation in Delaware?
Delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations. However, the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public. Delaware's laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders, and Delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes. These benefits don't mean much to smaller corporations. Keep in mind that if a corporation forms in Delaware and does business in another state, the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork, and pay any taxes and/or fees required to do business in that state. Given those factors, many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business.


What is an EIN?
An employer identification number (EIN), also known as a federal tax identification number, is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes. It's like a Social Security number, but for a business. In general, most businesses need an EIN. The only reason a business would not get an EIN is if it has only one owner, elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes, and does not want to open a separate business bank account. In this case, the owner would use their Social Security number as the business identifier. However, there are disadvantages to this approach, namely the risk of liability.


How are LLCs taxed?
Unlike a corporation, LLCs have some flexibility in how they're taxed. Depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects, the LLC can be taxed as either a corporation, partnership or as part of the owner's personal tax return (called a "disregarded entity"). By default, an LLC with two or more members are taxed as a partnership, unless they file an IRS Form 8832 to elect to be treated as a corporation. If the LLC has only one owner, it will be taxed as a sole proprietor, unless the owner files Form 8832. It's not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed. You have up to 12 months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision.


What is a registered agent?
A registered agent (sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent) is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business. States require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity. While you can be your own registered agent, there are disadvantages. You have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record. If you miss a filing deadline, you risk being fined or shut down. Our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents, sort through junk mail and keep your information private.


Is a corporation right for me?
It depends on many factors. Get help deciding by answering a few questions here.

The LegalZoom 3-step process was developed by attorneys from some of the most prestigious law firms in America. There are no complex instructions to follow and nothing to download or print. Simply answer a few questions and get started on
              setting up your corporation.

Here's how it works:

Complete the Incorporation Questionnaire
						Complete our simple questionnaire. With LegalZoom, you can choose to form a new corporation or incorporate an existing business. You can also select provisions to help you guard against personal liability.
We Create and File Your Incorporation Papers
						We create and file the Articles of Incorporation (or, in some states, the "Certificate of Formation" or "Certificate of Incorporation") with the Secretary of State (or in some states, the "Department of State" or "Corporation Commission"). We even create company-specific bylaws and organizational minutes.
Final Wrap-Up
						When we receive your filed Articles of Incorporation back from the state, we send them to you along with the rest of your formation documents, as well as easy instructions regarding next steps.

Common questions

What's the difference between a C corporation and an S corporation?
The IRS allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a "C corporation" or an "S corporation." Income from C corporations are subject to double taxation; that is, the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporation.S corporations have only one level of taxation. The shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation, but an S corporation does not pay taxes on its net income. While the S corporation is popular among small business owners, C corporations have greater tax planning flexibility.


How does a corporation protect my personal assets?
If a business operates as a corporation, the business owners, called shareholders, are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation. That's because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners. If a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity, then anyone seeking to collect a debt from, or enforce a claim against, a corporation, would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves. They would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation.


Why do many people choose to form their corporation in Delaware?
Delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations. However, the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public. Delaware's laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders, and Delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes. These benefits don't mean much to smaller corporations. Keep in mind that if a corporation forms in Delaware and does business in another state, the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork, and pay any taxes and/or fees required to do business in that state. Given those factors, many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business.


What is an EIN?
An employer identification number (EIN), also known as a federal tax identification number, is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes. It's like a Social Security number, but for a business. In general, most businesses need an EIN. The only reason a business would not get an EIN is if it has only one owner, elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes, and does not want to open a separate business bank account. In this case, the owner would use their Social Security number as the business identifier. However, there are disadvantages to this approach, namely the risk of liability.


How are LLCs taxed?
Unlike a corporation, LLCs have some flexibility in how they're taxed. Depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects, the LLC can be taxed as either a corporation, partnership or as part of the owner's personal tax return (called a "disregarded entity"). By default, an LLC with two or more members are taxed as a partnership, unless they file an IRS Form 8832 to elect to be treated as a corporation. If the LLC has only one owner, it will be taxed as a sole proprietor, unless the owner files Form 8832. It's not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed. You have up to 12 months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision.


What is a registered agent?
A registered agent (sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent) is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business. States require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity. While you can be your own registered agent, there are disadvantages. You have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record. If you miss a filing deadline, you risk being fined or shut down. Our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents, sort through junk mail and keep your information private.


Is a corporation right for me?
It depends on many factors. Get help deciding by answering a few questions here.
