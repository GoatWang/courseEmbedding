	Borrowings under the Senior Credit Facilities are determined at NRGs election, at LIBOR or at base rate, in each case, plus an applicable margin.

	No action, consent or approval of, registration or filing with, notice to, or any other action by, any Governmental Authority is or will be required in connection with this First Amendment or the Amended Credit Agreement, except for (i) the filing of UCC financing statements and filings with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and the United States Copyright Office, (ii) recordation of modifications of the Mortgages, if any, (iii) actions specifically described in Section 3.19 of the Credit Agreement or any of the Security Documents, if any, (iv) any immaterial actions, consents, approvals, registrations or filings or (v) such as have been made or obtained and are in full force and effect.
