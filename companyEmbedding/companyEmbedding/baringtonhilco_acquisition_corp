Barington/Hilco Acquisition Corp.    Hilco Global has formed a Special Purpose Acquisition Company (“SPAC”) in partnership with Barrington Capital. A SPAC is a unique investment vehicle that provides a private company an attractive opportunity to go public with advantages relative to an IPO (speed, inexpensive, certainty, participation in upside, etc.). The SPAC entity that we have created is called Barington/Hilco Acquisition Corp. (Nasdaq: “BHACU”) and it is a company formed for the purpose of entering into a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or other similar business combination.  We will be working with well-known activist investor and Barington Capital CEO, James Mitarotonda, who will be serving as the Chairman and CEO of BHAC.   
Barington Capital Group and Hilco Global have significant experience investing, operating and advising consumer focused businesses and helping such companies increase long-term shareholder value. BHAC will provide ongoing strategic sponsorship to a merger partner to accelerate strategic growth initiatives and provide a smooth transition to the U.S. public markets.  BHAC has approximately $43 million in available cash and is seeking merger partners with $10 million+ in EBITDA, above $100 million in revenues, and a strong management team willing to operate a public company. There is a focus on the consumer/retail industry; however the principals have broad experience across many industries. There is substantial flexibility in structuring and customizing a merger that takes full advantage of the management team, growth potential and experience of the principals.   If you have questions or comments contact Joseph Miller or Cory Lipoff at Hilco Global.

Barington/Hilco Acquisition Corp. Announces Closing Of Initial Public Offering

Feb 11, 2015, 21:00 ET
		  		  					
						 from   Barington/Hilco Acquisition Corp. 











 
















































 

 




















 


NEW YORK, Feb. 11, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Barington/Hilco Acquisition Corp. (Nasdaq:   BHACU) (the "Company"), a blank check company formed for the purpose of entering into a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or other similar business combination, today announced the closing of its initial public offering of 4,000,000 units at $10.00 per unit. The total gross proceeds to the Company from this offering are $40 million before deducting the underwriting discount and other estimated offering expenses payable by the Company. 
Each unit consists of one share of common stock, one right to receive one-tenth (1/10) of one share of common stock on the consummation of an initial business combination, and one warrant to purchase one-half of one share of common stock at a price of $12.50 per full share, subject to adjustment, commencing on the later of the completion of an initial business combination and February 5, 2016.  
The Company has granted the underwriters a 45-day option to purchase up to an additional 600,000 units at the initial public offering price, less the underwriting discount, to cover over-allotments, if any.
Of the proceeds received from the consummation of the initial public offering and a simultaneous private placement of units, $40,800,000 (or $10.20 per share sold in the public offering) was placed in trust. An audited balance sheet of the Company as of February 11, 2015 reflecting receipt of the proceeds upon consummation of the initial public offering and the private placement will be included as Exhibit 99.1 to a Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The units began trading Friday, February 6, 2015 on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol "BHACU". Once the securities comprising the units begin separate trading, the common stock, rights and warrants are expected to be listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbols "BHAC", "BHACR" and "BHACW", respectively
EarlyBirdCapital, Inc. acted as the sole book-running manager for the offering. Aegis Capital Corp. and I-Bankers Securities acted as co-managers. 
A registration statement relating to these securities has been declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 5, 2015. The offering was made only by means of a prospectus. A copy of the final prospectus relating to the offering may be obtained for free by visiting the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's website at www.sec.gov. Alternatively, a copy of the final prospectus may be obtained by contacting EarlyBirdCapital, Inc., Attention: Prospectus Department, 366 Madison Avenue, 8th Floor, New York, New York 10017, Attn: Aimee Bloch, (212) 661-0200.  
This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy, nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation, or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state or jurisdiction.
