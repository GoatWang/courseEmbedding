Sport Endurance, Inc. Launches Direct to Consumer Men’s Health 
      Supplement Product




Launches Website to Market Men’s Health Product Direct to Consumers






March 01, 2017 09:00 AM Eastern Standard Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Sport Endurance, Inc. (OTCQB: SENZ) (“the Company”) today announced it 
      has launched a new direct to consumer nutritional supplement product 
      called Ultra Peak T.
    

      The product is a natural testosterone booster that is designed to help 
      men over thirty overcome decreasing testosterone levels. Low 
      testosterone has been linked to decreased muscle tone, reduced energy 
      levels, and even depression.
    

      According to a 2016 report published by Grand View Research, the dietary 
      supplements market is expected to reach USD 278.02 billion by 2024 with 
      sports nutrition expected to be worth USD 37.16 billion.
    

      “I’m excited to make Ultra Peak T available directly to consumers who 
      are looking for a natural testosterone boosting supplement,” said Sport 
      Endurance CEO, David Lelong. “This product is formulated to help men 
      over thirty become more active and feel more energized.”
    

      Ultra Peak T can be purchased directly from the Company at http://www.buyultrapeakt.com.

Sport Endurance, Inc. Closes Financing




Plans to Use Proceeds to Launch Line of Men’s Health Supplements






May 13, 2016 03:30 PM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Sport Endurance, Inc. (OTCQB:SENZ) (the “Company”) announced it has 
      issued Senior Secured Convertible Notes (the "Notes") to institutional 
      lenders (the "Lenders") for an aggregate principal amount of $440,000 
      (including a 3.5% original issue discount) in accordance with the terms 
      of a Securities Purchase Agreement (the "Agreement").
    


      “This is an important step toward executing our direct to consumer 
      supplement marketing strategy, and I look forward to communicating more 
      milestones to our shareholders,” said Sport Endurance CEO, David Lelong.
    

      The Notes bear interest at 10% per annum, can be pre-paid at a premium, 
      and mature six months from issuance. At the option of the Lenders, the 
      principal and accrued interest under the Notes are convertible into 
      Shares at $0.50 per share.
    

      The Notes are secured by a first lien on all assets of the Company. The 
      Lenders did not receive any registration rights which means that all 
      Shares including those issuable upon conversion of the Notes must be 
      held for at least six months.
    

      The Lenders also received 200,000 shares of restricted Common Stock of 
      the Company (the “Shares”).
    

      The proceeds from the financing will be used for: (i) launching an 
      enhanced line of men’s health nutritional supplements; and (ii) working 
      capital purposes.
    

      About Sport Endurance, Inc.
    

      Sport Endurance, Inc. plans to market and distribute quality dietary 
      supplement products throughout the United States. We believe that 
      improved health contributes to and promotes a higher quality of life. 
      It’s our goal to improve health by providing quality and effective 
      nutritional supplements for an aging population. Our primary focus is on 
      three areas of health that most directly impact the lives of most 
      adults: Total Wellness, Energy, and Sleep.

Sport Endurance Inc (OTCMKTS:SENZ) Pops on New Product Strategy

By Jermaine Farmer -  March 15, 2017 


SHARE

Facebook
Twitter






Sport Endurance Inc (OTCMKTS:SENZ) is a penny play that has started to garner attention as the stock bounces up the chart. The proximate catalyst is the company’s recent announcement it has launched a new direct to consumer nutritional supplement product called Ultra Peak T. The initial reaction is a jump in the stock as the market expects top line numbers to improve. We think that is an obvious and reasonable reaction. That said, there may be some merit in pointing out the company’s 180-day money-back guarantee when next revenues are reported.
According to the company’s release, the product is a natural testosterone booster that is designed to help men over thirty overcome decreasing testosterone levels. Low testosterone has been linked to decreased muscle tone, reduced energy levels, and even depression. The stock has responded with a big move. But the action is thin and we don’t have a lot of technical conviction in the move given the low volume.
Sport Endurance Inc (OTCMKTS:SENZ) promulgates itself as a company that markets and distributes quality dietary supplements products throughout the United States.
According to company materials, “Sport Endurance, Inc. develops, markets, and distributes nutritional supplement products throughout the United States. We believe that improved health contributes to and promotes a higher quality of life. It’s our goal to improve health by providing quality and effective nutritional supplements. Our primary focus is on three areas of health that most directly impact the lives of many active adults – Total Wellness, Performance, and Recovery.”

According to a 2016 report published by Grand View Research, the dietary supplements market is expected to reach USD 278.02 billion by 2024 with sports nutrition expected to be worth USD 37.16 billion.
“I’m excited to make Ultra Peak T available directly to consumers who are looking for a natural testosterone boosting supplement,” said Sport Endurance CEO, David Lelong. “This product is formulated to help men over thirty become more active and feel more energized.”
The company’s sales materials cite a Harvard Men’s Health Watch: “Some studies have found that men taking testosterone have more cardiovascular problems, like heart attacks, strokes, and deaths from heart disease. Some physicians also have a lingering concern that testosterone therapy could stimulate the growth of prostate cancer cells.”
The article recommends that men at high risk should approach testosterone therapy with extra caution.
This includes men at high risk for prostate cancer; those with severe urinary symptoms from prostate enlargement; heart attack survivors; and those diagnosed with heart disease or multiple risk factors for it. That’s the impetus for the company’s new product.
The direct-to-consumer sales approach is potentially costly, and may ultimately lead to lower margins. But sales growth has begun to show up.
Hence, the stock has responded: We’ve witnessed 36% added to share values of the name over the past week of action, but this action is running counter to the larger trend in the name. However, SENZ has a history of dramatic rallies. What’s more, the company has seen an influx in interest of late, with the stock’s recent average trading volume running approaching 300% above the average volume levels in play in this stock over the longer term.
Traders should note this as important given the stock’s extremely small trading float of 9.8M shares. This type of thing is something to watch out for: a mechanically driven price squeeze can result from this type of mix of small float and ramping attention from traders.
SENZ has virtually no cash on the books, which stands against about $440K in total current liabilities. So, the balance sheet isn’t in great shape at this point. One should also note that debt has been growing over recent quarters.
Nonetheless, the OTC market is clearly focusing on the fact that SENZ is pulling in trailing 12-month revenues of $278, with massive recent top line growth on a sequential quarterly basis (growing at 379.2%). There is one big bogeyman here that we would be remiss in not pointing out: As noted above, the company’s ads offer a 180-day money-back guarantee. The jump in sales is very recent, meaning that the company is likely reporting a number that could be clawed back if the product doesn’t provide results. We will update the story again soon as developments transpire.

Sport Endurance, Inc. Launches Direct to Consumer Men’s Health Supplement Product
Mar 01, 2017
OTC Disclosure & News Service

                            
                                - 

      Sport Endurance, Inc. (OTCQB: SENZ) (“the Company”) today announced it 
      has launched a new direct to consumer nutritional supplement product 
      called Ultra Peak T.
    

      The product is a natural testosterone booster that is designed to help 
      men over thirty overcome decreasing testosterone levels. Low 
      testosterone has been linked to decreased muscle tone, reduced energy 
      levels, and even depression.
    

      According to a 2016 report published by Grand View Research, the dietary 
      supplements market is expected to reach USD 278.02 billion by 2024 with 
      sports nutrition expected to be worth USD 37.16 billion.
    

      “I’m excited to make Ultra Peak T available directly to consumers who 
      are looking for a natural testosterone boosting supplement,” said Sport 
      Endurance CEO, David Lelong. “This product is formulated to help men 
      over thirty become more active and feel more energized.”
    

      Ultra Peak T can be purchased directly from the Company at http://www.buyultrapeakt.com.
