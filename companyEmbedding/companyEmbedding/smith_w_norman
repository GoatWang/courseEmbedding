If you experience any of the above symptoms, call your eye doctor or go to the emergency room immediately. Doctors typically perform two types of surgery to repair the retinal detachment. Laser surgery is used to create tiny burn areas around the detached area to help fuse it back into place, while cryopexy is a technique that uses freezing cold temperatures to seal the edges of the retina.NeurologistsMultiple SclerosisOptic nerve inflammation may also be responsible for blurred vision. Your optic nerve carries impulses from the retina, a layer of cells that line the back of the eye, to the brain, where they are interpreted as images. Optic nerve inflammation is often one of the earliest signs of multiple sclerosis. It can also occur if you have syphilis, Lyme disease, shingles, cat scratch fever, herpes, mumps or measles.RadiologistChemotherapyTake medications that increase your sensitivity to UV and blue light, including tranquilizers, birth control pills, diabetes and chemotherapy drugs, antihistamines, retinoids, steroids, anti-inflammatories and antibiotics.OphthalmologistsEye ExamDuring an eye exam, the doctors will ask you questions about any symptoms or issues you are experiencing, medications your are currently taking, any blurry vision, your work environment, and your overall health. Family history and previous eye or vision conditions will also be discussed during this part of the examination. The doctors will consider this information when determining any treatments or recommendations.Cataract SurgeryCataracts occur when the lens at the center of your eye becomes cloudy. If your cataract becomes large enough and interferes with your vision, your optometrist will probably recommend surgery to remove it. During cataract surgery, the cloudy lens is replaced with an artificial lens.GlaucomaGlaucoma. Increased pressure inside the eye can cause irreversible damage to the optic nerve that connects the eye to the brain. Glaucoma often has no symptoms until it has already caused permanent vision damage. If your child does develop symptoms, they may include enlarged eyes, sensitivity to light, hazy corneas and vision loss.OphthalmologyMacular DegenerationThe complex contains eight B vitamins that may reduce your risk of macular degeneration and help you avoid changes in the blood vessels in your retina.Laser Eye SurgeryAt Classic Vision Family Eye Care, we provide comprehensive care to meet the vision needs of our patients. Our doctors offer pre- and post-operative care for patients undergoing LASIK eye surgery or other eye surgical procedures. Our goal is to help you attain the clearest vision possible using advanced technologies.CataractsHow does UV affect unprotected eyes? UV rays can cause proteins inside the lens to become opaque or cloudy, a condition known as cataracts. Cataracts can make interfere with night vision, reduce your ability to see colors, and make reading difficult; they cannot be reversed, only removed. UV exposure can also cause retinal damage, changes in the eye tissues, and a temporary but irritating "sunburn" of the cornea called photokeratitis.DermatologistsSkin CancerThe more time you spend in the sun without protection, the greater the chance that you will develop skin cancer around your eyes. Since many people do not put sunscreen on their eyelids, this area is particularly susceptible to cancer.PsoriasisEndocrinologistDiabetes CareThyroidDiabetic RetinopathyHave diabetic retinopathy. If you have this condition, fluid from leaking blood vessels can accumulate under the retina.Physical TherapistsPhysical TherapyMany vision problems do not require surgery for correction. In these situations, vision therapy is typically an option. Vision therapy is a form of physical therapy used on the eyes and brain. It is designed to resolve vision problems that can contribute to learning disabilities. This therapy can also be used an effective treatment for problems like lazy eye, crossed eyes, or double vision.Occupational TherapyIt does work. Studies on vision therapy show it is effective in improving the lives of patients. Data shows that this therapy can improve visual function enough to keep it from interfering with a patient's ability to absorb information and learn. In its own sphere, this therapy is as effective as physical therapy or occupational therapy.PsychiatristsDepressionAnxietySend to PhoneJacob Smith OD3700 W Robinson St, Norman, OK 73072(405) 447-4680Send this business listing as a text message to a mobile phone.I agree to the Terms and ConditionsCancelSendYour text message was sent.To opt out at anytime, send the word STOP to YP411.To get a help message, send the word HELP to YP411.There was an error sending your text.Please try again.E-MailJacob Smith OD3700 W Robinson St, Norman, OK 73072(405) 447-4680Send this business details to yourself or up to 5 friends.Up to 5 email addresses, separate addresses with a commaSend Yourself a CopyCancelSend

Early life[edit]
Smith was born in Edmonton, Middlesex, and served as an RAF glider pilot during World War II. After an unsuccessful career as a jazz musician, Smith joined EMI as an apprentice sound engineer in 1959.
Career as producer and engineer[edit]
He was the engineer on all of the EMI studio recordings by the Beatles until 1965,[1] when EMI promoted him from engineer to producer. The last Beatles album he recorded was Rubber Soul,[2] and Smith engineered the sound for almost 100 Beatles songs in total.[3]
John Lennon first bestowed upon Smith the nickname of "Normal", and it was quickly picked up by the other Beatles. Lennon did so as a humorous reference to Smith's very unhurried and unflappable nature.[citation needed]
While working with The Beatles on 17 June 1965, he was offered £15,000 by the band's music publishing company, Dick James Music, to buy outright a song he had written.[4]
In early 1967, he began working with a new group, Pink Floyd,[1] producing their first, second, and fourth studio albums The Piper at the Gates of Dawn, A Saucerful of Secrets, and Ummagumma.[5] During the sessions for the song "Remember a Day", drummer Nick Mason became agitated that he could not come up with the right drum part for the song. Smith, however, knew what he wanted with the drums, so he played the part himself.[6]
In 1968, Smith produced one of the first rock concept albums, the Pretty Things' S.F. Sorrow.[1]
He produced early recordings by Barclay James Harvest, including their album Once Again, and many years later was name-checked in John Lees' song "John Lennon's Guitar".[citation needed]
Recording career as "Hurricane Smith"[edit]
In 1971, Smith, using a recording artist pseudonym of Hurricane Smith, had a UK No. 2 hit with "Don't Let It Die".[7] This recording was a demo of a song that he had written with the hope that John Lennon would record it. When he played it for fellow record producer Mickie Most, Most was impressed enough to tell him to release it as it was.[citation needed] In 1972, he enjoyed a transatlantic hit with "Oh, Babe, What Would You Say?", which became a US No. 1 Cash Box and a Billboard Pop No. 3 hit.[8] It reached No. 4 in the UK Singles Chart.[7] Also included on Smith's self-titled debut album was a third hit single, a cover version of Gilbert O'Sullivan's "Who Was It?" (UK #23).[7]
Some recordings followed, such as "My Mother Was Her Name" (1972), "Beautiful Day, Beautiful Night" (1973) and "To Make You My Baby" (1974). However, his subsequent attempts at producing successful recordings proved elusive. Capitalising on his solo recording efforts, Smith undertook two tours of the then thriving north of England cabaret circuit, complete with band and dancers. Smith enlisted the help of session drummer Peter Boita who "fixed" a band for Smith which was mostly made up of the temporarily disbanded "Bob Miller and the Millermen" band. This line-up went on to record the last album Smith made for EMI Records, Razzmahtazz Shall Inherit The Earth, which was released in 1973.
Smith also recorded an instrumental track, entitled "Theme From an Unmade Silent Movie", which the West Midlands based radio presenter, Tony Butler, adopted as his theme music, playing it frequently on his sports show in an attempt, often successful, to encourage the region's local football teams to score a goal. Fans of Aston Villa F.C. also consider this tune as their unofficial club theme, and it can often be heard played at Villa Park during the pre-match and half-time intervals. It was performed by the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra on 6 June 2008.[9]
In 2004, Smith released a new CD, From Me To You (SFMCD030), featuring new recordings of his biggest self-penned hits, "Don't Let It Die" and "Oh, Babe, What Would You Say?". Included in the liner notes were messages from Sir Paul McCartney and members of Pink Floyd.
In 2011, a snippet of Smith's "Don't Let It Die" was included in the soundtrack of Tomas Alfredson's 2011 film adaptation of John le Carré's Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy.
Memoir[edit]
Smith wrote a memoir, entitled John Lennon Called Me Normal. It debuted on 16 March 2007 as a limited edition at The Fest For Beatles Fans in Secaucus, New Jersey. There, Smith appeared and sang "Oh, Babe". The book contains never-before published pictures, newly revealed historical facts about the Beatles and Pink Floyd at Abbey Road Studios, as well as details of Smith's life as an RAF glider pilot.
Death[edit]
Smith died aged 85, in March 2008 in East Sussex, England.[1]

Early life[edit]
Smith was born in Edmonton, Middlesex, and served as an RAF glider pilot during World War II. After an unsuccessful career as a jazz musician, Smith joined EMI as an apprentice sound engineer in 1959.
Career as producer and engineer[edit]
He was the engineer on all of the EMI studio recordings by the Beatles until 1965,[1] when EMI promoted him from engineer to producer. The last Beatles album he recorded was Rubber Soul,[2] and Smith engineered the sound for almost 100 Beatles songs in total.[3]
John Lennon first bestowed upon Smith the nickname of "Normal", and it was quickly picked up by the other Beatles. Lennon did so as a humorous reference to Smith's very unhurried and unflappable nature.[citation needed]
While working with The Beatles on 17 June 1965, he was offered £15,000 by the band's music publishing company, Dick James Music, to buy outright a song he had written.[4]
In early 1967, he began working with a new group, Pink Floyd,[1] producing their first, second, and fourth studio albums The Piper at the Gates of Dawn, A Saucerful of Secrets, and Ummagumma.[5] During the sessions for the song "Remember a Day", drummer Nick Mason became agitated that he could not come up with the right drum part for the song. Smith, however, knew what he wanted with the drums, so he played the part himself.[6]
In 1968, Smith produced one of the first rock concept albums, the Pretty Things' S.F. Sorrow.[1]
He produced early recordings by Barclay James Harvest, including their album Once Again, and many years later was name-checked in John Lees' song "John Lennon's Guitar".[citation needed]
Recording career as "Hurricane Smith"[edit]
In 1971, Smith, using a recording artist pseudonym of Hurricane Smith, had a UK No. 2 hit with "Don't Let It Die".[7] This recording was a demo of a song that he had written with the hope that John Lennon would record it. When he played it for fellow record producer Mickie Most, Most was impressed enough to tell him to release it as it was.[citation needed] In 1972, he enjoyed a transatlantic hit with "Oh, Babe, What Would You Say?", which became a US No. 1 Cash Box and a Billboard Pop No. 3 hit.[8] It reached No. 4 in the UK Singles Chart.[7] Also included on Smith's self-titled debut album was a third hit single, a cover version of Gilbert O'Sullivan's "Who Was It?" (UK #23).[7]
Some recordings followed, such as "My Mother Was Her Name" (1972), "Beautiful Day, Beautiful Night" (1973) and "To Make You My Baby" (1974). However, his subsequent attempts at producing successful recordings proved elusive. Capitalising on his solo recording efforts, Smith undertook two tours of the then thriving north of England cabaret circuit, complete with band and dancers. Smith enlisted the help of session drummer Peter Boita who "fixed" a band for Smith which was mostly made up of the temporarily disbanded "Bob Miller and the Millermen" band. This line-up went on to record the last album Smith made for EMI Records, Razzmahtazz Shall Inherit The Earth, which was released in 1973.
Smith also recorded an instrumental track, entitled "Theme From an Unmade Silent Movie", which the West Midlands based radio presenter, Tony Butler, adopted as his theme music, playing it frequently on his sports show in an attempt, often successful, to encourage the region's local football teams to score a goal. Fans of Aston Villa F.C. also consider this tune as their unofficial club theme, and it can often be heard played at Villa Park during the pre-match and half-time intervals. It was performed by the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra on 6 June 2008.[9]
In 2004, Smith released a new CD, From Me To You (SFMCD030), featuring new recordings of his biggest self-penned hits, "Don't Let It Die" and "Oh, Babe, What Would You Say?". Included in the liner notes were messages from Sir Paul McCartney and members of Pink Floyd.
In 2011, a snippet of Smith's "Don't Let It Die" was included in the soundtrack of Tomas Alfredson's 2011 film adaptation of John le Carré's Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy.
Memoir[edit]
Smith wrote a memoir, entitled John Lennon Called Me Normal. It debuted on 16 March 2007 as a limited edition at The Fest For Beatles Fans in Secaucus, New Jersey. There, Smith appeared and sang "Oh, Babe". The book contains never-before published pictures, newly revealed historical facts about the Beatles and Pink Floyd at Abbey Road Studios, as well as details of Smith's life as an RAF glider pilot.

Smith died aged 85, in March 2008 in East Sussex, England.[1]

In early 1967, he began working with a new group, Pink Floyd,[1] producing their first, second, and fourth studio albums The Piper at the Gates of Dawn, A Saucerful of Secrets, and Ummagumma.[5] During the sessions for the song "Remember a Day", drummer Nick Mason became agitated that he could not come up with the right drum part for the song. Smith, however, knew what he wanted with the drums, so he played the part himself.[6]
In 1968, Smith produced one of the first rock concept albums, the Pretty Things' S.F. Sorrow.[1]
He produced early recordings by Barclay James Harvest, including their album Once Again, and many years later was name-checked in John Lees' song "John Lennon's Guitar".[citation needed]
Recording career as "Hurricane Smith"[edit]
In 1971, Smith, using a recording artist pseudonym of Hurricane Smith, had a UK No. 2 hit with "Don't Let It Die".[7] This recording was a demo of a song that he had written with the hope that John Lennon would record it. When he played it for fellow record producer Mickie Most, Most was impressed enough to tell him to release it as it was.[citation needed] In 1972, he enjoyed a transatlantic hit with "Oh, Babe, What Would You Say?", which became a US No. 1 Cash Box and a Billboard Pop No. 3 hit.[8] It reached No. 4 in the UK Singles Chart.[7] Also included on Smith's self-titled debut album was a third hit single, a cover version of Gilbert O'Sullivan's "Who Was It?" (UK #23).[7]
Some recordings followed, such as "My Mother Was Her Name" (1972), "Beautiful Day, Beautiful Night" (1973) and "To Make You My Baby" (1974). However, his subsequent attempts at producing successful recordings proved elusive. Capitalising on his solo recording efforts, Smith undertook two tours of the then thriving north of England cabaret circuit, complete with band and dancers. Smith enlisted the help of session drummer Peter Boita who "fixed" a band for Smith which was mostly made up of the temporarily disbanded "Bob Miller and the Millermen" band. This line-up went on to record the last album Smith made for EMI Records, Razzmahtazz Shall Inherit The Earth, which was released in 1973.
Smith also recorded an instrumental track, entitled "Theme From an Unmade Silent Movie", which the West Midlands based radio presenter, Tony Butler, adopted as his theme music, playing it frequently on his sports show in an attempt, often successful, to encourage the region's local football teams to score a goal. Fans of Aston Villa F.C. also consider this tune as their unofficial club theme, and it can often be heard played at Villa Park during the pre-match and half-time intervals. It was performed by the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra on 6 June 2008.[9]
In 2004, Smith released a new CD, From Me To You (SFMCD030), featuring new recordings of his biggest self-penned hits, "Don't Let It Die" and "Oh, Babe, What Would You Say?". Included in the liner notes were messages from Sir Paul McCartney and members of Pink Floyd.
In 2011, a snippet of Smith's "Don't Let It Die" was included in the soundtrack of Tomas Alfredson's 2011 film adaptation of John le Carré's Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy.
Memoir[edit]
Smith wrote a memoir, entitled John Lennon Called Me Normal. It debuted on 16 March 2007 as a limited edition at The Fest For Beatles Fans in Secaucus, New Jersey. There, Smith appeared and sang "Oh, Babe". The book contains never-before published pictures, newly revealed historical facts about the Beatles and Pink Floyd at Abbey Road Studios, as well as details of Smith's life as an RAF glider pilot.
Death[edit]
Smith died aged 85, in March 2008 in East Sussex, England.[1]

Early life[edit]
Smith was born in Edmonton, Middlesex, and served as an RAF glider pilot during World War II. After an unsuccessful career as a jazz musician, Smith joined EMI as an apprentice sound engineer in 1959.
Career as producer and engineer[edit]
He was the engineer on all of the EMI studio recordings by the Beatles until 1965,[1] when EMI promoted him from engineer to producer. The last Beatles album he recorded was Rubber Soul,[2] and Smith engineered the sound for almost 100 Beatles songs in total.[3]
John Lennon first bestowed upon Smith the nickname of "Normal", and it was quickly picked up by the other Beatles. Lennon did so as a humorous reference to Smith's very unhurried and unflappable nature.[citation needed]
While working with The Beatles on 17 June 1965, he was offered £15,000 by the band's music publishing company, Dick James Music, to buy outright a song he had written.[4]
In early 1967, he began working with a new group, Pink Floyd,[1] producing their first, second, and fourth studio albums The Piper at the Gates of Dawn, A Saucerful of Secrets, and Ummagumma.[5] During the sessions for the song "Remember a Day", drummer Nick Mason became agitated that he could not come up with the right drum part for the song. Smith, however, knew what he wanted with the drums, so he played the part himself.[6]
In 1968, Smith produced one of the first rock concept albums, the Pretty Things' S.F. Sorrow.[1]
He produced early recordings by Barclay James Harvest, including their album Once Again, and many years later was name-checked in John Lees' song "John Lennon's Guitar".[citation needed]
Recording career as "Hurricane Smith"[edit]
