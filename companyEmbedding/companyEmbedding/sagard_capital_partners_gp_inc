NEW YORK, Oct. 24, 2016 /CNW/ - Sagard Capital Partners, L.P. and certain of its affiliates (collectively, "Sagard Capital") announce that Sagard Capital and Fairfax Financial Holdings Limited ("Fairfax") have entered into a confidentiality agreement relating to Performance Sports Group Ltd. (the "Issuer") and its confidential information and any other confidential information provided by or on behalf of Sagard Capital to Fairfax.   
Sagard Capital and the Issuer, and their respective advisors, have discussed the possibility of Sagard Capital, and potentially one or more co-investors partnering with Sagard Capital, proposing potential plans or proposals that may involve one or more of the following related to the Issuer (each, a "Potential Transaction"): restructurings; possible issuances by the Issuer of additional and/or refinancing indebtedness; the acquisition of indebtedness of the Issuer or its subsidiaries; and/or other strategic alternatives.  Any such plans or proposals may be directed to or discussed with the Issuer, its advisors, its securityholders and/or its lenders, with advisors to Sagard Capital and/or with potential sources of financing and co-investors for any of the foregoing, among others.  Sagard Capital and their advisors have also conducted, and continue to conduct, a due diligence review of the Issuer and its subsidiaries.  Sagard Capital presently expects to continue discussions with additional potential sources of financing and/or co-investors for any Potential Transaction, and with the Issuer related to a possible Potential Transaction.
Sagard Capital, Fairfax and their respective representatives have discussed the possibility of Sagard Capital and Fairfax, and/or one or more entities to be formed at their direction, acting together with respect to potential plans or proposals related to a Potential Transaction.  Fairfax and/or its representatives have participated with Sagard Capital and/or their representatives in discussions with the Issuer regarding such matters.  Sagard Capital and Fairfax have not yet entered into any agreements, term sheets, or other arrangements among themselves with respect to any joint activity. However, based on discussions to date, Sagard Capital has concluded that it is likely that, if they proceed with a plan or proposal to effect any Potential Transaction, they will proceed with Fairfax and/or one of its affiliates.  
Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is uncertain whether Sagard Capital and Fairfax, and/or an entity formed thereby, on the one hand, and the Issuer, on the other hand, will agree to any definitive agreement with respect to any Potential Transaction, or that any Potential Transaction will occur.  Further, there can be no assurance that Sagard Capital will submit a plan or proposal with respect to any of the foregoing, that Sagard Capital or any other person (including the Issuer) will agree to any definitive agreement with respect to any of the foregoing, or that any of the foregoing will occur.  Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to constitute an offer to sell or purchase or the solicitation of an offer to sell or purchase any securities, nor shall there be any purchase or sale of any securities in any province, country, state or jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such province, country, state or jurisdiction.
Sagard Capital further discloses that it continues to beneficially own and control an aggregate of 7,721,599 common shares of the Issuer ("Shares"), representing approximately 16.9% of the issued and outstanding Shares. Fairfax has informed Sagard Capital that Fairfax does not have ownership or control over any Shares as of the date hereof. 
Sagard Capital, a subsidiary of Power Corporation of Canada, is relying on Part 5 of National Instrument 62-103 in respect of aggregation relief relating to any securities that may be held by Great-West Lifeco Inc. and its subsidiaries, IGM Financial Inc. and its subsidiaries, and any investment fund managed by entities within the Power Corporation of Canada group of companies.

PRESS RELEASE
Sagard Capital Announces Developments Concerning Holdings in Performance Sports Group Ltd.
NEW YORK, Oct. 27, 2016 /CNW/ – Sagard Capital Partners, L.P. and certain of its affiliates (collectively, “Sagard Capital”) announce that Sagard Capital and Brookfield Capital Partners Ltd. (“Brookfield”) have entered into a confidentiality agreement relating to the Issuer and its confidential information, as required by Sagard’s existing confidentiality agreement with Performance Sports Group Ltd. (the “Issuer”), and any other confidential information provided by or on behalf of Sagard Capital to Brookfield. 





As previously announced, Sagard Capital and the Issuer, and their respective advisors, have discussed the possibility of Sagard Capital, and potentially one or more co-investors (including Fairfax Financial Holdings Limited (“Fairfax”) as described below) partnering with Sagard Capital, proposing potential plans or proposals that may involve one or more of the following related to the Issuer (each, a “Potential Transaction”): restructurings; possible issuances by the Issuer of additional and/or refinancing indebtedness; the acquisition of indebtedness of the Issuer or its subsidiaries; and/or other strategic alternatives. Any such plans or proposals may be directed to or discussed with the Issuer, its advisors, its securityholders and/or its lenders, with advisors to Sagard Capital and/or with potential sources of financing and co-investors for any of the foregoing, among others. Sagard Capital and their advisors have also conducted, and continue to conduct, a due diligence review of the Issuer and its subsidiaries. Sagard Capital presently expects to continue discussions with additional potential sources of financing and/or co-investors for any Potential Transaction, and with the Issuer related to a possible Potential Transaction.
Sagard Capital and Brookfield and their respective representatives may discuss the possibility of Sagard Capital and Brookfield, and/or one or more entities to be formed at the direction of Sagard Capital, acting together with respect to potential plans or proposals related to a Potential Transaction. Sagard Capital and Brookfield have not yet entered into any agreements, term sheets, or other arrangements among themselves with respect to any joint activity and it is presently uncertain whether Sagard and Brookfield, and/or an entity formed thereby, on the one hand, and the Issuer, on the other hand, will agree to any definitive agreement with respect to any Potential Transaction, or that any Potential Transaction will occur. 





As previously announced, Sagard has also entered into a confidentiality agreement with Fairfax relating to the Issuer and its confidential information, as required by Sagard’s existing confidentiality agreement with the Issuer, and any other confidential information provided by or on behalf of Sagard to Fairfax. Sagard Capital, Fairfax and their respective representatives have discussed the possibility of Sagard Capital and Fairfax, and/or one or more entities to be formed at their direction, acting together with respect to potential plans or proposals related to a Potential Transaction. Fairfax and/or its representatives have participated with Sagard Capital and/or their representatives in discussions with the Issuer regarding such matters.
Sagard Capital and Fairfax have not yet entered into any agreements, term sheets, or other arrangements among themselves with respect to any joint activity. However, based on discussions to date, Sagard Capital has concluded that it is likely that, if they proceed with a plan or proposal to effect any Potential Transaction, they will proceed with Fairfax and/or one of its affiliates. It is possible that, depending on discussions with Brookfield, Brookfield may be an additional participant in such a plan or proposal submitted by Sagard Capital (and Fairfax, if applicable).
There can be no assurance that Sagard Capital will submit a plan or proposal with respect to any of the foregoing, that Sagard Capital or any other person (including the Issuer, Fairfax, Brookfield and/or an entity formed thereby) will agree to any definitive agreement with respect to any of the foregoing, or that any of the foregoing (including a Potential Transaction) will occur. Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to constitute an offer to sell or purchase or the solicitation of an offer to sell or purchase any securities, nor shall there be any purchase or sale of any securities in any province, country, state or jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such province, country, state or jurisdiction. 





Sagard Capital further discloses that it continues to beneficially own and control an aggregate of 7,721,599 common shares of the Issuer (“Shares”), representing approximately 16.9% of the issued and outstanding Shares. Fairfax has informed Sagard Capital that Fairfax does not have ownership or control over any Shares as of the date hereof. Brookfield has informed Sagard Capital that 251091708 Delaware LP, a Delaware limited partnership indirectly controlled by Brookfield, has ownership and control over 6,026,860 Shares of the Issuer, representing approximately 13.23% of the issued and outstanding Shares.
Sagard Capital, a subsidiary of Power Corporation of Canada, is relying on Part 5 of National Instrument 62-103 in respect of aggregation relief relating to any securities that may be held by Great-West Lifeco Inc. and its subsidiaries, IGM Financial Inc. and its subsidiaries, and any investment fund managed by entities within the Power Corporation of Canada group of companies.
The Issuer’s head office is located at 100 Domain Drive, Exeter, New Hampshire, U.S.A., 03833.
