Patent number:  8392220
                                            

Abstract:  A system and method of facilitating a patient's care transitions both into and upon subsequent discharge from an in-patient medical facility utilizes three points of health care provider intervention. The system and method utilizes a cloud-based medication management system applying rules to determine whether the patient's medications, clinical lab results, genomic information, or other relevant considerations would, in combination, amount to an adverse health outcome. If an adverse health outcome is predicted based on an application of the pre-programmed rules, health care intervention is sought.

MEDICATION MANAGEMENT SYSTEM AND METHOD



Publication number:  20120116810
                                            

Abstract:  A system and method of facilitating a patient's care transitions both into and upon subsequent discharge from an in-patient medical facility utilizes three points of health care provider intervention. The system and method utilizes a cloud-based medication management system applying rules to determine whether the patient's medications, clinical lab results, genomic information, or other relevant considerations would, in combination, amount to an adverse health outcome. If an adverse health outcome is predicted based on an application of the pre-programmed rules, health care intervention is sought.
