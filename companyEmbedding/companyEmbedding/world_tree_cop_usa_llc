Empress Tree - World Tree






















































































Select Page


  
 



 



 








 




The World Tree Carbon Offset Program is made possible by the unique qualities of the Empress Tree. The World’s fastest growing hardwood, it reaches maturity in less than 10 years, eating up tonnes of carbon in the process.

 
 
 
 






The Empress Splendor Tree
The key to our carbon offset program is the Empress Splendor tree. This is the fastest growing hardwood tree in the world (Guinness Book of World Records) reaching maturity in just 10 years.
The Empress is a member of the Paulownia family, a sacred tree of the orient, long revered for its fast growth and quality wood. In Japan it is the emblem of the prime minister.
The Paulownia is native to North America but is not as well known here. The Empress Splendor is a non-invasive, hybrid species, that can grow in most the United States and Canada where it’s primary use is lumber.
Empress Splendor trees are not genetically modified, but are bred using conventional methods used by farmers for thousands of years. They do not respond well to chemical products, preferring instead organic farming methods and the use of natural fertilizers such as chicken manure.
The Empress tree is ‘wet’ wood which makes it naturally fire and insect resistant.

 
 
 
 




Empress Splendor trees absorb more carbon dioxide than any other tree. Planting 22 trees will offset the carbon emissions of an average north american for 50 years.

 
 
 
 






Record breaking growth
The Empress Splendor is the fastest growing hardwood tree in the world, growing up to 20 feet in the first year and reaching maturity in just 7-10 years.
This tree is just four years old.


 
 




Part of the ecosystem
The flowers of the Empress tree are rich in nectar, attracting honey bees.
The large, widely spaced leaves provide the plants below both light and shelter and the tree revitalizes the soil for other plants.


 
 




Tree regrows 7 times
When you cut down an Empress Splendor tree, it immediately regrows from the root.
An Empress tree will regenerate up to 7 times, continuing to absorb carbon for 50 years.


 
 
 
 




From Planting to Harvest in 10 Years
World Tree only works with qualified farmers who already have experience successfully growing Empress Trees. Empress trees grow best  in places with summer temperatures of 70°F (21°C) and above for at least 5-6 months a year and an altitude of less than 2,200 feet.
The trees typically grow 10-20 feet in the first year and reach maturity in 10 years. The trees are naturally resistant to fire and insects so are extremely hardy. None the less, World Tree insures all the trees so that your investment is protected.
After 10 years World Tree harvests the trees and sells the lumber. One of the amazing properties of the tree is that it regrows from the root very quickly after harvesting and will regrow itself up to 7 times after being cut down.

 
 



 
 
 



 




A Beautiful, Useful Hardwood
The Empress Splendor produces a light, straight-grained lumber that is silky to the touch. It has an exceptional strength to weight ratio with lumber that is 30% stronger than pine.
Empress wood is very light, strong and water resistant when dry. This combination of strength, light-weight and water resistance makes it the ideal wood for building boats and surfboards. Paulownia wood is becoming every more popular with surfers looking for an environmentally friendly alternative to fibre-glass boards.
Empress wood is also used for the production of musical instruments, furniture, windows, doors and crown moulding. It can be peeled for veneer in 1/32 inch thickness and the Chinese use the veneer as paper.

 
 



 
 
 



 




Frequently Asked Questions

 

Where do the trees grow?

Empress trees grow in western Canada and the United states. They grow best in places with summer temperatures of 70°F (21°C) and above for at least 5-6 months a year and an altitude of less than 2,200 feet.
The warmer the temperatures, the faster the growth. World Tree farmers can be found in Florida, Arizona, Georgia, Ohio, British Columbia and Costa Rica.
 
 
Is this tree invasive?

The short answer is: No, the Empress Splendor tree is not invasive.
The Empress Splendor tree belongs to the genus Paulownia. There are many different species of Paulownia and there is only one that is classified as invasive, the Paulownia tomentosa (http://www.invasivespeciesinfo.gov/plants/printree.shtml). We do not use this variety, choosing instead non-invasive species such as the Paulownia fortuneii.
The Rainforest Alliance has chosen Paulownia as an an ecologically sound tree for the purposes of eforestation and carbon sequestration (http://www.rainforest-alliance.org/business/climate/validation-verification/projects/paulownia). The Rainforest alliance is internationally recognized as a certification program for sustainable forestry and best practices for tree planting and agroforestry.
 
 
Are the trees genetically modified? 

No, our trees are not genetically modified (GMO).
GMO refers to an organism whose genetic material has been altered using genetic engineering techniques. These sometimes contain genes from totally unrelated species, such as salmon genes in tomatoes developed to have frost resistance and this raises concerns that as such an organism could not possibly develop naturally we don’t know the long term effects.
Our Paulownia trees are bred using conventional methods as used by farmers for thousands of years, i.e. we cross pollinate different lines of the same genus (Paulownia) and then grow the seedlings out, selecting the best and then propagate only from those best trees to develop new varieties.
We do not splice in genes from outside the Paulownia genus. There is no unrelated genetic material whether plant or animal included in the genome of our trees.
 
 
Are the trees organically grown?

Our program attracts many organic farmers because Empress Splendor trees don’t respond well to chemical products and prefer natural fertilizers and pest control. For example, they love chicken manure!!
 
 
Why haven't I heard of this tree before?

The Empress tree is indigenous to North America, however it almost died out during the ice ages.
The tree does not grow well from seed, it is best grown from the roots and it’s only recently that North Americans have taken an interest in growing the tree.

Groupon Guide San Jose Guide San Jose is the third largest city in California and provides plenty of activities for people to enjoy. This San Jose Guide will provide several ways for residents to enjoy a quiet afternoon or fun with the family, whether they are looking for a bit of history or looking for a thrill.Downtown San Jose is home to the San Jose Museum of Art which has an extensive collection of modern art, mainly focusing on the heritage of the West Coast, but also has national and international works of art. General admission costs around $8, making it a good choice for an inexpensive way to enjoy an afternoon. While in the neighborhood, stop by the Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Library, originally the largest library west of the Mississippi. Anyone is able to enjoy the material inside without showing identification, and admission is always free.Located on Winchester Boulevard, the Winchester Mystery House was home to Sarah Winchester, wife of the famous maker of Winchester guns. Sarah was afraid of retaliation from ghosts of those who were killed by Winchester guns, because a psychic told her she had to keep building on to her house to keep the spirits away. The home is filled with staircases and doors that lead to nowhere and has been featured in many ghost hunter shows.The San Jose Municipal Rose Garden is home to more than 4,000 rose bushes of 189 different varieties and is a great choice for those who appreciate the beauty and aroma of roses. On Park Avenue, the Rosicrucian Egyptian and Planetarium provides a unique look into the history of Egypt. With a replica of an Egyptian tomb and authentic collection of artifacts and mummies, this museum is a must-see.Families and individuals will enjoy the amusement parks located in San Jose. Raging Waters is a local favorite to cool off from the summer heat and provides water rides and slides. California's Great America has many activities for families, including roller coasters, water parks, and live shows.San Jose provides many fun and budget-friendly activities for everyone to enjoy all year long.

A healthy planet and a healthy profit

 
 
 
 




The World Tree carbon offset program is an investment opportunity for the kind of people who want their money to work for them and do good in the process.

 
 
 
 




The World Tree 2016 Carbon Offset Program
How can you have a positive impact on the environment without sacrificing your quality of life?
At World Tree we provide the answer with our Carbon Offset Program.
Many people are looking for green alternatives to conventional investment approaches.
The World Tree 2016 Carbon Offset Program is an investment opportunity for people who want to use their money to create both positive change in the world and a return on investment.
The World Tree COP 2016 LP (the “Partnership”) is an exempt market investment.
The Carbon Offset Program provides the following benefits:

Offset your carbon footprint for life
Protect our precious legacy of old growth forests
Investment in a long-term program that has the potential to build investor wealth

The partnership will plant up to 330,000 Empress Splendor trees on behalf of its investors which will offset over 10 million tons of carbon.

 
 


Download Brochure

 
 
 
 



 




How it works
World Tree 2016 Carbon Off Set Program is a Limited Partnership whose purpose is:

To participate in a collective effort to reduce the carbon footprint of the investors.
To produce profit from the harvesting of Empress Splendor trees which will be distributed to the investors in 2026.

As an investor, you will subscribe for Class A limited partnership units in the Partnership.
The Partnership will acquire trees on behalf of the Partnership with a portion of the funds raised from the sale of units. These trees are planted by farmers who have been selected for their experience in growing Empress Splendor trees.
The manager, World Tree Technologies Inc, oversees the whole process with a view to producing the highest quality lumber possible.
Once the trees reach maturity (in 10 years), they are sold for lumber and the profits are shared 50:50 with the farmer and the Partnership.

 
 



 
 
 






Carbon Investors
As an investor, you will subscribe for Class A limited partnership units in the Partnership.
550 Empress Splendor trees are acquired for every Class A Unit. You receive both certification for your carbon offsets and a subscription agreement for your investment.



 
 




World Tree
World Tree has over 14 years experience growing Empress Splendor trees. We work hand in hand with the farmers to ensure the best opportunity for a profitable experience for everyone.
World Tree’s agronomists inspect the farms every year to take care of your investment.



 
 




Farmers
The farmers plant and care for the trees. Participating farmers are carefully chosen for their experience in growing Empress Splendor trees.
The trees are only planted in appropriate growing areas in Canada, the United States and select parts of Central America.



 
 
 
 



 




Return on Investment
Once the distributions of profit from the harvest and sale of the lumber have been made between the farmers and the Partnership, the Partnership’s share of the profits will be distributed 50% to investors and 50% to management.
One unit in the Partnership costs $6,500 USD. The Partnership will plant and grow 5 acres of Empress Splendor trees for every Unit sold.
Investors should note the acquisition of a unit does not provide an investor with an ownership interest in any of the trees planted by the Partnership.
A unit entitles an investor to distributions of profit, if any, resulting from the harvest and sale of lumber from the trees planted by the Partnership on the terms described herein.
Proceeds from the sale of each Unit will be used by the Partnership to carry on the Partnership’s business which includes payment to the Manager of the sum of $1000 USD as a Management Fee for every Unit sold by the Partnership.
Investor returns are dependent upon the amount of lumber produced and how much it sells for.
A well managed 5-acre plot yields up to 145,000 board feet of lumber. Currently, Empress Splendor lumber sells for between $3 and $14 or higher, depending on the quality and finish of the wood.
We can’t predict the future or what will happen to the price of lumber in years to come.

Frequently Asked Questions


 

Who plants the trees and where do they grow?

The trees are planted by World Tree certified farmers. These are farmers who already have experience successfully growing Empress Trees.
Empress trees grow best in places with summer temperatures of 70°F (21°C) and above for at least 5-6 months a year and an altitude of less than 2,200 feet. Our farmers are located in Canada, the United States and select regions of Central America.

 
 
What are the biggest risks in participating in this program?

The biggest risk is that something happens to the trees due to severe weather or other natural events. The trees are most vulnerable when they are young.. If anything happens to the trees in the first two years World Tree replaces them.
Your trees are not planted in a single location. We pool your trees with all the other trees that have been purchased this year and plant them across a number of farms. This means that if one farm does get hit by a problem it only has a small impact on each investor.
Remember that all investments carry risks. We can’t predict the future and we don’t know for sure the value of the lumber in 10 years time. Risk factors are described in the Offering Memorandum and individuals are advised to read this document in full before investing.

 
 
How do I know I will get a good return on investment?

There are no guarantees when you make any kind of investment.
Investor returns are dependent upon the amount of lumber produced and how much it sells for.
A well managed 5-acre plot yields up to 145,000 board feet of lumber. Currently Empress Splendor lumber currently sells for between $3 and $14 or higher, depending on the quality and finish of the wood.
We can’t predict the future or what will happen to the price of lumber in years to come.

 
 
When do I get my return?

You receive your return on investment 10 years after you sign your subscription agreement.
Once a year you will receive a report with pictures of your trees and statistics on the growth of your trees.

 
 
Are the trees genetically modified?

No, our trees are not genetically modified (GMO).
GMO refers to an organism whose genetic material has been altered using genetic engineering techniques. These sometimes contain genes from totally unrelated species, such as salmon genes in tomatoes developed to have frost resistance and this raises concerns that as such an organism could not possibly develop naturally we don’t know the long term effects.
Our Paulownia trees are bred using conventional methods as used by farmers for thousands of years, i.e. we cross pollinate different lines of the same genus (Paulownia) and then grow the seedlings out, selecting the best and then propagate only from those best trees to develop new varieties.
We do not splice in genes from outside the Paulownia genus. There is no unrelated genetic material whether plant or animal included in the genome of our trees.

 
 
Are the trees organically grown?

Yes. Empress Splendor trees don’t respond well to chemical products and are best when they are grown organically. For example, they love chicken manure!! The bark of the tree is moist, which most insects don’t like. This means that the tree is naturally insect repellant and fire retardant.

Carbon Offsets - World Tree

Climate change is happening now

 
 
 
 




We are dependent on energy for our daily lives. Our cars, homes, computers, vacations and even the food we eat requires energy. The production of energy creates carbon and this carbon is the root cause of global warming.

 
 
 
 




Why Your Carbon Footprint Matters
We all have a carbon footprint. Our homes, businesses, cars, travel and appliances all use energy. When fossil fuels are burned to create that energy they emit carbon dioxide, along with other greenhouse gases, which contribute directly to global warming.
Climate change is serious problem that is happening now. The last 10 years were the warmest on record and sea levels are rising. A recent White House report warns of increasing storms, heat waves, droughts, wild fires and acidification of the oceans.
This has become an economic issue. The White House report predicts that just 3 degrees of warming will cause economic damages in excess of $150 billion dollars per year in North America alone. If we want to slow the rate of climate change, then we must reduce the impact of our energy consumption and carbon emissions.

 
 



“We only get one planet. Humankind must become accountable on a massive scale for the wanton destruction of our collective home. Protecting our future on this planet depends on the conscious evolution of our species.”
~ Leonardo DiCaprio in a speech to the United Nations

 
 
 
 
 
 




Tons carbon produced every year by an average North American

 


Tons carbon absorbed a year by an acre of Empress Splendor tress

 


Tons carbon sequestered in 50 years by the purchase of 1 carbon offset package

 
 
 



 




Carbon Offsets – The Natural Choice
To make a serious dent in our carbon emissions we all need to take action. There are only two ways to reduce your carbon footprint: use less energy or find a way to offset your carbon emissions.
Many people are refitting their homes and businesses to be more energy efficient and to use clean energy sources such as solar power. However, even the greenest homes and workplaces still have a carbon footprint. Planting trees is one of the most effective ways of offsetting your carbon emissions.
The Empress Splendor tree sequesters 11 times more carbon than any other tree.
In fact, it is so efficient that the average North American would only need to plant 22 trees to offset their carbon emissions for the next 50 years!

 
 



The Environmental Resources Trust measured the amount of carbon sequestered by 1 acre of Empress Trees. They found that Empress trees absorb on average 103 tons of carbon per acre every year. Most trees absorb between 2 and 9 tons per acre per year.


 
 
 
 
 
 






Eats Carbon for Breakfast
Trees are one of the most effective way of offsetting your carbon emissions.
The Empress Splendor tree holds and absorbs 11 times more carbon than any other tree.


 
 




Protects old growth forests
There is a constant and growing demand for hardwood.
Empress trees are the fastest growing hardwood tree in the world and can meet this demand, preventing the destruction of old growth forests.


 
 




Replenishes the soil
Empress trees can be planted in depleted soil and will revitalize it.
The large leaves create nutrient rich mulch and the tree pulls water and nutrition from the air and brings it back to the ground.


 
 
 
 




Positive Action for a Better World
Sometimes it’s hard to know what to do to really make a difference. Offsetting your carbon emissions is a powerful action you can take to reverse your carbon footprint. This is the only program where you not only offset your emissions you also get a financial return. Watch the video to find out how the unique properties of  the Empress Tree make this possible.
