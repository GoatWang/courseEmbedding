Gramm and the ‘Enron Loophole’

In 2000, Senator Phil Gramm played a central role in writing the Commodity Futures Modernization Act, a law that would open the door to unregulated trading of credit default swaps, the financial instruments blamed, in part, for the current economic meltdown.But there was another aspect of this legislation that, earlier this decade, helped produce another financial meltdown: the collapse of Enron, the Texas energy company.The commodity futures act, in addition to allowing unregulated trading of financial derivatives, included language advocated by Enron that largely exempted the company from regulation of its energy trading on electronic commodity markets, like its once-popular Enron Online. The provision came to be known as the Enron Loophole.E-mail written by Enron executives and lobbyists — which became public as part of a federal investigation after Enron collapsed — shows how top Enron officials closely monitored negotiations on the bill. They paid particular attention to Mr. Gramm, who before a final agreement in late 2000 was trying to press other key figures on Capitol Hill and at the White House to agree to concessions that would further curtail regulation of trading.

Enron’s primary concern was that Mr. Gramm’s insistence at getting these additional free-market concessions — most of which were unrelated to Enron’s business — might scuttle the whole deal, killing Enron’s chance of getting the loophole it sought. Continue reading the main story

Enron was a major contributor to Mr. Gramm’s political campaigns, and Mr. Gramm’s wife, Wendy, served on the Enron board, which she joined after stepping down as chairwoman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.Although not directly related to the current economic crisis, the Enron e-mail provides a window into how much clout Mr. Gramm had as chairman of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, and the ways lobbyists intervened to advance and defend their interests during negotiations on the bill.The Commodity Futures Modernization Act was approved in December 2000, just before Bill Clinton’s term as president ended. Mr. Gramm, in a recent interview, said he was not responsible for inserting the language into the bill that established the Enron Loophole. But once the Commodity Futures Modernization measure — with this provision included — reached the Senate floor, Mr. Gramm led the debate, urging his fellow senators to pass it into law.Following are excerpts from some of the e-mail pulled from the Enron files that discuss Mr. Gramm and this legislation. All of the e-mail is available at Enron Explorer,  a site that has put the Enron e-mail into a searchable format.  More information on the Enron Loophole is available here.Aug. 10, 2000: ‘We Need Senator Gramm’ Christopher M. Long, an Enron lobbyist, writes to other Enron executives, updating the status of the negotiations over the Commodity Futures Modernization Act and urging Enron’s chief executive, Kenneth Lay, to call Senator Gramm to nudge him on the topic. As an Enron board member, Wendy Gramm is playing a part in the debate as well. Two Enron executives write Mr. Long back, endorsing the idea of having Mr. Lay call Mr. Gramm. Chris Long@ENRON08/10/2000 05:12 PMTo: Mark E Haedicke/HOU/ECT@ECT, Steven J Kean/HOU/EES@EES, Richard Shapiro/HOU/EES@EES, Mark Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECT, Joe Hillings/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Cynthia Sandherr/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Tom Briggs/NA/Enron@Enroncc: raislerk@sullcrom.com, Allison Navin/Corp/Enron@ENRONSubject: CFTC ReauthorizationAt his request, I met Lee Sachs, Assistant Treasury Secretary, who had requested the meeting after a brief conversation recently. Lee said that senior-level negotiations led by Secretary Summers were initiated last week between the CFTC and SEC and that progress was being made on the single stock futures issue (the major issue postponing movement of the legislation).

The Senate Agriculture Committee passed out the Senate version in July. However, the bill is not moving quickly in the Senate due to Senator Phil Gramm’s desire to see significant changes made to the legislation (not directly related to our energy language). Last week at the Republican Convention, I asked the Senator about the bill and he said they were working on it, but much needs to be changed for his support. More telling perhaps, were Wendy Gramm’s comments that she would rather the current bill die if a better bill can be passed next year. What this means is that we must, at the least, remove Senator Gramm’s opposition to the bill to move the process and more importantly seek to gain his support of the legislation.However, with less than 20 or so legislative days left, we need Senator Gramm to engage. A call from Ken Lay in the next two weeks to Senator Gramm could be an impetus for Gramm to move his staff to resolve the differences. Gramm needs to fully understand how helpful the bill is to Enron. Let me know your thoughts on this approach. I am prepared to assist in coordinating the call and drafting the talking points for a Ken Lay/Sen. Gramm call.Oct. 13, 2000: Talking PointsMr. Long again writes Enron executives providing “talking points” that Mr. Lay should bring up in his conversation with Senator Gramm. Senator Gramm, in a recent interview, said he did not remember ever having the conversation with Mr. Lay. Earlier e-mail shows that Mr. Lay and Mr. Gramm had previously spoken about the legislation.Chris Long10/13/2000 03:09 PMTo: Tori L Wells/HOU/ECT@ECT, Rosalee Fleming/Corp/Enron@ENRON  cc: Steven J Kean/NA/Enron@Enron, Joe Hillings/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Cynthia  Sandherr/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Lisa Yoho/HOU/EES@EESSubject: Commodity Futures Act - Talking PointsTori: We have contacted Senator Gramm and Majority Leader Armey about the calls from Ken on Monday. Because of the uncertainty of the Congressional schedule, both offices told us to call on Monday morning to schedule the call. If Ken wants to make the calls unscheduled, we expect Armey and Gramm to both be in DC by Monday morning.** CONFIDENTIAL **Talking Points on Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000 Background:We have hit an impasse on the CFTC Reauthorization legislation. On legal certainty, nearly all interested parties agree. However, Senator Gramm continues to raise objections unrelated to legal certainty for our business. There are two issues (which we understand have primarily been advanced by Senator Gramm, one on bank products and one on SEC jurisdiction). Majority Leader Dick Armey is trying to gain consensus with the interested parties which include Senator Gramm, the Chairmen of the House Agriculture, Commerce, and Banking Committees, as well as the Department of Treasury, CFTC, and SEC. Meetings are occurring on a daily basis, but little concrete progress has been made since draft legislation was released on October 9.Talking Points:We need your help to resolve outstanding differences so that the Commodities Futures Modernization Act of 2000 can pass this year. There are very few legislative days left and movement now on this legislation is essential. Do not let the Congressional calendar be the enemy of gaining legal certainty for this dynamic and growing industry.The current version of the legislation provides important legal certainty for all physical commodity transactions (not including agricultural commodities) entered into on a counterparty-to-counterparty basis or on an electronic trading facility. We strongly support these provisions.

The legislation eliminates concerns that our derivatives transactions may be illegal or that our online platforms may be unregulated futures exchanges. These provisions allow our businesses to grow and innovate. Without this legislation the industry will be crippled with legal uncertainty and these platforms will develop overseas.Virtually all of the issues in this very complex legislative package have been resolved. We are indifferent to outstanding provisions, except to the extent that they impede passage of the legislation. We cannot allow the great progress made to date, fail in the end.If asked, about a possible solution to the logjam. Answer: Encourage Majority Leader Armey, Senator Gramm, and Secretary Summers to meet immediately to finalize the remaining issues. Given time constraints, if such a meeting does not occur in the next few days, there may not be enough time to pass this important legislation.Note: Congress will be going out on either October 20 or October 27.Oct. 25, 2000: Signs of a BottleneckKenneth M. Raisler, a lawyer at Sullivan & Cromwell, a law firm advising Enron, sends an e-mail message to Tom Briggs, then Enron’s vice president for governmental affairs, explaining how Senator Gramm is holding up the legislation. Senator Gramm, he said, is trying to broaden the regulatory exemptions for derivatives trading provided in the Commodity Exchange Act (C.E.A.) beyond what the other parties in the negotiations had agreed to, including officials at the Securities and Exchange Commission (S.E.C.), Commodity Futures Trading Commission (C.F.T.C.) and mercantile exchanges in Chicago and New York. RAISLERK@sullcrom.com10/25/2000 07:51 AMTo: tom.briggs@enron.comcc:Subject: Fwd: CEA Update Bad NewsSenator Gramm’s staff presented to the Senate Ag Committee Republican and Democratic staff and the Democratic staff of the Senate Banking Committee, Gramm’s proposed changes to the CEA bill. This proposal is quite lengthy, and includes many amendments most of which were previously discussed with the House Agriculture Committee, some of which were included in House Agriculture Committee Saturday Night Draft of 10/8/00. Because of the length of the document we have only attached the summary that the Gramm staff provided. In separate e-mails to follow we will send only the pages of the House-passed bill that were changed by the Gramm proposal. As you know some of these provisions include matters objectionable to Treasury, SEC, CFTC, Chicago and New York Exchanges. As you also know the view of the Agencies and the Ag Comm is that some of these exclusions create loopholes which can allow some market participants to avoid the new Single Stock Futures regulatory design, the CFTC oversight of the energy market, and go far beyond the recommendations of the President’s Working Group.The staffs of the Banking and Agriculture Committees have agreed to meet tomorrow late morning. We believe at that time the Agriculture Committee will propose a counter-offer which while addressing the Gramm major concerns will not adopt his proposal but instead rely on the Treasury proposals. If Senator Gramm is willing to work off this alternative a negotiation may result, otherwise it is unlikely that any agreement with Gramm will be reached. The Agriculture Committee is disinclined to repeat the debates held in the House Agriculture Comm. consideration of the bill. We welcome your reaction to the proposal.Oct. 27, 2000: An Optimistic NoteMr. Raisler again writes Enron executives, explaining that the negotiations are now moving ahead, after being contacted by energy industry players.

Senator Gramm is actively engaged and his issues are being aggressively negotiated. There remain a number of outstanding points but there is good cooperation with the Administration to get this done. Senator Gramm has been contacted by a number of people including members of our Energy Group and Alan Greenspan urging passage of the bill. This clearly has had an impact. Senator Gramm appears committed, and he and his Staff are very focused.

With respect to physical commodities, our issues remain essentially untouched from the House bill. I expect that this is where we will be if the legislation gets passed. It looks now like Congress will be in next week, perhaps until Thursday. While this is painful, it does give them more time to work out unresolved issues.I will continue to keep you apprised.Dec. 12, 2000: Pressure on Gramm Stacy Carey, an executive at the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, sends the organization’s members, including Enron, an update on the negotiations over the Commodity Future Modernization Act in the final days before Congress adjourns. Mr. Gramm is being pressured to give in and sign off on the legislation, but he is still pushing for certain changes, and getting agreement on them. Representative Thomas Ewing, Republican of Illinois, is pressing Mr. Gramm to sign off on the deal, saying that as agreed upon by the House speaker, Dennis Hastert, they will bring a House version to the floor even if Mr. Gramm refuses to accept the plan. CEA Legislation Email detailsFrom: scarey@isda.orgTo: usregcomm@isda.orgSent: 12/12/2000 at 16:57Email metadataThemes:Negotiations between the Treasury Department, the House Agriculture Committee and Senator Gramm continue this evening. The attached documents reflect language sent to Senator Gramm from the Treasury Department this morning. The House Agriculture is waiting for a mark-up of the Treasury language from Senator Gramm’s office.Congress is expected to finish its work this week. Negotiations on this legislation will likely need to be completed in the next 24 hours if it is to be included in a final package.Additionally, Chairman Ewing spoke to Senator Gramm this morning urging completion of negotiations. Ewing also advised Gramm that he would be forwarding a final legislative package to Speaker Hastert. Dec. 12, 2000: A Deal Is ReachedMr. Long, the Enron lobbyist, writes to Enron executives announcing that a deal has nearly been reached, after Mr. Gramm was able to persuade the players to accept some modest amendments to the legislation, including a change that will further protect swaps from regulation, as he had long sought — a change that would benefit Enron.From: Chris LongTo: Mark Taylor, Linda Robertson, Lisa Yoho, Tom BriggsSent: 12/12/2000 at 11:04Mark - Treasury just minutes ago sent this compromise language to the CEA bill to Gramm’s staff. It is my understanding from Treasury that the swap exemption is expanded slightly to say that if you are a trading on a facility (MTF) and you are trading on principle-to-principle basis among eligible contract participants you are no longer subject anti-fraud and anti-manipulation as contained in Sec. 107 of the House passed legislation. This would be good for us. Ken is in London, so can you take a quick look at the attached language and tell me if you concur.

Also, we need to take a look at the new Sec. 4 to see if it causes any problems.They may cut a deal as early as this afternoon!Thanks - Chris  Dec. 16, 2000: Celebrating a Victory Mr. Long celebrates the bill’s passage, crediting work by Enron and other players as Mr. Gramm, after getting certain narrow changes in the legislation, removes his hold and lets the bill go to a vote in the Senate. From: Chris LongTo: Jeff Skilling, Kenneth Lay, Steven Kean, Louise Kitchen, Greg Whalley, David Delainey, John Lavorato, Mark Haedicke, Mark Taylor, Jeffrey Shankman, Richard Shapiro, Mike Mcconnell, James Steffes, Mark Schroeder, Lisa Yoho, Mark Tawney, Gary Hickerson, Linda Robertson, Joe Hillings, Cynthia Sandherr, Tom Briggs, Stephen Burns, Allison Navin, Amy Fabian, Carolyn Cooney, Jeffrey Keeler (21 more)Sent: 12/16/2000 at 11:16Congress Passes the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000Late Friday afternoon, December 15, Congress passed the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000. The purpose of the Act is to eliminate unnecessary regulation of commodity futures exchanges and other entities falling within the coverage of the Commodities Exchange Act (“CEA”) and the provide legal certainty with regard to certain futures and derivatives transactions. By enacting such changes, Congress intends to promote product innovation and to enhance the competitive position of US financial markets. Certain provisions of the Act open the door for Enron’s further product innovation and growth. Specifically, the Act provides important legal certainty for energy and other transactions occuring both on an over-the-counter (OTC) bilateral basis and on multilateral electronic trading platforms. Enron was a leading advocate of passage of this legislation.Bilateral TransactionsUnder the Act, bilateral transactions in all commodities (other than agriculture commodities) that do not occur on trading facility (i.e. not on a multi-party exchange) are exempt from most provisions of the CEA as long as the transactions are entered solely between “eligible contract participants”(i.e. persons and certain legal entities satisfying capital thresholds and other requirements under the Act). This provision essentially codifies and expands existing CFTC exemptions for swaps and forward contracts, thereby eliminating a degree of legal ambiguity that has frustrated product innovation and growth.Multilateral TransactionsIn addition, the Act creates a broad exemption for any agreement, contract or transaction in commodities (other than agriculture commodities) so long as they the transactions are between “eligible commercial participants”, are entered into on a “principle-to-principle basis” and that take place on a multi-party “electronic facility”. This exemption could facilitate expansion of EnronOnline to allow for multi-party transactions, however certain legal requirements will have to be met.Other TransactionsThe Act also creates a broad exclusion for a number of commodities that are of interest to Enron, including “credit risk measure” commodities and weather derivatives . Again, the derivative transaction exclusion will have to meet certain legal thresholds.This legislation has been over six years in the making and the collective support of many Enron employees has been crucial. Thank you to all that have contributed to the passage on this important legislation. We will have a more through legal summary of this legislation in the near future.

Jan. 8, 2001: Looking AheadWith the Clinton administration almost over, and George W. Bush preparing to take office,  Enron —  with the help of Mr. Gramm and his wife, an Enron board member —  seeks to continue to influence the regulatory process, including helping to select the new chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. (Ultimately, James E. Newsome held the post through 2004.)Chris Long@ENRON01/08/2001 09:14 AMTo: Mark E Haedicke/HOU/ECT@ECT, Mark Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECT, Richard  Shapiro/NA/Enron@Enron, Linda Robertson/NA/Enron@ENRON, Cynthia  Sandherr/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Lisa Yoho/NA/Enron@Enron, Tom Briggs/NA/Enron@Enroncc: Allison Navin/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Ginger Dernehl/NA/Enron@EnronSubject:As the Bush transition moves forward, we need to monitor (or perhaps try to influence) the selection of the new CFTC Chair/Commissioners.As noted below, Jim Newsome has been selected as Acting Chair. I mentioned this to Ken Raisler and Stacy Carey. Everyone agrees that Newsome is a known quantity, though he may not be a superstar in the mold of Bill Ranier. Ken said Newsome knows our issues and is favorable to a “free market” approach to energy and metals. However, there is some concern about his ability to reign in the CFTC staff. Newsome is the favorite currently for the position with boosters in Senators Lott and Cochran and his college roommate Rep. Jerry Moran (R-KS). However, it is still early in the game and unknown Chair candidates could still be out there (including officials passed over for more high profile positions).If Newsome is nominated as the Chair, an additional Commissioner (a Republican) position opens and will be named by Speaker Denny Hastert. Hastert is from the suburbs and the assumption is that he the Chicago exchanges may influence the appointment. Stacy Carey is poking around to determine what Chicago exchanges are thinking. One name that has been mentioned often is retired Congressman Tom Ewing who has expressed interest in a Commission seat, but not the Chair (Ewing is supportive of our issues).David Spears is also likely to leave, but no date has been announced. This is also a Republican seat. The Democrats Barbara Holum and Tom Erickson are likely to stick around until their terms expire.We can try to float names of persons we would like to see either Chair or join the Commission. Also, we have learned that Wendy Gramm has list of names she may be shopping around for CFTC and SEC  — it would be good the see who Gramm is proposing.Please advise how you want to proceed in either reviewing or suggesting the appointees.Thanks - Chris

Feb. 14, 2001: Seeking a ‘Free-Market Person’Wendy Gramm, while on the Enron board, seeks to help officials at Enron, including Steven J. Kean, the company’s chief of staff, influence the process of restructuring the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which she ran in the late 1980s and early 1990s, when George H. W. Bush was president. Enron proves unable to get Mr. Newsome, the acting chairman, replaced. But in later e-mail messages, once it becomes clear Mr. Newsome will stay in his post, they invite him to visit Enron’s headquarters. The exchange shows how both Mr. Gramm and his wife continued to be involved in C.F.T.C. business until Mr. Gramm left office.WGramm@aol.com02/14/2001 07:58 AMTo: Steven.J.Kean@enron.comcc:Subject: Re: Confidential  — CFTC ChairHi Steve,Folks love Newsome, and I think he’s very nice and appears to be very free market. Spears, the other Republican appointee is not at all free market, in my view. I would not like this to mentioned anywhere else, but I have found that the farm reps on the Commission may sound deregulatory but are not, and have been really troublesome without a good free market person on board. And there are no truly free market persons on board at the Commission (every single other agricultural rep that I worked with on the Commission were trouble, even though they claimed to be deregulatory  —  and they were far worse before I got there and after I left.)I visited with Newsome a day before Inauguration, and I was appalled at what they were planning to do concerning agency structure  —  that would have elevated the regulatory lawyers and diminished the role of the economists at the agency. Misguided and showed to me a lack of understanding of how organizational structures can affect what comes out of an agency.I am often at odds with "the industry view" regarding CFTC issues. I don’t think the futures exchanges, who have a lot of power, necessarily are pro-competition; and many of the non-exchange folks who lobby on CFTC issues are Washington or New York (Democrat - which is why they want to involve Ken at this level) lawyers who do not understand markets and who are more interested in being able to claim influence or impact. The CFTC is in awful shape  —  the quality of staff is horrendous, and the Commission is relying on some of the worst people for their policy work (same folks that Brooksley Born used, same folks who have advocated more regulation of the OTC market for years). Many quality folks do not want the job as Chairman because it’s been such a backwater. I am looking for some good folks. Have at least one person who would be good at that job. And it’s not Newsome. Please do not share this information with the usual folks, as they hate me anyway (I’m too free market and have argued against their "fixes"). Sorry for this scathing review, but this is an important appointment.Wendy Continue reading the main story

About Profile Visibility
Profile Visibility is based on the total number of weekly profile views. It provides a weekly snapshot of
            which profiles users are viewing on martindale.com in the form of a ranking. We do not differentiate in
            the case of a tie, which may mean a number of attorneys in the same city display the same
            ranking. For example, if three lawyers each received 20 profiles views last week in Atlanta, and 20 is the
            highest number of profile views for that week, all three lawyers would receive a #1 ranking.

            Peer Reviews
            



About Peer Rating
Martindale-Hubbell® Peer Review Ratings™ are the gold standard in attorney ratings, and have been for more than a century. These ratings indicate attorneys who are widely respected by their peers for their ethical standards and legal expertise in a specific area of practice.


The Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings process is the gold standard due to its objectivity and comprehensiveness. Lawyers solicited for peer reviews include both those selected by the attorney being reviewed and lawyers independently selected by Martindale-Hubbell. All reviewers are verified as attorneys through Martindale-Hubbell's extensive attorney database. Only attorneys practicing at least three years and receiving a sufficient number of reviews from non-affiliated attorneys are eligible to receive a Rating.
What are the different Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings?
AV Preeminent®: The highest peer rating standard. This rating signifies that a large number of the lawyer's peers rank him or her at the highest level of professional excellence for their legal knowledge, communication skills and ethical standards.
Distinguished: An excellent rating for a lawyer with some experience. This rating indicates the attorney is widely respected by their peers for high professional achievement and ethical standards.
Notable: This rating indicates that the lawyer has been recognized by a large number of their peers for strong ethical standards.
Lawyers who have received peer reviews after 2009 will display more detailed information, including practice areas, summary ratings, detailed numeric ratings and written feedback (if available). Details for individual reviews received before 2009 are not displayed.
Attorneys that receive reviews from their peers, but not a sufficient number to establish a Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Rating, will have those reviews display on our websites.

Client Reviews 


About Client Rating
The Martindale-Hubbell® Client Review Ratings™ display reviews submitted by clients of lawyers and law firms.


The Client Review Rating score is determined through aggregation of validated responses. People who submit reviews are clients of law firms who hired a lawyer within the last year, whose matter is not pending and who want to share their experience of that lawyer or law firm with other potential clients. Reviewers can be anyone who hires a lawyer including in-house counsel, corporate executives, small business owners and private individuals.
Martindale-Hubbell validates that the reviewer is a person with a valid email address. As part of the review process, respondents must affirm that they have been a client of the lawyer or law firm identified within the past year, although Martindale-Hubbell cannot confirm the lawyer/client relationship as it is often confidential. The content of the responses are entirely from client reviewers.
Prior results do not guarantee a similar outcome and Martindale-Hubbell accepts no responsibility for the content or accuracy of any review.
For more information on Martindale-Hubbell Client Review Ratings, please visit our Client Review Page.

                I was facing losing my license from speeding tickets and he worked out an agreement with the court allowing me keep my license. His fees are very reasonable and he's very knowledgeable in his field and I would recommend anyone with traffic violation concerns to contact him.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/28/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

As with all your investments through Fidelity, you must make your own determination whether an investment is appropriate for you.  Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.  Foreign securities are subject to interest-rate, currency-exchange-rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.  Illiquidity is an inherent risk associated with investing in real estate and REITs.  There is no guarantee the issuer of a REIT will maintain the secondary market for its shares and redemptions may be at a price which is more or less than the original price paid.  Closed-end funds can trade at a discount to their NAV.  Shareholders of Master Limited Partnerships may be treated as partners for tax purposes.  Partnerships issue a Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) rather than a Form 1099 form for tax purposes. It lists the partner's share of income, deductions, credits, etc.  Speak with your tax advisor to determine how this may affect you.  A royalty trust is a type of corporation, mostly in the United States or Canada, usually involved in oil and gas production or mining.  Royalty trusts may have special tax treatment, so you should consult a tax advisor on the potential tax consequences of investing in them.News, commentary and events are from third-party sources unaffiliated with Fidelity.

Victoria's Secret and Financial Privacy. Outside the Beltway, it is not well known that a Victoria's Secret catalog was responsible for a key aspect of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. Read the story here. (Jan. 2005)

Introduction
Information that many would consider private--including bank balances and account numbers--is regularly bought and sold by banks, credit card companies, and other financial institutions. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA), which is also known as the Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999, provides limited privacy protections against the sale of your private financial information. Additionally, the GLBA codifies protections against pretexting, the practice of obtaining personal information through false pretenses.
The GLBA primarily sought to "modernize" financial services--that is, end regulations that prevented the merger of banks, stock brokerage companies, and insurance companies. The removal of these regulations, however, raised significant risks that these new financial institutions would have access to an incredible amount of personal information, with no restrictions upon its use. Prior to GLBA, the insurance company that maintained your health records was distinct from the bank that mortgaged your house and the stockbroker that traded your stocks. Once these companies merge, however, they would have the ability to consolidate, analyze and sell the personal details of their customers' lives. Because of these risks, the GLBA included three simple requirements to protect the personal data of individuals: First, banks, brokerage companies, and insurance companies must securely store personal financial information. Second, they must advise you of their policies on sharing of personal financial information. Third, they must give consumers the option to opt-out of some sharing of personal financial information.

Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA).
Title V of the GLBA (sections with financial privacy and pretexting protections).

History of the GLBA
The history of the GLBA has its roots in the separation of banks, brokerage companies, and insurance companies. As a result of the financial failures of the Great Depression, Congress in 1933 passed the Glass-Steagall Act prohibiting national and state banks from affiliating with securities companies. In 1956, Congress passed the Bank Holding Company Act that prohibited a bank from controlling a non-bank company. In 1982 Congress amended the Bank Holding Act to further forbid banks from conducting general insurance underwriting or agency activities. This changed, however, in 1999, when the GLBA repealed sections of these acts and allowed banks to engage in a wide range of financial services.
The privacy risks from such mergers were put onto the agenda by a series of international and domestic events. On the international front, in 1995, the EU passed the Data Protection Directive, which required that international data exchanges that used EU citizens' personal data be accorded the same level of protection that their home country would afford them. This meant that US companies would have to ensure that when they used EU citizens' personal data they provided the same level of protection these citizens were afforded within the EU. The EU was especially concerned with the US government's preference for self-regulatory approaches to privacy and the lack of federal privacy legislation. While the EU-US agreed to a Safe Harbor proposal, which allowed for companies to self-regulate under FTC oversight, financial services industries were not included in the original agreement.
In the United States, privacy was increasingly cited as being at risk. Public polls at the time indicated citizen privacy awareness and unhappiness with the banking industry's lack of concern for consumer privacy issues. These poll responses led to subsequent studies that indicated how much consumers were concerned with ineffectual bank privacy standards and the lack of consumer protections against unwanted information sharing.
These attitudes were further fueled by a series of high profile cases involving banks selling consumer information with adverse consequences for customers including marketing, credit fraud, and identity theft.
In November 1997, Charter Pacific Bank of Agoura Hills, California sold millions of credit card numbers to an adult website company, which then proceeded to bill customers for access to Internet porn sites and other services they did not request. Some of the customers billed did not even own a computer. The website company had set up numerous merchant accounts under different names to avoid detection. In September 2000, the FTC announced that it has won a $37.5 million judgment against the website company. While the bank maintained that it did not do anything wrong, it has since then stopped selling credit card numbers to merchants.
In 1998, NationsBank (later merged with Bank of America) was fined millions for securities law violations because it shared customer information with its affiliate subsidiary Nations Securities. The subsidiary then convinced low risk customers to buy high-risk investments. Many NationsBank customers lost large amounts and many senior citizens lost large amounts of their life savings.
In June 1999, the Minnesota Attorney General initiated a lawsuit against U.S. Bankcorp for sharing customer information with third party marketers in violation of its own policies without customer knowledge or authorization. The telemarketers then illicitly charged those customers. US Bankcorp eventually settled that case, along with those brought by 39 other state attorneys general. In April 2000, Minnesota settled with the third party telemarketer, Memberworks, that US Bankcorp used. According to Memberworks' SEC filings, 19 out of the 25 largest banks in the US had contracts with it. Other prominent banks, including Chase Manhattan and Citibank, have been involved in schemes where personal account information is sold to telemarketers.
This confluence of international and domestic events prompted Congress to include Title V in its GLBA provisions, which contains limited privacy protections for financial information. The GLBA was introduced in the Senate by Senator Phil Gramm (R-TX) as 106 S. 900 and in the House of Representatives by Representative James Leach (R-IA) as 106 H.R. 10. It was signed by President Clinton and became Public Law 106-102 (113 Stat. 1338) on November 11, 1999. The privacy protections are codified at 15 USC § 6801-6810.

Privacy Protections Under the GLBA
The GLBA's privacy protections only regulate financial institutions--businesses that are engaged in banking, insuring, stocks and bonds, financial advice, and investing.
First, these financial institutions, whether they wish to disclose your personal information or not, must develop precautions to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer records and information, to protect against any anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of such records, and to protect against unauthorized access to or use of such records or information which could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer.
Second, financial institutions are required to provide you with a notice of their information sharing policies when you first become a customer, and annually thereafter. That notice must inform the consumer of the financial institutions' policies on: disclosing nonpublic personal information (NPI) to affiliates and nonaffiliated third parties, disclosing NPI after the customer relationship is terminated, and protecting NPI. "Nonpublic personal information" means all information on applications to obtain financial services (credit card or loan applications), account histories (bank or credit card) and the fact that an individual is or was a customer. This interpretation of NPI makes names, addresses, telephone numbers, Social Security Numbers and other data subject to the GLBA's data sharing restrictions.
Third, the GLBA gives consumers the right to opt-out from a limited amount of NPI sharing. Specifically, a consumer can direct the financial institution to not share information with unaffiliated companies.
Consumers have no right under the GLBA to stop sharing of NPI among affiliates. An affiliate is any company that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with another company. The individual consumer has absolutely no control over this kind of "corporate family" trading of personal information.
There are several exemptions under the GLBA that can permit information sharing over the consumer's objection. For instance, if a financial institution wishes to engage the services of a separate company, they can transfer personal information to that company by arguing that the information is necessary to the services that the company will perform. A financial institution can transfer information to a marketing or sales company to sell new products (different stocks) or jointly offered products (co-sponsored credit cards). Once this unaffiliated third party has your personal information, they can share it with their own "corporate family." However, they themselves cannot likewise transfer the information to further companies through this exemption.
In addition, financial institutions can disclose your information to credit reporting agencies, financial regulatory agencies, as part of the sale of a business, to comply with any other laws or regulations, or as necessary for a transaction requested by the consumer.
Fourth, financial institutions are prohibited from disclosing, other than to a consumer reporting agency, access codes or account numbers to any nonaffiliated third party for use in telemarketing, direct mail marketing, or other marketing through electronic mail. Thus, even if a consumer fails to "opt-out" of a financial institutions' transfers, your credit card numbers, pins or other access codes cannot be sold, as they had been in some previous cases.
Fifth, certain types of "pretexting" were prohibited by the GLBA. Pretexting is the practice of collecting personal information under false pretenses. Pretexters pose as authority figures (law enforcement agents, social workers, potential employers, etc.) and manufacture seductive stories (that the victim is about to receive a sweepstakes award or insurance payment) in order to elicit personal information about the victim. The GLBA prohibits the use of false, fictitious or fraudulent statements or documents to get customer information from a financial institution or directly from a customer of a financial institution; the use of forged, counterfeit, lost or stolen documents to get customer information from a financial institution or directly from a customer of a financial institution; and asking another person to get someone else's customer information using false, fictitious, or fraudulent documents or forged, counterfeit, lost or stolen documents.
However, investigators still can call friends, relatives, or entities not covered by the GLBA under false pretenses in order to gain information on the victim.
Problems with the GLBA
First, the GLBA does not protect consumers. It unfairly places the burden on the individual to protect privacy with an opt-out standard. By placing the burden on the customer to protect their data, GLBA weakens customer power to control their financial information. The agreement's opt-out provisions do not require institutions to provide a standard of protection for their customers regardless of whether they opt-out of the agreement. This provision is based on the assumption that financial companies will share information unless expressly told not to by their customers and if customers neglect to respond, it gives institutions that freedom to disclose customer nonpublic personal information.
Second, the GLBA notices are confusing and limit the transparency of information practices. GLBA assumes a company will explain a complex set of legal definitions added to numerous exceptions to the law in a way that will allow for an informed choice and in transparent language. There are reservations about a company's desire to do this.
Moreover, according to recent studies, most privacy and opt-out policies are usually convoluted, confusing, and misleading since they are created by entities whose interests are better served when there is no effective notice. GLBA does little to deal with the lack of transparency in the privacy notices themselves. Typical privacy notices do not include any specific information about how the data is actually used. GLBA notices do inform consumers that their personal information will be shared, but they generally do not inform the individual of who will receive the information or the purposes for which it will be used.
Third, the GLBA fails to enhance consumers' control over affiliate information sharing. Consumers have no opt-out right against affiliate information sharing. In today's world of mega-mergers, a bank may have over one thousand affiliates, some of which may be completely unrelated to financial services.
Fourth, financial institutions can evade opt-out requirements by exploiting the exceptions in the GLBA. The service provider/joint marketing exemption allows financial institutions to share information with non-affiliated third parties despite a consumer's opt-out.
Fifth, the GLBA has weak enforcement and compensation mechanisms. GLBA's enforcement mechanisms are inadequate to assure compliance with even existing weak privacy protections. Enforcement rests solely with federal government agencies, leaving the individual no private right of action.
How the GLBA Could Be Improved
Privacy advocates and industry groups have asked for some substantial changes to the GLBA to ensure greater protection and consumer security. Some of these changes include:

Financial institutions should implement an opt-in approach to the use of personal information because this minimizes any unwanted or unknowing disclosure of information and places the burden of responsibility on those actors who will gain from the disclosure of information.
If an opt-out framework is maintained, financial institutions should be obligated to give and accept alternative opt-out methods. They should be required to provide simple opt-out processes including easy access to privacy policies at branch offices and online through a single web site with opt-out information,
In order to ensure greater transparency and accountability, financial institutions should include in their privacy reports what information is going to be used for. Financial institutions should be required to provide customers with a statutory right of access to learn more about industry practices in order to know how the information is collected, who its affiliates are, and what the information collected for is used.
Financial institutions should provide simply stated and clear privacy policies. Financial institutions should be required to follow acceptable standards for readability by displaying clearer and more transparent privacy reports.
Expand enforcement authority to give states concurrent jurisdiction to enforce the provisions of GLBA in order to ensure a more efficient enforcement program.
Individuals should have the right to protect their privacy and seek remedies and redress under GLBA. As GLBA currently stands, there is no private right of action.
Give individuals the right to review information that is disclosed or to correct inaccurate or incomplete data.

State Law and the GLBA
As with most consumer protection legislation, the GLBA allows states to formulate protections that exceed federal law. The state law debate over GLBA privacy protections has primarily revolved around the question of whether to adopt an opt-in standard for information sharing, and whether to create protections for affiliate information sharing.

In California: Governor Gray Davis' focus upon privacy during his campaign has made California a place to watch. A broad-based coalition that includes the Consumers Union, the American Association of Retired Persons, the American Civil Liberties Union and other groups will launch an attempt to place the consumer financial privacy issue on the November 2002 ballot. The initiative, interestingly, is to be funded by an Internet executive. Chris Larsen, the CEO of E-Loan, felt strongly enough that consumer privacy fears were a major impediment to his business that he donated $1 million to fund the initiative.
In North Dakota: Shortly after the passage of the GLBA, North Dakota passed emergency legislation to eliminate opt-in protections in the state. Members of the State's Constitution Party strongly objected to this, and collected the 15,000 signatures necessary to get the issue placed on the ballot for statewide review. A group called "Protect Our Privacy" formed, and with the help of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), they raised about $27,000 to campaign for opt-in support. An opposition group, driven mainly by bankers and financial interests, raised well over $100,000 to oppose opt-in. Much of that money was spent on misleading ads, including one that claimed ATMs would no longer work in the State if opt-in was adopted. This caused such controversy that the State Attorney General issued an opinion specifically rebutting this claim.
The referendum provided the first opportunity for voters to express their opinion on opt-in. And, consistent with the strong support for opt-in demonstrated in public opinion polls, the voters overwhelmingly rejected opt-out. 73% supported reestablishing the opt-in standard. North Dakota's action is likely to spark voter initiatives for opt-in in other states. Advocates in North Dakota also plan to expand opt-in next year by applying the standard to the insurance industry.

In Vermont: The State's Department of Banking, Insurance, Securities, and Health Care Administration adopted opt-in provisions for information sharing. To comply with the regulation, some companies have simply treated all Vermont residents as having opted-out under GLBA. However, a group of insurance companies has mounted a challenge to the requirements.
In other states: Alaska (Alaska Stat. § 06.05.175), Connecticut (Conn. Gen. Stat. Ann § 36a-42), Illinois (205 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/48.1), and Maryland (Md. Code Ann. § 1-301) require some form of opt-in consent before financial information can be shared. Additionally, because efforts to obtain opt-in in California failed in 2001 and 2002, communities in that state have adopted opt-in ordinances. In 2002, both San Mateo County and Daly City adopted opt-in financial privacy ordinances. Bank of America and Wells Fargo Bank have brought suit to invalidate them.

July 2001 Petition to Federal Agencies on GLBA
On July 26, 2001, EPIC along with Public Citizen and other organizations submitted a petition to the GLBA entities with their concerns regarding financial notices. In this petition, they requested an amendment to the regulations implementing GLBA to ensure the consumers are provided with better notice and more convenient means of exercising their right to opt out of information sharing.
EPIC argued that the notices mailed out, thus far, by financial institutions employed dense, misleading statements, and confusing and cumbersome procedures to prevent consumers from opting out. Their arguments were that the GLBA could not protect privacy unless the Agencies required readable notices and reasonable opt-out opportunities. They believe that the existing scheme placed much of the burden of privacy protection on consumers and that recent privacy notices show that the regulations under GLBA are failing to protect consumer privacy. By providing obfuscated information and opt-out schemes, couched in legalistic and confusing terms, with misleading options and providing limited alternative options, such as 24 hour toll free numbers, financial institutions sought to deprive consumers of the their right to prevent these institutions from sharing private information. Moreover, most privacy notices lack adequate definitions of important terms and phrases and requires thus the effort of the Agencies to amend existing GLBA regulations to ensure that consumers have meaningful opportunities to exercise their rights. These regulations should require financial institutions provide standardized notice that consumers can understand and opt-out mechanism that consumers can use conveniently.
The petition also includes specific recommendations regarding notices and opt-out mechanisms including examples of clear statements and formats, the option to send an e-mail or use a web page and a detachable, pre-addressed postcard with boxes in which to check off preferences. With these changes, the petitioners believe that consumers can exercise their right more effectively with notices that are readable and understandable and with opt-out mechanisms that are easy to use.

Wherever possible, minimize the amount of personal data given to commercial or governmental entities. Do not release contact information where it is unnecessary. Do not give out your Social Security Number unless it is related for tax purposes, such as employment or opening a bank account.
Don't give out personal information on the phone, mail or through the Internet unless you have initiated the contact or know whom you are dealing with. Pretexters may pose as representatives of survey firms, banks, Internet service providers and even government agencies to get you to reveal your SSN, mother's maiden name, financial account numbers and other identifying information. Legitimate organizations with which you do business have the information they need and will not ask you for it.
Pay attention to your statement cycles and follow up with your financial institutions if your statements do not arrive on time.
Review your statements carefully and promptly and report any discrepancies to your institution immediately.
Keep items with your personal information in a safe place. Tear or shred your charge receipts, copies of credit application, insurance forms, bank checks and other financial statements.
Be mindful about where you leave personal information in your home, especially if you have roommates or are having work done in your home by others.
Add passwords to your credit card, bank and phone accounts.
Your credit report contains information on where you work and live, the credit accounts that have been opened in your name, how you pay your bills and whether you've been sued, arrested or have filed for bankruptcy. Checking your report periodically can help you catch mistakes and fraud before they wreak havoc on your personal finances.
Opt-out from the Credit Reporting Agencies (CRAs) pre-approved credit card offers. By calling 1-888-5OPTOUT (1-888-567-8688), you can stop most pre-approved credit card offers. However, you cannot opt-out from the sale of credit headers. Be sure to specify that you wish to be permanently removed from pre-approved credit card offers, otherwise you will be placed back on the recipient list in two years. To permanently opt-out, you will have to fill out a form that the CRA will mail to you.
Be aware of the price of marketing schemes, while they may convince you that conceding control of your personal data will bring offers of better products and services, for most people this does not translate into opportunity, but into more unwanted telemarketing calls, more junk mail, and more opportunities for sensitive information to make its way into the databases of online data brokers available to identity thieves, fraudulent credit repair services, charities, investments and other schemes.

Consumer Federation of California Starts Financial Privacy Commercial Campaign. The Consumer Federation of California has released a series of commercials on financial privacy. (Mar. 30, 2004)
EPIC Urges Agencies to Improve Notice, Opt-Out. In comments to agencies that regulate financial services companies, EPIC urged the creation of clear, simple privacy notices and user friendly opt-out procedures. (Mar. 29, 2004)
Court Upholds Vermont Opt-In Insurance Privacy Law. A Vermont Superior Court has upheld (pdf) a state law that requires insurance companies to obtain opt-in consent before disclosing their customers' personal information to third parties. Vermont's opt-in standard is stronger than federal protections for privacy, and designed to address the problem presented by "financial companies as high volume traffickers of consumers' intimate, personal information…" For more information, see the affidavits of Richard Bower (on opt-in versus opt-out), William Lutz (on the readability of privacy notices), and the memorandum of the Vermont Attorney General supporting the opt-in law. (Feb. 18, 2004)
EPIC, PIRG Comment on Security Notices. In comments to the Department of the Treasury, EPIC and the U.S. Public Interest Research Group urged the agency to strengthen a proposed guidance on security notices to bank customers. The proposed guidelines specify when a financial institution must give notice to a customer when their personal information has been accessed without authorization. The comments urge the agency to expand the definition of "sensitive consumer information," and to require financial institutions to report statistical information on all security events to federal regulators. For more information, see the EPIC Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Page. (Oct. 14, 2003)
Privacy Groups Urge the Senate to Strengthen Financial Privacy Law. EPIC has joined the testimony (PDF) of U.S. PIRG before the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs in an oversight hearing on Financial Privacy and the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA). The testimony focuses on the failure of the GLBA to promote financial privacy, and on the rights of states to pass legislation that exceeds federal protections. For more information, see the EPIC GLBA Page. (Sept. 19, 2002)
FTC Prevails in Privacy Case Against Trans Union. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has rejected free speech challenges by Trans Union to privacy regulations drafted by federal agencies pursuant to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA). The decision will limit credit bureaus from using personal information for marketing. For more information, see the EPIC Profiling Page. (July 17, 2002)
EPIC, Consumer Groups, State AGs Argue for Stronger Privacy Safeguards for Financial Records. EPIC, Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, U.S. PIRG and Consumers Union submitted comments (PDF) on May 1 for a U.S. Treasury Department study on the effectiveness of Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act financial privacy protections. The study is required by law to shed light on the information sharing practices of the financial services industry. The comments describe flaws in the implementation of the GLB Act and demonstrate the benefits for consumers if an "opt-in" approach is adopted for financial information sharing. 37 state Attorneys General also filed comments for the study, stating that "current law does not adequately protect consumers' privacy" and poses a significant risk to consumers. (May 3, 2002)
Groups Petition Agencies to Improve Financial Privacy. EPIC has joined Public Citizen and other organizations in petitioning federal agencies to improve notice and opt-out mechanisms under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA). The petition (PDF) urges the agencies to adopt requirements of clear, concise language for GLBA privacy notices and to require more effective measures to allow consumers to opt-out from financial information sharing. (July 2001)
Report: Opt-Out Notices Are Difficult to Understand. The Privacy Rights Clearinghouse has published a report showing that most opt-out notices required by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act are written at a second-year college level. Federal law requires that these notices must be written in "plain language." The notices explain how financial institutions collect, share, and use personal information and how individuals can opt-out from certain types of information use. (April 2001)
Proposed Financial Privacy Regulations Released. The Treasury Department, Federal Reserve, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and Office of Thrift Supervision issued a joint notice of proposed rule-making on February 3. The rules (160K PDF) will govern how financial institutions may pass on customer information to affiliated and third parties. On February 24, the Federal Trade Commission released its own notice and rules (120K PDF) for financial institutions within its jurisdiction. Comments on both sets of proposed rules are due by March 31. (Feb. 2000)

Cases

Trans Union v. FTC, No. 00-1141 (D.C. Cir. 2001), cert. denied, 536 U. S. ____ (2002) . In Trans Union, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit held that tradelines (credit information that includes name, address, date of birth, telephone number, Social Security number, account type, opening date of account, credit limit, account status, and payment history) could not be sold for marketing purposes because they constituted a credit report for purposes of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA). Further, the Court rejected the profiler's claim that the First and Fifth Amendments invalidated the FCRA.
IRSG v. FTC, 145 F. Supp. 2d 6, No. 00-1828 (D.D.C. 2001)(PDF 1.9 MB). In Individual Reference Services Group v. FTC, a trade association representing credit reporting agencies and their customers unsuccessfully sued to overturn GLBA regulations. The credit reporting agencies sell products, which use non-public personal information. For example, Trans Union sells products such as "Trace," which allows the user to input an individual's social security number and receive, in return, the name and address of that person; "Retrace," which enables the user who has an individual's name and address to obtain that person's social security and phone numbers; and "ID Search," which permits a customer with a person's name and phone number to obtain that individual's social security number and current and former addresses; and other products which sell the above information along with account information. This decision was affirmed in Trans Union v. FTC, No. 01-5202 (D.C. Cir. 2002).
