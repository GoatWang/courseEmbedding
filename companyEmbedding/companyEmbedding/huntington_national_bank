                I love my Huntington Premier Savings account. I recently switched to Huntington within the last year and can honestly say that it's the best banking institution that I have worked with and has the best savings and checking account perks. I feel like the quality of customer care goes above and beyond and the tellers always do what is easiest for me! I especially love that I can go online and chat with a Huntington representative to get answers to most account questions, it's so easy! My savings account is easy to access and it's super easy to transfer funds to and from my savings. I wouldn't go with another bank, Huntington is for me.… read more

                I've had a savings account with Huntington for over 10 years. I've never paid a maintenance fee on my checking or savings account. There is also a grace period if you overdraw your account. Awhile back had my bank numbers stolen and my accounts were fully drained - Huntington caught the unusual activity, informed me of the steps to get my money back and made the best out of a terrible situation. Whether it’s a large or small problem, anytime I've called their customer service department they are friendly, helpful and seem to really care about fixing the problem. Highly recommend!… read more

                The customer service team at Hunting National Bank is the best. Any time that I have an issue or question the online chat feature has been a great source of saving time so that I do not have to stay on hold during a phone conversation or go out of my way to visit an office. Although when I do have to visit one of the two branches in my area, the tellers go out of their way to give all three of my boys the same flavor sucker so that I don't have to hear arguing in the car :)… read more

                I had been using a few other local banks for my savings accounts over the years, but when problems continued to arise, I knew it was time for a switch. My family recommended Huntington National Bank for my checking and savings accounts because of their local regional base, but with a more personalized customer service style. I couldn't be happier. This savings account has a low minimum balance, low enough for someone young starting out like me, but high enough to give me an incentive to keep saving, with no withdrawal fees and an easy link to my checking account. At a low balance like this, the interest rates don't really matter so much, but if I had a higher investment I would use Huntington's money market account. The best part of being with Huntington National Bank is absolutely the customer service, which is so friendly and the best and most personalized to fit my needs than any other local bank out there. I would recommend this savings account to my friends out there who want a savings account with a realistic minimum balance to avoid the small, but easily avoidable, monthly account fee.… read more

                I've had checking and savings accounts with other banks, most of them much bigger than Huntington. I opened my savings account the same day I opened my checking account, and I'm happy I made that decision. The savings account has about the same interest rate as other larger banks, if not a little lower than average, but it's much nicer than putting cash (which can be easily stolen) in an envelope. Huntington also doesn't have any fees for their savings account at all, even if the savings balance is below a certain amount, or your checking goes below a certain amount. A lot of banks now will charge rather large fees for lower balances.… read more

                Prior to opening an account with Huntington I was using a local credit union. I was happy with the credit union because they didn't charge me fees to keep the account open or fees for being inactive, but the disadvantage was that the credit union wasn't available to me everywhere, it only had a few branches somewhat far away from where I lived. I went to Huntington and I've been so happy with it. There is NO minimum balance to have the savings account open, which is wonderful. There are Huntington branches everywhere, and they are so helpful when you approach the tellers with questions! They even have it set up that my checking draws from my saving in the case of an overdraft. I would highly recommend stopping in your local branch and checking it out. It's definitely a safe place to keep your money.… read more

                My boyfriend and I are saving up for a house and a vacation and we needed somewhere to keep our money besides in envelopes laying around my bedroom! So when I opened a checking account with Huntington I also got a free savings account with no fees! I thought this was perfect because I could put my money in the checking and my boyfriend's in the savings so I am not tempted to spend his money! I am so happy to have both of these accounts and it makes my life much simpler and now I do not have to worry about mixing up my money and my boyfriend's, nor do I have to worry about someone breaking in and stealing that money!… read more

                I went to huntington Bank to open a checking account, but for reasons not entirely clear to me, Huntington requires you to open a joint savings account whenever you open a checking one. Since it didn't cost anything or have a minimum balance requirement, I pretty much just put the savings account in the back of my mind, intending to use the checking instead. Not long after signing up in person, I received a pack of personalized deposit slips in the mail, which were meant for use with the savings account. I had not asked for these, so I figured they were just something the account came with standard.Unfortunately, I received an email the same week telling me my savings account was overdrawn $5.00, and had accrued a $34 NSF charge. I immediately called Huntington, told them about the email and explained I had never used the savings account. They looked it up and it was determined that I had somehow been charged for the slips, but they promised to take off the charge for them and the NSF. Three weeks later, it hadn't been taken care of. And because the checking account I opened was connected to the savings account, the bank decided to take money out of my checking, to cover the charges in my savings. I was totally flabbergasted by this, and could not believe they could do that without asking- they promised to remedy the issue, but of course, with banks, that can take ages. When I inquired about the legality of them taking from the checking to cover the savings, they told me that it was a “perk” for customers to keep them from over-drafting, and apparently it was in the fine print. It took another 4 weeks for the whole debacle to be fixed, and for me to recoup the money they took from my checking- this alone was a HUGE red flag, and what's worse, the bank manager and one of the other tellers there were incredibly rude and unprofessional. Every time I called to try to have the issue fixed, they promised to do it immediately, but when I would call back b/c they never did, they would backpedal and say that they would never tell me that it would be done immediately, b/c it's normally a 30 day thing. 30 days to fix THEIR mistake.I can't speak for any other branches- but the North Ridgeville one is TERRIBLE. They have one female teller who is incredibly nice, but she's not always there, so ultimately, I opened a checking and savings with another bank, and never looked back. I definitely would not recommend them, but if you do go with them, make sure you stay on top of your accounts, and I would strongly recommend not putting all your money in their accounts alone, let something like this happen again.… read more

                Huntington was my first bank and is still my only bank. I have both a checking and savings account with them. The only problem that I have really run into thus far is that they only let me transfer to and from my savings account 3 times a month. While this might not be a problem for a lot of you, for me it was pretty much a deal breaker. So they ended up forcefully converting my savings account into my checking account. They refused to let me have a savings account that I could transfer into and that really got on my nerves. So needless to say I now only have one checking account and it runs pretty smoothly. I have weekly deposits and can withdraw as many times as I please without any type of hidden fee.… read more

1Huntington Investment Company, a registered broker dealer, member FINRA/SIPC, and a registered investment adviser with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The Huntington Investment Company is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Huntington Bancshares Incorporated.


Trust and investment management services are provided by The Huntington National Bank, a national bank with fiduciary powers. The Huntington National Bank is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Huntington Bancshares Incorporated.

Investment, Insurance and Trust products are:
NOT A DEPOSIT • NOT FDIC INSURED • NOT GUARANTEED BY THE BANK • NOT INSURED BY ANY FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AGENCY • MAY LOSE VALUE
Business Continuity Plan
A plan is maintained by The Huntington Investment Company (HIC) to continue business throughout varying degrees of circumstances which in the absence the plan, would otherwise disrupt HIC’s ability to conduct business. In the plan, HIC has endeavored to consider and prepare for a broad range of scenarios of varying severity. Preparation includes the establishment of arrangements for alternative facilities, systems and staffing to strive to minimize the impact of any such event. Resumption of service is dependent on nature of the incident at hand.
For example, should there be an event that would prevent HIC from conducting business in its primary operational facility, the plans are designed to enable resumption of essential functions in a backup facility within the same business day. As to the matter of client’s ability to place trades, through re-direction of phone lines and client’s access to internet trading capabilities, our expectation is that so long as the securities markets remain open, trading would not be disrupted.
While there can be no guarantee to its effectiveness, HIC has a high level of confidence that through its careful planning and periodic testing, the firm’s preparation provides a reasonable strategy to effectively manage a business recovery operation. For more information, contact your HIC Investment Representative.

Certain market centers may execute orders at prices superior to the publicly quoted market in accordance with their rules or practices.

Unethical business practices, encouraging people to open checking accounts with total deposits of $1,000 in 60 days to get $150 cash bonus, That's fine, but not when the Store Manager is encouraging account holders to just deposit $100, take it out the next day, redeposit it again, etc. until they reach $1,000. What??? Training. Don't even get me started. For one thing, they don't disclose how much travel you'll be doing at the time of hire. They tell you there's "some" training and it's all close by. Really??? I had a "training" trip over 5 hours away, driving my vehicle and paying forward all of my expenses. Folks, this job is not rocket science, trust me. It's just a sales job. And we don't get paid enough to expense ourselves right out the gate. I had OVER $1,200 expensed OUT OF MY POCKET within 30 days. And the hours??? If you like open to close shifts, followed by another open shift, (which was also NOT disclosed,) then this is the job for you.Advice to ManagementBe fair and be transparent to potential hires.
