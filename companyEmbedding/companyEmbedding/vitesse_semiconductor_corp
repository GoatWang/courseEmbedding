Corporate history[edit]
Vitesse was founded by Al Joseph in 1984 as Vitesse Electronics Corporation. Its founders came out of Rockwell International and were funded with $30 Million from the Norton corporation. It later raised venture capital from Sequoia Capital and New Enterprise Associates. It changed its name to Vitesse Semiconductor in 1987. It became a public company in 1991. In 1999, it acquired XaQti and in 2000, acquired Sitera [2] and Orologic.[3]
Products[edit]
Vitesse was one of the early developers of gallium arsenide (GaAs) based integrated circuits. It now offers a line of Ethernet switching products consisting of Carrier Ethernet switch engines for customer-premises equipment, access network equipment, wireless base stations, mobile access equipment, fiber and microwave wireless backhaul equipment, and metro networking equipment; and Ethernet switches that enable desktop, workgroup, and LAN infrastructure. The company also provides Ethernet media access controllers that offer addressing and channel control mechanisms and are used in enterprise class modular Ethernet switch platforms, as well as in Ethernet-over-SONET/SDH and Ethernet-over-OTN systems used in access, metro, and long-haul carrier networking systems; Ethernet transceivers, including single, quad, and octal devices that allow the transmission of 10/100/1000 BASE-T data over category 5 copper cable and fiber optic cabling for use in personal computers, home electronics, and LAN applications; and Ethernet transceivers with packet timing and synchronization capabilities. In addition, it provides a line of connectivity products, which comprise mixed-signal physical media devices, physical layer devices, crosspoint switches, and signal integrity devices that are used for the connection of systems via optical fiber, copper cable, or backplanes. Further, Vitesse offers a range of transport processing products, such as framers, mappers, and switches, which support data rates up to 10 Gbit/s for SONET/SDH, EoS, and OTN applications. It markets and sells its products directly to OEMs and original design manufacturers, as well as through third-party electronic component distributors and manufacturing service providers.[4]
Securities fraud[edit]
In 2007 the company paid US$10.2 million to settle a class action lawsuit alleging securities fraud though options backdating, saying that the company failed to disclose and misrepresented some adverse facts.[5] Subsequently, in 2010, two of its former executives, founder Lou Tomasetta and the former executive vice president Eugene Hovanec were charged with securities fraud related to the backdating.[6] In December 2010, Vitesse finalized a settlement with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), over the SEC's investigations into the firm's historical stock options practices and accounting. Vitesse agreed to pay $3.0M to the SEC, which concluded the SEC's investigation of Vitesse.[7]
Turnaround[edit]
In June 2014, the Camarillo-based chip company announced a $23.2M stock offering, a planned sale of 7.5 million shares at $3.35 each, to be used for working capital and general corporate purposes.[8] This raise would be Vitesse's third in two years.
In June 2013, Vitesse closed a $18.7M offering at a price of $2.15 and gross proceeds of $40.2M.[9] The company previously netted $17.1M from an offering in December 2012.[10]
In the June 2014 offering, Vitesse's largest shareholder, Raging Capital Management LLC, purchased an additional 1.6 million shares. This raised Raging Capital's total position to 14.3 million shares, or approximately 25% of Vitesse's outstanding shares.[11]

The company also provides Ethernet media access controllers that offer addressing and channel control mechanisms and are used in enterprise class modular Ethernet switch platforms, as well as in Ethernet-over-SONET/SDH and Ethernet-over-OTN systems used in access, metro, and long-haul carrier networking systems; Ethernet transceivers, including single, quad, and octal devices that allow the transmission of 10/100/1000 BASE-T data over category 5 copper cable and fiber optic cabling for use in personal computers, home electronics, and LAN applications; and Ethernet transceivers with packet timing and synchronization capabilities. In addition, it provides a line of connectivity products, which comprise mixed-signal physical media devices, physical layer devices, crosspoint switches, and signal integrity devices that are used for the connection of systems via optical fiber, copper cable, or backplanes. Further, Vitesse offers a range of transport processing products, such as framers, mappers, and switches, which support data rates up to 10 Gbit/s for SONET/SDH, EoS, and OTN applications. It markets and sells its products directly to OEMs and original design manufacturers, as well as through third-party electronic component distributors and manufacturing service providers.[4]
Securities fraud[edit]
In 2007 the company paid US$10.2 million to settle a class action lawsuit alleging securities fraud though options backdating, saying that the company failed to disclose and misrepresented some adverse facts.[5] Subsequently, in 2010, two of its former executives, founder Lou Tomasetta and the former executive vice president Eugene Hovanec were charged with securities fraud related to the backdating.[6] In December 2010, Vitesse finalized a settlement with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), over the SEC's investigations into the firm's historical stock options practices and accounting. Vitesse agreed to pay $3.0M to the SEC, which concluded the SEC's investigation of Vitesse.[7]
Turnaround[edit]
In June 2014, the Camarillo-based chip company announced a $23.2M stock offering, a planned sale of 7.5 million shares at $3.35 each, to be used for working capital and general corporate purposes.[8] This raise would be Vitesse's third in two years.
In June 2013, Vitesse closed a $18.7M offering at a price of $2.15 and gross proceeds of $40.2M.[9] The company previously netted $17.1M from an offering in December 2012.[10]
In the June 2014 offering, Vitesse's largest shareholder, Raging Capital Management LLC, purchased an additional 1.6 million shares. This raised Raging Capital's total position to 14.3 million shares, or approximately 25% of Vitesse's outstanding shares.[11]

Corporate history[edit]
Vitesse was founded by Al Joseph in 1984 as Vitesse Electronics Corporation. Its founders came out of Rockwell International and were funded with $30 Million from the Norton corporation. It later raised venture capital from Sequoia Capital and New Enterprise Associates. It changed its name to Vitesse Semiconductor in 1987. It became a public company in 1991. In 1999, it acquired XaQti and in 2000, acquired Sitera [2] and Orologic.[3]
Products[edit]
Vitesse was one of the early developers of gallium arsenide (GaAs) based integrated circuits. It now offers a line of Ethernet switching products consisting of Carrier Ethernet switch engines for customer-premises equipment, access network equipment, wireless base stations, mobile access equipment, fiber and microwave wireless backhaul equipment, and metro networking equipment; and Ethernet switches that enable desktop, workgroup, and LAN infrastructure. The company also provides Ethernet media access controllers that offer addressing and channel control mechanisms and are used in enterprise class modular Ethernet switch platforms, as well as in Ethernet-over-SONET/SDH and Ethernet-over-OTN systems used in access, metro, and long-haul carrier networking systems; Ethernet transceivers, including single, quad, and octal devices that allow the transmission of 10/100/1000 BASE-T data over category 5 copper cable and fiber optic cabling for use in personal computers, home electronics, and LAN applications; and Ethernet transceivers with packet timing and synchronization capabilities.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

                    Ex-Executives of Vitesse Are Charged With Fraud                
The founder and former chief executive of the chip maker and another former top executive were charged in a scheme to deceive auditors.











                    Stock Option Subpoenas Issued                
Caremark Rx, Affiliated Computer Services, Vitesse Semiconductor and SafeNet received federal subpoenas requesting information on their granting of stock options.

                    Technology Briefing | Hardware: Vitesse To Buy Cicada For $66 Million                
The Vitesse Semiconductor Corporation, a maker of chips used in telecommunications gear, agreed yesterday to buy closely held Cicada Semiconductor for about $66 million to add products used for high-speed data transmission. Cicada's products will increase 2004 revenue by about $10 million, said Vitesse, based in Camarillo, Calif. Cicada will trim its work force to about 40 employees, Vitesse said, without elaborating. Businesses are increasing the speed of their data networks with gigabit Ethernet gear, which is made by Cicada and others. Vitesse is expanding in that market by adding Cicada's gigabit transceivers, helping it compete with larger rivals. A call to Vitesse's office seeking comment was not returned. A call to Roger Taylor, a spokesman for Cicada, was not immediately returned. For more than a year, Vitesse and Cicada, based in Austin, Tex., have jointly sold gigabit switching products consisting of Vitesse switches and Cicada transceivers. The acquisition, expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2004, will double Vitesse's revenue in the market for switches used in local-area networks, Vitesse said.











                    Technology Briefing | Hardware: Vitesse Chief Is Buying Shares                
Louis Tomasetta, the chief executive of the Vitesse Semiconductor Corporation, which makes chips for fiber optic networking equipment, has started buying shares in the company as they trade below the price of their initial public offering. Mr. Tomasetta has bought 200,000 shares since mid-August, some for as little as $1.18, according to the Securities and Exchange Commission. In December 1991, Vitesse sold its shares through a public offering for $1.50 each. At that time, Vitesse had quarterly revenue of about $10 million; it now has about $40 million of revenue each quarter. But revenue has fallen recently because of reduced capital spending among telephone companies. Last year, Mr. Tomasetta made about $14 million by selling the company's stock, the S.E.C. said.











                    Technology Briefing | Hardware: Vitesse Posts 4th-Quarter Loss                
The Vitesse Semiconductor Corporation, which makes chips for fiber optic networking equipment, said yesterday that it had a fiscal fourth-quarter loss, compared with a profit a year earlier, as sales plunged 73 percent. The loss was $59.2 million, or 30 cents a share, compared with net income of $11.6 million, or 6 cents a share, a year earlier, Vitesse said. Revenue in the quarter ended Sept. 30 dropped to $37.2 million from $138 million. Sales in the first quarter will be $36 million to $40 million, Lou Tomasetta, the chief executive, said during a conference call. Sales at Vitesse and its rivals, including PMC-Sierra and Applied Micro Circuits, plummeted last quarter as much as they boomed in 2000. Telecommunications companies reduced spending on equipment that used the semiconductor makers' products, leaving a glut of chips in inventory. Vitesse shares rose 66 cents yesterday, to $9.56, and were little changed in after-hours trading after the report. They declined 88 percent in the last year.

                    VITESSE LOSS WILL BE WIDER THAN PREVIOUSLY REPORTED                
The Vitesse Semiconductor Corporation, a maker of chips for fiber optic networking gear, said its fiscal fourth-quarter loss would be wider than previously forecast. It was the third straight quarter that Vitesse has lowered its targets before the period ended. Customers of Vitesse, which is based in Camarillo, Calif., are ordering fewer chips because of an inventory glut and lower spending by telephone and Internet-service companies. Sales will be $37 million to $40 million, compared with a previous forecast of $50 million, the company said. In the year-earlier period, Vitesse reported net income of $11.6 million, or 6 cents a share, on revenue of $138 million.

                    Technology Briefing | Hardware: Vitesse To Buy Cicada For $66 Million                
The Vitesse Semiconductor Corporation, a maker of chips used in telecommunications gear, agreed yesterday to buy closely held Cicada Semiconductor for about $66 million to add products used for high-speed data transmission. Cicada's products will increase 2004 revenue by about $10 million, said Vitesse, based in Camarillo, Calif. Cicada will trim its work force to about 40 employees, Vitesse said, without elaborating. Businesses are increasing the speed of their data networks with gigabit Ethernet gear, which is made by Cicada and others. Vitesse is expanding in that market by adding Cicada's gigabit transceivers, helping it compete with larger rivals. A call to Vitesse's office seeking comment was not returned. A call to Roger Taylor, a spokesman for Cicada, was not immediately returned. For more than a year, Vitesse and Cicada, based in Austin, Tex., have jointly sold gigabit switching products consisting of Vitesse switches and Cicada transceivers. The acquisition, expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2004, will double Vitesse's revenue in the market for switches used in local-area networks, Vitesse said.

Corporate history[edit]
Vitesse was founded by Al Joseph in 1984 as Vitesse Electronics Corporation. Its founders came out of Rockwell International and were funded with $30 Million from the Norton corporation. It later raised venture capital from Sequoia Capital and New Enterprise Associates. It changed its name to Vitesse Semiconductor in 1987. It became a public company in 1991. In 1999, it acquired XaQti and in 2000, acquired Sitera [2] and Orologic.[3]
Products[edit]
Vitesse was one of the early developers of gallium arsenide (GaAs) based integrated circuits. It now offers a line of Ethernet switching products consisting of Carrier Ethernet switch engines for customer-premises equipment, access network equipment, wireless base stations, mobile access equipment, fiber and microwave wireless backhaul equipment, and metro networking equipment; and Ethernet switches that enable desktop, workgroup, and LAN infrastructure. The company also provides Ethernet media access controllers that offer addressing and channel control mechanisms and are used in enterprise class modular Ethernet switch platforms, as well as in Ethernet-over-SONET/SDH and Ethernet-over-OTN systems used in access, metro, and long-haul carrier networking systems; Ethernet transceivers, including single, quad, and octal devices that allow the transmission of 10/100/1000 BASE-T data over category 5 copper cable and fiber optic cabling for use in personal computers, home electronics, and LAN applications; and Ethernet transceivers with packet timing and synchronization capabilities. In addition, it provides a line of connectivity products, which comprise mixed-signal physical media devices, physical layer devices, crosspoint switches, and signal integrity devices that are used for the connection of systems via optical fiber, copper cable, or backplanes. Further, Vitesse offers a range of transport processing products, such as framers, mappers, and switches, which support data rates up to 10 Gbit/s for SONET/SDH, EoS, and OTN applications. It markets and sells its products directly to OEMs and original design manufacturers, as well as through third-party electronic component distributors and manufacturing service providers.[4]
Securities fraud[edit]
In 2007 the company paid US$10.2 million to settle a class action lawsuit alleging securities fraud though options backdating, saying that the company failed to disclose and misrepresented some adverse facts.[5] Subsequently, in 2010, two of its former executives, founder Lou Tomasetta and the former executive vice president Eugene Hovanec were charged with securities fraud related to the backdating.[6] In December 2010, Vitesse finalized a settlement with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), over the SEC's investigations into the firm's historical stock options practices and accounting. Vitesse agreed to pay $3.0M to the SEC, which concluded the SEC's investigation of Vitesse.[7]
Turnaround[edit]
In June 2014, the Camarillo-based chip company announced a $23.2M stock offering, a planned sale of 7.5 million shares at $3.35 each, to be used for working capital and general corporate purposes.[8] This raise would be Vitesse's third in two years.
In June 2013, Vitesse closed a $18.7M offering at a price of $2.15 and gross proceeds of $40.2M.[9] The company previously netted $17.1M from an offering in December 2012.[10]
In the June 2014 offering, Vitesse's largest shareholder, Raging Capital Management LLC, purchased an additional 1.6 million shares. This raised Raging Capital's total position to 14.3 million shares, or approximately 25% of Vitesse's outstanding shares.[11]

Why Shares of Vitesse Semiconductor Corp. Are On Fire Today
What investors need to know about the acquisition of Vitesse.











                Timothy Green
            

                (TMFBargainBin)



            
            Mar 18, 2015 at 12:59PM
            
            





Although we don't believe in timing the market or panicking over market movements, we do like to keep an eye on big changes -- just in case they're material to our investing thesis.
What: Shares of Vitesse Semiconductor (NASDAQ:VTSS), a supplier of integrated circuits used in networking applications, surged on Wednesday after it was announced that Microsemi (NASDAQ:MSCC) was acquiring the company. The stock was up 36% by noon, equal to the premium paid my Microsemi.
So what: Microsemi will pay $5.28 per share, or $389 million total, to acquire Vitesse. The combination will create immediate EPS accretion and synergies, according to the press release announcing the acquisition. While Microsemi is profitable on a GAAP basis, Vitesse has been unprofitable in almost every year in the past decade.
Microsemi CEO James J. Peterson had this to say about the deal: "This acquisition is further evidence of Microsemi's continuing commitment to grow as a communications semiconductor company. Vitesse's highly complementary technology suite will expand our product offering and accelerate growth with differentiated technology in emerging markets, while benefiting from the increased scale, consolidated infrastructure and cost savings of the combined entity."
Now what: The deal is expected to close during the second quarter, and Microsemi expects it to contribute an additional $0.16-$0.20 in per-share earnings by the first full year after close. Microsemi has been extremely acquisitive in recent years, spending a total of nearly $1.5 billion in the past five years on acquisitions, excluding the Vitesse deal. Microsemi stock was up just slightly on Wednesday.





Consolidation of smaller companies is inevitable in the semiconductor business, but investors should be aware that the promised synergies related to acquisitions often aren't realized. Despite all of Microsemi's acquisitions in the past few years, the company's earnings have been declining, and it's very possible that the Vitesse deal will produce similar results.

Microsemi Corporation to Acquire Vitesse Semiconductor Corporation
 


 
























 




 





 


ALISO VIEJO, Calif. and CAMARILLO, Calif., March 18, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Microsemi Corporation (Nasdaq:   MSCC), a leading provider of semiconductor solutions differentiated by power, security, reliability and performance, and Vitesse Semiconductor Corporation (Nasdaq:   VTSS), jointly announced today that Microsemi has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Vitesse for $5.28 per share through a cash tender offer, representing a premium of 32 percent based on the average closing price of Vitesse's shares of common stock during the 30 trading days ended March 17, 2015. The board of directors of Vitesse unanimously recommends that Vitesse's stockholders tender their shares in the tender offer. The total transaction value is approximately $389 million.
Headquartered in Camarillo, California, Vitesse designs a diverse portfolio of high-performance semiconductors, application software, and integrated turnkey systems solutions for carrier, enterprise and Internet of Things (IoT) networks worldwide. Vitesse's products enable the fastest-growing network infrastructure markets including mobile access/IP edge, enterprise cloud access, and industrial-IoT networking.
"This acquisition is further evidence of Microsemi's continuing commitment to grow as a communications semiconductor company," stated James J. Peterson, Microsemi chairman and CEO. "Vitesse's highly complementary technology suite will expand our product offering and accelerate growth with differentiated technology in emerging markets, while benefitting from the increased scale, consolidated infrastructure and cost savings of the combined entity."
"The proposed acquisition of Vitesse by Microsemi will create a powerful combination," said Chris Gardner, Vitesse's chief executive officer. "I believe Microsemi will be able to leverage Vitesse's Ethernet technology and capabilities further into the communications market and has the scale to implement the adoption of our industrial IoT strategy."
Microsemi expects significant synergies from this transaction and expects to see immediate accretion in the first full quarter of completion. Based on current assumptions, Microsemi expects the acquisition to be $0.16 to $0.20 per share accretive in its first full fiscal year ending September 30, 2016.
As of this date, Microsemi remains comfortable with its Jan. 22, 2015 non-GAAP guidance for its second fiscal quarter of 2015, ending March 29, 2015. Microsemi currently intends to announce its second fiscal quarter results on April 23, 2015. Further details will be forthcoming.
Tender Offer and Closing
Under the terms of the definitive acquisition agreement, Microsemi will commence a cash tender offer to acquire Vitesse's outstanding shares of common stock at $5.28 per share, net to each holder in cash. Upon satisfaction of the conditions to the tender offer and after such time as all shares tendered in the tender offer are accepted for payment, the agreement provides for the parties to effect, as promptly as practicable, a merger which would result in all shares not tendered in the tender offer being converted into the right to receive $5.28 per share in cash. The tender offer is subject to customary conditions, including the tender of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of Vitesse's common stock on a modified fully diluted basis and certain regulatory approvals, including the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act, and is expected to close in Microsemi's fiscal third quarter, ending June 28, 2015. No approval of the stockholders of Microsemi is required in connection with the proposed transaction. Terms of the agreement were unanimously approved by the boards of directors of both Microsemi and Vitesse. Microsemi has received support agreements from Vitesse stockholders holding approximately 22 percent of Vitesse's outstanding common shares. Under the terms of the support agreements, these stockholders have agreed to tender their shares in the tender offer.
Under the terms of the merger agreement, Vitesse may solicit superior proposals from third parties for a "go shop" period of 21 calendar days continuing through April 7, 2015. It is not anticipated that any developments will be disclosed with regard to this process unless and until Vitesse's board of directors makes a decision to pursue a potential superior proposal. Deutsche Bank will assist Vitesse with its go shop process. There are no guarantees that this process will result in a superior proposal. The merger agreement provides Microsemi with a customary right to match a superior proposal. The agreement also provides for certain break-up fees payable to Microsemi in connection with the termination of the agreement in certain circumstances.
BofA Merrill Lynch is providing customary committed debt financing for the acquisition.  BofA Merrill Lynch and RBC Capital Markets acted as financial advisors, and O'Melveny & Myers LLP is acting as legal adviser to Microsemi. Deutsche Bank and Needham & Company are acting as financial advisors and Stubbs Alderton & Markiles, LLP is acting as legal advisor to Vitesse. 
Webcast
Microsemi is hosting an analyst day today in New York, and will briefly address details of the transaction at that event. A live webcast and the accompanying presentation relating to the transaction will be available in the "Investors" section of Microsemi's website at www.microsemi.com.
Webcast date: March 18, 2015
Time: 9-11:30 a.m. EDT

Microsemi Safe Harbor Statement
"Safe Harbor" Statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995: This release contains forward-looking statements based on current expectations or beliefs, as well as a number of assumptions about future events, and these statements are subject to factors and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. The reader is cautioned not to put undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which are not a guarantee of future performance and are subject to a number of uncertainties and other factors, many of which are outside the control of Microsemi and Vitesse. The forward-looking statements in this release address a variety of subjects including, for example, the expected date of closing of the acquisition, the potential benefits of the merger, including the potentially accretive and synergistic benefits, Microsemi's revenue and earnings guidance, and any other statements of belief or about the Microsemi's plans, beliefs or expectations. The following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in these forward-looking statements: the risk that Vitesse's business will not be successfully integrated with Microsemi's business or complement its products, including product mix and acceptance, gross margins and operational and other cost synergies; costs associated with the merger, tender offer and financing; the unsuccessful completion of the tender offer; matters arising in connection with the parties' efforts to comply with and satisfy applicable regulatory approvals and closing conditions relating to the transaction; increased competition and technological changes in the industries in which Microsemi and Vitesse compete; Microsemi's reliance on government contracts for a portion of its sales, including impacts of any federal government shutdown; Microsemi's failure to continue to move up the value chain in its customer offerings; negative or worsening worldwide economic conditions or market instability; downturns in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry; intense competition in the semiconductor industry and resultant downward price pressure; inability to develop new technologies and products to satisfy changes in customer demand or the development by the company's competitors of products that decrease the demand for Microsemi's products; unfavorable or declining conditions in end markets; inability of Microsemi's compound semiconductor products to compete successfully with silicon-based products; production delays related to new compound semiconductors; variability of the company's manufacturing yields; the concentration of the factories that service the semiconductor industry; delays in beginning production, implementing production techniques, resolving problems associated with technical equipment malfunctions, or issues related to government or customer qualification of facilities; potential effects of system outages; the effect of events such as natural disasters and related disruptions on our operations; inability by Microsemi to fulfill customer demand and resulting loss of customers; variations in customer order preferences; difficulties foreseeing future demand; rises in inventory levels and inventory obsolescence; potential non-realization of expected orders or non-realization of backlog; failure to make sales indicated by the company's book-to-bill ratio; risks related to the company's international operations and sales, including availability of transportation services, political instability and currency fluctuations; increases in the costs of credit and the availability of credit or additional capital only under more restrictive conditions or not at all; unanticipated changes in Microsemi's tax provisions, results of tax examinations or exposure to additional income tax liabilities; changes in generally accepted accounting principles; principal, liquidity and counterparty risks related to Microsemi's holdings in securities; environmental or other regulatory matters or litigation, or any matters involving contingent liabilities or other claims; the uncertainty of litigation, the costs and expenses of litigation, the potential material adverse effect litigation could have on Microsemi's business and results of operations if an adverse determination in litigation is made, and the time and attention required of management to attend to litigation; uncertainty as to the future profitability of acquired businesses, and delays in the realization of, or the failure to realize, any accretion from acquisition transactions; any circumstances that adversely impact the end markets of acquired businesses; and difficulties in closing or disposing of operations or assets or transferring work, assets or inventory from one plant to another. In addition to these factors and any other factors mentioned elsewhere in this news release, the reader should refer as well to the factors, uncertainties or risks identified in the company's most recent Form 10-K and all subsequent Form 10-Q reports filed by Microsemi with the SEC. Additional risk factors may be identified from time to time in Microsemi's future filings. The forward-looking statements included in this release speak only as of the date hereof, and Microsemi does not undertake any obligation to update these forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Guidance is provided only on a non-GAAP basis due to the inherent difficulty of forecasting the timing or amount of certain items that have been excluded from the forward-looking non-GAAP measures, and a reconciliation to the comparable GAAP guidance has not been provided because certain factors that are materially significant to Microsemi's ability to estimate the excluded items are not accessible or estimable on a forward-looking basis. 
Vitesse Safe Harbor Statement
Certain statements either contained in or incorporated by reference into this press release, other than purely historical information, including estimates, projections and statements relating to Vitesse's business plans and objectives, and the assumptions upon which those statements are based, are "forward-looking statements." These forward-looking statements generally include statements that are predictive in nature and depend upon or refer to future events or conditions, and include words such as "believes," "plans," "anticipates," "projects," "estimates," "expects," "intends," "strategy," "future," "opportunity," "may," "will," "should," "could," "potential," or similar expressions. Such forward-looking statements include the ability of Vitesse and Microsemi to complete the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the parties' ability to satisfy the conditions to the consummation of the tender offer and the other conditions set forth in the merger agreement and the possibility of any termination of the merger agreement. The forward-looking statements contained in this release are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties which may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from current expectations because of risks associated with uncertainties as to the timing of the tender offer and the subsequent merger; uncertainties as to how many of Vitesse's stockholders will tender their shares in the tender offer; the risk that competing offers or acquisition proposals will be made; the possibility that various conditions to the consummation of the tender offer or the merger may not be satisfied or waived, including that a governmental entity may prohibit, delay or refuse to grant approval for the consummation of the tender offer or the merger; the effects of disruption from the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement on Vitesse's business and the fact that the announcement and pendency of the transactions may make it more difficult to establish or maintain relationships with employees, suppliers and other business partners; the risk that stockholder litigation in connection with the tender offer or the merger may result in significant costs of defense, indemnification and liability; other uncertainties pertaining to the business of Vitesse, including those set forth in Vitesse's filings with the SEC, especially in "Item 1A. Risk Factors" of Vitesse's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2014 filed with the SEC on December 4, 2014 and in other periodic reports and filings with the SEC from time to time, including Vitesse's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. The reader is cautioned not to unduly rely on these forward-looking statements. Vitesse expressly disclaims any intent or obligation to update or revise publicly these forward-looking statements except as required by law.
Notice to Investors 
The tender offer for the outstanding shares of common stock of Vitesse has not yet commenced. This press release is for informational purposes only and no statement in this press release is an offer to purchase or a solicitation of an offer to sell securities. At the time the tender offer is commenced, Microsemi Corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Microsemi Corporation will file a tender offer statement on Schedule TO with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and Vitesse will file a solicitation/recommendation statement on Schedule 14D-9 with respect to the tender offer. The tender offer statement (including an offer to purchase, a related letter of transmittal and other offer documents) and the solicitation/recommendation statement will contain important information that should be read carefully before any decision is made with respect to the tender offer. Such materials will be made available to Vitesse's stockholders at no expense to them. In addition, such materials (and all other offer documents filed with the SEC) will be available at no charge on the SEC's Web site: www.sec.gov.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
