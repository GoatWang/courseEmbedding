Clovis Oncology stock surges 50% on positive late-stage cancer trial results
Clovis Oncology Inc.  shares surged 50% in premarket trade Monday after the company said its late-stage trial for a cancer drug met its primary endpoint and a key secondary endpoint. Clovis said it plans to try for Food and Drug Administration approval for the drug, rucaparib, within the next four months for second line and later maintenance treatment for women with platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer who have responded to their most recent platinum therapy. Leerink analyst Michael Schmidt described the latest results as "bull case plays out." "The outcome looks to be the best-case-scenario for CLVS," he said, adding "the results look particularly impressive when compared to previous competitor data," including companies like Tesaro  and AstraZeneca , which are also developing a class of cancer drugs called PARP inhibitors. "If approved, Rubraca would have the broadest label of any PARP inhibitor in ovarian cancer... which we think should bode well for the commercial uptake of the drug," Schmidt said, calling the company a prime takeout candidate. In three sub-groups of women with ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer, patients on rucaparib had improved progression-free survival, the phase 3 trial's primary endpoint. Progression-free survival was also improved in patient on the drug as compared with placebo, a key secondary endpoint, Clovis Oncology said. The trial enrolled 564 women. Clovis Oncology shares have dropped 15.9% to $59.97 over the last three months, compared with a 2.3% rise in the S&P 500 .

Drug maker Tesaro looks for buyer: WSJ
Drug maker Tesaro Inc.  is exploring a sale, The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday, citing people familiar with the matter.

Gilead Could Acquire This Biotech — But Vertex Is Still Better: Analyst
Gilead Sciences (GILD) could fill a hole in its portfolio by acquiring Incyte (INCY), an analyst suggested Friday, offering one caveat — Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) would still be a less risky bet. Though Gilead could make a play now for Incyte — to the tune of a 30%-40% premium on its stock price — the No. 3 biotech would largely be betting on the commercial success of Incyte's immuno-oncology drug, epacadostat. Meanwhile, it's dealing with a

A key hepatitis C drug from Gilead Sciences (GILD) could top Wall Street's expectations, but investors will be tuning into the company's second-quarter report on July 26 for more hints on potential M&A activity, an analyst said Friday. Gilead's hepatitis C sales slipped in 2016 and, in the months following, the No. 3 biotech said it could be open to a deal, especially in oncology.

Are Gilead's Fortunes About To Change — Without An Acquisition?
Gilead Sciences' (GILD) fortunes are likely to change this summer on the expected approval of a key hepatitis C drug regimen and after the No. 3 biotech unveils Phase 3 data from an HIV trial, an analyst said Friday. Year to date, Gilead stock is down 3% as of Thursday's close. Shares declined as much as 10.5% to the year's low of 64.12 on June 16, but have since recovered somewhat amid a biotech rally that saw the sector rise collectively to a

The No. 3 biotech by market cap has shown interest in making an oncology-centric buy as it struggles with declining hepatitis C drug sales.

Clovis Oncology stock surges 50% on positive late-stage cancer trial results
Clovis Oncology Inc.  shares surged 50% in premarket trade Monday after the company said its late-stage trial for a cancer drug met its primary endpoint and a key secondary endpoint. Clovis said it plans to try for Food and Drug Administration approval for the drug, rucaparib, within the next four months for second line and later maintenance treatment for women with platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer who have responded to their most recent platinum therapy. Leerink analyst Michael Schmidt described the latest results as "bull case plays out." "The outcome looks to be the best-case-scenario for CLVS," he said, adding "the results look particularly impressive when compared to previous competitor data," including companies like Tesaro  and AstraZeneca , which are also developing a class of cancer drugs called PARP inhibitors. "If approved, Rubraca would have the broadest label of any PARP inhibitor in ovarian cancer... which we think should bode well for the commercial uptake of the drug," Schmidt said, calling the company a prime takeout candidate. In three sub-groups of women with ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer, patients on rucaparib had improved progression-free survival, the phase 3 trial's primary endpoint. Progression-free survival was also improved in patient on the drug as compared with placebo, a key secondary endpoint, Clovis Oncology said. The trial enrolled 564 women. Clovis Oncology shares have dropped 15.9% to $59.97 over the last three months, compared with a 2.3% rise in the S&P 500 .

Gilead Could Acquire This Biotech — But Vertex Is Still Better: Analyst
Gilead Sciences (GILD) could fill a hole in its portfolio by acquiring Incyte (INCY), an analyst suggested Friday, offering one caveat — Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) would still be a less risky bet. Though Gilead could make a play now for Incyte — to the tune of a 30%-40% premium on its stock price — the No. 3 biotech would largely be betting on the commercial success of Incyte's immuno-oncology drug, epacadostat.

A key hepatitis C drug from Gilead Sciences (GILD) could top Wall Street's expectations, but investors will be tuning into the company's second-quarter report on July 26 for more hints on potential M&A activity, an analyst said Friday. Gilead's hepatitis C sales slipped in 2016 and, in the months following, the No. 3 biotech said it could be open to a deal, especially in oncology.
