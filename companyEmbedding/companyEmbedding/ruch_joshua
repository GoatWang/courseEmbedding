I Puritani

Posted: 03/03/17 by Joshua Ruch | Category: Opera |
1 Comment » 


Saw “I Puritani” last night. Old tired production, but Diana Damrau and Javier Camarena and Bellini’s music made it one of the more exciting visits to the Met Opera in a long time. Only one more opportunity to see them …Read More




Bethlehem

We recently revisited the 2013 Israeli movie “Bethlehem,” which is available for streaming on Netflix. The story, which at a high level centers on the cat and mouse game played between Palestinian terrorists and the Israeli Secret Service seeking to …Read More




Sense and Sensibility

The Old Friends

Terrific ensemble acting, and it is a  large ensemble.  Hallie Foote is especially good, and there is the additional bonus of her being the playwright’s ( Horton Foote’s) daughter. There is not enough meat on the bone to make this …Read More




Winston’s War

By Michael Dobbs. If  you are a WWII/Winston Churchill junkie as I am, and you also like spy novels, you’ll have a ball with this one. The story is told against the backdrop of a Britain struggling with appeasement in …Read More
