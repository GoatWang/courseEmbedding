Overview+



What is an annuity? 
An annuity is an insurance product that pays you periodic income payments in exchange for your premium payment. It can be used as part of your overall retirement strategy. Depending on the type of annuity, it may help you grow your retirement savings, protect your savings from loss, and offer death benefits to protect your beneficiaries. 




How to choose an annuity
Make your choice based on how your needs match up to the features of the annuity. Do you need to grow your retirement savings or are you concerned with losing principal? Or both? Do you need income that starts now or in the future? Do you want to leave a legacy to your heirs? These are some of the questions to ask yourself to determine which annuity might work for you. 




Why Voya?
Voya Financial is ready to help Americans build a secure financial future—one person, one family, one institution at a time. We are ready to make a difference—to deliver financial solutions to help all Americans become retirement ready.

1 P E R F O R M A N C E U P D A T E Voya Retirement Insurance and Annuity Company INDEPENDENT S D B PLAN Variable Annuity Account C, Non-Standardized Returns Average Annual Total Returns as of: 09/30/2015 (shown in percentages) Variable annuities are long-term investment vehicles designed for retirement purposes which allow you to allocate contributions among variable investment options that have the potential to grow tax-deferred, or in the case of Roth contributions, tax free, with an option to receive a stream of income at a later date. Early withdrawals may be subject to surrender charges, and if taken prior to age 59 1/2, a 10% IRS penalty may apply. Taxes are due upon withdrawal of tax-deferred assets; withdrawals will also reduce the applicable death benefit and cash surrender value/account value. The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. For monthend performance which may be lower or higher than the performance data shown please call Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that, when sold, an investment may be worth more or less than the original cost. These numbers reflect total Separate Account charges of 0.75% on an annual basis. They also assume reinvestment of all dividends (ordinary income and capital gains) and are net of management fees and other fund operating expenses. Depending upon the type of contract in which you participate, you have either received prospectuses and/or prospectus summaries for the separate account and the funds. You should consider the investment objectives, risks and charges, and expenses of the variable product and its underlying fund options carefully before investing. The prospectus contains this and other information. Anyone who wishes to obtain a free copy of the separate account and/or fund prospectuses may call their Voya representative or the number above. Please read the prospectus or prospectus summaries carefully before investing. Returns less than one year are not annualized. Fund is the date of inception for the underlying fund, and is the date used in calculating the periodic returns. The fund inception date indicates the inception date of the underlying investment portfolio, which may precede the portfolio's inclusion in the product. Stability of Principal Fund Money Market Voya Money Market Portfolio - Class I (2) /01/1980 The 7-day annualized Subaccount yield as of 09/30/2015 is -0.75%, which more closely reflects current earnings.

Foreign investing involves special risks such as currency fluctuation and public disclosure, as well as economic and political risks. Some of the Funds invest in securities guaranteed by the U.S. Government as to the timely payment of principal and interest; however, shares of the Funds are not insured nor guaranteed. High yielding fixed-income securities generally are subject to greater market fluctuations and risks of loss of income and principal than are investments in lower yielding fixed-income securities. Sector funds may involve greater-than average risk and are often more volatile than funds holding a diversified portfolio of stocks in many industries. Examples include: banking, biotechnology, chemicals, energy, environmental services, natural resources, precious metals, technology, telecommunications, and utilities.

Foreign investing involves special risks such as currency fluctuation and public disclosure, as well as economic and political risks. Some of the Funds invest in securities guaranteed by the U.S. Government as to the timely payment of principal and interest; however, shares of the Funds are not insured nor guaranteed. High yielding fixed-income securities generally are subject to greater market fluctuations and risks of loss of income and principal than are investments in lower yielding fixed-income securities. Page 5 of 76 Sector funds may involve greater-than average risk and are often more volatile than funds holding a diversified portfolio of stocks in many industries. Examples include: banking, biotechnology, chemicals, energy, environmental services, natural resources, precious metals, technology, telecommunications, and utilities. Additional Notes Not all investment options are available under all contracts, plans or jurisdictions. (1)The CURRENT rate for the Voya Fixed Plus Account II Large Case is 3.00%, expressed as an annual effective yield, and is guaranteed not to drop below 3.00% through 12/31/2015. The annual rate of interest applied to your account may be higher or lower than the current rate. Restrictions may apply to transfers of funds from the Fixed Account to other contract investment options. Please refer to your product prospectus / disclosure booklet and call your 800 number for more information. (2)An investment in the Fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Although the Fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it is possible to lose money by investing in the Fund. (3)There is no guarantee that any investment option will achieve its stated objective. Principal value fluctuates and there is no guarantee of value at any time, including the target date. The "target date" is the approximate date when you plan to start withdrawing your money. When your target date is reached, you may have more or less than the original amount invested. For each target date Portfolio, until the day prior to its Target, the Portfolio will seek to provide total returns consistent with an asset allocation targeted for an investor who is retiring in approximately each Portfolio's designation Target Year. Prior to choosing a Target Portfolio, investors are strongly encouraged to review and understand the Portfolio's objectives and its composition of stocks and bonds, and how the asset allocation will change over time as the target date nears. No two investors are alike and one should not assume that just because they intend to retire in the year corresponding to the Target that that specific Portfolio is appropriate and suitable to their risk tolerance. It is recommended that an investor consider carefully the possibility of capital loss in each of the target date Portfolios, the likelihood and magnitude of which will be dependent upon the Portfolio's asset allocation. On the Target, the portfolio will seek to provide a combination of total return and stability of principal. Stocks are more volatile than bonds, and portfolios with a higher concentration of stocks are more likely to experience greater fluctuations in value than portfolios with a higher concentration in bonds. Foreign stocks and small and midcap stocks may be more volatile than large cap stocks. Investing in bonds also entails credit risk and interest rate risk. Generally investors with longer timeframes can consider assuming more risk in their investment portfolio. The Voya Solution PortfoliosSM are actively managed and the asset allocation adjusted over time. The portfolios may merge with or change to other portfolios over time. Refer to the prospectus for more information about the specific risks of investing in the various asset classes included in the Voya Solution Portfolios.

As a component of benefits offered to employees, 401k plans are a very popular way to accumulate tax-deferred income and earnings for retirement. 
Employers offer 401k plans as a way to help their employees save for retirement. You choose how much pre-tax income you wish to contribute and that amount is automatically deducted from your paycheck and placed into your account within the 401k plan. Your retirement savings can continue to grow tax-deferred until you make a withdrawal. You do not pay taxes on your salary deferrals or earnings until you take a withdrawal from the plan. Generally, if you take the distribution after age 59½ there is no tax penalty.  
One difference from an IRA is that 401k plans permit higher contribution limits and are only available through your employer.     




Key Features

Because your employer sponsors the 401k plan, there may be other valuable benefits offered in addition to salary deferrals. Check your plan carefully. The following are key features provide a brief overview to assist you:

Optional Participation: Although some plan sponsors automatically enroll employees to promote plan participations, 401k plan participation is still optional. Check with your employer to determine how you can enroll. 
Contribution Rate: You can choose the amount you want to contribute each payroll up to established IRS limits. You will also be permitted to change your contribution rate once you are in the plan.
Your 401k plan contribution comes out of your paycheck on a pre-tax basis which lowers your taxable income for that pay period. (That’s a good thing!) 
Available Investments: You can choose from a variety of investment choices selected by your employer.
Deferred Taxes: Not only do your pre-tax contributions help lower your taxable income each pay period, but all earnings on your contributions grow tax deferred. Note: Some plans offer a Roth 401k, which permit savings on an after tax basis.  
You will not be taxed on either the contributions or earnings until you make a withdrawal. 
Optional Employer Match: To provide an extra boost to retirement savings, many employers match a percentage of an employee’s contribution which will be given to the employee once she is vested. 
Accessing Funds During Employment: Loans—As an optional feature your employer may permit you to borrow against your plan account up to specified IRS limits. Hardship Withdrawals—Understanding that certain hardships arise, the IRS permits plans to allow distributions for certain hardship reasons. 
Portability: If you leave your job, you can remain in the plan or rollover your 401k funds into an IRA or another 401k.
Support: Your 401k plan provider typically offers many free tools and resources to help you establish savings goals, measure your progress, and to see how financially close you are to meeting your retirement goals.
The 457 and 403b plans are similar to 401k plans, but are typically offered by other types of organizations. The 457 plan is offered to employees of state and local governments. The 403b plan is offered only to the employees of public schools and qualified tax-exempt organizations such as higher-education, churches, tax-exempt hospitals, and charities.
Roth accounts: May also be offered by a plan sponsor under 401k, 403b, or governmental 457b plans. Roth contributions are made after you’ve paid taxes on the income, but qualified distributions may be taken tax-free in retirement.1  



Suitable For




The 401k is a key financial tool for almost anyone trying to save as much as possible for their retirement.  








Eligibility
 



You must be employed by a plan sponsor offering a 401k plan to participate. 
If you leave employment, you will no longer be able to contribute to the plan. 
Some employers will let you keep your savings in their plan after you leave. 
You can always combine all of your old plans into one rollover IRA or in most cases, into the 401k plan offered by your new employer.
Contributions are deducted from your paycheck up to certain IRS-defined annual limits. Contributions can be designated as a specific dollar amount or percentage of your pay. The contributions are taken before taxes, lowering your current income tax bill. You will owe income taxes when you make a withdrawal from the plan. Withdrawals prior to age 59½ are also subject to a 10% IRS early withdrawal penalty, unless an IRS exception applies.

Overview+



What is life insurance? 
Life insurance can provide financial protection for your loved ones when you pass away and be an important part of your overall financial strategy. The Voya Life Companies offer all types of customizable policies with tax benefits to help you protect your financial future, provide for your loved ones and possibly even add to your retirement income. 
Why have life insurance 




How to choose
The kind of life insurance you may want depends on where you are in life, how long you want the coverage, and whether you want to use life insurance to help build money (called cash value) inside of your policy tax-free. That’s money you could possibly borrow1 during your lifetime. Whether term or cash value life insurance, the right choice for you depends on your overall financial strategy.   
Compare Life Insurance Types 




Why Voya? 
The Voya Life Companies are highly rated by commercial rating agencies for financial strength and their ability to meet claims and guarantees.

Life insurance products are issued by ReliaStar Life Insurance Company of New York (Woodbury, NY) and Security Life of Denver Insurance Company (Denver, CO). Variable universal life insurance products are distributed by Voya America Equities, Inc. Within the state of New York, only ReliaStar Life Insurance Company of New York is admitted and it's products issued. All are members of the Voya® family of companies.
All guarantees are based on the financial strength and claims paying ability of the issuing insurance company, who is solely responsible for all obligations under its policies. 





Policy loans and partial withdrawals may vary by state, may generate an income tax liability, reduce available surrender value and reduce the death benefit, or cause the policy to lapse.
1Income tax free distributions are usually achieved by withdrawing to the cost basis (usually premiums paid), then using policy loans. This assumes the policy qualifies as life insurance, is not a modified endowment contract, is not lapsed or surrendered with an outstanding loan. Individual tax results may vary. You should consult your attorney or other tax advisor.

You should consider the investment objectives, risks and charges, and expenses of the variable annuity and its underlying investment options carefully before investing. The prospectuses for the variable annuity and underlying investment options contain this and other information. You may obtain free prospectuses by calling your financial professional or 800-366-0066. Please read the prospectuses carefully before investing.
Variable annuities are issued by Voya Insurance and Annuity Company (Des Moines, IA) and distributed by Directed Services LLC. Both are members of the Voya® family of companies.
A variable annuity is a long-term investment designed for retirement planning. It is a contract between you and an insurance company, under which the insurer agrees to make periodic payments to you. Additionally, variable annuities offer the opportunity to allocate premiums among fixed and variable investment options that have the potential to grow income tax-deferred, until an income stream begins. These payments, called annuity income, will begin either immediately or at a future date and a part of which may be the return of your premium or principal. This income is guaranteed by the issuing insurance company for a specified period of time or for the life of the annuitant.
Variable annuities are subject to investment risk, are not guaranteed and will fluctuate in value. In addition, there is no guarantee that any variable investment option will meet its stated objective.
IRAs and other qualified plans already provide tax deferral like that provided by an annuity. Additional features and benefits such as contract guarantees, death benefits and the ability to receive a lifetime income are contained within the annuity for a cost. Please be sure the features and costs of the annuity are right for you when considering the purchase of the annuity. Neither the company nor its agents or representatives can provide tax, legal or accounting advice. Please consult your attorney or tax advisor about your specific circumstances. The contract does not directly participate in any stock or equity products.
All guarantees are based on the financial strength and claims paying ability of  Voya Insurance and Annuity Company, who is solely responsible for all obligations under its polices.   





1Withdrawals may be subject to Federal/State income tax and, if taken prior to age 59½, an additional 10% Federal penalty tax.

Annuities are issued by Voya Insurance and Annuity Company (Des Moines, IA), member of the Voya® family of companies.
All withdrawals reduce the death benefit and may reduce the value of any optional benefits. Early withdrawals and other distributions of taxable amounts may be subject to ordinary income tax, a surrender charge, and if taken prior to age 59½, an IRS 10% premature distribution penalty tax unless an exception applies. Federal law requires that withdrawals be taken first from interest credited. A withdrawal includes any partial surrender. All distributions from qualified annuities may be taxable. State premium taxes may reduce the final value of your annuity.
IRAs and other qualified plans already provide tax deferral like that provided by an annuity. Additional features and benefits such as contract guarantees, death benefits and the ability to receive a lifetime income are contained within the annuity for a cost. Please be sure the features and costs of the annuity are right for you when considering the purchase of the annuity.
Neither the company nor its agents or representatives can provide tax, legal or accounting advice. Please consult your attorney or tax advisor about your specific circumstances.
The contract does not directly participate in any stock or equity products.   





1Guarantees are based on the claims-paying ability of Voya Insurance and Annuity Company (VIAC).
2Annuity income is defined as a series of periodic payments, a part of which may be return of your premium or principal, which is guaranteed by the issuing insurance company for a specified period of time or for the life of the annuitant.
