      ■ Glenn M. Renwick served as president, chairman, and chief
      executive officer of Progressive Casualty Insurance Company. At
      Progressive he was able to create long-term profitability through his
      accurate predictive insurance models, which allowed the company to insure
      high-risk drivers. Renwick was known as a responsive and accessible leader
      who welcomed new innovations in technology and believed in truthfulness in
      business.
    

      LEARNING ABOUT AND MARKETING TO THE CUSTOMER
    

      Renwick joined Progressive Casualty Insurance Company in 1986 as an auto
      product manager for Florida. As he worked in the day-to-day local
      operations of the company, he learned much about Progressive's
      clients. Foremost among these lessons was that customers find it hard to
      shop for car insurance.
    

      The easier a company makes it to buy a policy, the more likely a customer
      is to purchase the insurance. He also learned that good, accessible
      customer service can make the difference in a company's reputation,
      whether the customer is shopping for insurance or submitting a claim
      following an accident. These customer details became very important to
      Renwick when he entered Progressive's brand advertising and
      marketing department.
    

      Remembering the lessons learned in Progressive's local operations,
      Renwick developed a strategy to help customers shop for insurance. His
      idea was to focus Progressive's marketing campaign on the specific
      services that assisted customers in their search for the best insurance
      carrier. These services included competitively priced auto insurance
      rates, excellent customer services, and a practice of giving
      customer's quotes from other competitive insurance companies as
      well as their own. Progressive's successful marketing campaign
      resulted in an increase of market share: from 1.5 percent in 1993 to 6
      percent in 2003.
    

      USING THE INTERNET
    

      After his successes in the consumer marketing group, Renwick moved into a
      new role as chief information officer in 1998. The position of CIO at
      Progressive proved to be an intense and important role, since Progressive
      placed so much weight on technology and customer education. One of
      Progressive's most marketed features was their provision of
      insurance quotes and the selling of insurance over the Internet, beginning
      in 1997. Renwick extended Progressive's Internet services through
      creation of online interactive customer services, through which customers
      could look up their policy information, obtain a policy quote, check the
      status of a claim, make online payments, and update personal account
      information. Renwick considered the project, named Personal Progressive,
      one of his best customer-focused innovations, because it allowed customers
      to examine their insurance policies without going through an insurance
      agent or customer service representative.
    

      As part of his plan to educate customers, Renwick added the Insurance
      Institute for Highway Safety's side-impact head-protection crash
      videos to the Progressive website. The stated purpose of the videos was to
      help Progressive's customers make
       informed vehicle and insurance-purchase decisions. The posting of the
      videos on Progressive's website garnered considerable media
      attention, since it was the only authorized online outlet for viewing the
      crash-test videos at that time. In recognition of its usefulness and
      functionality, the company's Web site was named one of 
      
        InfoWeek
      
       magazine's "top 10 Web sites that work in 2001" and
      also was named to 
      
        Smart Business
      
       magazine's Smart Business 50.
    

      Later in his term as chief information office, Renwick used his finance
      and engineering skills to create an accurate predictive formula to
      determine insurance rates. The formula models were set up as a detailed,
      oriented approach to calculating insurance rates based on how much, when,
      and where a particular person drives. The high level of predictive
      accuracy from the calculations allowed the company to profitably insure
      high-risk drivers. The main goal of the CIO during Renwick's tenure
      was to ensure that Progressive's technology remained ahead of the
      other industry leaders, and he met it with great success.
    

      THE BIG PICTURE: SHORT-TERM LOSS FOR A LONG-TERM GOAL
    

      In 2000, after two successful years as CIO, Renwick became
      Progressive's chief executive officer. As CEO, Renwick made the
      tough decision to raise insurance rates, because it was the only strategy
      that would keep rates accurately reflecting current costs. At the same
      time, Renwick changed the duration of the insurance policies from 12
      months to six months. Although a survey of customers found that most
      people prefer a longer-duration policy, Renwick felt that a shorter policy
      would allow the company to enhance the accuracy of their insurance rates.
      Wall Street and other industry leaders immediately criticized Renwick for
      his rate hike, and in 2001 Progressive had only 2 percent net new
      business. However, the company soon gained more new business when larger
      companies, such as State Farm Insurance, had to start aggressively raising
      their insurance rates after their artificially low rates resulted in large
      financial losses. By 2002 Progressive's new net business was
      booming, and the company had a 30 percent increase in new-insurance
      premiums.
    

      As Progressive's new CEO, Renwick felt that it was best to
      categorize and prioritize the different challenges confronting him. He
      narrowed his management goals to making operations more efficient,
      improving customer services, and keeping expenses low. To decrease
      expenses and improve corporate efficiency, Renwick reorganized and
      clarified Progressive's management structure and focused on new
      technologies to boost efficiency. As a way to keep his finger on the pulse
      of clients' needs, Renwick created a series of customer
      questionnaires. Outside his goals as CEO, Renwick's priority for
      the company was to ensure that the insurance company's rates and
      reserves remained adequate. Progressive's focus on the accuracy of
      rates helped the company remain true to its slogan to make their business
      "all about the customer."
    

      INNOVATION AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES
    

      When Renwick became CEO after the tenure of the eccentric, visionary Peter
      Lewis, Progressive was already known for its ability to implement new and
      innovative ideas successfully. Renwick continued the company's
      policy of innovation by concentrating on the weaknesses of the
      car-insurance business and trying to find creative solutions to solve the
      problems. For example, Renwick recognized that car-insurance companies
      have the least control over events when customers are most anxious, right
      after an accident. To address this issue, Renwick created a network of
      "one-stop shopping" centers that allow the customer
      "to bring in the damaged car and get a replacement car immediately,
      and also get a beeper so that the insurer can get in touch with the
      customer when the car is ready." (
      
        BusinessWeek Online
      
      , April 16, 2003) These one-stop-shopping centers helped lessen customer
      confusion following an accident and increased the speed with which claims
      were processed.
    

      In keeping with his former role as CIO, Renwick created another model for
      Progressive to track information technology (IT) expenses. Given the large
      number of technological innovations implemented throughout the company, it
      was important to efficiently track the amount of profit directly related
      to the cost of specific IT developments. With an IT expense tracking
      model, Renwick was able to develop a simple budget that kept tabs on
      specific innovations, their cost, and their overall impact on business
      operations. If a project was costing more money and having a minimal
      positive effect compared with other innovations, Renwick and his managers
      would be aware of it and could further evaluate the merit of that
      particular IT innovation.
    

      MANAGEMENT STYLE
    

      Renwick was known as a responsive and communicative leader who welcomed
      new innovations in technology. When he became CEO of Progressive, he
      focused on the company's organizational structure so that every
      employee would understand his or her job objectives and responsibilities.
      By establishing accountability and clear objectives, Renwick encouraged
      employees to focus fully on their position's goals and thus improve
      company productivity, and he communicated openly and honestly with his
      employees and shareholders so that they understood the motivations behind
      the business decisions made in the company. In fact, to emphasize his
      position, Renwick placed a picture of a naked man and the title
      "Bare All" on the company's 2003 annual report. He
      believed that the atmosphere of candor and openness at Progressive was
      responsible
       for the success of the company. As he put it, "In insurance, the
      foundation of success is trust. To be trusted, you need integrity and you
      need to be open" (

Nationality: American.

■ Glenn M. Renwick served as president, chairman, and chief executive officer of Progressive Casualty Insurance Company. At Progressive he was able to create long-term profitability through his accurate predictive insurance models, which allowed the company to insure high-risk drivers. Renwick was known as a responsive and accessible leader who welcomed new innovations in technology and believed in truthfulness in business.
LEARNING ABOUT AND MARKETING TO THE CUSTOMER
Renwick joined Progressive Casualty Insurance Company in 1986 as an auto product manager for Florida. As he worked in the day-to-day local operations of the company, he learned much about Progressive's clients. Foremost among these lessons was that customers find it hard to shop for car insurance.
The easier a company makes it to buy a policy, the more likely a customer is to purchase the insurance. He also learned that good, accessible customer service can make the difference in a company's reputation, whether the customer is shopping for insurance or submitting a claim following an accident. These customer details became very important to Renwick when he entered Progressive's brand advertising and marketing department.


Remembering the lessons learned in Progressive's local operations, Renwick developed a strategy to help customers shop for insurance. His idea was to focus Progressive's marketing campaign on the specific services that assisted customers in their search for the best insurance carrier. These services included competitively priced auto insurance rates, excellent customer services, and a practice of giving customer's quotes from other competitive insurance companies as well as their own. Progressive's successful marketing campaign resulted in an increase of market share: from 1.5 percent in 1993 to 6 percent in 2003.
USING THE INTERNET
After his successes in the consumer marketing group, Renwick moved into a new role as chief information officer in 1998. The position of CIO at Progressive proved to be an intense and important role, since Progressive placed so much weight on technology and customer education. One of Progressive's most marketed features was their provision of insurance quotes and the selling of insurance over the Internet, beginning in 1997. Renwick extended Progressive's Internet services through creation of online interactive customer services, through which customers could look up their policy information, obtain a policy quote, check the status of a claim, make online payments, and update personal account information. Renwick considered the project, named Personal Progressive, one of his best customer-focused innovations, because it allowed customers to examine their insurance policies without going through an insurance agent or customer service representative.
As part of his plan to educate customers, Renwick added the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety's side-impact head-protection crash videos to the Progressive website. The stated purpose of the videos was to help Progressive's customers make informed vehicle and insurance-purchase decisions. The posting of the videos on Progressive's website garnered considerable media attention, since it was the only authorized online outlet for viewing the crash-test videos at that time. In recognition of its usefulness and functionality, the company's Web site was named one of InfoWeek magazine's "top 10 Web sites that work in 2001" and also was named to Smart Business magazine's Smart Business 50.
Later in his term as chief information office, Renwick used his finance and engineering skills to create an accurate predictive formula to determine insurance rates. The formula models were set up as a detailed, oriented approach to calculating insurance rates based on how much, when, and where a particular person drives. The high level of predictive accuracy from the calculations allowed the company to profitably insure high-risk drivers. The main goal of the CIO during Renwick's tenure was to ensure that Progressive's technology remained ahead of the other industry leaders, and he met it with great success.
THE BIG PICTURE: SHORT-TERM LOSS FOR A LONG-TERM GOAL
In 2000, after two successful years as CIO, Renwick became Progressive's chief executive officer. As CEO, Renwick made the tough decision to raise insurance rates, because it was the only strategy that would keep rates accurately reflecting current costs. At the same time, Renwick changed the duration of the insurance policies from 12 months to six months. Although a survey of customers found that most people prefer a longer-duration policy, Renwick felt that a shorter policy would allow the company to enhance the accuracy of their insurance rates. Wall Street and other industry leaders immediately criticized Renwick for his rate hike, and in 2001 Progressive had only 2 percent net new business. However, the company soon gained more new business when larger companies, such as State Farm Insurance, had to start aggressively raising their insurance rates after their artificially low rates resulted in large financial losses. By 2002 Progressive's new net business was booming, and the company had a 30 percent increase in new-insurance premiums.
As Progressive's new CEO, Renwick felt that it was best to categorize and prioritize the different challenges confronting him. He narrowed his management goals to making operations more efficient, improving customer services, and keeping expenses low. To decrease expenses and improve corporate efficiency, Renwick reorganized and clarified Progressive's management structure and focused on new technologies to boost efficiency. As a way to keep his finger on the pulse of clients' needs, Renwick created a series of customer questionnaires. Outside his goals as CEO, Renwick's priority for the company was to ensure that the insurance company's rates and reserves remained adequate. Progressive's focus on the accuracy of rates helped the company remain true to its slogan to make their business "all about the customer."
INNOVATION AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES
When Renwick became CEO after the tenure of the eccentric, visionary Peter Lewis, Progressive was already known for its ability to implement new and innovative ideas successfully. Renwick continued the company's policy of innovation by concentrating on the weaknesses of the car-insurance business and trying to find creative solutions to solve the problems. For example, Renwick recognized that car-insurance companies have the least control over events when customers are most anxious, right after an accident. To address this issue, Renwick created a network of "one-stop shopping" centers that allow the customer "to bring in the damaged car and get a replacement car immediately, and also get a beeper so that the insurer can get in touch with the customer when the car is ready." (BusinessWeek Online, April 16, 2003) These one-stop-shopping centers helped lessen customer confusion following an accident and increased the speed with which claims were processed.
In keeping with his former role as CIO, Renwick created another model for Progressive to track information technology (IT) expenses. Given the large number of technological innovations implemented throughout the company, it was important to efficiently track the amount of profit directly related to the cost of specific IT developments. With an IT expense tracking model, Renwick was able to develop a simple budget that kept tabs on specific innovations, their cost, and their overall impact on business operations. If a project was costing more money and having a minimal positive effect compared with other innovations, Renwick and his managers would be aware of it and could further evaluate the merit of that particular IT innovation.
MANAGEMENT STYLE
Renwick was known as a responsive and communicative leader who welcomed new innovations in technology. When he became CEO of Progressive, he focused on the company's organizational structure so that every employee would understand his or her job objectives and responsibilities. By establishing accountability and clear objectives, Renwick encouraged employees to focus fully on their position's goals and thus improve company productivity, and he communicated openly and honestly with his employees and shareholders so that they understood the motivations behind the business decisions made in the company. In fact, to emphasize his position, Renwick placed a picture of a naked man and the title "Bare All" on the company's 2003 annual report. He believed that the atmosphere of candor and openness at Progressive was responsible for the success of the company. As he put it, "In insurance, the foundation of success is trust. To be trusted, you need integrity and you need to be open" (Intelligent Enterprise, March 20, 2004).

Citation styles

									Encyclopedia.com gives you the ability to cite reference entries and articles according to common styles from the Modern Language Association (MLA), The Chicago Manual of Style, and the American Psychological Association (APA).
								

									Within the “Cite this article” tool, pick a style to see how all available information looks when formatted according to that style.  Then, copy and paste the text into your bibliography or works cited list.
								

									Because each style has its own formatting nuances that evolve over time and not all information is available for every reference entry or article, Encyclopedia.com cannot guarantee each citation it generates.  Therefore, it’s best to use Encyclopedia.com citations as a starting point before checking the style against your school or publication’s requirements and the most-recent information available at these sites:

Notes:


										Most online reference entries and articles do not have page numbers.  Therefore, that information is unavailable for most Encyclopedia.com content.  However, the date of retrieval is often important.  Refer to each style’s convention regarding the best way to format page numbers and retrieval dates.
