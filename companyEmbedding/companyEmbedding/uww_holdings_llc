corporation (“ UWW ”) and Allan R. Dragone,
Jr. (“ Consultant ”).

UWW as its Chief Executive Officer pursuant to the Third
Amended & Restated Employment Agreement, made as of
September 19, 2008, between UWW and Consultant and amended as
of December 17, 2008, further amended as of December 21,

”);

Merger Agreement ”), by and among xpedx Holding
Company, a Delaware limited liability company (the “
Company ”), UWW, International Paper Company, a New

wholly-owned subsidiary of IP (“ xpedx Intermediate
LLC ”) and certain other parties thereto, UWW will merge
with and into the Company (the “ Merger ”), with
the Company continuing as the surviving corporation, and
immediately thereafter, xpedx Intermediate LLC will merge with and
into Unisource Worldwide, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“
Unisource Sub ”), with Unisource Sub continuing as the
surviving corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company
(together, the “ Proposed Transaction
”);

WHEREAS, effective as of the closing
date of the Proposed Transaction (the “ Effective Date
”) Consultant’s employment with UWW under the
Employment Agreement shall cease and Consultant shall become a
consultant to the Company under the terms hereunder;

WHEREAS, the Company will assume the
obligations under and become a party to this Agreement by operation
of law as a result of the consummation of the Merger;

WHEREAS, Consultant understands and
acknowledges that IP and the Company would not enter into the
Merger Agreement or consummate the Proposed Transactions in the
absence of this Agreement, including but not limited to
Consultant’s agreement to the restricted covenants set forth
in paragraphs 6, 7 and 8 of this Agreement;

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of
the mutual covenants contained herein and other good and valuable
consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:

1. Consulting Relationship .
The Company shall engage the services of Consultant, and Consultant
hereby agrees to perform services for the Company, upon the terms
and conditions set forth in this Agreement for the period beginning
on the Effective Date (such date, the “ Consulting Period
Effective Date ”) and ending upon the second anniversary
of the Consulting Period Effective Date, or such earlier date as
provided in this Agreement (such period, the “ Consulting
Period ”). In the event that the Proposed Transaction
does not occur, this Agreement shall become null and void and
Consultant and the Company shall have no further rights or
obligations hereunder.



2. Position and Duties
.

(a) During the Consulting Period,
Consultant shall serve as an independent contractor. During the
Consulting Period, Consultant shall render such consulting services
to the Company and its Subsidiaries as the Board of Directors of
the Company (the “ Board ”) or the Chief
Executive Officer of the Company (the “ CEO ”)
may from time to time direct and, subject to paragraph 4, shall
serve as a member of the Board. For avoidance of doubt, the Company
intends that the services performed by Consultant to the Company
pursuant to this Agreement shall be at a level that is no more than
20% of the average level of services that Consultant performed
during the thirty-six (36) months of his employment with UWW
immediately preceding the Consulting Period Effective
Date.

(b) Consultant shall report to the
Board or the CEO. During the Consulting Period, the Consultant
(1) will not have an office at any Company facility,
(2) will not attend industry associations or shows as a
representative of the Company, (3) will refer emails and phone
calls from employees and customers to the CEO or the General
Counsel of the Company and (4) will not respond to press or
investor inquiries, in each case without authorization from the
Board or the CEO of the Company.

(c) For purposes of this Agreement,
“ Subsidiaries ” shall mean any corporation or
other entity of which the securities or other ownership interests
having the voting power to elect a majority of the board of
directors or other governing body are, at the time of
determination, owned by the Company or UWW, directly or through one
or more Subsidiaries.

(d) For purposes of this Agreement,
“ Affiliates ” shall mean with respect to the
Company and its Subsidiaries or UWW and its Subsidiaries, any other
Person controlling, controlled by or under common control with the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries and, in the case of a Person
which is a partnership, any partner of the Person.

(e) For purposes of this Agreement,
“ Person ” shall mean an individual, a
partnership, a corporation, a limited liability company, an
association, a joint stock company, a trust, a joint venture, an
unincorporated organization and a governmental entity or any
department, agency or political subdivision thereof.

3. Compensation .

(a) During the Consulting Period,
Consultant will receive an amount equal to $1,000,000 per annum
(the “ Base Payment ”) payable on a monthly
basis, and pro rated for any period of less than a full year, for
the consulting services provided by Consultant and
Consultant’s other promises and agreements hereunder. During
the Consulting Period, the Consultant shall not be eligible to
participate in any of the employee benefit plans or arrangements of
the Company.
 
-2-



(b) During the Consulting Period,
the Company shall reimburse Consultant for all reasonable and
necessary business expenses incurred by him in the course of
performing his duties and responsibilities under this Agreement
which are consistent with the Company’s policies in effect
from time to time with respect to travel (which may be first
class), entertainment and other business expenses, subject to the
Company’s requirements with respect to reporting and
documentation of such expenses.

(c) In addition to the Base Payment,
during each twelve (12) month period following the Consulting
Period Effective Date, Consultant will be eligible to earn a target
bonus of 50% of his Base Payment for such period (the “
Target Bonus ”), determined by the Board or the
compensation committee of the Board (if there is one) (the “
Compensation Committee ”) based upon the Board’s
reasonable determination of the satisfaction of financial goals or
such other metrics as agreed by the Compensation Committee prior to
each year commencing during the Consulting Period. Unless otherwise
agreed to by Consultant, any such bonus amount for a year shall be
paid no later than the date which is two and one-half months after
the end of such annual period. For the avoidance of doubt, the
aggregate Target Bonuses for the Consulting Period shall not exceed
$1,000,000.

4. Board Membership . The
Board shall take such action as may be necessary to appoint or
nominate Consultant to become a member of the Board effective as of
the Consulting Period Effective Date. Thereafter, during the
Consulting Period, the Board shall nominate Consultant for
re-election as a member of the Board at the expiration of the then
current term, provided that the foregoing shall not be required to
the extent prohibited by legal or regulatory requirements. Upon the
termination or expiration of the Consulting Period, Consultant
shall resign as a director of the Company and its Subsidiaries, as
the case may be. To eliminate any potential conflicts of interest,
the Consultant will not serve on any committee of the Board and,
for the avoidance of doubt, will not participate in the assessment
of the Company’s CEO. While serving on the Board, Consultant
shall be entitled to receive the same compensation for service as a
director as the Company’s independent directors (including
without limitation any equity and/or convertible
equity).

5. Term .

(a) The Consulting Period shall
continue until the second anniversary of the Consulting Period
Effective Date, but may be terminated earlier, (i) by
Consultant’s resignation (with or without Good Reason, as
defined below), death, or Disability, (ii) or upon the
Board’s determination in its good faith judgment that
termination of Consultant’s service is in the best interests
of the Company (whether for Cause (as defined below) or without
Cause).

(b) If the Consulting Period is
terminated (1) by the Company without Cause (other than as a
result of Consultant’s Disability) or (2) upon
Consultant’s resignation with Good Reason, in each case prior
to the second anniversary of the Consulting Period Effective Date,
Consultant shall be entitled to (x) an amount equal to
$1,000,000, reduced by any bonus previously paid or earned pursuant
to paragraph 3(c) , paid in a lump sum within seventy
(70) days following the termination of the Consulting Period
and (y) continued payment of his Base Payment through the
second anniversary of the Consulting Period Effective Date, paid on
a monthly basis. Any amounts payable pursuant to this paragraph
5(b) shall not be paid until the
 
-3-


first scheduled payment date following the date
the General Release (as defined below) is executed and no longer
subject to revocation, with the first such payment being in an
amount equal to the total amount to which Consultant would
otherwise have been entitled during the period following the
termination of the Consulting Period if such deferral had not been
required; provided, however, that any such amounts that constitute
nonqualified deferred compensation within the meaning of Internal
Revenue Code Section 409A and the regulations and official
guidance promulgated thereunder (“ Code
Section 409A ”) shall not be paid until the 60th day
following such termination to the extent necessary to avoid adverse
tax consequences under Code Section 409A, and, if such
payments are required to be so deferred, the first payment shall be
in an amount equal to the total amount to which Consultant would
otherwise have been entitled during the period following the end of
the Consulting Period if such deferral had not been
required.

(c) If the Consulting Period is
terminated (1) by the Company for Cause, (2) due to
Consultant’s death or Disability (3) by
Consultant’s resignation without Good Reason, or
(4) following the second anniversary of the Consulting Period
Effective Date, Consultant shall be entitled to receive
(i) his Base Payment through the date of termination or
expiration and (ii) any bonus amounts to which Consultant is
entitled determined by reference to a bonus period that ended on or
prior to the date of termination or expiration.

(d) The parties hereto acknowledge
that the Consultant’s employment pursuant to the Employment
Agreement has been terminated without Cause, effective as of the
Consulting Period Effective Date. As such, the parties acknowledge
and agree that severance shall be paid to the Consultant pursuant
to Section 5(b) of the Employment Agreement and the Executive
shall have the rights described in Section 28 (relating to the
Executive Residence Matters) of the Employment Agreement, in each
case in accordance with the terms and conditions of such provisions
as provided in the Employment Agreement, which terms shall
expressly survive the Consulting Period Effective Date. The parties
acknowledge and agree that the general release, in form and
substance satisfactory to the Company, that is referred to in
Section 5(b) of the Employment Agreement and is required to be
executed to receive such severance, shall be in the form attached
hereto as Exhibit B .

(e) Any and all amounts payable
pursuant to paragraph 5(b) shall only be payable if Consultant
delivers to the Company and does not revoke a general release of
claims in favor of the Company and its Affiliates (the “
General Release ”) in substantially the form attached
on Exhibit A hereto. Such release shall be executed and
delivered (and no longer subject to revocation, if applicable)
within sixty (60) days following termination.

(f) Except as otherwise expressly
provided herein, Consultant shall not be entitled to any
compensation from the Company or its Subsidiaries after the
termination or expiration of the Consulting Period.

(g) Consultant is under no
obligation to mitigate damages or the amount of any payment
provided for hereunder by seeking other employment or
otherwise.

(h) The Company may offset any
amounts Consultant owes it or any of its Subsidiaries against any
amounts the Company or its Subsidiaries owes Consultant
hereunder,
 
-4-


provided, however that in no event shall any
payment under this Agreement that constitutes “nonqualified
deferred compensation” for purposes of Code Section 409A
be subject to offset by any other amount unless otherwise permitted
by Code Section 409A.

(i) For purposes of this Agreement,
“ Cause ” shall mean with respect to Consultant
one or more of the following: (i) the commission of a felony
or other crime involving moral turpitude or the commission of any
crime involving misappropriation, embezzlement or fraud with
respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
customers or suppliers, (ii) conduct causing the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries substantial public disgrace or disrepute or
economic harm, (iii) repeated failure to perform duties as
reasonably directed by the Board or CEO, (iv) any act or
omission aiding or abetting a competitor, supplier or customer of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to the material disadvantage
or detriment of the Company and its Subsidiaries, (v) breach
of fiduciary duty, gross negligence or willful misconduct with
respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (vi) any
other material breach by Consultant of this Agreement which is not
cured to the Board’s reasonable satisfaction within 15 days
after written notice thereof to Consultant.

(j) Consultant will be “
Disabled ” only if, as a result of his incapacity due
to physical or mental illness, Consultant would have been
considered disabled under the Company’s long-term disability
insurance plans if he were covered by such plans.

(k) For purposes of this Agreement,
“ Good Reason ” shall mean if Consultant resigns
from the Consultant’s position with the Company and its
Subsidiaries prior to the end of the Consulting Period as a result
of the Company’s reduction in the amount of the Base Payment
without Consultant’s written consent, or the Company breaches
its obligation to pay Consultant any portion of the Base Payment
when due, which is not cured to Consultant’s reasonable
satisfaction within 15 days after written notice thereof to the
Company.

6. Confidential Information
.

(a) Consultant acknowledges that the
continued success of the Company and its Subsidiaries and
Affiliates, depends upon the use and protection of a large body of
confidential and proprietary information. All of such confidential
and proprietary information now existing or to be developed in the
future will be referred to in this Agreement as “
Confidential Information .” Confidential Information
will be interpreted as broadly as possible to include all
information of any sort (whether merely remembered or embodied in a
tangible or intangible form) that is (i) related to the
Company’s or its Subsidiaries’ or Affiliates’
current or potential business and (ii) is not generally or
publicly known. Confidential Information includes, without specific
limitation, the information, observations and data obtained by
Consultant during the course of his employment with UWW and its
Subsidiaries prior to the Consulting Period Effective Date, his
performance of services under this Agreement or his service as a
director of the Company, UWW or any of their respective
Subsidiaries or Affiliates, in each case whether before or after
the Consulting Period Effective Date, concerning the business and
affairs of the Company and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates,
information concerning acquisition opportunities in or reasonably
related to the Company’s or its Subsidiaries’ or
Affiliates’ business or industry of which Consultant became
or becomes aware of during his employment or other service with UWW
and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates, during the Consulting Period
or during his service as a
 
-5-


director of the Company and its Subsidiaries and
Affiliates, the Persons or entities that are current, former or
prospective suppliers or customers of any one or more of them
during Consultant’s course of employment or other service
with UWW and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates, performance under
this Agreement or service as a director of the Company and its
Subsidiaries and Affiliates, as well as development, transition and
transformation plans, methodologies and methods of doing business,
strategic, marketing and expansion plans, including plans regarding
planned and potential sales, financial and business plans, employee
lists and telephone numbers, locations of sales representatives,
new and existing programs and services, prices and terms, customer
service, integration processes, requirements and costs of providing
service, support and equipment. Therefore, Consultant agrees that,
in addition to any obligations under the Employment Agreement,
during the Consulting Period and after termination of the
Consulting Period for any reason he shall not disclose to any
unauthorized person or use for his own account any of such
Confidential Information without the Board’s prior written
consent, unless and to the extent that any Confidential Information
(i) becomes generally known to and available for use by the
public other than as a result of Consultant’s acts or
omissions to act or (ii) is required to be disclosed pursuant
to any applicable law or court order. Consultant agrees to deliver
to the Company at the end of the Consulting Period, or at any other
time the Company may request in writing, all memoranda, notes,
plans, records, reports and other documents (and copies thereof)
relating to the business of the Company or its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates (including, without limitation, all Confidential
Information) that he may then possess or have under his
control.

(b) During the Consulting Period,
Consultant shall not use or disclose any confidential information
or trade secrets, if any, of any former employers or any other
Person (other than UWW and its Subsidiaries) to whom Consultant has
an obligation of confidentiality, and shall not bring onto the
premises of the Company or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates any
unpublished documents or any property belonging to any former
employer or any other Person to whom Consultant has an obligation
of confidentiality unless consented to in writing by the former
employer or Person (other than UWW and its Subsidiaries).
Consultant shall use in the performance of his duties only
information that is (i) generally known and used by Persons
with training and experience comparable to Consultant’s and
that is (x) common knowledge in the industry or (y) is
otherwise legally in the public domain, (ii) otherwise
provided or developed by the Company or its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates or (iii) in the case of materials, property or
information belonging to any former employer or other Person to
whom Consultant has an obligation of confidentiality (other than
UWW and its Subsidiaries), approved for such use in writing by such
former employer or Person. If at any time during the Consulting
Period, Consultant believes he is being asked to engage in work
that will, or will be likely to, jeopardize any confidentiality or
other obligations Consultant may have to former employers,
Consultant shall immediately advise the Board so that
Consultant’s duties can be modified appropriately.

(c) Consultant represents and
warrants to the Company that Consultant took nothing with him which
belonged to any former employer, other than UWW and its
Subsidiaries, when Consultant left his prior position and that
Consultant has nothing that contains any information which belongs
to any former employer (other than UWW and its Subsidiaries). If at
any time Consultant discovers this is incorrect, Consultant shall
promptly return any such materials to Consultant’s former
employer. The Company does not want any such materials, and
Consultant shall not be permitted to use or refer to any such
materials in the performance of Consultant’s duties
hereunder.
 
-6-



(d) Consultant understands that the
Company and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates will receive from third
parties confidential or proprietary information (“ Third
Party Information ”) subject to a duty on the
Company’s and its Subsidiaries’ and Affiliates’
part to maintain the confidentiality of such information and to use
it only for certain limited purposes. During the Consulting Period
and thereafter, and without in any way limiting the provisions of
paragraph 6(a) above, Consultant will hold Third Party
Information in the strictest confidence and will not disclose to
anyone (other than personnel of the Company or its Subsidiaries and
Affiliates who need to know such information in connection with
their work for the Company or such Subsidiaries and Affiliates) or
use, except in connection with his work for the Company or its
Subsidiaries and Affiliates, Third Party Information unless
expressly authorized by a member of the Board in
writing.

7. Intellectual Property,
Inventions and Patents . Consultant acknowledges that all
discoveries, concepts, ideas, inventions, innovations,
improvements, developments, methods, designs, analyses, drawings,
reports, patent applications, copyrightable work and mask work
(whether or not including any Confidential Information) and all
registrations or applications related thereto, all other
proprietary information and all similar or related information
(whether or not patentable) which relate to the Company’s or
any of its Subsidiaries’ actual or anticipated business,
research and development or existing or future products or services
and which are conceived, developed or made by Consultant (whether
above or jointly with others) while providing services to the
Company and its Subsidiaries, whether before or after the date of
this Agreement (“ Work Product ”), belong to the
Company or such Subsidiary. Consultant shall promptly disclose such
Work Product to the Board and, at the Company’s expense,
perform all actions reasonably requested by the Board (whether
during or after the Consulting Period) to establish and confirm
such ownership (including, without limitation, assignments,
consents, powers of attorney and other instruments).

8. Non-Compete,
Non-Solicitation .

(a) Consultant acknowledges and
agrees that during the course of his employment, consultancy and
other service relationships with UWW, the Company and their
respective Subsidiaries he has and shall become familiar with the
Company’s and its Subsidiaries’ and Affiliates’
trade secrets and with other Confidential Information concerning
the Company and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates, that his services
have been and shall be of special, unique and extraordinary value
to the Company and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates and that given,
this expertise and knowledge, Consultant’s competition with
the Company and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates would cause the
Company to suffer irreparable harm. Therefore, and in further
consideration of the compensation to be paid to Consultant
hereunder, Consultant agrees that, during the Consulting Period and
for twenty four (24) months thereafter (the “
Noncompete Period ”), he shall not, directly or
indirectly, compete with the Business of the Company within North
America by serving in any capacity, job or function (including, but
not limited to, as a proprietor, stockholder, partner, member,
officer, director, employee, consultant, independent contractor, or
agent) that is the same or similar to the capacities, jobs or
functions in
 
-7-


which he served the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries during the Consulting Period or UWW or any of its
Subsidiaries for the two (2) years immediately prior to the
cessation of his employment with UWW when in such capacity, job or
function, he could or would assist, support or further any entity,
organization or other Person in competing with the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates in the Business of the Company;
provided that Consultant may maintain his current passive
investments in the Consultant’s Businesses that otherwise
would violate this paragraph 80, so long as Consultant has no
active participation in such Consultant’s Businesses and
Consultant does not make additional investments in such
Consultant’s Businesses without the prior written consent of
the Board. For the purposes of this Agreement, the “
Business of the Company ” means a business materially
engaged in the competitive business of selling or distributing the
following products manufactured by third parties: (x) printing
and specialty papers, (y) packaging supplies and equipment, or
(z) as it relates to printing and specialty papers, industrial
and commercial maintenance supplies or graphic imaging supplies and
equipment, in any locale of any country in which the Company
conducts such business. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company
agrees that customers and suppliers of the Company are not deemed
to be competitive with the Company merely based upon such status.
Nothing herein shall prohibit Consultant from being a passive owner
of not more than 2% of the outstanding stock of any class of a
corporation which is publicly traded, so long as Consultant has no
active participation in the business of such
corporation.

(b) During the Noncompete Period,
Consultant shall not directly or indirectly, or through another
Person or entity (i) solicit any current employee of the
Company or any Subsidiary with whom Consultant had Material Contact
during the 12-month time period immediately preceding the
termination of his employment with UWW or during the 12-month time
period immediately preceding the termination of the Consulting
Period (for any reason) to leave the employ of the Company or such
Subsidiary, (ii) solicit any person who was previously an
employee of the Company or any Subsidiary at any time during the
twelve (12) months prior to the termination of the Consulting
Period and with whom Consultant had Material Contact during the
12-month time period immediately preceding the termination of his
employment with UWW or during 12-month time period immediately
preceding the termination of the Consulting Period (for any reason)
to leave the employ of such person’s present employer,
(iii) induce or attempt to induce any customer, supplier,
licensee, licensor, franchisee or other business relation of the
Company or any Subsidiary with whom Consultant had Material Contact
during the 12-month time period immediately preceding the
termination of his employment with UWW or during the 12-month time
period immediately preceding the termination of the Consulting
Period (for any reason) to cease doing business with the Company or
such Subsidiary, and (iv) solicit any business in competition
with the Business of the Company from any of the existing or
potential customers with whom Consultant had Material Contact
during the 12-month time period immediately preceding the
termination of his employment with UWW or during the 12-month time
period immediately preceding the termination of the Consulting
Period (for any reason). For purposes of this Agreement, “
Material Contact ” means personal contact or the
supervision of the efforts of those who have had direct personal
contact.

(c) If, at the time of enforcement
of this paragraph 8, a court shall hold that the duration, scope or
area restrictions stated herein are unreasonable under
circumstances then existing, the parties agree that the maximum
duration, scope or area reasonable under such
 
-8-


circumstances shall be substituted for the
stated duration, scope or area and that the court shall be allowed
to revise the restrictions contained herein to cover the maximum
period, scope and area permitted by law. Consultant acknowledges
that the restrictions contained in paragraph 6 and this paragraph 8
(x) constitute consideration for inducing the Company to
employ Consultant as a consultant and to provide Consultant with
the compensation and payments under this Agreement, (y) are
reasonable and necessary to protect the business interests of the
Company, and (z) will not cause him any undue hardship and
will not prevent him from earning a living, and that he has
reviewed the provisions of this Agreement with his legal
counsel.

(d) In the event of the breach or a
threatened breach by Consultant of any of the provisions of
paragraph 6 or this paragraph 8, the Company and its Subsidiaries
would suffer irreparable harm, and in addition and supplementary to
other rights and remedies existing in its favor, the Company shall
be entitled to specific performance and/or injunctive or other
equitable relief from a court of competent jurisdiction in order to
enforce or prevent any violations of the provisions hereof (without
posting a bond or other security). In addition, in the event of an
alleged breach or violation by Consultant of this paragraph 8, the
Noncompete Period shall be tolled until such breach or violation
has been duly cured.

9. Consultant’s
Representations . Consultant hereby represents and warrants to
the Company that (i) the execution, delivery and performance
of this Agreement by Consultant do not and shall not conflict with,
breach, violate or cause a default under any contract, agreement,
instrument, order, judgment or decree to which Consultant is a
party or by which he is bound, (ii) Consultant is not a party
to or bound by any employment agreement, noncompete agreement or
confidentiality agreement with any other Person or entity other

the valid and binding obligation of Consultant, enforceable in
accordance with its terms. Consultant hereby acknowledges and
represents that he has consulted with independent legal counsel
regarding his rights and obligations under this Agreement and that
he fully understands the terms and conditions contained
herein.

10. Survival . Paragraphs 5
through 25 shall survive and continue in full force in accordance
with their terms notwithstanding the expiration or termination of
the Consulting Period. The other provisions hereof shall cease to
be of any force or effect following the expiration or termination
of the Consulting Period.

Item 4 of the Original Schedule 13D is hereby amended and restated in its entirety as follows: 
The information set forth in Item 6 of this Statement is hereby incorporated herein by reference. 
The Reporting Person holds the Common Stock for investment purposes. In its capacity as a significant stockholder of the Issuer, the Reporting
Person intends to take an active role in working with the Issuers management on operational, financial and strategic initiatives. As a result of Seth A. Meisels resignation from the Issuers board of directors (and the
committees thereof) on November 4, 2015, no member of the board of managers of UWWH currently serves on the Issuers board of directors. The Reporting Person reviews and intends to continue to review, on an ongoing and continuing basis,
its investment in the Issuer. Depending upon the factors discussed below and subject to applicable law and the agreements described in Item 6 below, including that described under the heading Registration Rights Agreement, the Reporting
Person may from time to time acquire additional securities of the Issuer or sell or otherwise dispose of some or all of its securities of the Issuer. Any transactions that the Reporting Person may pursue may be made at any time and from time to time
without prior notice and will depend upon a variety of factors, including, without limitation, current and anticipated future trading prices of the securities of the Issuer, the financial condition, results of operations and prospects of the Issuer,
general economic, financial market and industry conditions, other investment and business opportunities available to the Reporting Person, tax considerations and other factors. 
Other than as described above, or in Item 6 of this Statement, the Reporting Person currently has no plans or proposals that relate to or
would result in any of the transactions involving the Issuer described in subparagraphs (a) through (j) of Item 4 of Schedule 13D (although the Reporting Person may from time to time consider pursuing or proposing any such transactions and, in that
connection, may discuss, evaluate and/or pursue any such transactions with their advisors, the Issuer or other persons).  Item 5. Interest in
Securities of the Issuer.  Item 5 of the Original Schedule 13D is hereby amended and restated in its entirety as follows: 
(a)-(b) As the date hereof, the Reporting Person holds sole voting and dispositive power over 6,083,840 shares, or approximately 38.8%, of
Common Stock.  Voting and dispositive power with respect to the shares of Common Stock held by the Reporting Person is exercised through a
three-member board of managers acting by majority vote. Fund VII and Coinvestment VII have the right to appoint two of the three members of the board of managers of the Reporting Person. In addition, Fund VII LLC, Coinvest VII LLC, BCIP III LLC,
BCIP T III LLC, BCIP III-B LLC, BCIP T III-B LLC and J5 (the Bain Capital Funds) collectively hold common equity interests of the Reporting Person. 
BCI is the general partner of BCP VII, which is the general partner of Coinvestment VII and Fund VII, which is the managing member of J5.
Boylston Coinvestors, LLC is the managing partner of BCIP Trust Associates III, BCIP Trust Associates III-B, BCIP Associates III and BCIP Associates III-B, which is the manager of BCIP T III LLC, BCIP T III-B LLC, BCIP III LLC and BCIP III-B LLC,

(d) Except as stated within this Item 5, to the knowledge of the Reporting Person, only the
Reporting Person has the right to receive or the power to direct the receipt of dividends from, or proceeds from the sale of, the shares of Common Stock of the Issuer reported by this Statement. 
(e) Not applicable.  Item 6. Contracts,
Arrangements, Understandings or Relationships with Respect to the Securities of the Issuer  Item 6 of the Original Schedule 13D is hereby amended and
supplemented as follows:  Underwriting Agreement and Lock-up Agreement 
Pursuant to an Underwriting Agreement (the Underwriting Agreement), dated as of November 17, 2016 by and among the Issuer, UWWH and
Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, as representative of the several underwriters named therein (the Underwriters), UWWH agreed to sell to the Underwriter in an underwritten public offering an aggregate of 1,756,160
shares of Common Stock (the Public Offering). The sale of the Common Stock to the Underwriter closed on November 23, 2016. Contemporaneously with the closing of the Public Offering, the Issuer repurchased from the Underwriters
313,600 of the shares of Common Stock that were the subject of the Public Offering at a price per share equal to the price at which the Underwriters purchased such shares from UWWH in the Public Offering (the Share Repurchase). The
313,600 shares of Common Stock acquired by the Issuer in connection with the Share Repurchase will no longer be outstanding.  In
connection with the Public Offering, UWWH and directors and executive officers of the Issuer entered into a lock-up agreement (the Lock-up Agreement) with the Underwriter. Under the Lock-up Agreement, each party to the Lock-up Agreement
agreed, subject to certain exceptions, not to sell or transfer any Common Stock or securities convertible into, exchangeable for, exercisable for, or repayable with Common Stock, for 60 days after November 17, 2016 without first obtaining the
written consent of the Underwriter.  The summaries of the Underwriting Agreement and Lock-up Agreement contained in this Item 6 are qualified in their
entirety by reference to the Underwriting Agreement and the Lock-up Agreement, each of which is filed as an exhibit hereto and incorporated by reference herein. 
Item 7. Materials to be Filed as Exhibits  Item 7 of

Mergers and Acquisitions 






 Unisource & xpedx To Merge 
 Wed, 01/29/2014 - 3:58pm 
 Comments 
 by Unisource Worldwide, Inc.  

 



New publicly held distribution company to create enhanced platform for profitable growth across Packaging, Print and Facility SolutionsNorcross, GA – Distribution solutions businesses Unisource Worldwide, Inc. and xpedx will merge under the terms of a definitive agreement that would result in the creation of a new publicly traded company. The agreement to merge the two businesses was signed by International Paper, parent company of xpedx, and by UWW Holdings, Inc. the holding company of Unisource and owned indirectly by an affiliate of Bain Capital and by Georgia-Pacific, as well as certain of their affiliates.Upon the expected completion of the merger in mid-2014, which is subject to certain closing conditions, the new company will have projected annual revenue in the range of $9 billion to $10 billion and will have about 9,500 team members across more than 170 distribution centers in North America. The new company is expected to generate approximately $200 million in synergies.Allan Dragone, chief executive officer of Unisource, said, “This merger will create a new company with  unique capabilities that will enable better service to customers across their core business segments of packaging, print and facility solutions. Building upon the strengths of both Unisource and xpedx, we believe the new company will be able to accelerate and enhance top-line growth opportunities across a complementary portfolio.”Seth Meisel, a member of the Unisource board of directors and a managing director at Bain Capital, stated, “By bringing together these two businesses, we will be able to provide customers with innovative solutions and ideas to solve their toughest challenges in product packaging and fulfillment, paper and print management, supply chain and logistics services, and facility solutions. The new company will offer an unmatched combination of reach, product depth and service capabilities.”Transaction DetailsThe transaction will be accomplished through a Reverse Morris Trust structure.  International Paper will contribute the assets of xpedx to a newly formed wholly owned subsidiary, xpedx Holding Company, in exchange for the stock of the subsidiary, a cash payment of approximately $400 million expected to be financed with new debt in the new company’s capital structure, as well as the potential for an additional cash payment pursuant to an “earn-out” in the sixth year after closing. The subsidiary will be spun off into a new company.Following the spinoff of the new company to International Paper shareholders, UWW Holdings, Inc. will immediately thereafter merge with and into the new company. Immediately following such a merger, Unisource will merge with xpedx. In connection with the merger, the shares of UWW Holdings, Inc., will be converted into a number of shares of the new company such that, following the merger, approximately 51 percent of shares of the new public company will be owned by International Paper shareholders, with the remaining approximately 49 percent of shares held by a new holding company, UWW Holdings, LLC. The new company intends to apply to list its shares for trading on the New York Stock Exchange. UWW Holdings, LLC may request to register its shares of the new company with the SEC for resale beginning 180 days following the closing of the merger, pursuant to the terms of a Registration Rights Agreement to be entered into between the new company and UWW Holdings, LLC.To finance the cash payment to International Paper and refinance existing debt of Unisource, the new company has entered into a commitment with three banks for $1.4 billion of asset-backed financing. The new company’s debt-to-EBITDA ratio is targeted to be in the range of 4-5. The new company will be well positioned to generate solid cash flow for operations and reinvestment in the business while adequately servicing its debt.The new company’s executive offices will be located in the greater Atlanta area. In addition, the new company will retain the two existing operational headquarters of the legacy companies in Norcross, Ga., and Loveland, Ohio.Leadership & GovernanceMary Laschinger, currently president, xpedx, and senior vice president, International Paper, will be the chief executive officer of the new company and chairman of its board of directors. Dragone will serve as a director of the new company and will advise on integration activities. The other directors will be: Lead Director William E. Mitchell, retired chairman and chief executive officer, Arrow Electronics, Inc. and founder of Sequel Capital Management, LLC Daniel T. Henry, retired executive vice president and chief financial officer, American Express Tracy Leinbach, retired executive vice president and CFO, Ryder System, Inc. John Zillmer, retired chairman, president and chief executive officer, Univar, Inc. Michael Muldowney, former CFO and interim CEO of Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing Co., and founder and CEO of Foxford Capital, LLC Charles G. Ward, partner, Perella Weinberg Partners, and former president, Lazard Ltd. Seth Meisel, managing director, Bain CapitalBarclays and Goldman, Sachs & Co. are serving as financial advisors, and Kirkland & Ellis LLP is serving as legal counsel, to UWW Holdings LLC.

A non-competition agreement is also known as a non-compete agreement. The document may be used when hiring a new employee (''Employee'') to an organization or company (''Company''), and prohibits the employee from working at a competitor (''Competitor''), after the employee is terminated or leaves the company.Non-competition agreements are designed to protect a company's business practices and intellectual property from being provided to a competitor by a former employee.  This agreement might be used by a soft drink company to prevent its employees from taking trade secrets to a competitor. A document will usually specify the time length in which the employee promises to not work for a competitor after leaving the company. The geographic territory and any  prohibited activities may also be included.The laws surrounding the use and implementation of non-competition agreements may vary from state to state.
