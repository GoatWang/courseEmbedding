Eleven Biotherapeutics Appoints Industry Veteran Karen L. Tubridy as 
      Chief Development Officer






June 28, 2013 07:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time



CAMBRIDGE, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Eleven Biotherapeutics, a biopharmaceutical company designing and 
      engineering novel and differentiated protein-based biotherapeutics for 
      ocular diseases, announced today that it has appointed biologics 
      industry veteran Karen L. Tubridy, PharmD, as Chief Development Officer. 
      She will be responsible for leading and executing the company’s clinical 
      and regulatory development strategy, currently focused on innovative 
      protein therapeutics for ocular diseases. Ms. Tubridy will be a member 
      of Eleven’s management team reporting to Abbie Celniker, PhD, Chief 
      Executive Officer, and she will play a key role in advancing the 
      clinical development of the company’s lead ocular product candidate, 
      EBI-005, in collaboration with Michael H. Goldstein, MD, Eleven’s 
      medical director and the co-director of the Cornea, External Disease and 
      Cataract Service group at Tufts University Medical Center.
    


      “Karen Tubridy is joining Eleven at an exciting time in the company’s 
      evolution. EBI-005, the first IL-1 signaling inhibitor designed for 
      topical ocular administration, has just completed a Phase 1b clinical 
      study in patients with dry eye disease and Karen will play a key role in 
      further advancing the clinical development of EBI-005 based on its 
      positive clinical progress to-date,” said Abbie Celniker, PhD, Chief 
      Executive Officer of Eleven Biotherapeutics. “We look forward to 
      leveraging Karen’s extensive global development experience, including 
      clinical and regulatory strategies specific to biotherapeutic product 
      candidates, as we continue to advance EBI-005 into later stage clinical 
      development.”
    

      “Eleven’s technology has clearly demonstrated the ability to create 
      novel biotherapeutics with improved characteristics and therapeutic 
      benefits, with EBI-005 as a prime example of the promising therapeutic 
      potential of proteins from Eleven’s R&D engine,” said Ms. Tubridy. “I am 
      excited to be joining Eleven and look forward to working with the team 
      to advance EBI-005 to its full potential, as well as exploring other 
      promising opportunities.”
    

      Ms. Tubridy has more than 20 years of experience directing global 
      clinical programs, developing regulatory and clinical strategies, and 
      leading development programs of novel and first-in-class 
      biotherapeutics. Karen Tubridy most recently served as Senior Vice 
      President, Clinical Development and Medical Affairs at Inspiration 
      Biopharmaceuticals where she successfully led the clinical, medical and 
      regulatory functions of the company’s lead product candidates, OBI-1, 
      which was acquired by Baxter in March 2013 for more than $700 million 
      and IB1001 which was acquired by Cangene. Before Inspiration, Ms. 
      Tubridy was Executive Director, Clinical Operations and Regulatory 
      Affairs, Translational Medicine at Alexion Pharmaceuticals and Taligen 
      Therapeutics (which was acquired by Alexion). Prior to Alexion, Karen 
      Tubridy held similar clinical operations and regulatory positions of 
      increasing responsibility at Syntonix Pharmaceuticals (which was 
      acquired by Biogen Idec), AVANT Immunotherapeutics, Wyeth, Genetics 
      Institute and New England Medical Center. Ms. Tubridy received her BSc 
      and PharmD from Massachusetts College of Pharmacy and Allied Health 
      Sciences.

To warm or not to warm, that is the question (well, at least a concern for those dry eye minded individuals...) Having said that, did you know that the human body can regulate core temperature between 98°F and 100°F when the ambient temperature is between 68°F and 130°F?1 This is remarkable in that the ambient temperature can vary significantly while the internal core temperature remains tightly controlled. In this week's research update, you will discover that measurement of the internal eyelid in normal subjects is lower—on average 34.3°C (93.7°F)—than the average normal core temperature of 37.0 °C (98.6 °F). Our eyelids are certainly external, and would thus be expected to be lower in temperature than our core, but how much lower can they be to maintain normal function? And by "normal function" I mean normally acting meibomian glands, secreting healthy, non-hazy or opaque solidified meibum. This normal "oil-like" meibum is the end goal of lid hygiene and warm compress therapy—shouldn't we try to get there clinically?

I live in Houston. It is warm (understatement) here—really warm in the summer. I can honestly say that when it is really hot outside, I am not thinking about how hot my eyelids might be—and how the outdoor environment might affect that. What if my body was able to keep my lids cooler (even when I wasn't)? What we don't understand is what temperature loss, or even temperature regulation, of the lids results in a change to the secretions, and if warming the lids, through warm compress therapy, will return the lids to "normalcy." Clinically, warm compress therapy, as well as the new Lipiflow treatment, would augment the body's ability to warm the eyelids—and thus, "normalize" the eyelid temperature. Regardless of why the lids were cooler, warming, in theory, makes sense. The challenge lies in making this concept manageable, and accessible, to our patients.

                                            Eleven Biotherapeutics Announces Positive Topline Data on EBI-005


                        						Eleven Biotherapeutics, a biopharmaceutical company designing and engineering novel and differentiated protein-based biotherapeutics for ocular diseases, announced positive topline clinical results from a 6-week randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled Phase 1b/2a study of EBI-005 in patients with dry eye disease (DED). According to the company, EBI-005 reflects a new approach to the treatment of DED and is the first IL-1 (Interleukin-1) signaling inhibitor designed for topical ocular administration. In the efficacy results from the study, EBI-005 demonstrated statistically significant improvements in signs and symptoms of dry eye disease compared to baseline. In addition, EBI-005 met the predefined efficacy criteria of the study and showed a differential effect between patients who received EBI-005 and those who received only the vehicle control (EBI-005 drug formulation without the active pharmaceutical ingredient). Data from the study showed that EBI-005 was generally safe and well tolerated. The results from the Phase 1b/2a study of EBI-005 confirm similar observations from a recently-published study1 validating the blockade of IL-1 as an efficacious mechanism for treating dry eye disease. 

The topline data from the clinical study of EBI-005 will be described at the Masters in Ophthalmology 2013 annual meeting, June 28-30, 2013, in Palm Beach, Florida, and the full data set will be presented at an upcoming ophthalmologic meeting this fall. Based on these results, Eleven plans to rapidly advance EBI-005 into late stage clinical studies in dry eye disease and additional ocular surface inflammatory diseases, including severe allergic conjunctivitis. The Phase 1b/2a clinical trial study was a double-masked, multi-center, randomized, placebo-controlled study to evaluate two doses of EBI-005 over a six-week period in subjects with dry eye disease. The trial enrolled 74 subjects and was conducted in multiple centers throughout the United States. The primary objective of the study was to determine the safety and tolerability of EBI-005, along with additional assessments of efficacy of EBI-005 in patients with dry eye disease. The study was designed to assess activity of EBI-005 to determine improvements in signs and symptoms of dry eye disease with EBI-005 as compared to baseline as well as differentiation of EBI-005 as compared to vehicle control. The efficacy of EBI-005 in relation to improvement in signs and symptoms of dry eye disease from baseline and EBI-005 compared to vehicle control was measured by the Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) and corneal fluorescein staining.

Amber Gaume Giannoni, OD, FAAO








                        A 38 year old Caucasian female presented for a dry eye evaluation, reporting two courses of Accutane as a teenager. Her greatest complaint was dryness that wakes her up in the middle of the night, despite instilling gel drops prior to bedtime, and using a sleep mask and humidifier. Numerous treatments have proved ineffective, including "every OTC drop imaginable," lid hygiene, topical corticosteroids, two separate rounds of Restasis therapy (each for over 1 year), punctual cautery and Azasite. She drinks over a gallon of water daily, exercises regularly and consumes an excellent diet, including fish and omega 3 supplements. Exam findings revealed clear lashes with no ocular surface staining, however, her lid margins showed scalloping, epithelial ridging and significant poster margin redness. Meibomian gland expression exposed thickened, opaque secretions, while infrared meibography showed only shortening of a few glands in each lid, greater inferiorly. What would you do?

This patient was treated with the Lipiflow Thermal Pulsation System (TearScience), (Figures 1 and 2). A protective corneal shell heats the lid from the palpebral side, and inflatable bladders provide cyclic gland expression over a 12 minute period. One study showed that a single treatment can improve symptoms of MGD for at least 12 months.1 Our patient tolerated the procedure well, although due to extremely small palpebral fissures, the device was a little challenging to apply. Increased dryness is expected for the first few days to weeks since the contents of her meibomian glands were completely depleted; however, we are optimistic this in-office therapy will compliment her existing routine to provide the symptomatic relief that she has been looking for.

RESEARCH UPDATE: COMMENTARY ON ABSTRACT OF THE WEEK
Sruthi Srinivasan, PhD, BS Optom, FAAO 







                                            Dry eye diagnosis is usually based on patient reported symptoms and clinical signs observed by eye care practitioners. Most clinical tests (Schirmer's test, tear break up time, addition of dyes to determine ocular surface staining) are often invasive and the grading severity is subjective. To overcome these difficulties, non-invasive tests have been developed. One such device is the thermographer, which non-invasively measures the temperature of the ocular surface. Studies in the past have successfully used this device1,2 and also demonstrated that after sustained eye opening, the central corneal temperature in dry eye patients to be lower than those in normal eyes.3 Although this technique has been around since the 1960's,4 the tests had to be carried out in specialized temperature and humidity controlled rooms. Considerable training and expertise was required to obtain measurements and post processing of the obtained data was also time-consuming. To overcome these difficulties, an objective, non-invasive and user-friendly device that is specialized to measure ocular surface temperature was developed by Tomoyuki Kamao and colleagues (TOMEY Corp, Nagoya, Japan). They used this thermographer as a screening tool for dry eye disease, and the original abstract is presented as the abstract of the week.5

To supplement this abstract, this week's research update additionally focuses on another Japanese research group (Arita et al in association with developers of the TOMEY thermographer) who attempted to compare the surface temperature of the cornea and tarsal conjunctiva in patients with obstructive meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD). In a letter to JAMA Ophthalmology (http://archopht.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1678150), Arita et al describe a study of nineteen patients (mean age= 74.2 ±10.3 years) with obstructive MGD and 16 age matched healthy volunteers. The authors examined the correlation between the surface temperature and other ocular surface parameters including the central cornea and tarsal conjunctiva (both upper and lower) measured using the Tomey ocular surface thermographer. The results of this preliminary study showed that decreased conjunctival temperature was associated with an increase in the viscosity of the meibum, which could potentially induce obstructive MGD. The authors also speculated that impeded blood flow might lead to the decreased conjunctival temperature in patients with obstructive MGD. Although Tomey ocular surface thermographer instrument is not currently available in North America, the concept of thermography as a screening tool in MGD is novel. If further research could establish a strong relationship between measuring ocular surface temperature and MGD, this instrument could be a valuable tool for eyecare practitioners.

ABSTRACT







Screening for Dry Eye with Newly Developed Ocular Surface Thermographer


                        Kamao T, Yamaguchi M, Kawasaki S, Mizoue S, Shiraishi A, Ohashi Y. Am J Ophthalmol. 2011 May;151(5):782-791.e1. doi: 10.1016/j.ajo.2010.10.033. Epub 2011 Feb 18.
Department of Ophthalmology, Medicine of Sensory Function, Ehime University Graduate School of Medicine, Toon, Japan.

PURPOSE: To evaluate the newly developed Ocular Surface Thermographer (TOMEY Corporation) for dry eye screening.

DESIGN: Prospective, controlled study.

METHODS: We studied 30 eyes of 30 patients diagnosed with dry eye (mean age ± standard deviation, 52.9 ± 17.1 years) and 30 eyes of 30 normal subjects (42.7 ± 17.0 years). The ocular surface temperature was measured immediately after eye opening and every second during 10 seconds of eye opening. The reliability of the measurements was determined by calculating intraclass correlation coefficients. Then, the correlations between the change in the ocular surface temperature and tear film break-up time, Schirmer I test values, and fluorescein staining scores were determined.

RESULTS: The measurements of the ocular surface temperature had a high degree of reliability. Immediately after eye opening, the temperature in the dry eye did not differ significantly from that in normal eyes in any of the 3 regions tested. The decrease in the ocular surface temperature in dry eyes was significantly greater than that in normal eyes (P < .001) at 10 seconds after eye opening. The decrease in the temperature of the cornea was correlated significantly with the tear film break-up time (r = -0.572; P < .001). When the changes in ocular surface temperature of the cornea were used as an index for dry eye, the sensitivity was 0.83 and the specificity was 0.80 after 10 seconds.

CONCLUSIONS: Measurements of the ocular surface temperature obtained with our newly developed Ocular Surface Thermographer after 10 seconds of eye opening may provide a simple, noninvasive screening test for dry eyes.

DRY EYE 101: NUTS AND BOLTS
Jillian Meadows, OD, MS 








Question: I want to express the meibomian glands, but how do I do it?

Answer:  Expressing the meibomian glands (MGs) is an integral component to the ocular surface evaluation, and your technique should vary depending on what you want to accomplish. 

Routine MG expression for all patients is recommended as a screening test for nonobvious MGD. Using your thumb or forefinger, apply moderate pressure just beneath the inferior lash margin (above if upper lid) and observe the material that emerges from the glands. Clear to slightly yellowish oil is a sign of meibomian gland vitality. Granular, turbid, opaque, or inspissated meibum should prompt a more thorough evaluation. 
For the symptomatic patient, diagnostic expression of the MGs requires the application of a clinical scale to "quantify" some attribute. The procedure is essentially the same: apply external pressure to the lid margin and hold for 15 seconds. Some assign a grading scale to the amount of pressure needed to yield expression (1=gentle, 4=forceful). Others prefer to grade the quality of the meibum expressed (0=clear fluid, 1=granular, 2=whitish/semi-solid, 3=yellowish/solid, 4=no expression). Alternatively, you could count the number of expressible glands in a defined region of the lid (≥50%=normal, <50%=reduced).

For the established MGD patient, consider therapeutically expressing the MGs. Here, you need to apply significant force in order to fully evacuate thickened excreta, so a drop of anesthetic may be helpful. Place a firm instrument, such as a cotton swab, paddle/spatula, or glass rod, on the inner surface of the eyelid to avoid transferring the pressure to the globe. Sandwich the lid margin between your preferred finger and instrument and steadily squeeze to expel the inspissated meibum, taking care to remain just beneath your patient's pain threshold at all times. 
Practice your expressions. The more meibum you see, the better you will become at detecting abnormalities. As always, maintain uniformity between visits to track for changes.
