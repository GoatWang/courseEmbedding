THE LATEST NEWS FROM CLYDE
June 2017
June 24th, 2017

1960 to 2017. EPIC, end of an era, party at the family home on Macomb Street, Washington, D.C. New Chapter. New Challenges. 


 
May 2017
Clyde presented Tangled Bylines at the Concorde Bookstore outside Boston on Thursday evening, May 11, 2017. 
Andrew: "The literary tradition of Concord continues!  We had a great crowd at the bookstore last night -- where the questions just kept on coming.   Clyde was in rare form.... We were happy to have Charlie Ritchie join us as well!"



 

Loose lips sink ships, warns a World War I poster that after recent Presidential indiscretions about ISIS should drape the Oval Office. My book, Tangled Bylines, somewhat amusingly shows how the issue dogged reporters, including AP foreign correspondent Clyde A Farnsworth, my Dad, in World War II.  
 "Dad attended the sunrise briefing inside a new hangar of bamboo and lashings. Eight hundred men stood around -- the flight crews of seventy-two Superfortresses, including Dad's Monsoon Over Anshan. An intelligence officer showed slide projections of Japanese fighters. Men fidgeted. Cigarette smoke drifted around silvered cones of light.
 "The AP story included an unintentional breach of censorship derived from the briefing, which almost cost Dad's accreditation. The degree to which military censorship was then enforced stands in sharp contrast to more recent exercises of press freedom, such as Wikileaks or the Pentagon Papers, and it will probably take forever to find the happy medium between the public's right to know and the sanctity of jealously guarded secrets of national defense. Winding up the briefing, the intelligence officer said: "In case any of you guys gets his ass shot off over the target but can still make it to your alternate, you know what to do."
 "'Egg in your  borscht," came a voice from the back, followed by snickers. 
 "Monkeyshines from the Catskills, Dad thought, and incorporated the assumed GI wisecrackery into his account. Alas, when the intelligence officer, Colonel Jesse Williams, a former functionary at Texaco, read the clippings, he lost his cool. He accused Dad and the AP of a serious breach of security.
 "Egg in your borscht" was not just a wisecrack. Under a secret protocol between Roosevelt and Stalin, it was code for safe harbor for disabled American aircraft. Stalin vetoed U.S. bases in Russia, but he assented letting crippled American planes land in Siberia, provided it got no publicity. Moscow could have used the AP story to revoke  the accord. Denied such landing rights, more American airmen might have perished. It was a very serious  charge. Dad demonstrated that the story had cleared through the regular channels. Only an informed reader would ever notice, and the breach was inadvertent. Colonel Williams eventually backed down, but he rode Dad hard for weeks."
 
April 2017 
TANGLED BYLINES is now in print and available from Amazon, Barnes & Noble, etc. A successful reading in Denver's Tattered Cover bookstore. 
Friday, April 21, 7 pm, presentation and Q&A in Denver at the Tattered Cover Bookstore.          
Clyde will be presenting at the Concorde Bookstore outside Boston on Thursday evening, May 11, 7 p.m.          
February 2017
BOOK PARTY! Clyde's Book Tangled Bylines arrives several weeks sooner than expected! Book party is on the birthday of Clyde's father, Thursday, March 23, 5pm onward,  for both TANGLED BYLINES and my two published in 2016, BABUSHKA'S BEADS and REFLECTIONS: POEMS ON PAINTING, A POET'S GALLERY. Also celebrating Cameron's birthday, and her own many books.

I have just  finished 
                a massive project,
TANGLED BYLINES: A Father-Son memoir of two journalists.
 ...a journey of father and son, both journalists who reported from around the world.
University of Missouri Press accepted  manuscript for publication in 2016


After the police beat for Ohio newspapers in Prohibition, Big Clyde covers Claire  Chennault's Flying Tigers for the AP in World War II, stays on in Asia for Scripps Howard, reporting both the Chinese Civil War and early stages of war in Korea. As the last president of the Foreign Correspondents Club of China, he rescues two British newsmen from a Shanghai police firing squad, founds the successor club in Hong Kong. Little Clyde has earlier played Tag Along Sundays, while Dad, an AP slot man, marshals news of those gathering storms in Asia and Europe. The son hangs out at 50 Rock, plays checkers with office boys, teletype operators, knocks off a Werewolf story, heeds warnings not to get in the grown-ups' hair. No surprise, the kid, after a Bronze Star in Korea, follows Dad as a newsman in his own right: United Press, New York Herald Tribune and New York Times, an Overseas Press Club E.W. Fairchild award under the belt, barely missing out on a Pulitzer. The two have recorded nearly a century of history, sometimes together, such as the 1968 Soviet-led invasion of Czechoslovakia. They tell what it was like, boners, accolades, tangles with fate, even reveal a source or two, in this behind-the-scenes look at the gripping and all-too-human world of journalism.
