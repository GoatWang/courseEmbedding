	PROSPECTUS SUPPLEMENT






	(To Prospectus dated December 1, 2016)






	20,000,000 Shares




	 







	Fairmount Santrol Holdings Inc.






	COMMON STOCK




	 



	 






	The
	selling security holder identified in this prospectus supplement is offering to sell 20,000,000 shares of common stock of Fairmount Santrol Holdings Inc. to the underwriter named below. We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of our common
	stock by the selling security holder.








	The underwriter has agreed to purchase our common stock from the selling
	security holder at a price of $8.53750 per share, which will result in approximately $170,750,000 of proceeds to the selling security holder (before offering expenses). The underwriter may offer shares of our common stock from time to time for sale
	in one or more transactions on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), in the over-the-counter market, through negotiated transactions or otherwise at market prices prevailing at the time of sale, at prices related to prevailing market
	prices or at negotiated prices. See Underwriting.





	 



	 






	Our
	common stock, par value $0.01 per share, is listed on the NYSE under the symbol FMSA. The last reported sale price of our common stock on the NYSE on December 1, 2016, was $9.52 per share.





	 



	 






	Investing in our common stock involves risk. Before you invest in our common stock, you should carefully consider each of the
	factors described under 

	Risk Factors

	 beginning on page S-4 of this prospectus supplement, as well as in the accompanying prospectus and the documents we have filed with the Securities and Exchange
	Commission that are incorporated by reference.





	 



	 





	The
	selling security holder has granted the underwriter the option to purchase up to 3,000,000 additional shares of common stock on the same terms and conditions as set forth above within 30 days from the date of this prospectus supplement. If the
	underwriter exercises the option in full, the total proceeds, before expenses, to the selling security holder will be $196,362,500.






	Neither the Securities and Exchange Commission nor any state securities commission has approved or disapproved of these securities or passed on the adequacy or accuracy of this prospectus supplement. Any representation to the
	contrary is a criminal offense.






	The underwriter expects to deliver the shares on or about December 7, 2016.

	prospectus supplement. The information contained or incorporated by reference in this prospectus supplement, the accompanying prospectus and any related free writing prospectus prepared by us or on our behalf may only be accurate as of their

	Table of Contents




	INDUSTRY AND MARKET DATA



	The market data and certain other statistical information used throughout this prospectus supplement are based on independent industry
	publications, government publications and other published independent sources. Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the market related research statistics. The market data regarding supply and demand is difficult to quantify as the
	proppant industry continues to evolve and many market participants are privately held, making accurate estimates of supply capacity and market demand difficult to qualify. Some data is also based on our good faith estimates. Although these are
	third-party sources, we acknowledge our responsibility for all disclosures in this prospectus supplement. The industry in which we operate is subject to a high degree of uncertainty and risk due to a variety of factors, including those described in
	the section entitled Risk Factors. These and other factors could cause results to differ materially from those expressed in these publications.



	TRADEMARKS AND TRADE NAMES



	We own or have rights to various trademarks, service marks and trade names that we use in connection with the operation of our business. This
	prospectus supplement may also contain trademarks, service marks and trade names of third parties, which are the property of their respective owners. Our use or display of third parties trademarks, service marks, trade names or products in
	this prospectus supplement is not intended to, and does not imply a relationship with, or endorsement or sponsorship by us. Solely for convenience, the trademarks, service marks and trade names referred to in this prospectus may appear without the

	®

	, TM or SM symbols, but such references are not intended to indicate, in any way, that we will not assert, to the fullest extent under applicable law, our rights or the rights of the applicable
	licensor to these trademarks, service marks and trade names.

	SUMMARY




	The following summary is qualified in its entirety by the more detailed information included elsewhere or incorporated by reference in this
	prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus. Because this is a summary, it may not contain all the information that may be important to you. You should read the entire prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus as well as the
	documents incorporated by reference before making an investment decision. Some of the statements in this prospectus supplement are forward-looking statements. See Forward-Looking Statements. Unless we state otherwise or the context
	otherwise requires, the terms we, us, our, Fairmount Santrol, our business and our company refer to Fairmount Santrol Holdings Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries and
	predecessor companies.




	Our Company



	We are one of the worlds largest providers of sand-based proppant solutions and for nearly 40 years have been a pioneer in the
	development of high performance proppants used by Exploration & Production (E&P) companies to enhance the productivity of their oil and gas wells. We offer the broadest range of proppants available in the market today,
	including high quality sand and a variety of resin-coated and other value-added products. All of our frac sand exceeds American Petroleum Institute (API) specifications. Additionally, for more than 120 years, we and our predecessor
	companies have provided high quality sand-based products, strong technical leadership and applications knowledge to end users in the Industrial & Recreational (I&R) markets.


	Our asset base as of December 31, 2015 includes 798 million tons of proven and probable mineral reserves, which we believe is one of
	the largest reserve bases in the industry. Due to the challenging conditions in the oil and gas industry, we have adjusted our operations to minimize our costs and consolidate into what we believe is our lowest-cost footprint. As of October 2016, we
	have 10 sand processing facilities (6 of which are active) with 16.8 million tons of annual sand processing capacity. We re-opened our Menomonie, Wisconsin facility at the end of third quarter 2016, primarily to serve the I&R market and
	will also enable us to provide more fine-mesh products to the proppant market from our Wedron, Illinois facility. We also have 9 coating facilities (5 of which are active) with 2.3 million tons of annual coating capacity.


	As one of the nations longest continuously operating mining organizations, we have developed a strong commitment to environmental
	stewardship and to the three pillars of Sustainable Development: People, Planet and Prosperity. Our strong commitment to safety is reflected in the health and safety of our employees and is illustrated by our achieving a consistently low recordable
	incident rate among our similarly sized industrial sand competitors as well as one of the lowest rates for all those reporting in the Industrial Mining Association of North America. Since 2011, our employees have demonstrated our commitment to our
	communities by donating over 73,000 hours of company-paid volunteer hours, as well as significant personal volunteer hours, into the communities in which we live and operate. We are focused on environmental stewardship, and 30 of our facilities now
	generate zero waste to landfills. Additionally, we executed upon annual initiatives to reduce our carbon emissions and have planted over 395,000 trees since 2011 in order to offset our remaining Tier I and Tier 2 greenhouse gas emissions. We believe
	adhering to sustainable development principles is not only the right thing to do, but also results in a higher level of engagement and commitment from our employees, better relationships with our communities and, as a result, a stronger base from
	which to pursue profitable growth over the long-term. Abiding by these guiding principles, our corporate motto is Do Good. Do Well.


	We are capable of Class I railroad deliveries to each of North Americas major oil and gas producing basins and also have the flexibility
	to ship our product via barge, marine terminals and trucks to reach our customers as needed. As of October 2016, we operate an integrated logistics platform consisting of 41 proppant distribution terminals and a fleet of approximately 10,200
	railcars.


	 






	 


	S-1






	Table of Contents





	We have expanded our unit train capabilities to now include two production facilities and
	eight in-basin terminals, which reduce freight costs and improve cycle times for our railcar fleet. In order to better align our logistics network with customer demand and to reduce costs, we discontinued activity at four transloading terminals in
	2016.


	Our operations are organized into two segments based on the primary end markets we serve: (i) Proppant Solutions and
	(ii) I&R Products. Our Proppant Solutions segment predominantly provides sand-based proppants for use in hydraulic fracturing operations throughout the U.S. and Canada, Argentina, Mexico, China, northern Europe and the United Arab Emirates.
	Our I&R Products segment provides raw, coated, and custom blended sands to the foundry, building products, glass, turf and landscape and filtration industries primarily in North America. We believe our two market segments are complementary.
	Our ability to sell to a wide range of customers across multiple end markets allows us to maximize the recovery of our reserve base within our mining operations and to reduce the cyclicality of our earnings.


	In 2015, our Proppant Solutions segment sold 6.2 million tons of proppant with revenues of $710 million, which represent decreases of 14%
	and 42%, respectively, from 2014. Proppant Solutions represented approximately 91% and 87% of total company revenues for 2014 and 2013, respectively. For 2015, our I&R Products segment had sales volume of 2.3 million tons with revenues of
	$119 million, which represent decreases of 5% and 5%, respectively, from 2014.


	In the nine months ended September 30, 2016, our
	Proppant Solutions segment sold 4.6 million tons of proppant with revenues of $302.7 million. Our Proppant Solutions segment sold 4.8 million tons of proppant with revenues of $602.6 million in the nine months ended September 30,
	2015. Our I&R Products segment had sales volume of 1.9 million tons with revenues of $91.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016. In the nine months ended September 30, 2015, our I&R Products segment
	had sales volume of 1.7 million tons with revenues of $91.2 million.



	Corporate History Information



	We were incorporated as a Delaware corporation in 1986. Our predecessor companies began operations over 120 years ago. On October 3,
	2014, we completed an initial public offering of 25 million shares of our common stock at an offering price of $16.00 per share (the IPO). We are listed under the ticker symbol FMSA on the New York Stock Exchange.


	In August 2010, we partnered with American Securities LLC (American Securities) when affiliated funds managed by American
	Securities (collectively with American Securities, the AS Group) acquired indirect control over the selling security holder, which acquired 51% of our stock (the AS Group Acquisition). At the time of this offering, the AS
	Group indirectly owns approximately 31.9% of our outstanding common stock.


	Our corporate headquarters is located at 8834 Mayfield Road,
	Chesterland, Ohio 44026. Our telephone number is (800) 255-7263. Our company website is

	www.fairmountsantrol.com

	. We make available free of charge our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form
	8-K and amendments to those reports as soon as reasonably practicable after we file or furnish such reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC). The information on our website is not incorporated by reference in or
	considered to be a part of this prospectus supplement.

	RISK FACTORS




	This offering and an investment in our common stock involve a high degree of risk. You should refer to the other information set forth or
	incorporated by reference in this prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus, including the Risk Factors sections of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, our Quarterly Reports on
	Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2016, June 30, 2016 and September 30, 2016 and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes incorporated by reference in this prospectus supplement and the
	accompanying prospectus. If any of these risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects could be materially and adversely affected. As a result, the trading price of our common stock could
	decline and you could lose all or part of your investment in our common stock.




	Risks Related to This Offering and Ownership of Our Common Stock





	The concentration of our capital stock ownership among our largest stockholders and their affiliates will limit your ability to
	influence corporate matters.




	As a result of this offering, the selling security holder will indirectly own approximately 23.0% of
	our outstanding common stock (not including the exercise of the underwriters option), and management and other employees own a substantial portion of the remainder of our stock. As a result, the portion of our stock held by the investing
	public taken as a whole will be approximately 47% following this offering. Consequently, the selling security holder and our management and employees will continue to have significant influence over all matters that require approval by our
	stockholders, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. This concentration of ownership will limit your ability to influence corporate matters, and as a result, actions may be taken that you may not view
	as beneficial.


	Furthermore, conflicts of interest could arise in the future between us, on the one hand, and American Securities and its
	affiliates, including its portfolio companies, on the other hand, concerning among other things, potential competitive business activities or business opportunities. American Securities is a private equity firm in the business of making investments
	in entities in a variety of industries. As a result, American Securities existing and future portfolio companies which it controls may compete with us for investment or business opportunities. These conflicts of interest may not be resolved in
	our favor.


	We have also renounced our interest in certain business opportunities. See Our amended and restated certificate of
	incorporation contains a provision renouncing our interest and expectancy in certain corporate opportunities.




	Our stock price
	could be volatile, and you may not be able to resell shares of your common stock at or above the price you paid.




	The stock markets
	in general have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. Volatility in the market
	price of our common stock may prevent you from being able to sell your common stock at or above the price at which you purchased the stock. As a result, you may suffer a loss on your investment. Securities class action litigation has often been
	instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the overall market and in the market price of a companys securities. Such litigation, if instituted against us, could result in very substantial costs, divert our
	managements attention and resources and harm our business, operating results and financial condition.


	In addition to the risks
	described in this section, the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors, most of which we cannot control, including:


	 




	 


	


	 


	our operating and financial performance;




	 


	S-4






	Table of Contents





	 


	


	 


	quarterly variations in the rate of growth of our financial indicators, such as revenues, EBITDA, net income, and net income per share;




	 




	 


	


	 


	the public reaction to our press releases, our other public announcements, and our filings with the SEC;




	 




	 


	


	 


	strategic actions by our competitors;




	 




	 


	


	 


	our failure to meet revenue or earnings estimates by research analysts or other investors;




	 




	 


	


	 


	changes in revenue or earnings estimates, or changes in recommendations or withdrawal of research coverage, by equity research analysts;




	 




	 


	


	 


	speculation in the press or investment community;




	 




	 


	


	 


	the failure of research analysts to cover our common stock;




	 




	 


	


	 


	sales of our common stock by us, the selling security holders, or other stockholders, or the perception that such sales may occur;




	 




	 


	


	 


	changes in accounting principles, policies, guidance, interpretations, or standards;




	 




	 


	


	 


	additions or departures of key management personnel;




	 




	 


	


	 


	actions by our stockholders;




	 




	 


	


	 


	general market conditions, including fluctuations in commodity prices, sand-based proppants, or industrial and recreational sand-based products;




	 




	 


	


	 


	domestic and international economic, legal and regulatory factors unrelated to our performance; and




	 




	 


	


	 


	the realization of any risks described under this Risk Factors section.






	Our
	amended and restated certificate of incorporation contains a provision renouncing our interest and expectancy in certain corporate opportunities.




	Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides for the allocation of certain corporate opportunities between us and American
	Securities. Under these provisions, neither American Securities, its affiliates and subsidiaries, nor any of their officers, directors, agents, stockholders, members, or partners will have any duty to refrain from engaging, directly or indirectly,
	in the same business activities or similar business activities or lines of business in which we operate, other than opportunities related to hydraulic fracturing proppants. For instance, a director of our company who also serves as a director,
	officer or employee of American Securities or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates may pursue certain acquisitions or other opportunities that may be complementary to our business and, as a result, such acquisition or other opportunities may not be
	available to us. These potential conflicts of interest could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations if attractive corporate opportunities are allocated by American Securities to itself or its
	subsidiaries or affiliates instead of to us.




	Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws,
	as well as Delaware law, contain provisions that could discourage acquisition bids or merger proposals, which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.




	Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval.
	If our board of directors elects to issue preferred stock, it could be more difficult for a third party to acquire us. In addition, some provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could make
	it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us, even if the change of control would be beneficial to our stockholders, including:


	 




	 


	


	 


	a classified board of directors;




	 




	 


	


	 


	advance notice provisions for stockholder proposals and nominations for elections to the board of directors to be acted upon at meetings of stockholders;




	 


	S-5






	Table of Contents





	 


	


	 


	providing that the board of directors is expressly authorized to adopt, or to alter or repeal our amended and restated bylaws;




	 




	 


	


	 


	establishing advance notice and certain information requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings;




	 




	 


	


	 


	giving the Board of Directors the power to authorize the issuance of one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designations, preferences, limitations and relative rights, including preferences over
	our common stock respecting dividends and distributions;




	 




	 


	


	 


	providing that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware shall be the sole and exclusive forum for certain stockholder actions involving the Company, and




	 




	 


	


	 


	as described below, limitations on the removal of directors and limitations on the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings.




	As a result of the completion of our common stock offering in October 2016, the AS Groups ownership fell below 35% of the outstanding
	shares of our common stock. As a result, certain provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws became effective that increased the voting thresholds required by our amended and restated
	certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws for various shareholder actions and otherwise may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us. These provisions provide that:


	 




	 


	


	 


	any action required or permitted to be taken by the stockholders must be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting of stockholders and may not be effected by any consent in writing in lieu of a meeting of such
	stockholders, subject to the rights of the holders of any series of preferred stock with respect to such series;




	 




	 


	


	 


	our amended and restated bylaws may be amended by the stockholders only by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of our then outstanding common stock;




	 




	 


	


	 


	special meetings of our stockholders may only be called by the board of directors;




	 




	 


	


	 


	certain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation may be amended by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 75% of our then outstanding common stock; and




	 




	 


	


	 


	subject to the rights of the preferred stockholders, if any, any director may be removed only for cause and upon the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 75% of our then outstanding common stock.






	We currently do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock, and our debt agreements place certain restrictions
	on our ability to do so. Consequently, your only opportunity to achieve a return on your investment is if the price of our common stock appreciates.




	We do not plan to declare dividends on shares of our common stock in the foreseeable future. Additionally, our existing revolving credit
	facility and our term loan both place certain restrictions on our ability to pay cash dividends. Consequently, unless we revise our dividend policy, your only opportunity to achieve a return on your investment in us will be if you sell your common
	stock at a price greater than you paid for it. There is no guarantee that the price of our common stock that will prevail in the market will ever exceed the price that you pay in this offering.




	Future sales of our common stock in the public market could reduce our stock price, and any additional capital raised by us through the
	sale of equity or convertible securities may dilute your ownership in us.




	We may sell additional shares of common stock in
	subsequent public offerings. We may also issue additional shares of common stock or convertible securities. We cannot predict the size of future issuances of our


	 


	S-6






	Table of Contents



	common stock or securities convertible into common stock or the effect, if any, that future issuances and sales of shares of our common stock will have on the market price of our common stock.
	Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock (including shares issued in connection with an acquisition), or the perception that such sales could occur, may adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock.




	The underwriter of this offering may waive or release parties to the lock-up agreements entered into in connection with this offering,
	which could adversely affect the price of our common stock.




	We, the selling security holder, and all of our directors and
	executive officers will enter into lock-up agreements with respect to their common stock, pursuant to which they are subject to certain resale restrictions for a period of 60 days following the date of this prospectus supplement. Morgan
	Stanley & Co. LLC may, at any time and without notice, release all or any portion of the common stock subject to the foregoing lock-up agreements. If the restrictions under the lock-up agreements are waived, then common stock will be
	available for sale into the public markets, which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline and impair our ability to raise capital.




	If securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, if they adversely change their recommendations
	regarding our common stock or if our operating results do not meet their expectations, our stock price could decline.




	The trading
	market for our common stock is influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly,
	we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline. Moreover, if one or more of the analysts who cover our company downgrades our common stock or if our operating results do not
	meet their expectations, our stock price could decline.

	FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS



	This prospectus supplement (including the information incorporated by reference herein) contains forward-looking statements. These statements
	relate to our plans, expectations, estimates and beliefs of future events or our future financial performance and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, levels of activity, performance or

	Holders of Record



	On November 21, 2016, there were 222,890,868 shares of our common stock outstanding, which were held by approximately 56 stockholders of
	record. Because many of our shares of common stock are held by brokers and other institutions on behalf of stockholders, we are unable to estimate the total number of stockholders represented by these record holders.






	Dividend Policy



	We do not anticipate
	declaring or paying any cash dividends to holders of our common stock in the foreseeable future. We currently intend to retain future earnings, if any, to finance the growth of our business. Our future dividend policy is within the discretion of our
	board of directors and will depend upon then-existing conditions, including our results of operations, financial condition, capital requirements, investment opportunities, statutory restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and other factors our
	board of directors may deem relevant. In addition, our revolving credit facility and term loans place restrictions on our ability to pay cash dividends.

	UNDERWRITING



	Under the terms and subject to the conditions in an underwriting agreement dated the date of this prospectus supplement, Morgan
	Stanley & Co. LLC, as underwriter, has agreed to purchase 20,000,000 shares of our common stock from the selling security holder.


	The underwriter is offering the shares of common stock subject to its acceptance of the shares from selling security holder and subject to
	prior sale. The underwriting agreement provides that the obligations of the underwriter to pay for and accept delivery of the shares of common stock offered by this prospectus supplement are subject to the approval of certain legal matters by their
	counsel and to certain other conditions. The underwriter is obligated to take and pay for all of the shares of common stock offered by this prospectus supplement if any such shares are taken. However, the underwriter is not required to take or pay
	for the shares covered by the underwriters option to purchase additional shares described below.


	The underwriter may offer the
	shares of common stock from time to time for sale in one or more transactions on the NYSE, in the over-the-counter market, through negotiated transactions or otherwise at market prices prevailing at the time of sale, at prices related to prevailing
	market prices or at negotiated prices, subject to receipt and acceptance by it and subject to its right to reject any order in whole or in part. In connection with the sale of the shares of common stock offered hereby, the underwriter may be deemed
	to have received compensation in the form of underwriting discounts. The underwriter may effect such transactions by selling shares of common stock to or through dealers, and such dealers may receive compensation in the form of discounts,
	concessions or commissions from the underwriter and/or purchasers of shares of common stock for whom they may act as agents or to whom they may sell as principal.


	The selling security holder has granted to the underwriter an option, exercisable for 30 days from the date of this prospectus supplement, to
	purchase up to 3,000,000 additional shares of common stock at the public offering price listed on the cover page of this prospectus supplement, less underwriting discounts and commissions.


	The estimated offering expenses payable by us, exclusive of the underwriting discounts and commissions, are approximately $825,000. We have
	also agreed to reimburse the underwriter for certain of its expenses in an amount up to $30,000 as set forth in the underwriting agreement.


	The underwriter has informed us that it does not intend sales to discretionary accounts to exceed 5% of the total number of shares of common
	stock offered by them.


	Our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the trading symbol FMSA.


	We and all directors and officers and the selling security holder have agreed that, without the prior written consent of Morgan
	Stanley & Co. LLC, we and they will not, during the period ending 60 days after the date of this prospectus supplement (the restricted period):


	 




	 


	


	 


	offer, pledge, sell, contract to sell, sell any option or contract to purchase, purchase any option or contract to sell, grant any option, right or warrant to purchase, lend or otherwise transfer or dispose of, directly
	or indirectly, any shares of common stock or any securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for shares of common stock;




	 




	 


	


	 


	file any registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission relating to the offering of any shares of common stock or any securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for common stock; or




	 




	 


	


	 


	enter into any swap or other arrangement that transfers to another, in whole or in part, any of the economic consequences of ownership of the common stock.




	 


	S-13






	Table of Contents



	whether any such transaction described above is to be settled by delivery of common stock or such
	other securities, in cash or otherwise. In addition, each such person agrees that, without the prior written consent of Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, such other person will not, during the restricted period, make any demand for, or exercise any
	right with respect to, the registration of any shares of common stock or any security convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for common stock.


	The restrictions described in the immediately preceding paragraph to do not apply to:


	 




	 


	


	 


	the sale of shares to the underwriter; or




	 




	 


	


	 


	the issuance by the Company of shares of common stock upon the exercise of an option or a warrant or the conversion of a security outstanding on the date of this prospectus supplement (or certain transfers or
	withholdings or sales by individual holders to the Company pursuant to the exercise of stock option/incentive plan grants); or




	 




	 


	


	 


	certain permitted bona fide gifts; or




	 




	 


	


	 


	the issuance by the Company of stock options, restricted stock, shares of common stock or other equity incentive awards pursuant to the Companys equity compensation or director compensation plans as in effect as
	of the date of this prospectus supplement and which has been disclosed or incorporated by reference herein; or




	 




	 


	


	 


	the establishment of a trading plan pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), for the transfer of shares of common stock, provided that (i) such
	plan does not provide for the transfer of common stock during the restricted period and (ii) to the extent a public announcement or filing under the Exchange Act, if any, is required of or voluntarily made regarding the establishment of such
	plan, such announcement or filing shall include a statement to the effect that no transfer of common stock may be made under such plan during the restricted period.




	Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, in its sole discretion, may release the common stock and other securities subject to the lock-up agreements
	described above in whole or in part at any time with or without notice.


	In order to facilitate the offering of the common stock, the
	underwriter may engage in transactions that stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the price of the common stock. Specifically, the underwriter may sell more shares than they are obligated to purchase under the underwriting agreement, creating a
	short position. A short sale is covered if the short position is no greater than the number of shares available for purchase by the underwriter under the option. The underwriter can close out a covered short sale by exercising the option or
	purchasing shares in the open market. In determining the source of shares to close out a covered short sale, the underwriter will consider, among other things, the open market price of shares compared to the price available under the option. The
	underwriter may also sell shares in excess of the option, creating a naked short position. The underwriter must close out any naked short position by purchasing shares in the open market. A naked short position is more likely to be created if the
	underwriter is concerned that there may be downward pressure on the price of the common stock in the open market after pricing that could adversely affect investors who purchase in this offering. As an additional means of facilitating this offering,
	the underwriter may bid for, and purchase, shares of common stock in the open market to stabilize the price of the common stock. These activities may raise or maintain the market price of the common stock above independent market levels or prevent
	or retard a decline in the market price of the common stock. The underwriter is not required to engage in these activities and may end any of these activities at any time.


	We and the underwriter have agreed to indemnify each other against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. The
	selling security holder has also agreed to indemnify the underwriter against certain liabilities.


	The underwriter and certain of its
	affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in various activities, which may include securities trading, commercial and investment banking, financial advisory,


	 


	S-14






	Table of Contents



	investment management, investment research, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities. The underwriter and certain of its affiliates have, from time to time, performed,
	and may in the future perform, various commercial and investment banking and financial advisory services for the Company and its affiliates, for which they received or may in the future receive customary fees and expenses.


	In the ordinary course of their various business activities, the underwriter and certain of its affiliates may make or hold a broad array of
	investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for its own account and for the accounts of its customers, and such investment and securities activities
	may involve securities and/or instruments of the Company or its affiliates. If the underwriter or its affiliates have a lending relationship with us, they may hedge their credit exposure to us consistent with their customary risk management
	policies. Typically, the underwriter and its affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in our securities or the securities of
	our affiliates, including potentially the shares of common stock offered hereby. Any such credit default swaps or short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the shares of common stock offered hereby. The underwriter and certain
	of its affiliates may also communicate independent investment recommendations, market color or trading ideas and/or publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or instruments and may at any time hold, or recommend to
	clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments.


	A prospectus supplement in electronic format
	may be made available on websites maintained by the underwriter, or selling group members, if any, participating in this offering. The underwriter may agree to allocate a number of shares of common stock for sale to its online brokerage account
	holders.

	ABOUT THIS PROSPECTUS



	This prospectus is part of a registration statement that we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) using a
	shelf registration procedure. Under this shelf registration process, we may sell any combination of the securities described in this prospectus in one or more offerings from time to time, and the selling security holders may sell shares
	of our common stock in one or more offerings from time to time. This prospectus provides you with a general description of the securities we may offer, as well as the shares of our common stock that the selling security holders may offer. Each time
	we sell securities under this shelf registration, or the selling security holders sell shares of our common stock, to the extent required, we will provide a prospectus supplement that will contain specific information about the terms of that
	offering.


	Any prospectus supplement and any related free writing prospectus that we or any selling security holders may authorize may
	also add, update, or change information contained in this prospectus. The prospectus supplement and any related free writing prospectus may also add, update or change information contained in this prospectus. Therefore, if there is any inconsistency
	between the information in this prospectus and the prospectus supplement or free writing prospectus, you should rely on the information in the prospectus supplement or free writing prospectus, as applicable. You should carefully read this
	prospectus, the applicable prospectus supplement and any free writing prospectuses we or any selling security holders have authorized for use in connection with a specific offering, together with the additional information described under the
	heading Where You Can Find More Information, in their entirety. They contain information that you should consider when making your investment decision.


	We and the selling security holders have not authorized any dealer, salesman or other person to give any information or to make any
	representation other than those contained or incorporated by reference in this prospectus and any related prospectus supplement. You must not rely upon any information or representation not contained or incorporated by reference in this prospectus
	or the related prospectus supplement. This prospectus and any related prospectus supplement do not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities other than the registered securities to which they relate, nor do
	this prospectus and any related prospectus supplement constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy securities in any jurisdiction to any person to whom it is unlawful to make such offer or solicitation in such jurisdiction. You
	should not assume that the information in this prospectus, any prospectus supplement, or any document incorporated by reference is accurate as of any date other than the date of the document in which such information is contained, or such other date
	referred to in such document, regardless of the time of any sale or issuance of a security.


	The registration statement that contains this
	prospectus contains additional information about our company and the securities offered under this prospectus. That registration statement can be read at the SEC website or at the SEC offices mentioned under the heading Where You Can Find More
	Information.





	WHERE YOU CAN FIND MORE INFORMATION

	Table of Contents



	plans, expectations, estimates and beliefs of future events or our future financial performance and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual
	results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from those expressed or implied by any forward-looking statements. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as may,

	4






	Table of Contents



	this prospectus and any accompanying prospectus supplement. We caution you that these risk factors may not be exhaustive. We operate in a continually changing business environment, and new risk
	factors emerge from time to time. Management cannot predict such new risk factors, nor can it assess the impact, if any, of such new risk factors on our businesses or the extent to which any factor or combination of factors, may cause actual results
	to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the forward-looking events discussed in this prospectus or in documents incorporated by reference herein might not
	occur.








	RISK FACTORS



	Investing in our securities involves risks. Before deciding whether to purchase any of our securities, you should carefully consider the risks
	involved in an investment in our securities, as set forth in:


	 




	 


	


	 


	Item 1A, Risk Factors, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for our fiscal year ended December 31, 2015; and




	 




	 


	


	 


	the other risks described in any prospectus supplement or in any of the documents incorporated by reference in this prospectus.




	It is possible that our business, financial condition, liquidity or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of
	these risks.








	USE OF PROCEEDS



	We intend to use the net proceeds from the sale of the securities for other general corporate purposes unless otherwise indicated in the
	applicable prospectus supplement or in any free writing prospectuses we have authorized relating to a specific issuance of securities. Our general corporate purposes include, but are not limited to, working capital, repayment, redemption or
	refinancing of debt, leases, capital expenditures, investments in or loans to subsidiaries and joint ventures, funding of possible acquisitions and satisfaction of other obligations. Pending any such use, the net proceeds from the sale of the
	securities may be invested in short-term, investment grade, interest-bearing instruments. We will include a more detailed description of the use of proceeds of any specific offering in the applicable prospectus supplement relating to an offering of
	securities under this prospectus. Unless otherwise set forth in a prospectus supplement, we will not receive any proceeds from the sale of common stock by any selling security holders.








	RATIO OF EARNINGS TO FIXED CHARGES



	The following table sets forth the ratio of our earnings to our fixed charges for the periods indicated. The ratio has been computed by
	dividing earnings by fixed charges. For purposes of computing the ratio, Earnings is income before income taxes plus fixed charges, less capitalized interest. Fixed Charges is interest expense plus capitalized interest and
	the portion of rental expense which management believes is representative of interest expense.

	DESCRIPTION OF CAPITAL STOCK



	The following summary of the capital stock and amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws of Fairmount
	Santrol Holdings Inc. does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the provisions of applicable law and to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws.



	Common Stock



	Our amended and restated
	certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue up to 1,850,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share. As of November 21, 2016, there were 222,890,868 shares of common stock outstanding, net of treasury shares, held by 56
	direct registered stockholders.


	Except as provided by law or in a preferred stock designation, holders of common stock are entitled to
	one vote for each share held of record on all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders, will have the exclusive right to vote for the election of directors and do not have cumulative voting rights. Except as otherwise required by law, holders
	of common stock are not entitled to vote on any amendment to the amended and restated certificate of incorporation (including any certificate of designations relating to any series of preferred stock) that relates solely to the terms of any
	outstanding series of preferred stock if the holders of such affected series are entitled, either separately or together with the holders of one or more other such series, to vote thereon pursuant to the amended and restated certificate of
	incorporation (including any certificate of designations relating to any series of preferred stock) or pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law (the DGCL). Subject to prior rights and preferences that may be applicable to any
	outstanding shares or series of preferred stock, holders of common stock are entitled to receive ratably in proportion to the shares of common stock held by them such dividends (payable in cash, stock or otherwise), if any, as may be declared from
	time to time by our board of directors out of funds legally available for dividend payments. All outstanding shares of common stock are fully paid and non-assessable. The holders of common stock have no preferences or rights of conversion, exchange,
	pre-emption or other subscription rights. There are no redemption or sinking fund provisions applicable to the common stock. In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of our affairs, holders of common stock
	will be entitled to share ratably in our assets in proportion to the shares of common stock held by them that are remaining after payment or provision for payment of all of our debts and obligations and after distribution in full of preferential
	amounts to be distributed to holders of outstanding shares of preferred stock, if any.



	Preferred Stock



	Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors, subject to any limitations prescribed by law, without
	further stockholder approval, to establish and to issue from time to time one or more series of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share. Each such series of preferred stock will cover the number of shares and will have the powers, preferences,
	rights, qualifications, limitations and restrictions determined by the board of directors, which may include, among others, dividend rights, participation rights, liquidation preferences, voting rights, conversion rights, preemptive rights and
	redemption rights. Except as provided by law or in a preferred stock designation, the holders of preferred stock will not be entitled to vote at or receive notice of any meeting of stockholders.



	Anti-Takeover Effects of Provisions of Our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, our Amended and Restated Bylaws and Delaware Law



	Some provisions of Delaware law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws contain provisions
	that could make the following transactions more difficult: acquisitions of us by means of a tender offer, a proxy contest or otherwise or removal of our directors. These provisions may also have the effect of preventing changes in our management. It
	is possible that these provisions


	 


	6






	Table of Contents



	could make it more difficult to accomplish or could deter transactions that stockholders may otherwise consider to be in their best interest or in our best interests, including transactions that
	might result in a premium over the market price for our shares.


	These provisions are expected to discourage coercive takeover practices
	and inadequate takeover bids. These provisions are also designed to encourage persons seeking to acquire control of us to first negotiate with us. We believe that the benefits of increased protection and our potential ability to negotiate with the
	proponent of an unfriendly or unsolicited proposal to acquire or restructure us outweigh the disadvantages of discouraging these proposals because, among other things, negotiation of these proposals could result in an improvement of their terms.




	Delaware Law




	Section 203 of the DGCL prohibits a Delaware corporation, including those whose securities are listed for trading on the NYSE, from
	engaging in any business combination (as defined in Section 203) with any interested stockholder (as defined in Section 203) for a period of three years following the date that the stockholder became an interested stockholder, unless:


	 




	


	 


	the business combination or the transaction which resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder is approved by the board of directors before the date the interested stockholder attained that status;




	 




	


	 


	upon consummation of the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder, the interested stockholder owned at least 85% of the voting stock of the corporation outstanding at the time the
	transaction commenced; or




	 




	


	 


	on or after such time the business combination is approved by the board of directors and authorized at a meeting of stockholders by at least two-thirds of the outstanding voting stock that is not owned by the interested
	stockholder.




	A corporation may elect not to be subject to Section 203 of the DGCL. We have elected to not be subject
	to the provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL.




	Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated Bylaws




	Provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may delay or discourage transactions
	involving an actual or potential change in control or change in our management, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares, or transactions that our stockholders might otherwise deem to be in
	their best interests. Therefore, these provisions could adversely affect the price of our common stock.


	Among other things our amended
	and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws:


	 




	


	 


	establish advance notice procedures with regard to stockholder proposals relating to the nomination of candidates for election as directors or new business to be brought before meetings of our stockholders. These
	procedures provide that notice of stockholder proposals must be timely given in writing to our corporate secretary prior to the meeting at which the action is to be taken. Generally, to be timely, notice must be received at our principal executive
	offices not less than 90 days nor more than 120 days prior to the first anniversary date of the annual meeting for the preceding year. Our amended and restated bylaws specify the requirements as to form and content of all stockholders notices.
	These requirements may preclude stockholders from bringing matters before the stockholders at an annual or special meeting;




	 




	


	 



	provide our board of directors the ability to authorize undesignated preferred stock. This ability makes it
	possible for our board of directors to issue, without stockholder approval, preferred stock with voting or





	 


	7






	Table of Contents





	 



	other rights or preferences that could impede the success of any attempt to change control of us. These and other provisions may have the effect of deferring hostile takeovers or delaying changes
	in control or management of our company;





	 




	


	 


	provide that the authorized number of directors may be changed only by resolution of the board of directors;




	 




	


	 


	provide that all vacancies, including newly created directorships, shall, except as otherwise required by law or, if applicable, the rights of holders of a series of preferred stock, be filled exclusively by the
	affirmative vote of a majority of directors then in office, even if less than a quorum;




	 




	


	 


	provide that any action required or permitted to be taken by the stockholders must be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting of stockholders and may not be effected by any consent in writing in lieu of a
	meeting of such stockholders, subject to the rights of the holders of any series of preferred stock with respect to such series;




	 




	


	 


	provide that our bylaws may be amended by the stockholders only by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of our then outstanding common stock;




	 




	


	 


	provide that special meetings of our stockholders may only be called by the board of directors;




	 




	


	 


	provide that certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation may be amended by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 75% of our then outstanding common stock;




	 




	


	 


	provide that, subject to the rights of the preferred stockholders, if any, any director may be removed only for cause and upon the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 75% of our then outstanding common stock;




	 




	


	 


	provide for our board of directors to be divided into three classes of directors, with each class as nearly equal in number as possible, serving staggered three year terms, other than directors which may be elected by
	holders of preferred stock, if any. This system of electing and removing directors may tend to discourage a third party from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us, because it generally makes it more difficult for
	stockholders to replace a majority of the directors;




	 




	


	 


	provide that we renounce any interest in certain business opportunities presented to American Securities LLC or any of its officers, directors, agents, members, affiliates and subsidiaries (other than business
	opportunities presented to such person in his or her capacity as an officer or director of the company) and that to the fullest extent permitted by law they have no obligation to offer us those opportunities, other than opportunities relating to
	hydraulic fracturing proppants; and




	 




	


	 


	provide that our bylaws can be amended or repealed by the board of directors.





	Forum Selection



	Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the
	Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, be the sole and exclusive forum for:


	 




	


	 


	any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf;




	 




	


	 


	any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers, employees or agents to us or our stockholders;




	 




	


	 


	any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our bylaws; or




	 




	


	 


	any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine, in each such case subject to such Court of Chancery having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as
	defendants therein.




	 


	8






	Table of Contents



	Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation also provides that any person or entity
	purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock will be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to this forum selection provision. However, it is possible that a court could find our forum selection provision to
	be inapplicable or unenforceable.



	Stockholders Agreement



	On October 8, 2014, we amended and restated our stockholders agreement (the Stockholders Agreement) to, among
	certain other things, revise certain registration rights as described below.




	Registration Rights.


	In accordance with the
	requirements of the Stockholders Agreement, we filed a shelf registration statement, of which this prospectus is a part. We are required to use our reasonable best efforts to keep the shelf registration statement effective until all of the
	shares of common stock described under Selling Security Holders have been sold in accordance with the means of distribution described under Plan of Distribution or can otherwise be freely sold under the Securities Act without
	registration.




	Demand Rights.


	 While the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part remains effective,
	certain major stockholders (or their permitted transferees), including ASP FML Holdings, LLC, have the right to require us to engage in an underwritten offering in respect of their shares.




	Piggy-back Rights.


	 If, at any time, subject to certain customary limitations and exceptions, we propose to conduct a
	registered offering of common stock for our own account or for the account of any third party, then we must give written notice to all holders entitled to registration rights who own common stock with an anticipated gross offering price of at least
	$5 million to allow them to include a specified number of their shares in the offering.




	Conditions and Limitations;
	Expenses.


	 These registration rights are subject to certain conditions and limitations, including the right of the underwriters in any underwritten offering to limit the number of shares to be included in the offering and our right to
	delay or withdraw an offering under certain circumstances.



	Limitation of Liability and Indemnification Matters



	Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation limits the liability of our directors for monetary damages for breach of their fiduciary
	duty as directors, except for liability:


	 




	


	 


	for any breach of their duty of loyalty to us or our stockholders;




	 




	


	 


	for acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law;




	 




	


	 


	for unlawful payment of dividend or unlawful stock repurchase or redemption, as provided under Section 174 of the DGCL; or




	 




	


	 


	for any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit.




	Any
	amendment, repeal or modification of these provisions will be prospective only and would not affect any limitation on liability of a director for acts or omissions that occurred prior to any such amendment, repeal or modification.


	Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws also provide that we will indemnify and advance expenses
	to our directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law. Under Delaware law we may purchase insurance on behalf of any officer, director, employee or other agent for any liability arising out of that persons actions as
	our officer, director, employee or agent, regardless of whether Delaware law would permit indemnification. We entered into indemnification agreements with each of our current directors and officers. These agreements require us to indemnify these
	individuals to the fullest extent permitted under Delaware law against liability that may arise by reason of their service to us, and to


	 


	9






	Table of Contents



	advance expenses incurred as a result of any proceeding against them as to which they could be indemnified. We believe that the limitation of liability, indemnification and advancement of
	expenses provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and the indemnification agreements will facilitate our ability to continue to attract and retain qualified individuals to serve as directors and officers.






	Transfer Agent and Registrar



	The
	transfer agent and registrar for our common stock is American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC.



	Listing



	Our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol FMSA.








	DESCRIPTION OF DEBT SECURITIES



	The following description of the terms of the Debt Securities (as defined below) sets forth certain general terms and provisions of the Debt
	Securities to which any prospectus supplement may relate. The particular terms of the Debt Securities offered by any prospectus supplement and the extent, if any, to which such general provisions may apply to the Debt Securities so offered will be
	described in the prospectus supplement relating to such Debt Securities. Accordingly, for a description of the terms of a particular issue of Debt Securities, reference must be made to both the prospectus supplement relating thereto and to the
	following description.


	The Debt Securities will be issued under an indenture (the Indenture) dated as of December 1, 2016,
	between us and The Bank Of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. (the Trustee). As used in this prospectus, Debt Securities means the debentures, notes, bonds and other evidences of indebtedness that we issue and the Trustee
	authenticates and delivers under the Indenture.


	We have summarized certain terms and provisions of the Indenture in this section. The
	summary is not complete. The Indenture is also an exhibit to the registration statement that included this prospectus. You should read the Indenture for additional information before you buy any Debt Securities. The summary that follows includes
	references to section numbers of the Indenture so that you can more easily locate these provisions. Capitalized terms used but not defined in this summary have the meanings specified in the Indenture.



	General



	The Debt Securities will be our
	direct unsecured obligations. The Indenture does not limit the amount of Debt Securities that we may issue and permits us to issue Debt Securities from time to time. Debt Securities issued under the Indenture will be issued as part of a series that
	has been established by us pursuant to the Indenture (Section 2.01(b)). Unless a prospectus supplement relating to Debt Securities states otherwise, the Indenture and the terms of the Debt Securities will not contain any covenants designed to afford
	holders of any Debt Securities protection in a highly leveraged or other transaction involving us that may adversely affect holders of the Debt Securities.


	A prospectus supplement relating to a series of Debt Securities being offered will include specific terms relating to the offering. These
	terms will include some or all of the following:


	 




	 


	


	 


	the title and type of the Debt Securities;

	


	 


	if the amount of principal, interest or premium, if any, with respect to the Debt Securities may be determined with reference to an index or pursuant to a formula, the manner in which such amounts will be determined;




	 




	 


	


	 


	any optional conversion provisions that would permit us or the Holders (as defined below) of Debt Securities to elect to convert the Debt Securities prior to their final maturity;




	 




	 


	


	 


	any optional redemption provisions that would permit us or the Holders (as defined below) of Debt Securities to elect redemption of the Debt Securities prior to their final maturity;




	 




	 


	


	 


	any sinking fund or analogous provisions that would obligate us to redeem, purchase or repay the Debt Securities prior to their final maturity;




	 




	 


	


	 


	the currency or currencies in which the Debt Securities will be denominated and payable, if other than U.S. dollars;




	 




	 


	


	 


	any provisions that would permit us or the Holders of the Debt Securities to elect the currency or currencies in which the Debt Securities are paid;

	the extent to which the Debt Securities will be subordinated to our other debt;

	

	in accordance with the Indenture to represent all or part of a series of Debt Securities);




	 




	 


	


	 


	any material United States federal income tax consequences of the Debt Securities; and




	 




	 


	


	 


	any other terms of the Debt Securities (which terms shall not be prohibited by the provisions of the Indenture).




	A Holder means the person in whose name a particular Security is registered in the Security Register (Section 1.01).



	Payment and Transfer



	In the prospectus
	supplement relating to a series of Debt Securities, we will designate a Place of Payment where you can receive payment of the principal of and any premium and interest on such Debt Securities or transfer such Debt Securities. There will
	be no service charge for any registration of transfer or exchange of the Debt Securities, but we may require you to pay any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection with a transfer or exchange of the Debt Securities.


	 


	11






	Table of Contents



	All funds which we pay to any paying agent for the payment of principal, interest or premium, if
	any, with respect to the Debt Securities that remain unclaimed at the end of two years after such principal, interest or premium shall have become due and payable will be repaid to us, and the holders of such Debt Securities will thereafter look
	only to us for payment thereof.



	Denominations



	Unless the prospectus supplement states otherwise, the Debt Securities will be issued only in registered form, without coupons, in
	denominations of $1,000 each, or multiples of $1,000.



	Original Issue Discount



	Debt Securities may be issued under the Indenture as Original Issue Discount Securities and sold at a substantial discount below their stated
	principal amount. If a Debt Security is an Original Issue Discount Security, that means that an amount less than the principal amount of the Debt Security will be due and payable upon a declaration of acceleration of the maturity of the
	Debt Security pursuant to the Indenture (Section 1.01). The prospectus supplement will describe the federal income tax consequences and other special factors which should be considered prior to purchasing any Original Issue Discount Securities.



	Consolidation, Merger or Sale of Assets



	The Indenture generally permits a consolidation or merger between us and another company. It also permits the sale or transfer by us of all or
	substantially all of our property and assets and the purchase by us of all or substantially all of the property and assets of another company. These transactions are permitted if:


	 




	 


	


	 


	the resulting or acquiring company (if other than us) is a U.S. corporation, partnership or trust which assumes, or has its parent company assume, all of our responsibilities and liabilities under the Indenture,
	including the payment of all amounts due on the Debt Securities and performance of the covenants in the Indenture; and




	 




	 


	


	 


	immediately after the transaction, no Event of Default exists.




	If we consolidate or merge
	with or into any other corporation or sell all or substantially all of our assets according to the terms and conditions of the Indenture, the resulting or acquiring corporation will be substituted for us in the Indenture with the same effect as if
	it had been an original party to the Indenture. As a result, the successor corporation may exercise our rights and powers under the Indenture, in our name or in its own name and we will be released from all our liabilities and obligations under the
	Indenture and under the Debt Securities (Sections 11.01(a) and (b)).



	Satisfaction and Discharge; Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance



	The following discussion of satisfaction and discharge, defeasance and covenant defeasance will be applicable to a series of Debt Securities
	only if we choose to have them apply to that series. If we do so choose, we will state that in the applicable prospectus supplement.



	Satisfaction and Discharge.

	The Indenture will be satisfied and discharged if:


	 




	 


	


	 


	we deliver to the Trustee all Debt Securities then outstanding for cancellation; or




	 




	 


	


	 


	all Debt Securities not delivered to the Trustee for cancellation have become due and payable, are to become due and payable within one year upon their stated maturity or are to be called for redemption within one year
	and we deposit an amount sufficient to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest to the date of maturity or redemption as applicable, or deposit (in the case of Debt Securities that have become due and payable), provided that in either case
	we have paid all other sums payable under the Indenture.




	 


	12






	Table of Contents




	Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance.

	The Indenture provides, if such provision is made
	applicable to the Debt Securities of a series, that:


	 




	 


	


	 


	we may elect either:




	 




	 


	


	 


	to defease and be discharged from any and all obligations with respect to any Debt Security of such series (except for the obligations to register the transfer or exchange of such Debt Security, to replace temporary or
	mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Debt Securities, to maintain an office or agency in respect of the Debt Securities and to hold moneys for payment in trust) (defeasance); or




	 




	 


	


	 


	to be released from our obligations with respect to certain restrictive covenants that may be applicable for a particular series; and




	 




	 


	


	 


	that the Events of Default described in the third, fourth (only with respect to those restrictive covenants that no longer apply) and sixth bullets under Events of Default, shall not be Events of Default
	under the Indenture with respect to such series (covenant defeasance), upon the deposit with the Trustee (or other qualifying trustee), in trust for such purpose, of money and/or certain U.S. government obligations which through the
	payment of principal and interest in accordance with their terms will provide money, in an amount sufficient to pay the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on such Debt Security, on the scheduled due dates.




	In the case of defeasance, the holders of such Debt Securities are entitled to receive payments in respect of such Debt Securities solely from
	such trust. Such a trust may only be established if, among other things, we have delivered to the Trustee an opinion of counsel (as specified in the Indenture) to the effect that the holders of the Debt Securities affected thereby will not recognize
	income, gain or loss for federal income tax purposes as a result of such defeasance or covenant defeasance and will be subject to federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such
	defeasance or covenant defeasance had not occurred. Such opinion of counsel, in the case of defeasance described above, must refer to and be based upon a ruling of the Internal Revenue Service or a change in applicable federal income tax law
	occurring after the date of the Indenture.



	Modification and Waiver



	Under the Indenture, certain of our rights and obligations and certain of the rights of Holders of the Debt Securities may be modified or
	amended with the consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Debt Securities of each series of Debt Securities affected by the modification or amendment. The following modifications and amendments will not
	be effective against any Holder of any outstanding Debt Security affected thereby without its consent:


	 




	 


	


	 


	a change in the stated maturity date of any payment of principal or interest;




	 




	 


	


	 


	a reduction in the principal amount, in the rate of interest or in any premium payable upon redemption;




	 




	 


	


	 


	a reduction in the principal amount of an Original Issue Discount Security that would be due and payable upon a declaration of acceleration of the maturity of a Debt Security pursuant to the Indenture;




	 




	 


	


	 


	a change in the Place of Payment or currency in which any payment on the Debt Securities is payable;




	 




	 


	


	 


	an impairment of a Holders right to sue us for the enforcement of certain payments due on the Debt Securities;




	 




	 


	


	 


	a reduction in the percentage of outstanding Debt Securities required to consent to a modification, waiver or amendment of the Indenture;




	 




	 


	


	 


	a modification with respect to the subordination of any Debt Security in a manner that adversely affects the rights of any Holder; and




	 


	13






	Table of Contents





	 


	


	 


	a modification of any of the foregoing requirements or a reduction in the percentage in principal amount of outstanding Debt Securities required to waive compliance with certain provisions of the Indenture or to waive
	certain defaults under the Indenture (Section 10.02).





	Events of Default



	The term Event of Default when used in the Indenture with respect to any series of Debt Securities, means any of the following:


	 




	 


	


	 


	failure to pay interest (including defaulted interest, if any) on any Debt Security of that series when due, and continuance of such default for a period of 30 days;




	 




	 


	


	 


	failure to pay the principal of or any premium on any Debt Security of that series when due;




	 




	 


	


	 


	failure to make any sinking fund payment when and as due by the terms of a Debt Security of that series, and continuance of such default for a period of 60 days;




	 




	 


	


	 


	default in the performance, or breach, of any covenant or warranty of the Company in the Indenture (other than a covenant or warranty, a default in the performance or breach of which is elsewhere specifically dealt with
	or which has expressly been included in the Indenture solely for the benefit of one or more series of Debt Securities other than that series), and continuance of such default or breach for a period of 90 calendar days after there has been given and
	actually received by the Company a Notice of Default (as defined in the Indenture) with respect to such default or breach;




	 




	 


	


	 


	certain events in bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization; or




	 




	 


	


	 


	any other Event of Default that may be specified for the Debt Securities of that series when that series is created (Section 8.01(a)).




	If an Event of Default (other than the Event of Default referred to in the fifth bullet above) for any series of Debt Securities occurs and
	continues, the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Debt Securities of the series may declare the entire principal of all the Debt Securities of that series to be due and payable immediately. If
	such a declaration occurs, the Holders of a majority of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Debt Securities of that series can, subject to certain conditions, rescind the declaration. Upon the occurrence of the Event of Default
	referred to in the fifth bullet above the entire principal of, and interest and premium (if any) on, all the Debt Securities of each series shall be due and payable immediately without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any
	Holder (Section 8.01(b) and (c)).


	The prospectus supplement relating to each series of Debt Securities that are Original Issue Discount
	Securities will describe the particular provisions that relate to the acceleration of maturity of a portion of the principal amount of such series when an Event of Default occurs and continues.


	An Event of Default for a particular series of Debt Securities does not necessarily constitute an Event of Default for any other series of
	Debt Securities issued under the Indenture. The Indenture requires us to file an Officers Certificate with the Trustee each fiscal year that states that certain defaults do not exist under the terms of the Indenture (Section 6.05).


	Other than its duties in the case an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, a Trustee is not obligated to exercise any of its rights
	or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any Holders, unless the Holders offer the Trustee indemnification satisfactory to it (Section 9.02(e)). If such indemnification is provided, then, subject to certain other rights of the
	Trustee, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Debt Securities of any series may, with respect to the Debt Securities of that series, direct the time, method and place of:


	 




	 


	


	 


	conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee; or




	 


	14






	Table of Contents





	 


	


	 


	exercising any trust or power conferred upon the Trustee (Section 8.06).




	The Holder of a Debt
	Security of any series will have the right to begin any proceeding with respect to the Indenture or for any other remedy under the Indenture (including the appointment of a receiver or trustee), only if:


	 




	 


	


	 


	the Holder has previously given the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default with respect to the Debt Securities of that series;




	 




	 


	


	 


	the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Debt Securities of that series have made a written request of, and offered satisfactory indemnification to, the Trustee to begin such
	proceeding;




	 




	 


	


	 


	the Holders have offered the Trustee indemnification to the Trustees satisfaction with respect to compliance with the request;




	 




	 


	


	 


	the Trustee has not started such proceeding within 60 days after receiving the request; and




	 




	 


	


	 


	the Trustee has not received directions inconsistent with such request from the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Debt Securities of that series during those 60 days
	(Section 8.04).




	However, the Holder of any Debt Security will have an absolute right to receive payment of principal
	of and any premium and interest on the Debt Security when due and to institute suit to enforce such payment (Section 8.09).



	Street
	Name and Other Indirect Holders



	Investors who hold securities in accounts at banks or brokers generally will not be recognized
	by us as legal Holders of Debt Securities. This is called holding in Street Name. Instead, we would recognize only the bank or broker, or the financial institution that the bank or broker uses to hold its securities. These intermediary
	banks, brokers and other financial institutions pass along principal, interest and other payments on the Debt Securities, either because they agree to do so in their customer agreements or because they are legally required to. If you hold Debt
	Securities in Street Name, you should check with your own institution to find out:


	 




	 


	


	 


	how it handles payments and notices;




	 




	 


	


	 


	whether it imposes fees or charges;




	 




	 


	


	 


	how it would handle voting if applicable;




	 




	 


	


	 


	whether and how you can instruct it to send you Debt Securities registered in your own name so you can be a direct Holder as described below; and




	 




	 


	


	 


	if applicable, how it would pursue rights under your Debt Securities if there were a default or other event triggering the need for Holders to act to protect their interests.





	Direct Holders



	Our obligations, as well
	as the obligations of the Trustee under the Indenture and those of any third parties employed by us or the Trustee under the Indenture, run only to persons who are registered as Holders of Debt Securities issued under the Indenture. As noted above,
	we do not have obligations to you if you hold in Street Name or other indirect means, either because you choose to hold Debt Securities in that manner or because the Debt Securities are issued in the form of global securities as
	described below. For example, once we make payment to the registered Holder, we have no further responsibility for the payment even if that Holder is legally required to pass the payment along to you as a Street Name customer but does
	not do so.

	Book-Entry, Delivery and Form



	We have obtained the information in this section concerning DTC, Clearstream Banking S.A., or Clearstream, and Euroclear
	Bank S.A./N.V., as operator of the Euroclear System, or Euroclear, and the book-entry system and procedures from sources that we believe to be reliable, but we take no responsibility for the accuracy of this information.


	Unless otherwise specified in the applicable prospectus supplement, the Debt Securities will be issued as fully-registered global securities
	which will be deposited with, or on behalf of, DTC and registered, at the request of DTC, in the name of Cede & Co. Beneficial interests in the global securities will be represented through book-entry accounts of financial institutions
	acting on behalf of beneficial owners as direct or indirect participants in DTC. The direct and indirect participants will remain responsible for keeping account of their holdings on behalf of their customers. Investors may elect to hold their
	interests in the global securities through either DTC (in the United States) or (in Europe) through Clearstream or through Euroclear. Investors may hold their interests in the global securities directly if they are participants of such systems, or
	indirectly through organizations that are participants in these systems. Interests held through Clearstream and Euroclear will be recorded on DTCs books as being held by the U.S. depositary for each of Clearstream and Euroclear (the U.S.
	Depositories), which U.S. Depositories will, in turn, hold interests on behalf of their participants customers securities accounts. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable prospectus supplement, beneficial interests in the
	global securities will be held in denominations of $1,000 and multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. Except as set forth below, the global securities may be transferred, in whole and not in part, only to another nominee of DTC or to a successor of
	DTC or its nominee.


	Debt Securities represented by a global security can be exchanged for definitive securities in registered form only
	if:


	 




	 


	


	 


	DTC notifies us that it is unwilling or unable to continue as depositary for that global security and we do not appoint a qualified successor depositary within 90 days after receiving that notice;




	 




	 


	


	 


	at any time DTC ceases to be a clearing agency registered under the Exchange Act and we do not appoint a successor depositary within 90 days after becoming aware that DTC has ceased to be registered as a clearing
	agency;




	 




	 


	


	 


	we in our sole discretion determine that such global security will be exchangeable for definitive securities in registered form or elect to terminate the book-entry system through DTC and notify the trustee of our
	decision; or




	 




	 


	


	 


	an event of default with respect to the Debt Securities represented by that global security has occurred and is continuing.




	A global security that can be exchanged as described in the preceding sentence will be exchanged for definitive securities issued in authorized denominations
	in registered form for the same aggregate amount. The definitive securities will be registered in the names of the owners of the beneficial interests in the global security as directed by DTC.


	We will make principal and interest payments on all Debt Securities represented by a global security to the paying agent which in turn will
	make payment to DTC or its nominee, as the case may be, as the sole registered owner and the sole holder of the Debt Securities represented by a global security for all purposes under the Indenture. Accordingly, we, the trustee and any paying agent
	will have no responsibility or liability for:


	 




	 


	


	 


	any aspect of DTCs records relating to, or payments made on account of, beneficial ownership interests in a Debt Security represented by a global security;




	 




	 


	


	 


	any other aspect of the relationship between DTC and its participants or the relationship between those participants and the owners of beneficial interests in a global security held through those participants; or




	 




	 


	


	 


	the maintenance, supervision or review of any of DTCs records relating to those beneficial ownership interests.




	 


	16






	Table of Contents



	DTC has advised us that its current practice is to credit direct participants accounts on
	each payment date with payments in amounts proportionate to their respective beneficial interests in the principal amount of such global security as shown on DTCs records, upon DTCs receipt of funds and corresponding detail information.
	The underwriters or agents for the Debt Securities represented by a global security will initially designate the accounts to be credited. Payments by participants to owners of beneficial interests in a global security will be governed by standing
	instructions and customary practices, as is the case with securities held for customer accounts registered in street name, and will be the sole responsibility of those participants, and not of DTC or its nominee, the trustee, any agent
	of ours, or us, subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements. Book-entry notes may be more difficult to pledge because of the lack of a physical note.



	DTC



	So long as DTC or
	its nominee is the registered owner of a global security, DTC or its nominee, as the case may be, will be considered the sole owner and holder of the Debt Securities represented by that global security for all purposes of the Debt Securities. Owners
	of beneficial interests in the Debt Securities will not be entitled to have Debt Securities registered in their names, will not receive or be entitled to receive physical delivery of the Debt Securities in definitive form and will not be considered
	owners or holders of Debt Securities under the Indenture. Accordingly, each person owning a beneficial interest in a global security must rely on the procedures of DTC and, if that person is not a DTC participant, on the procedures of the
	participant through which that person owns its interest, to exercise any rights of a holder of Debt Securities. The laws of some jurisdictions may require that certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery of the securities in certificated
	form. These laws may impair the ability to transfer beneficial interests in a global security. Beneficial owners may experience delays in receiving distributions on their Debt Securities since distributions will initially be made to DTC and must
	then be transferred through the chain of intermediaries to the beneficial owners account.


	We understand that, under existing
	industry practices, if we request holders to take any action, or if an owner of a beneficial interest in a global security desires to take any action which a holder is entitled to take under the Indenture, then DTC would authorize the participants
	holding the relevant beneficial interests to take that action and those participants would authorize the beneficial owners owning through such participants to take that action or would otherwise act upon the instructions of beneficial owners owning
	through them.


	Beneficial interests in a global security will be shown on, and transfers of those ownership interests will be effected
	only through, records maintained by DTC and its participants for that global security. The conveyance of notices and other communications by DTC to its participants and by its participants to owners of beneficial interests in the Debt Securities
	will be governed by arrangements among them, subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements in effect.


	DTC has advised us that it is
	a limited-purpose trust company organized under the New York banking law, a banking organization within the meaning of the New York Banking Law, a member of the Federal Reserve System, a clearing corporation within the
	meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code and a clearing agency registered under the Exchange Act. DTC is a wholly owned subsidiary of The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (

	DTCC

	). DTCC is the
	holding company for DTC, National Securities Clearing Corporation and Fixed Income Clearing Corporation, all of which are registered clearing agencies. DTCC is owned by the users of its regulated subsidiaries.


	DTC holds the securities of its participants and facilitates the clearance and settlement of securities transactions among its participants in
	such securities through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of its participants. The electronic book-entry system eliminates the need for physical certificates. DTCs participants include securities brokers and dealers, including
	underwriters, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and certain other organizations, some of which, and/or their representatives, own DTCC. Banks, brokers, dealers,


	 


	17






	Table of Contents



	trust companies and others that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a participant, either directly or indirectly, also have access to DTCs book-entry system. The rules
	applicable to DTC and its participants are on file with the SEC.


	DTC has advised us that the above information with respect to DTC has
	been provided to its participants and other members of the financial community for informational purposes only and is not intended to serve as a representation, warranty or contract modification of any kind.



	Clearstream



	Clearstream
	has advised us that it is incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg as an international clearing system. Clearstream holds securities for its participating organizations, or Clearstream Participants, and facilitates the clearance and
	settlement of securities transactions between Clearstream Participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of Clearstream Participants, thereby eliminating the need for physical movement of certificates. Clearstream provides to
	Clearstream Participants, among other things, services for safekeeping, administration, clearance and settlement of internationally traded securities and securities lending and borrowing. Clearstream interfaces with domestic securities markets in
	several countries. As a professional depositary, Clearstream is subject to regulation by the Luxembourg Commission for the Supervision of the Financial Sector (Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier). Clearstream Participants are recognized
	financial institutions around the world, including underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and certain other organizations. Clearstreams U.S. Participants are limited to securities brokers
	and dealers and banks. Indirect access to Clearstream is also available to others, such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Clearstream Participant either directly or
	indirectly.


	Distributions with respect to Debt Securities held beneficially through Clearstream will be credited to cash accounts of
	Clearstream Participants in accordance with its rules and procedures, to the extent received by the U.S. Depositary for Clearstream.



	Euroclear



	Euroclear has
	advised us that it was created in 1968 to hold securities for participants of Euroclear, or Euroclear Participants, and to clear and settle transactions between Euroclear Participants through simultaneous electronic book-entry delivery
	against payment, thereby eliminating the need for physical movement of certificates and any risk from lack of simultaneous transfers of securities and cash. Euroclear performs various other services, including securities lending and borrowing and
	interacts with domestic markets in several countries. Euroclear is operated by Euroclear Bank S.A./N.V., or the Euroclear Operator, under contract with Euroclear plc, a U.K. corporation. All operations are conducted by the
	Euroclear Operator, and all Euroclear securities clearance accounts and Euroclear cash accounts are accounts with the Euroclear Operator, not Euroclear plc. Euroclear plc establishes policy for Euroclear on behalf of Euroclear
	Participants. Euroclear Participants include banks, including central banks, securities brokers and dealers and other professional financial intermediaries. Indirect access to Euroclear is also available to other firms that clear through or maintain
	a custodial relationship with a Euroclear Participant, either directly or indirectly. Euroclear is an indirect participant in DTC.


	The
	Euroclear Operator is a Belgian bank. As such, it is regulated by the Belgian Banking and Finance Commission and the National Bank of Belgium.


	Securities clearance accounts and cash accounts with the Euroclear Operator are governed by the Terms and Conditions Governing Use of
	Euroclear and the related Operating Procedures of the Euroclear System, and applicable Belgian law, which we will refer to herein as the Terms and Conditions. The Terms and Conditions govern transfers of securities and cash within
	Euroclear, withdrawals of securities and cash from Euroclear, and receipts of payments with respect to securities in Euroclear. All securities in Euroclear are held on


	 


	18






	Table of Contents



	a fungible basis without attribution of specific certificates to specific securities clearance accounts. The Euroclear Operator acts under the Terms and Conditions only on behalf of Euroclear
	Participants, and has no record of or relationship with persons holding through Euroclear Participants.


	Distributions with respect to
	Debt Securities held beneficially through Euroclear will be credited to the cash accounts of Euroclear Participants in accordance with the Terms and Conditions, to the extent received by the Euroclear Operator.


	Euroclear has further advised us that investors that acquire, hold and transfer interests in the Debt Securities by book-entry through
	accounts with the Euroclear Operator or any other securities intermediary are subject to the laws and contractual provisions governing their relationship with such intermediary, as well as the laws and contractual provisions governing the
	relationship between such an intermediary and each other intermediary, if any, standing between themselves and the global securities.



	Global Clearance
	and Settlement Procedures



	Unless otherwise specified in the applicable prospectus supplement, initial settlement for the Debt
	Securities will be made in immediately available funds. Secondary market trading between DTC participants will occur in the ordinary way in accordance with DTC rules and will be settled in immediately available funds using DTCs Same-Day Funds
	Settlement System. Secondary market trading between Clearstream Participants and/or Euroclear Participants will occur in the ordinary way in accordance with the applicable rules and operating procedures of Clearstream and Euroclear and will be
	settled using the procedures applicable to conventional eurobonds in immediately available funds.


	Cross-market transfers between persons
	holding directly or indirectly through DTC, on the one hand, and directly or indirectly through Clearstream Participants or Euroclear Participants, on the other, will be effected through DTC in accordance with DTC rules on behalf of the relevant
	European international clearing system by its U.S. Depositary; however, such cross-market transactions will require delivery of instructions to the relevant European international clearing system by the counterparty in such system in accordance with
	its rules and procedures and within its established deadlines (European time). The relevant European international clearing system will, if the transaction meets its settlement requirements, deliver instructions to its U.S. Depositary to take action
	to effect final settlement on its behalf by delivering or receiving Debt Securities through DTC, and making or receiving payment in accordance with normal procedures for same-day funds settlement applicable to DTC. Clearstream Participants and
	Euroclear Participants may not deliver instructions directly to their respective U.S. Depositaries.


	Because of time-zone differences,
	credits of Debt Securities received through Clearstream or Euroclear as a result of a transaction with a DTC participant will be made during subsequent securities settlement processing and dated the business day following the DTC settlement date.
	Such credits or any transactions in such Debt Securities settled during such processing will be reported to the relevant Euroclear Participants or Clearstream Participants on such business day. Cash received in Clearstream or Euroclear as a result
	of sales of Debt Securities by or through a Clearstream Participant or a Euroclear Participant to a DTC participant will be received with value on the DTC settlement date but will be available in the relevant Clearstream or Euroclear cash account
	only as of the business day following settlement in DTC.


	If the Debt Securities are cleared only through Euroclear and Clearstream (and
	not DTC), you will be able to make and receive through Euroclear and Clearstream payments, deliveries, transfers, exchanges, notices, and other transactions involving any securities held through those systems only on days when those systems are open
	for business. Those systems may not be open for business on days when banks, brokers, and other institutions are open for business in the United States. In addition, because of time-zone differences, U.S. investors who hold their interests in the
	securities through these systems and wish to transfer their interests, or to receive or make a payment or delivery or exercise any other right with respect to their interests, on a particular


	 


	19






	Table of Contents



	day may find that the transaction will not be effected until the next business day in Luxembourg or Brussels, as applicable. Thus, U.S. investors who wish to exercise rights that expire on a
	particular day may need to act before the expiration date.


	Although DTC, Clearstream and Euroclear have agreed to the foregoing
	procedures in order to facilitate transfers of Debt Securities among participants of DTC, Clearstream and Euroclear, they are under no obligation to perform or continue to perform such procedures and such procedures may be modified or discontinued
	at any time. Neither we nor any paying agent will have any responsibility for the performance by DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream or their respective direct or indirect participants of their obligations under the rules and procedures governing their
	operations.




	What is a Global Security?




	A global security is a special type of indirectly held Debt Security as described above under Street Name and Other
	Indirect Holders. If we choose to issue Debt Securities in the form of global securities, the ultimate beneficial owners can only hold the Debt Securities in Street Name. We would do this by requiring that the global security be
	registered in the name of a financial institution we select and by requiring that the Debt Securities included in the global security not be transferred to the name of any other direct Holder unless the special circumstances described below occur.
	The financial institution that acts as the sole direct Holder of the global security is called the depositary. Any person wishing to own a Debt Security issued in the form of a global security must do so indirectly by virtue of an
	account with a broker, bank or other financial institution that in turn has an account with the depositary. The applicable prospectus supplement will indicate whether a series of Debt Securities will be issued only in the form of global securities
	and, if so, will describe the specific terms of the arrangement with the depositary.




	Special Investor Considerations for Global Securities




	As an indirect holder, an investors rights relating to a global security will be governed by the account rules of the
	investors financial institution and of the depositary, as well as general laws relating to securities transfers. We do not recognize this type of investor as a holder of Debt Securities and instead deal only with the depositary that holds the
	global security.


	An investor should be aware that if a series of Debt Securities are issued only in the form of global securities:


	 




	 


	


	 


	the investor cannot get Debt Securities of that series registered in his or her own name;




	 




	 


	


	 


	the investor cannot receive physical certificates for his or her interest in the Debt Securities of that series;




	 




	 


	


	 


	the investor will be a Street Name holder and must look to his or her own bank or broker for payments on the Debt Securities of that series and protection of his or her legal rights relating to the Debt
	Securities of that series, as described under  Street Name and Other Indirect Holders;




	 




	 


	


	 


	the investor may not be able to sell interests in the Debt Securities of that series to some insurance companies and other institutions that are required by law to own their securities in the form of physical
	certificates; and




	 




	 


	


	 


	the depositarys policies will govern payments, transfers, exchange and other matters relating to the investors interest in the global security. We and the Trustee have no responsibility for any aspect of the
	depositarys actions or for its records of ownership interests in the global security. We and the Trustee also do not supervise the depositary in any way.




	 


	20






	Table of Contents





	Special Situations When The Global Security Will be Terminated




	In a few special situations, a global security will terminate, and interests in it will be exchanged for physical certificates representing
	Debt Securities. After that exchange, the choice of whether to hold Debt Securities directly or in Street Name will be up to the investor. Investors must consult their own bank or brokers to find out how to have their interests in Debt
	Securities transferred to their own name, so that they will be direct Holders. The rights of Street Name investors and direct Holders in Debt Securities have been previously described in subsections entitled Street
	Name and Other Indirect Holders and Direct Holders.


	The special situations for termination of a global
	security are:


	 




	 


	


	 


	when the depositary notifies us that it is unwilling, unable or no longer qualified to continue as depositary, and we do not appoint a successor depositary;




	 




	 


	


	 


	when an Event of Default on the series of Debt Securities has occurred and has not been cured; and




	 




	 


	


	 


	at any time if we decide to terminate a global security.




	The applicable prospectus supplement
	may also list additional situations for terminating a global security that would apply only to the particular series of Debt Securities covered by the prospectus supplement. When a global security terminates, only the depositary is responsible for
	deciding the names of the institutions that will be the initial direct Holders.








	DESCRIPTION OF WARRANTS



	The following description, together with the additional information that we include in any applicable prospectus supplements and in
	any related free writing prospectus that we may authorize to be distributed to you, summarizes the material terms and provisions of the warrants that we may offer under this prospectus. While the terms we have summarized below will apply generally
	to any warrants that we may offer under this prospectus, we will describe the particular terms of any warrants in more detail in the applicable prospectus supplement. The terms of any warrants offered under a prospectus supplement may differ from
	the terms described below.


	We will file as exhibits to the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part, or will incorporate
	by reference from reports that we file with the SEC, the form of warrant agreement that describes the terms of the warrants we are offering, and any supplemental agreements, before the issuance of the related warrants. The following summaries of
	material terms and provisions of the warrants are subject to, and qualified in their entirety by reference to, all the provisions of the warrant agreement and any supplemental agreements applicable to a particular warrant. We urge you to read the
	applicable prospectus supplements related to the particular warrants that we may offer under this prospectus, as well as any related free writing prospectuses and the complete warrant agreement and any supplemental agreements that contain the terms
	of the warrants.


	We may issue (either separately or together with other offered securities) warrants to purchase underlying debt
	securities, preferred stock, common stock or any combination thereof issued by us (offered warrants). Such warrants may be issued independently or together with any such securities and may be attached or separate from the securities. We
	may issue the warrants under separate warrant agreements (each a warrant agreement) to be entered into between us and a bank or trust company, as warrant agent (the warrant agent), identified in the prospectus supplement. The
	warrant agent will act solely as our agent and will not assume any obligation or relationship of agency for or with holders of beneficial owners of warrants.

	The prospectus supplement will also contain a

	Warrant certificates will be exchangeable for
	new warrant certificates of different denominations. No service charge will be imposed for any permitted transfer or exchange of warrant certificates, but we may require payment of any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection
	therewith. Warrants may be exercised and exchanged and warrants in registered form may be presented for registration of transfer at the corporate trust office of the warrant agent or any other office indicated in the prospectus supplement or term
	sheet.



	Exercise of Warrants



	Each
	offered warrant will entitle the holder thereof to purchase the amount of underlying debt securities, preferred stock, common stock or any combination thereof at the exercise price set forth in, or calculable from, the prospectus supplement relating
	to the offered warrants. After the close of business on the expiration date, unexercised warrants will be void.


	Warrants may be exercised
	by payment to the warrant agent of the applicable exercise price and by delivery to the warrant agent of the related warrant certificate, properly completed. Warrants will be deemed to have been exercised upon receipt of the exercise price and the
	warrant certificate or certificates. Upon receipt of this payment and the properly completed warrant certificates, we will, as soon as practicable, deliver the amount of underlying debt securities, preferred stock, common stock or any combination
	thereof purchased upon exercise.


	If fewer than all of the warrants represented by any warrant certificate are exercised, a new warrant
	certificate will be issued for the unexercised warrants. The holder of a warrant will be required to pay any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any transfer involved in the issuance of underlying debt securities,
	preferred stock, common stock or other combination thereof purchased upon exercise.

	Amendments and Supplements to Warrant Agreement



	We and the warrant agent may amend or supplement the warrant agreement for a series of warrants without the consent of the holders of the
	warrants issued thereunder to effect changes that are not inconsistent with the provisions of the warrants and that do not materially and adversely affect the interests of the holders of the warrants.



	No Rights as Holders of Underlying Debt Securities, Preferred Stock or Common Stock



	Before the warrants are exercised, holders of the warrants are not entitled to payments of principal of, premium, if any, or interest on the
	related underlying debt securities and dividends on the preferred stock, common stock or any combination thereof, as applicable, or to exercise any rights whatsoever as holders of the underlying debt securities, preferred stock or common stock.








	DESCRIPTION OF UNITS



	The following description, together with the additional information that we include in any applicable prospectus supplements and in any
	related free writing prospectus that we may authorize to be distributed to you, summarizes the material terms and provisions of the units that we may offer under this prospectus. While the terms we have summarized below will apply generally to any
	units that we may offer under this prospectus, we will describe the particular terms of any series of units in more detail in the applicable prospectus supplement. The terms of any units offered under a prospectus supplement may differ from the
	terms described below.


	We will file as exhibits to the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part, or will incorporate by
	reference from reports that we file with the SEC, the form of unit agreement that describes the terms of the series of units we are offering, and any supplemental agreements, before the issuance of the related series of units. The following
	summaries of material terms and provisions of the units are subject to, and qualified in their entirety by reference to, all the provisions of the unit agreement and any supplemental agreements applicable to a particular series of units. We urge you
	to read the applicable prospectus supplements related to the particular series of units that we may offer under this prospectus, as well as any related free writing prospectuses and the complete unit agreement and any supplemental agreements that
	contain the terms of the units.



	General



	We may issue units comprised of one or more of the securities offered hereby in any combination. Each unit will be issued so that the holder of
	the unit is also the holder of each security included in the unit. Thus, the holder of a unit will have the rights and obligations of a holder of each included security. The unit agreement under which a unit is issued may provide that the securities
	included in the unit may not be held or transferred separately, at any time or at any time before a specified date.


	We will describe in
	the applicable prospectus supplement the terms of the series of units being offered, including:


	 




	 


	


	 


	the designation and terms of the units and of the securities comprising the units, including whether and under what circumstances those securities may be held or transferred separately;




	 




	 


	


	 


	any provisions of the governing unit agreement that differ from those described below; and




	 




	 


	


	 


	any provisions for the issuance, payment, settlement, transfer or exchange of the units or of the securities comprising the units.




	 


	23






	Table of Contents



	The provisions described in this section, as well as those described under Description of
	Capital Stock, Description of Debt Securities, Description of Warrants and Description of Purchase Contracts will apply to each unit and to any common stock, preferred stock, debt security, purchase contract
	or warrant included in each unit, respectively.



	Issuance in Series



	We may issue units in such amounts and in such numerous distinct series as we determine.



	Enforceability of Rights by Holders of Units



	Each unit agent will act solely as our agent under the applicable unit agreement and will not assume any obligation or relationship of agency
	or trust with any holder of any unit. A single bank or trust company may act as unit agent for more than one series of units. A unit agent will have no duty or responsibility in case of any default by us under the applicable unit agreement or unit,
	including any duty or responsibility to initiate any proceedings at law or otherwise, or to make any demand upon us. Any holder of a unit may, without the consent of the related unit agent or the holder of any other unit, enforce by appropriate
	legal action its rights as holder under any security included in the unit.



	Title



	We, and any unit agent and any of their agents, may treat the registered holder of any unit certificate as an absolute owner of the units
	evidenced by that certificate for any purpose and as the person entitled to exercise the rights attaching to the units so requested, despite any notice to the contrary.





	DESCRIPTION OF PURCHASE CONTRACTS



	We will set forth in the applicable prospectus supplement a description of any purchase contracts that may be offered pursuant to this
	prospectus.








	SELLING SECURITY HOLDERS



	Up to 71,156,628 shares of common stock are being offered by this prospectus, all of which are being offered for resale for the account of the
	selling security holders. The selling security holders may, from time to time, offer and sell pursuant to this prospectus any or all of the shares of common stock being registered. When we refer to the selling security holders in this
	prospectus, we mean the security holder specifically identified in the table below, as well as the donees, pledgees, transferees or other successors-in-interest who later come to hold any of such selling security holders interests other than
	through a public sale. Any permitted donee, pledgee, transferee or other successor-in-interest that intend to offer or sell securities through this prospectus will be named in a prospectus supplement, if required.


	We cannot advise you as to whether the selling security holders will in fact sell any or all of the securities being registered. In addition,
	the selling security holders may have sold, transferred or otherwise disposed of, or may sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of, at any time and from time to time, the securities in transactions exempt from the registration requirements of the
	Securities Act after the date on which they provided the information set forth in the table below.


	To the extent that any of the selling
	security holders may be deemed to be an affiliate of a broker-dealer, (1) any such selling security holder purchased the securities being registered for resale in the ordinary course of business; and (2) at the time of purchase of the
	securities being registered for resale, the selling security holder had no agreements or understanding, directly or indirectly, with any person, to distribute the securities.


	 


	24






	Table of Contents



	All information with respect to common stock ownership of the selling security holders has been
	furnished by or on behalf of the selling security holders. We believe, based on information supplied by the selling security holders, that except as may otherwise be indicated in the footnotes to the table below, the selling security holders have
	sole voting and dispositive power with respect to the common stock reported as beneficially owned by them. Because the selling security holders identified in the table may sell some or all of the shares owned by them which are included in this
	prospectus, and because there are currently no agreements, arrangements or understandings with respect to the sale of any of the shares of common stock, no estimate can be given as to the number of shares of common stock, (or the percentage of our
	outstanding common stock) that will be held by the selling security holders upon termination of this offering. In addition, the selling security holders may have sold, transferred or otherwise disposed of, or may sell, transfer or otherwise dispose
	of, at any time and from time to time, the shares of common stock they hold in transactions exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act after the date on which they provided the information set forth on the table below. We have,
	therefore, assumed for the purposes of the following table, that the selling security holders will sell all of the shares owned beneficially by them that are covered by this prospectus.

	PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION




	General



	We may sell any combination of
	the securities offered pursuant to this prospectus through agents, through underwriters or dealers or directly to one or more purchasers, or through a combination of these methods.


	Underwriters, dealers and agents that participate in the distribution of the securities offered pursuant to this prospectus may be
	underwriters as defined in the Securities Act, and any discounts or commissions received by them from us and any profit on the resale of the offered securities by them may be treated as underwriting discounts and commissions under the Securities
	Act. If a material arrangement with any underwriter, broker, dealer or agent is entered into for the sale of the offered securities, a prospectus supplement will be filed, if necessary, under the Securities Act disclosing the material terms and
	conditions of such arrangement. Any underwriters or agents will be identified and their compensation (including underwriting discount) will be described in the prospectus supplement. The prospectus supplement will also describe other terms of the
	offering, including any discounts or concessions allowed or reallowed or paid to dealers and any securities exchanges on which the offered securities may be listed.


	The distribution of the securities offered under this prospectus may occur from time to time in one or more transactions at a fixed price or
	prices, which may be changed, at market prices prevailing at the time of sale, at prices related to such prevailing market prices or at negotiated prices.


	If the prospectus supplement indicates, we will authorize dealers or agents to solicit offers by certain institutions to purchase offered
	securities from us pursuant to contracts that provide for payment and delivery on a future date. We must approve all institutions, but they may include, among others:


	 




	 


	


	 


	commercial and savings banks;




	 




	 


	


	 


	insurance companies;




	 




	 


	


	 


	pension funds;




	 




	 


	


	 


	investment companies; and




	 




	 


	


	 


	educational and charitable institutions.




	An institutional purchasers obligations under
	any contract to purchase our securities will only be subject to the condition that the purchase of the offered securities at the time of delivery is allowed by the laws that govern the purchaser. The dealers and our agents will not be responsible
	for the validity or performance of these contracts.


	We may have agreements with the underwriters, dealers and agents to indemnify them
	against certain civil liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, or to contribute with respect to payments which the underwriters, dealers or agents may be required to make as a result of those certain civil liabilities.


	When we issue the securities offered by this prospectus, they may be new securities without an established trading market. If we sell a
	security offered by this prospectus to an underwriter for public offering and sale, the underwriter may make a market for that security, but the underwriter will not be obligated to do so and could discontinue any market making without notice at any
	time. Therefore, we cannot give any assurances to you concerning the liquidity of any security offered by this prospectus.


	Underwriters
	and agents and their affiliates may be customers of, engage in transactions with, or perform services for us or our subsidiaries in the ordinary course of their businesses.

	The Selling Security Holders Distributions



	The selling security holders, which as used herein includes donees, pledgees, transferees or other successors-in-interest selling shares of our
	common stock or interests in shares of our common stock received after the date of this prospectus from the selling security holders as a gift, pledge, partnership distribution or other transfer, may, from time to time, sell, transfer or otherwise
	dispose of any or all of their shares of our common stock or interests in shares of our common stock on any stock exchange, market or trading facility on which the shares are traded or in private transactions. These dispositions may be at fixed
	prices, at prevailing market prices at the time of sale, at prices related to the prevailing market price, at varying prices determined at the time of sale, or at negotiated prices.


	The selling security holders may use any one or more of the following methods when disposing of shares of our common stock or interests
	therein:


	 




	 


	


	 


	ordinary brokerage transactions and transactions in which the broker-dealer solicits purchasers;




	 




	 


	


	 


	one or more underwritten offerings;




	 




	 


	


	 


	block trades in which the broker-dealer will attempt to sell the shares as agent, but may position and resell a portion of the block as principal to facilitate the transaction;




	 




	 


	


	 


	purchases by a broker-dealer as principal and resale by the broker-dealer for its account;




	 




	 


	


	 


	an exchange distribution in accordance with the rules of the applicable exchange;




	 




	 


	


	 


	privately negotiated transactions;




	 




	 


	


	 


	short sales effected after the date the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part is declared effective by the SEC;




	 




	 


	


	 


	through the writing or settlement of options or other hedging transactions, whether through an options exchange or otherwise;




	 




	 


	


	 


	broker-dealers may agree with the selling security holders to sell a specified number of such shares at a stipulated price per share; and




	 




	 


	


	 


	a combination of any such methods of sale.




	The selling security holders may, from time to
	time, pledge or grant a security interest in some or all of the shares of our common stock owned by them and, if a selling security holder defaults in the performance of its secured obligations, the pledgees or secured parties may offer and sell the
	shares of our common stock, from time to time, under this prospectus, or under an amendment or supplement to this prospectus amending the list of the selling security holders to include the pledgee, transferee or other successors in interest as the
	selling security holders under this prospectus. The selling security holders also may transfer the shares of our common stock in other circumstances, in which case the transferees, pledgees or other successors in interest will be the selling
	beneficial owners for purposes of this prospectus.


	In connection with the sale of our common stock or interests therein, the selling
	security holders may enter into derivative or other hedging transactions involving the securities with third parties, or sell securities not covered by this prospectus to third parties in privately-negotiated transactions. In connection with those
	derivative transactions, the third parties may sell securities covered by this prospectus and any related prospectus supplement, including in short sale transactions, or may lend securities in order to facilitate short sale transactions by others.
	If so, the third party may use securities pledged by the selling security holders or borrowed from the selling security holders or others to settle those sales or to close out any related open borrowings of securities, and may use securities
	received from the Selling Securities in settlement of those derivative or hedging transactions to close out any related open borrowings of securities.


	 


	27






	Table of Contents



	The aggregate proceeds to the selling security holders from the sale of our common stock offered
	by them will be the purchase price of our common stock less discounts or commissions, if any. The selling security holders reserve the right to accept and, together with their agents from time to time, to reject, in whole or in part, any proposed
	purchase of our common stock to be made directly or through agents. We will not receive any of the proceeds from any offering by the selling security holders.


	The selling security holders also may resell all or a portion of the shares of our common stock in open market transactions in reliance upon
	Rule 144 under the Securities Act, provided that they meet the criteria and conform to the requirements of that rule, or pursuant to other available exemptions from the registration requirements of the Securities Act.


	The selling security holders and any underwriters, broker-dealers or agents that participate in the sale of our common stock or interests
	therein may be underwriters within the meaning of Section 2(11) of the Securities Act. Any discounts, commissions, concessions or profit they earn on any resale of the shares of our common stock may be underwriting discounts and
	commissions under the Securities Act. If any selling security holder is an underwriter within the meaning of Section 2(11) of the Securities Act, then the selling security holder will be subject to the prospectus delivery
	requirements of the Securities Act. Underwriters and their controlling persons, dealers and agents may be entitled, under agreements entered into with us and the selling security holders, to indemnification against and contribution toward specific
	civil liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act.


	To the extent required, the shares of our common stock to be sold, the
	respective purchase prices and public offering prices, the names of any agents, dealer or underwriter, and any applicable discounts, commissions, concessions or other compensation with respect to a particular offer will be set forth in an
	accompanying prospectus supplement or, if appropriate, a post-effective amendment to the registration statement that includes this prospectus.


	To facilitate the offering of the shares of our common stock offered by the selling security holders, certain persons participating in the
	offering may engage in transactions that stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the price of our common stock. This may include over-allotments or short sales, which involve the sale by persons participating in the offering of more shares than were
	sold to them. In these circumstances, these persons would cover such over-allotments or short positions by making purchases in the open market or by exercising their over-allotment option, if any. In addition, these persons may stabilize or maintain
	the price of our common stock by bidding for or purchasing shares in the open market or by imposing penalty bids, whereby selling concessions allowed to dealers participating in the offering may be reclaimed if shares sold by them are repurchased in
	connection with stabilization transactions. The effect of these transactions may be to stabilize or maintain the market price of our common stock at a level above that which might otherwise prevail in the open market. These transactions may be
	discontinued at any time.








	VALIDITY OF SECURITIES



	The validity of the securities described in this prospectus has been passed upon by Calfee, Halter & Griswold LLP, The Calfee
	Building, 1405 East Sixth Street, Cleveland, Ohio 44114.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
