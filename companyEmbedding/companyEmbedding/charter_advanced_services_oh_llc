On January 31, 2013, I ordered phone and internet services from a special I saw online after having two months of my internet having been down constantly with Windstream.  I was told that if I prepaid Charter $79.99, it would cover the $29.99 installation fee and I would not receive my first billing until April 6th.  I wrote this down not once, but twice, along with the date of documentation and confirmation number of my order.  I also received an email with the confirmation number of my order. I did use my debit card to prepay the $79.99. I received my first bill last week stating that it will be due March 19, only 13 days after my first 30 days' use of these services. Prepayment was applied to my first month's use from the date of installation, 2/7 to 3/6.  I understand that.  What I do NOT understand is why I am having to pay for a full month's service with payment due only 13 days from 3/7, the first day of my second month's service.   Their customer service rep kept repeating the same thing, about how "all cable companies charge in advance."  It sounded like he was reading it. The fact still remains.  I was told by the person from whom I ordered Charter, and I repeat, that I would receive my first bill April 6, 2014.  Am I wrong, or is this false advertising?  I told him it is and also told him they need to get together with the people who market their "online specials" and tell them to stop lying to their potential new customers.   I have read the forums and have heard all about how all cable companies charge in advance, ad nauseum.  I don't want to see or hear it again.  My service with Charter, thus far, has been great. The bottom line is this.  I don't being lied to. We're on a tight budget here and I did NOT calculate this into my budget this month.       This report was posted on Ripoff Report on 03/06/2014 01:45 PM and is a permanent record located here:

About Us



Booking commercial airline travel is easy. Booking a private jet charter is not.... We aim to change that.
Why should it be so tedious to book a private aircraft charter? We don't think it should be.Introducing JetCharters.com - our mission is to remove the mystery and put all the information on air charter and jet charter at your fingertips. That means with as little as one search or one phone call, you can research private planes available at charter airports around the world. Refine your search by airport, location, airplane type or whatever search criteria you choose, connect with the private charter operator and get ready to take your next trip.




Facts about private Jet Charters



A jet charter allows you access to 5000 destination charter airports vs. just 500.
Chartering a jet allows you to accomplish the most demanding business itinerary.
The service and convenience a private jet charter provides is unparalleled.
Whether a jet or air charter, travel anywhere, anytime on your schedule.
At private terminals, avoid crowded security lines of commercial airports and the jets they serve.
Your charter vacation starts the minute you board the private jet - not when you get to your destination.
You can have the charter operator plan catering aboard your next jet charter.
Travel with who you want aboard a charter jet.
Over 400 jets in our private jet search system. 

Jet Charters - taking the hassle out of planning your next private aircraft charter.
