Public Affairs / News & Announcements / 2014 / October / Willard H. Dere, M.D., to Lead Program in Personalized Health








Willard H. Dere, M.D., to Lead Program in Personalized Health Print Media ContactsWillard H. Dere, M.D., to Lead Program in Personalized HealthWillard H. Dere, M.D.Oct 31, 2014 4:17 PM(SALT LAKE CITY)—An internationally regarded medical researcher and leader in the biopharmaceutical industry, and former University of Utah School of Medicine faculty member and medical resident, Will H. Dere, M.D., FACP, will return to the University to lead the Program in Personalized Health beginning Nov. 1.
Dere comes to the University from Amgen, one of the world’s largest biopharmaceutical companies, where he has served in numerous executive positions, including head of global development; head of international medical; corporate chief medical officer; and international chief medical officer over an 11-year period.  Before that, at Eli Lilly, he served in numerous senior positions in endocrine research and development, regulatory affairs, and translational medicine.  During his 25 years in the pharma industry, Dere had the opportunity to lead the clinical development of three bone-active medicines, raloxifene, rPTH 1-34, and denosumab, and several others in the oncology, inflammation, and nephrology therapeutic areas. 
“There are immense opportunities with ongoing and planned initiatives here at the University of Utah to enhance our understanding of the genome and molecular biology, and to use this knowledge in a wise manner to individualize health care interventions,” Dere says. “I am delighted and honored by this opportunity to participate in these initiatives, and to work again with smart, collaborative colleagues at the University of Utah.”
Vivian S. Lee, M.D., Ph.D., M.B.A., University of Utah (U of U) senior vice president for health sciences, said Dere’s expertise in pharmaceutics, as well as his experience at the University, position him well to lead the personalized health program. “As a recognized leader in translation of genomic discovery to improved clinical care, Dr. Dere can build on our strengths to develop a personalized health initiative that will transform the way we practice health care,” she says.
Accepting the position in personalized health represents a homecoming for Dere, who received his internal medicine residency training at the U of U School of Medicine. After further training in endocrinology and metabolism at the University of California, San Francisco, he returned to the U of U to join the medical school faculty where he held a hospital appointment at the Veterans Affairs Salt Lake City Health System.

Medication dispensing apparatus with spring-driven locking feature enabled by administration of final dosePatent 7,517,334Issued: April 14, 2009Inventor(s): Jacobs; Alexander Thomas & Judson; Jared Alden & Row; Gordon DavidsonAssignee(s): Eli Lilly and CompanyA medication dispensing apparatus with a spring-driven locking feature includes a drive member movable in a distal direction within a housing, and a fluid container with a piston that is advanceable by the drive member (60) when such drive member is moved distally by a driving means. The apparatus includes a latching element (180) having a skid (190) that is slidable along a surface of the drive member as the drive member passes distally during advancement. The drive member is arranged with the skid so as to maintain a latching lip of the latching element against a spring force in a first position free of the driving means during dose preparing and injecting prior to a final dose administration. The skid-engaging surface shifts distally of the skid such that the skid passes beyond a proximal end of that surface upon administration of a final dose, whereby the latching lip is urged by the spring force from the first position to a second position to physically lock the driving means to prevent further dose preparing and injecting.Patent expiration dates:

Drug PatentA drug patent is assigned by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and assigns exclusive legal right to the patent holder to protect the proprietary chemical formulation. The patent assigns exclusive legal right to the inventor or patent holder, and may include entities such as the drug brand name, trademark, product dosage form, ingredient formulation, or manufacturing process A patent usually expires 20 years from the date of filing, but can be variable based on many factors, including development of new formulations of the original chemical, and patent infringement litigation.
Drug ExclusivityExclusivity is the sole marketing rights granted by the FDA to a manufacturer upon the approval of a drug and may run simultaneously with a patent. Exclusivity periods can run from 180 days to seven years depending upon the circumstance of the exclusivity grant.
RLDA Reference Listed Drug (RLD) is an approved drug product to which new generic versions are compared to show that they are bioequivalent. A drug company seeking approval to market a generic equivalent must refer to the Reference Listed Drug in its Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA).  By designating a single reference listed drug as the standard to which all generic versions must be shown to be bioequivalent, FDA hopes to avoid possible significant variations among generic drugs and their brand name counterpart.
