This Stock Has A 12.17% Yield And Sells For Less Than Book
Five Oaks Investment Corp has been named as a Top 10 Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT), according to Dividend Channel, which published its most recent ''DividendRank'' report. The report noted that among REITs, OAKS shares displayed both attractive valuation metrics and strong profitability metrics.

Five Oaks Investment Becomes Oversold

NEW YORK, Dec. 16, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Five Oaks Investment Corp. (NYSE:   OAKS) (the "Company") today announced that the Company's board of directors has authorized a stock repurchase program for up to $10 million of the Company's common stock.  Under the stock repurchase program, the Company may repurchase its common stock from time to time, in amounts, at prices and at such times as the Company deems appropriate, subject to market conditions and other considerations.  The Company's repurchases may be executed using open market purchases (including through 10b5-1 plans), privately negotiated transactions, accelerated share repurchase programs or other transactions. 
The Company also announced that its board of directors has declared monthly cash dividend rates for the first quarter of 2016 of $0.06 per share of common stock for the months of January, February and March:

In accordance with the terms of the 8.75% Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock ("Series A Preferred Stock") of the Company, the board of directors has also declared monthly cash dividend rates for the first quarter of 2016 of $0.1823 per share of Series A Preferred Stock:

The Company also announced that it has obtained approval from Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis to fund its acquisition of prime jumbo loans.  The amount of any such funding will be a function of several factors, including the Company's pledging of sufficient eligible collateral.
Lastly, the Company announced that Thomas M. Pearce Jr., a director of the Company since 2013, is stepping down from the Company's board of directors to dedicate his full time to his role as President and CEO of MAXEX and its upcoming launch of a multi-seller to multi-buyer exchange and clearing agent for residential mortgage loans.  "We have greatly benefited from having Tom on the Board and thank him for his many contributions since our IPO in 2013", said David Carroll, President and CEO of the Company, "and we look forward to Tom's successful launch of his business."

Reports Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2016 Financial Results And Announces Second Quarter 2017 Common and Preferred Stock DividendsPR NewswireMarch 16, 2017ReblogShareTweetShareNEW YORK, March 16, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Five Oaks Investment Corp. (OAKS) ("we", "Five Oaks" or "the Company") today announced its financial results for the fourth quarter and for the year ended December 31, 2016. For the fourth quarter, the Company reported GAAP net income of $10.6 million, or $0.72 per basic and diluted share, a comprehensive loss of $0.6 million, or $0.04 per basic and diluted share, and core earnings (1) of $2.8 million, or $0.19 per basic and diluted share. For the year, the Company reported GAAP net loss of $11.5 million, or $0.79 per basic and diluted share, a comprehensive loss of $20.4 million, or $1.39 per basic and diluted share, and core earnings (1) of $10.9 million, or $0.75 per basic and diluted share. The Company also reported a net book value of $6.00 per share on a basic and diluted basis at December 31, 2016, which reflects, in large part, the increase in the Company's share count resulting from the issuance of stock in connection with the payment of a deficiency dividend in December 2016, as well as the cash portion of this dividend.The Company also announced that on March 14, 2017, its board of directors declared monthly cash dividend rates for the second quarter of 2017 of $0.05 per share of common stock for the months of April, May and June. Further, in accordance with the terms of the 8.75% Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock ("Series A Preferred Stock"), the board of directors has also declared monthly cash dividend rates for the second quarter of 2017 of $0.1823 per share of Series A Preferred Stock.2016 and Subsequent Events SummaryRealized a negative economic return on our common stock of 16.0% for the year after accounting for dividends of $2.04. (2)On a pro forma basis, after adjusting our net book value per common share at September 30, 2016 for the cash and stock portions of the deficiency dividend paid in December 2016, the remaining change in net book value per share during the fourth quarter was $(0.19) per share on a basic and diluted basis.Continued the reduction of Non-Agency RMBS exposure from $121.5 million at December 31, 2015 to $12.8 million at December 31, 2016 (on a non-GAAP combined basis); since year end, we have sold $7.6 million of the remaining exposure, substantially completing our reduction in Non-Agency RMBS exposure.Continued to redeploy capital released from selling down our credit exposure into Agency RMBS, which increased from $375.3 million at December 31, 2015 to $790.2 million at December 31, 2016.  In order to minimize the potential impact of interest rate volatility, the increase was composed of purchases of Agency hybrid-ARMS.Commencing on August 1, 2016, we ceased to aggregate prime jumbo mortgage loans, and no longer maintain warehousing facilities to fund loan purchases.  The reduction in personnel and related business infrastructure expenses of the prime jumbo business will be substantially complete by March 31, 2017.On April 25, 2016, we effected a re-securitization of certain first loss Multi-Family MBS securities backed by Freddie Mac K Certificates with a certificate principal balance of approximately $32.1 million, permitting the repayment of all related repurchase agreement financing.  Additionally, on April 21, 2016, we sold first loss securities from another Freddie Mac K series transaction with a certificate balance of approximately $79.7 million, plus related interest-only securities, permitting the repayment of all related repurchase agreement financing.On November 9, 2016, we declared a deficiency dividend of $19,384,684, or $1.3275 per common share, which was paid by the issuance of 2,936,864 common shares at a price of $5.28 per share and the remainder of $3,878,042 in cash.  The deficiency dividend was paid in order to reduce our undistributed taxable income from 2013 and in accordance with REIT rules and regulations in connection with a determination of an inability to offset net gains realized on certain hedging transactions in 2013 against net capital losses realized on the sale of mortgage-backed securities.  We recorded a charge of $1.86 million in the third quarter for interest charges projected to be payable to the IRS in the first quarter of 2017. On March 8, 2017, we paid an amount of $2.01 million to the IRS, and accordingly will record an additional interest charge of $0.15 million in the first quarter.(1) Core Earnings is a non-GAAP measure that we define as GAAP net income, excluding impairment losses, realized and unrealized gains or losses on the aggregate portfolio and certain non-recurring upfront costs related to securitization transactions or other one-time charges. As defined, Core Earnings includes interest income or expense and premium income or loss on derivative instruments.(2) Economic return is a non-GAAP measure that we define as the sum of the change in net book value per common share and dividends declared on our common stock during the period over the beginning net book value per common share.Management ObservationsDavid Carroll, Five Oaks' Chairman and CEO commented: "The latter part of 2016 was certainly interesting and eventful for both the markets and for Five Oaks. The unanticipated election of Donald Trump was viewed positively for both equity and credit markets, and reflationary for fixed income markets. The 10-year treasury rose from a low of 1.59% to a high of 2.64%, representing a 105 bps low to high range. The 2/10's spread widened from 81 bps to as high as 136 bps. Typically such conditions are negative for levered buyers of fixed rate mortgages and hence mortgage REIT book values, while curve steepening is positive for re-investment opportunities. We believe the Fed will tighten a few times this year which is now reflected in the steepening curve and higher rates across the curve. We also believe the longer term direction of rates is highly dependent on the new administration's success in implementing its reflationary growth plans for the economy. Given the political gridlock we have seen over the last several years we would not be surprised to see implementation of the new administration's economic and fiscal plan take longer than the markets appear to be pricing in.After adjusting for the stock and cash components of our December 2016 deficiency dividend, our net book value per share was down approximately 3% from $6.19 to $6.00 in the fourth quarter. I believe that our performance in the quarter was solid given market volatility, due in significant part to our methodical and active hedging, focus upon intermediate floating-rate Agency hybrid securities and a tightening in credit spreads. Agency spreads tightened as rates increased and the curve steepened in the hybrid agency sector, while the 30-year Agency sector widened and extended into the sell-off. We continued to opportunistically sell down our legacy Non-Agency positions, which we exited completely in the first quarter of 2017, and also made opportunistic sales of our Multi-Family and new issue Non-Agency subordinate positions in order to further reduce our reliance on repo funding of credit risk assets. We reinvested proceeds into new issue Agency hybrids at yields and spreads we consider attractive as rates increased. Read MoreAs communicated previously, we intend to continue to focus on a business strategy that is both simpler to understand and more cost efficient. We now intend to focus our balance sheet assets primarily on intermediate Agency hybrid floating rate securities and Freddie Mac K-series Multi-Family exposure while looking also for term funded credit opportunities when they arise. Investing in Agency hybrid securities should allow us to capture yield while seeking to minimize extension risk. Hybrid securities also typically benefit from roll down the curve, which is amplified as the yield curve steepens - as it did particularly in the fourth quarter. Our simplified business strategy and exiting the prime jumbo aggregation business has allowed us to meaningfully bring down our expense base, a process we believe will be substantially completed by the end of the first quarter. We also booked our first meaningful volume of business as backstop guarantee provider for what we believe to be limited rep and warranty risk on prime jumbo residential mortgage loans sold through MAXEX's LNEX Exchange.Looking back on our full year 2016, I believe we have made great strides in simplifying our business model, improving our funding and liquidity and increasing the portfolio's cash generation capacity.  Although we are small, I believe our portfolio rebalancing has enhanced Five Oaks' positioning in the mortgage REIT sector heading into 2017".Investment Portfolio and Capital AllocationThe following table summarizes certain characteristics of our investment portfolio and the related allocation of our equity capital on a non-GAAP combined basis as of December 31, 2016:  For the year ended December 31, 2016   Agency MBS   Multi-Family MBS (1)(2)   Non-Agency RMBS (1)(2)   Residential Loans (3)   Unrestricted Cash  (4)   Total     Amortized Cost   795,655,962   90,738,821   27,870,354   7,807,893   27,534,374   949,607,404     Market Value   790,190,232   91,488,606   12,784,707   7,473,260   27,534,374   929,471,179     Repurchase Agreements   (755,221,000)   (42,277,000)   (7,313,000)   -   -   (804,811,000)     Hedges   7,050,943   1,002,870   -   -   -   8,053,813     Other (5)   5,811,542   (66,141)   191,955   14,293   (2,309,320)   3,642,329     Restricted Cash and Due to Broker   5,586,893   440,686   82,965   -   -   6,110,544     Equity Allocated   53,418,610   50,589,021   5,746,627   7,487,553   25,225,054   142,466,865        Debt/Net Equity (6)   14.14   0.84   1.27   -   -   5.65              For the Year Ended December 31, 2016   Agency MBS   Multi-Family MBS   Non-Agency RMBS   Residential   Loans (7)   Unrestricted Cash   Total     Yield on Earning Assets (8)   2.52%   8.45%   4.38%   17.53%   -   3.78%     Less Cost of Funds   0.71%   1.31%   1.10%   2.30%   -   0.82%     Net Interest Margin (9)   1.81%   7.14%   3.28%   15.23%   -   2.96%     (1)   Information with respect to Non-Agency RMBS and Multi-Family MBS, and the resulting total is presented on a non-GAAP basis.

These forward-looking statements include information about possible or assumed future results of the Company's business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations, plans and objectives. You can identify forward-looking statements by use of words such as "believe," "expect," "anticipate," "estimate," "plan," "continue," "intend," "should," "may" or similar expressions or other comparable terms, or by discussions of strategy, plans or intentions. Statements regarding the following subjects, among others, may be forward-looking: the return on equity; the yield on investments; the ability to borrow to finance assets; and risks associated with investing in real estate assets, including changes in business conditions, interest rates, the general economy and political conditions and related matters. Forward-looking statements are based on the Company's beliefs, assumptions and expectations of its future performance, taking into account all information currently available to the Company. Actual results may differ from expectations, estimates and projections and, consequently, you should not rely on these forward looking statements as predictions of future events. Forward-looking statements are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and are generally beyond the Company's control. Additional information concerning these and other risk factors are contained in the Company's most recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are available on the Securities and Exchange Commission's website at www.sec.gov.All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements that the Company makes, or that are attributable to the Company, are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary notice. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made. Except as required by law, the Company is not obligated to, and does not intend to, update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresFor financial statement reporting purposes, GAAP requires us to consolidate the assets and liabilities of the FREMF 2011-K13 Trust; FREMF 2012-KF01 Trust; and CSMC 2014-OAK1 Trust.  However, our maximum exposure to loss from consolidation of the consolidated trusts is limited to the fair value of our net investment therein. We therefore have also presented certain information as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 that includes our net investments in the consolidated trusts. This information as well as core earnings, economic return and comparative expenses constitute non-GAAP financial measures within the meaning of Item 10(e) of Regulation S-K, as promulgated by the SEC. While we believe the non-GAAP information included in this press release provides supplemental information to assist investors in analyzing that portion of our portfolio composed of Non-Agency RMBS and Multi-Family MBS, and to assist investors in comparing our results with other peer issuers, these measures are not in accordance with GAAP, and they should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, our financial information calculated in accordance with GAAP. Our GAAP financial results and the reconciliations from these results should be carefully evaluated.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

Five Oaks Investment Corp. Announces Pricing Of Additional Shares Of Common Stock









PR Newswire




Jun 16, 2017 6:30 AM EDT













 


















































  NEW YORK, June 16, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Five Oaks Investment Corp. (NYSE: OAKS) (the "Company") today announced that it has priced an underwritten public offering of 4,000,000 shares of its Common Stock (the "Common Stock") at $4.60 per share. In connection with the offering, the Company has granted the underwriters an option for 30 days to purchase up to an additional 15%, or 600,000 shares of the Common Stock.  The Common Stock is listed on the NYSE under the symbol "OAKS."  The Company intends to use the net proceeds from the offering to purchase agency RMBS, which are residential mortgage-backed securities, for which a U.S. Government agency such as Ginnie Mae or a federally chartered corporation such as Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, guarantees payments of principal and interest of the securities and for working capital and other general purposes. JMP Securities LLC is acting as book-running manager for the offering; Ladenburg Thalmann is acting as lead manager for the offering.  The underwriters may offer the shares to purchasers in one or more transactions directly or through agents, or through brokers in brokerage transactions on the New York Stock Exchange, or to dealers in negotiated transactions or in a combination of such methods of sale, at a fixed price or prices, which may be changed, or at market prices prevailing at the time of sale, at prices related to such prevailing market prices or at negotiated prices.  The offering is expected to close subject to customary closing conditions on June 21, 2017. A shelf registration statement (File No. 333-215234) relating to the securities being offered has been filed with and declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC").  This press release does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy, nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any state or other jurisdiction in which such an offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful before registration or qualification thereof under the securities laws of any such state or jurisdiction.
