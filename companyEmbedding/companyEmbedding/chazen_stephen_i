"Steve Chazen is an exceptional leader in the U.S. oil and natural gas industry," API President and CEO Jack Gerard said. "His passion, integrity and advocacy have been a positive force in helping shape America’s 21st century energy renaissance.” 
 
During Chazen's tenure at Occidental Petroleum, he enhanced the company's reputation as an innovative, well-run and socially responsible business. He built a company that is respected for the competency and work ethic of its staff. Mr. Chazen also recommended and implemented the company's acquisition and divestiture strategy, which was a key factor in Occidental's transformation into a major oil and gas company.
 
Chazen joined Occidental Petroleum in 1994 as Executive Vice President-Corporate Development. He held numerous positions prior to his promotion to President in 2007 and served as Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President-Corporate Development from 1999 to 2004, Chief Financial Officer and Senior Executive Vice President from 2004 to 2007, Chief Financial Officer from 2007 to 2010, and Chief Operating Officer from 2010 to 2011.
 
Before joining Occidental, Mr. Chazen was a Managing Director in Corporate Finance and Mergers and Acquisitions at Merrill Lynch. Mr. Chazen is a former Chairman of the American Petroleum Institute and continues to serve on its board, and he is a member of the National Petroleum Council.
 
API is the only national trade association representing all facets of the oil and natural gas industry, which supports 9.8 million U.S. jobs and 8 percent of the U.S. economy. API’s more than 625 members include large integrated companies, as well as exploration and production, refining, marketing, pipeline, and marine businesses, and service and supply firms.

News, Policy & Issues
The oil and natural gas industry shares a keen interest in the policy issues arena. As demand for energy to keep our homes, vehicles, and businesses running continues to increase, so does our advancement in technology, allowing us to provide safe, reliable, and affordable energy. While serious challenges face our nation on a variety of fronts, oil and natural gas industry representatives remain actively engaged with government leaders to ensure informed decision making so the energy needs of tomorrow are met. 
100 Days of Energy
Think about energy. It’s all around us – in fuels and products that make life better, more comfortable. Yet energy’s value goes even deeper: What do you want to do? Where do you want to go? What do you want to become? Energy is integrally involved in the answers to all three. It’s absolutely fundamental to both prosperity and opportunity.
American Energy
American Made Energy is our vision for the future. We can achieve this vision by unleashing the full benefit of developing U.S. oil and natural gas resources. But this will only happen if new policies are implemented to ensure effective regulation, if we proceed with vital infrastructure projects like the Keystone XL pipeline, and improve and accelerate the leasing and permitting process.
American Jobs
The oil and natural gas industry is the backbone of the American economy. What happens in the industry is felt throughout the entire economy. The oil and natural gas industry not only provides most of the energy that heats our homes, powers our factories and offices, and gets Americans to school and work, it also supports 9.2 million American jobs and supports more than $1 trillion of economic activity.
Energy Infrastructure
Oil and natural gas provide the majority of the energy American consumers’ need, and our nation’s energy infrastructure –including pipelines, railroads, highways, waterways and ports—make sure this energy is available when they need it.
Environment
Our members recognize their responsibility to work with the public, the government, and others to develop and to use natural resources in an environmentally sound manner while protecting the health and safety of our employees and the public. Industry practice has changed a lot in the past 50 years, even the past 10 years. Advancements in technology allow us to conduct many aspects of our operations far more efficiently than just a few years ago. This efficiency translates to smaller "footprints" (the amount of surface area disturbed), less waste generated, cleaner and safer operations, and greater compatibility with the environment.
Exploration & Production
Access to oil and natural gas resources is critical to supplying the energy needs of American consumers, business and homeowners.
Fuels & Renewable Policy
The oil and natural gas industry is dedicated meeting the energy challenges of the 21st century and ensuring that the transportation fuel needs of U.S. consumers are addressed in the decades ahead. Also, the oil and natural gas industry is the nation’s largest user of ethanol and is increasing the volume of renewable fuels in America's transportation fuel portfolio.
Hurricane Information
API helps the oil and natural gas industry gain a better understanding of the environmental conditions in and around the Gulf of Mexico during hurricane or tropical storm activity and then aids it to use that knowledge to make offshore and onshore facilities less vulnerable. API also collaborates with member companies, other industries and with federal, state and local governments to prepare for hurricanes and return operations as quickly and as safely as possible.
Hydraulic Fracturing
Hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling are safely unlocking vast U.S. reserves of oil and natural gas found in shale and other tight-rock formations. Developing energy from shale is an advanced process that uses the latest drilling technologies and equipment. 
Letters or Comments
See API letters and comments regarding government regulations and policies that impact the oil and natural gas industry.
Media
See the American Petroleum Institute’s news releases, infographics, and Media Department contact list.
Natural Gas Solutions
Clean. Reliable. Affordable.  These are the three big benefits of natural gas.  And together they continue to change the energy landscape in this country and beyond. American natural gas is a solution that has forever altered the world's energy equation.
Ozone NAAQs
National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) are air quality standards established by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) under the Clean Air Act.
Safety & System Integrity
America's oil and natural gas industry considers safety its top priority and is committed to developing the technologies, standards and best practices, and programs needed to help ensure that workplace safety is at the forefront of our activities.
Section 1504
API member companies have historically supported and continue to support payment transparency. Several API member companies are founding members of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative and engage in transparency initiatives in many countries.
State of American Energy
America runs on energy. Every moment of every day, energy is required for Americans to maintain their daily lives, and the majority of that energy is supplied by oil and natural gas. Oil and natural gas are integral to all aspects of the U.S. economy—and America’s economic recovery—as the success of any modern economy is dependent on reliable and affordable energy. Over the last 100 years, and well into the foreseeable future, oil and natural gas have and will continue to provide the energy America needs to succeed.
Taxes
America's oil and natural gas industry supports 9.8 million U.S. jobs and 8 percent of the U.S. economy.. Our industry provides higher-than-average wages and helps ensure our nation’s energy security. In the process, the industry generates tax revenues from operations and sales of products that contribute billions every year to federal, state and local governments.
Testimony & Speeches
See notable testimony by API spokespersons on energy issues.
Top Industry Policy Issues
The American people want an energy policy to develop our domestic oil and natural gas resources in an environmentally responsible way to power our nation's economy, create jobs, and enhance our nation’s energy security. See the top policy issues that impact the oil and natural gas industry and the American economy.
Trade
API supports free trade and the abolition of trade and investment restrictions on oil and natural gas goods and services and the liberalization of all trade in oil and natural gas. We support principles that achieve the objective of increasing trade in oil and natural gas, as well as principles that help to underpin investments in finding, developing, producing and transporting hydrocarbon resources.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/23/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

                                                    Shale producers say spending 'flexibility' key as oil prices drop
                                                


                                                    Reuters – 
                                                    4:25 PM ET 06/27/2017
                                                


U.S. shale oil producers plan to keep drilling new wells despite this month's crude price drop but expect to revisit spending should pricing remain below $45 a barrel for several months. "We will not drill into oblivion," Tim Dove, chief executive of Pioneer Natural Resources Co (PXD), told investors on Tuesday at a J.P. Morgan energy conference in New York.

















                                                    Big Oil turns to big data to save big money on drilling
                                                


                                                    Reuters – 
                                                    1:00 AM ET 06/23/2017
                                                


In today's U.S. shale fields, tiny sensors attached to production gear harvest data on everything from pumping pressure to the heat and rotational speed of drill bits boring into the rocky earth. The sensors are leading Big Oil's mining of so-called big data, with some firms envisioning billions of dollars in savings over time by avoiding outages, managing supplies and identifying safety hazards.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
