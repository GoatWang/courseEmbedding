entirety the First Restated Employment Agreement;

 

WHEREAS, the Company desires to
employ the Executive to devote full time to the business of the
Company as the President and Chief Investment Officer of the
Company on the terms and subject to the conditions hereinafter
stated; and

 

WHEREAS, the Executive desires to be
employed by the Company on the terms and subject to the conditions
hereinafter stated.

 

Accordingly, the parties hereto
agree as follows:

 

1.                                       
Term .  The Company hereby continues the
employment of the Executive, and the Executive hereby accepts such
continuation of employment, for a term ending on December 31,
2013 unless sooner terminated in accordance with the provisions of
Section 4 or Section 5 (the period during
which the Executive is employed hereunder being hereinafter
referred to as the “ Term ”).  The Term
shall be subject to automatic one-year renewals unless either party
hereto notifies the other, in accordance with Section 7.4, of
non-renewal at least ninety (90) days prior to the end of any such
Term.  Notwithstanding the employment of the Executive by the
Company, the Company shall be entitled to pay the Executive from
the payroll of any subsidiary of the Company.

 

2.                                       
Duties .  The Executive, in his capacity as
President and Chief Investment Officer, shall faithfully perform
for the Company the duties of said office and shall perform such
other duties of an executive, managerial or administrative nature
as shall be specified and designated from time to time by the Board
of Trustees of the Company (the “ Board ”)
(including the performance of services for, and serving on the
Board of Directors or a comparable governing body of, any
subsidiary or affiliate of the Company without any additional
compensation).  The Executive shall devote substantially all
of the Executive’s business time and effort to the
performance of the Executive’s duties hereunder, provided
that in no event shall this sentence prohibit the Executive from
performing personal and charitable activities and any other
activities approved by the Board, so long as such activities do not
materially and adversely interfere with the Executive’s
duties for the Company.  The Board may delegate its authority
to take any action
 






 
under this Agreement to the Compensation
Committee of the Board (the “ Compensation Committee
”).

 

3.                                       
Compensation
.

 

3.1                                 
Salary .  The Company shall pay the Executive
during the Term a base salary at the rate of $410,000 per annum
(the “ Annual Salary ”), in accordance with the
customary payroll practices of the Company applicable to senior
executives generally.  The Annual Salary may be increased
annually by an amount as may be approved by the Board or the
Compensation Committee, and, upon such increase, the increased
amount shall thereafter be deemed to be the Annual Salary for
purposes of this Agreement.

 

3.2                                 
Bonus .  During the Term, in addition to the
Annual Salary, the Executive will be eligible to participate in
(a) any formal annual bonus plan established by the
Compensation Committee for all executive officers in its sole and
absolute discretion (the “ Annual Bonus Plan ,”
and amounts paid thereunder are referred to as an “ Annual
Bonus ”) and (b) any formal long-term bonus or
incentive plans established by the Compensation Committee for all
executive officers in its sole and absolute discretion (the “
Long-Term Bonus Plans ,” and amounts paid thereunder
are referred to as “ Long-Term Bonus ”). 
The Annual Bonus Plans and the Long-Term Bonus Plans are referred
to as the “ Bonus Plans .”  The Executive
may be awarded such restricted shares, share options and other
equity-based awards under the Company’s equity compensation
plans (“ Equity Awards ”) as the Compensation
Committee determines to be appropriate in its sole
discretion.

 

3.3                                 
Benefits — In
Genera l.  The
Executive shall be permitted during the Term to participate in any
group life, hospitalization or disability insurance plans, health
programs, pension and profit sharing plans and similar benefits
that may be available to similarly situated senior executives of
the Company generally, on the same terms as may be applicable to
such other executives, in each case to the extent that the
Executive is eligible under the terms of such plans or
programs.  During the Term, the Company shall maintain
customary liability insurance for trustees and officers and list
the Executive as a covered officer.

 

3.4                                 
Vacation .  During the Term, the Executive shall be
entitled to vacation of four (4) weeks per year.

 

3.5                                 
Automobile
.  During the Term, the Company
will provide the Executive an allowance for the use of an
automobile (including the payment of vehicle insurance) in
accordance with the Company’s policy in effect from time to
time.  At the option of the Company, in lieu of providing such
allowance, the Company will provide the Executive with an
automobile of suitable standard to the Executive’s
position.

 

3.6                                 
Expenses .  The Company shall pay or reimburse the
Executive for all ordinary and reasonable out-of-pocket business
expenses actually incurred (and, in the case of reimbursement,
paid) by the Executive during the Term in the performance of the
Executive’s services under this Agreement, pursuant to the
Company’s standard expense reimbursement policy as in effect
from time to time, so long as the Executive provides proper
documentation establishing the amount, date and business purpose of
the expenses.

3.7                                 
Special Payment
.  Within thirty (30) days
after the date of this Agreement, the Company shall pay to the
Executive $51,000.

 

4.                                       
Termination upon Death or
Disability .  If the
Executive dies during the Term, the obligations of the Company to
or with respect to the Executive shall terminate in their entirety
except as otherwise provided under this Section 4
.  If the Executive becomes Disabled (as defined below), the
Company shall have the right, to the extent permitted by law, to
terminate the employment of the Executive upon notice in writing to
the Executive and such termination in and of itself shall not be,
nor shall it be deemed to be, a breach of this Agreement. 
“Disabled” means that the Executive, because of
sickness or injury, is not able to perform his material duties
under this Agreement for a period of one hundred twenty (120)
consecutive days or for a cumulative period of one hundred eighty
(180) days in any twelve-month period.

 

Upon death of the Executive or the
Company’s determination to terminate the employment of the
Executive because the Executive has become Disabled, then
(i) the Executive (or the Executive’s estate or
beneficiaries in the case of the death of the Executive) shall have
no right to receive any compensation or benefit hereunder on and
after the Effective Date of the Termination other than Annual
Salary earned and accrued under this Agreement prior to the
Effective Date of the Termination, any bonus for the prior fiscal
year awarded but not yet paid, other benefits, including payment
for accrued but unused vacation, earned and accrued under this
Agreement prior to the Effective Date of the Termination (and
reimbursement under this Agreement for expenses incurred but not
paid prior to the Effective Date of the Termination) and an amount
equal to the product of (x) the Executive’s target
annual bonus for the fiscal year of the Executive’s death or
in which the Executive became Disabled and (y) a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of days in the current fiscal year
through the Effective Date of the Termination, and the denominator
of which is 365, such amount to be paid to the Executive (or the
Executive’s estate or beneficiaries in the case of the death
of the Executive) within 30 days of the Effective Date of the
Termination; (ii) all Equity Awards held by the Executive
shall become fully vested and exercisable; and (iii) this
Agreement shall otherwise terminate upon the Effective Date of the
Termination and there shall be no further rights with respect to
the Executive hereunder (except as provided in
Section 7.14 ).  For purposes of this
Section 4 , the “ Effective Date of the
Termination ” shall mean the date of death or the date of
the Executive’s termination of employment on account of his
becoming Disabled.

 

For the avoidance of doubt, the
Executive acknowledges and agrees that the payments set forth in
this Section 4 constitute liquidated damages for
termination of his employment during the Term upon death or by
virtue of his becoming Disabled.

 

5.                                       
Other Terminations of
Employment .

 

5.1                                 
Termination for Cause
.  For purposes of this
Agreement, “ Cause ” shall mean:

 

(a)

(or pleading nolo contendere to) any felony or a misdemeanor
involving moral turpitude;
 
3 





 

(b)                                 
the Executive’s commission of
an act of fraud, theft or dishonesty related to the business of the
Company or its affiliates or the performance of the
Executive’s duties hereunder;

 

(c)                                  
the willful and continuing failure
or habitual neglect by the Executive to perform the
Executive’s duties hereunder other than in the event that the
Executive has become Disabled;

 

(d)                                 
any material violation by the
Executive of the covenants contained in Section 6 or in
the Amended and Restated Non-Competition Agreement dated as of the
date hereof between the Executive and the Company (the “
Restated Non-Competition Agreement ”); or

 

(e)                                  
the Executive’s willful and
continuing material breach of this Agreement.

 

For purposes of this
Section 5.1 , no act, or failure to act, by Executive
shall be considered “ willful ” unless committed
in bad faith and without a reasonable belief that the act or
omission was in the best interests of the Company or its
subsidiaries.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if there exists
(without regard to this sentence) an event or condition that
constitutes Cause under clause (c), (d) or (e) above, the
Executive shall have 30 days from the date written notice is given
by the Company of such event or condition to cure such event or
condition and, if the Executive does so, such event or condition
shall not constitute Cause hereunder.

 

5.2                                 
Termination for Good
Reason .  For
purposes of this Agreement, “ Good Reason ”
shall mean, unless otherwise consented to by the
Executive:

the material reduction of the
Executive’s authority, duties and responsibilities, or the
assignment to the Executive of duties materially and adversely
inconsistent with the Executive’s position or positions with
the Company and its subsidiaries, other than in the event that the
Executive has become Disabled;

 

(b)                                 
a material reduction in Annual
Salary of the Executive;

 

(c)                                  
the failure by the Company to obtain
an agreement from any successor to the business of the Company to
assume and agree to perform this Agreement;

 

(d)                                 
a requirement by the Company that
the Executive’s work location be moved more than fifty (50)
miles from the Company’s office where the Executive works
effective as of the date of this Agreement, unless the relocation
results in the work location being closer to Executive’s
residence; or

 

(e)                                  
the Company’s material and
willful breach of this Agreement (provided that a re-assignment of
the Executive’s role and responsibilities if he becomes
Disabled shall not, in and if itself, constitute a
breach).

 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if
there exists (without regard to this sentence) an event or
condition that constitutes Good Reason under clause (a), (b),
(d) or (e) above, the Company
 
4 





 
shall have 30 days from the date on which the
Executive gives the written notice thereof to cure such event or
condition and, if the Company does so, such event or condition

have no right to receive any compensation or benefit hereunder on
and after the Effective Date of the Termination other than Annual
Salary and other benefits, including payment for unused vacation
earned and accrued under this Agreement prior to the Effective Date
of the Termination and reimbursement under this Agreement for
expenses incurred but not paid prior to the Effective Date of the
Termination, but excluding any bonuses the Executive would have
been entitled to under the Bonus Plans; and (ii) this
Agreement shall otherwise terminate upon the Effective Date of the
Termination and the Executive shall have no further rights
hereunder (except as provided in Section 7.14 ). 
For purposes of this Section 5.3 , the “
Effective Date of the Termination ” shall mean the
date on which a notice of termination is given or any later date
(within thirty (30) days after the giving of such notice) set forth
in such notice of termination.

 

5.4                                 
Effect of Termination Without
Good Reason .  The
Executive may terminate his employment without Good Reason. 
If the Executive terminates the Executive’s employment with
the Company without Good Reason: (i) the Executive shall have

after the Effective Date of the Termination other than Annual

extent applicable generally to other peer employees of the Company
and its affiliated companies, as if the Executive’s
employment had not been terminated; provided ,
however , that if the Executive becomes reemployed with
