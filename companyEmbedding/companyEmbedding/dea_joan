EXETER, NH--(Marketwired - Feb 4, 2015) - Performance Sports
Group Ltd. (NYSE: PSG[1]) (TSX: PSG[2]), a leading developer
and manufacturer of high performance sports equipment and apparel,
today announced that it has appointed Joan Dea to the company's
board of directors.

consumer retail and financial services sectors. Most recently, Dea
served as Executive Vice President, Head of Strategic Management
and Corporate Marketing for BMO Financial Group. Prior to joining
BMO, Dea held multiple positions with Boston Consulting Group,
where she advised Fortune 500 companies on issues of global
competitiveness, leadership and performance in North America, Asia

leader in the Consumer Goods and Retail Practice, and founded the
firm's Canadian Financial Services practice. Dea also currently
serves on the boards of Charles Schwab Bank, Torstar Corporation

"We are pleased to welcome Joan to our board of directors and

company and was instrumental in building our company into what it
is today," Davis said. "Chris brought a high-level of expertise and
knowledge to the board and was extremely supportive of management
as well as many other members of the Performance Sports Group
team. Chris will be forever connected with the success of this
company and I personally thank him for all that he has done for
Performance Sports Group."
