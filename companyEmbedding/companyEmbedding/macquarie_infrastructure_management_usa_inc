Discover the Macquarie difference
At Macquarie we uncover the opportunities others may miss. That's because we know success comes from encouraging our people to think differently. Our culture promotes innovation and entrepreneurial drive within a strong risk management framework.




















Our organisation

Macquarie is a diversified financial group providing clients with asset management and finance, banking, advisory and risk and capital solutions across debt, equity and commodities.
The diversity of our operations, combined with a strong capital position and robust risk management framework, has contributed to our 48-year record of unbroken profitability.

Our organisation structure

Macquarie has a non-hierarchical organisational structure, split into five operating groups. The Executive Committee, a central group comprising the Managing Director, Deputy Managing Director, Head of Risk Management, Global Chief Operation Officer and heads of Macquarie's major operating groups, manage the organisation as a whole.
Individual businesses operate within Macquarie's operating groups. These businesses work closely together, specialising in defined product or market sectors, and are committed to their client's relationship with the Macquarie group.
Within overall guidelines and a strong risk management framework, the operating groups have substantial discretion in the way they manage their business activities. Great emphasis is placed on a client's relationship with Macquarie as a whole.
Four service groups provide the framework, infrastructure and support that the operating groups require to manage their business. These are the Corporate Operations, Financial Management, Legal and Governance, and Risk Management Groups.
 









Our support groups

Our businesses are supported by specialist global teams.

       Macquarie aims to deliver long term profitability and shareholder returns, while managing risk and observing expected standards of corporate governance.
