Scott Jeffrey Podell is probably the worst con-men I have ever come across.  he lies about anything to get money out of people.  He recently tried to sell fake art to some galleries and also took art on consignment from artists and never returned the works - instead later we found out he sold it and did not give any of the money to the artists.   Scott Podell and his girlfriend Samantha seem to work together conning individuals out of money to pay for their New York City lifestyle since Scott had to leave Los Angeles due to the large amount of people he conned out of money and personal belongings over the years there.  BEWARE OF ANY DEALS SCOTT PODELL BRINGS YOU - THEY ARE MOST LIKELY TOTAL LIES AND ONLY INTENDED TO ENRICH MR PODELL. Scott Podell also sells drugs - this is his main source of income.  A run of his record indicates he was arrested for a violent felony in California. [continued below]....
