Capital One® Secured Mastercard®


                                            I never had played in credit before, and someone suggested this card to me to build credit for the first time. I've been really satisfied for the most part. They report quickly and accurately, remind me when my bill is due, and the customer service has been kind and thorough....show more

Walmart® Credit Card


                                            My husband called a customer service dealing with our balance. We've had this card for over 4 years and have only missed one payment. And have not used this card in over 2 years. This is our debt, and we do without some things to make sure it gets paid here lately. He told...show more

AAA Insurance


                                            I submitted a claim for a burglary in April. The beginning of this joke is that the girl that answered the 800 number didn't know where claims were sent. She had me send my claim to the Walnut Creek, California office. When I contacted the adjuster IN OKLAHOMA CITY, he said...show more

Stay far, far away from this nightmare of an experience from the website to the customer service line to the joke of a mobile app. Overdraft fees are insane at $37, sometimes more if they cover it.

                                            While the card offers nice perks, just like every other crappy card, there are hidden fees. I purchased 1400 dollars worth of stuff, and believing I had 12 months to pay off, I didn't worry about it for the first two months. The next time I looked they had hit me with 100$...show more

Wells Fargo


                                            I find it quite disturbing to see 24 one star, the lowest, ratings on the first page of Wallet Hub's most recent reviews of Wells Fargo. Somehow, in its overall summary, Wallet Hub still gives the impression Wells Fargo is a good banking option. What's going on here?
