History


Founded in 1989, Lombardia Capital Partners has been offering investment management services for over 25 years. LCP manages approximately $1.4 billion* for institutional, public, corporate, multi-employer, and not-for-profit clients. Our senior portfolio management team has an average of 30 years of industry experience. LCP is employee owned and has offices in Southern California and Chicago, IL.
In 2003, the investment professionals of CIC/HCM Asset Management and Waite & Associates, two large cap value managers based in Los Angeles, joined Valenzuela Capital Partners. In 2006, a change in ownership brought a new firm name: Lombardia Capital Partners.
LCP chose its corporate name to honor the history and ever-changing nature of investments. The first merchant banks can be traced back to the Lombard plains of the Middle Ages. After 613, many of the displaced Jews who had fled Spanish persecution entered the trade, bringing to it ancient business customs originating along the Silk Road. The key innovations of calculating present values, discounting notes, and holding money against a bill originated in Lombardia and soon spread to the other great financial markets, eventually to Lombard Street in London and on to the New World.
LCP’s long track record has been generated through a consistent, research-driven investment process.

Our Investment Process

 LCP offers three investment products: Small Cap Value, Small Cap Core and International Equity Value. We place a high premium on deep fundamental research, arriving independently at expectations of a company’s normalized profit and returns. After analyzing a universe appropriate to the respective product, we construct screens to identify undervalued businesses. We then determine if there will be an extended period of earnings and cash flow growth.
We implement our value investing philosophy through:
Deep fundamental research.  Our research is rigorous, independent, and objective.  Valuations drive our investment decisions as we focus on company and industry fundamentals rather than temporary, short-lived impairments to securities. 
Group vetting.  Investment committee members each face a high level of scrutiny for portfolio candidates as well as existing holdings. Our culture allows us to thoroughly and honestly challenge each other’s investment theses. 
A long-term view.  In valuing securities, we determine normalized earnings many years out, looking past a company’s tribulations and taking advantage of our patience. Under our model, portfolios and the relevant universe are constantly reviewed for the stocks that offer the highest discounts to intrinsic value.

About Us

LCP manages approximately $2.1 billion* for institutional public, corporate, and foundation clients. Our senior portfolio management team has an average of 30 years of industry experience. LCP is 100% employee owned and has offices in Pasadena, CA and Chicago, IL.
LCP chose its corporate name to honor the history and ever-changing nature of investments, whose roots can be traced to the Middle Ages when the first merchant banks were formed to facilitate trade in the cereal crops of the Lombard plains. After 613, many of the displaced Jews who had fled persecution in Spain entered the trade. They brought to it ancient business customs that had grown to normalcy along the Silk Road to finance the long distance transport of goods. The key innovations of calculating present values, discounting “billetes,” or notes, written by brokers in the actual grain, and holding money against a bill (later, a note, a letter of formal exchange, a bill of exchange, and later still, a check), flourished in Lombardia and soon spread to the other great financial bourses of Florence, Genoa, Burgos, Antwerp, Amsterdam, and eventually to Lombard Street in London, and from there to satellite financial centers in Scotland, Ireland, back to Spain and Portugal, and on to the New World.
With the Lombardia name, we acknowledge that we are merely transitory fiduciaries of the investment profession, and we salute all those who brought the flame and passion of investments to us.

Financial advisors use their knowledge of investments, 
tax laws, and insurance to recommend financial options to individuals.
The SEC typically regulates investment advisers that have assets under management in excess of $25,000,000. Investment advisers that do not meet this threshold generally are regulated by the states. The SEC registers IA firms but does not separately register individual representatives of IA firms. The states register IA firms, and many separately register individual investment adviser representatives.

Currently, you can only search for IA firms on this website. In the future, this website also will provide the ability to search for individual investment adviser representatives.

In 1996 Congress amended the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 to require that the SEC establish a readily accessible electronic process to respond to public inquiries about investment advisers and their disciplinary information. The SEC created this website to satisfy Congress? mandate.

LCP may also provide customized portfolios..LCP's Small Cap Value, Small Cap Core, Large Cap Value and All Cap Value Strategies focus on buying stocks at a discount to their estimate of the true worth of the business, or intrinsic value. Stocks are sold as they become fully priced, have a change to the original thesis or when a better investment opportunity is identified. These strategies invest in stocks with attractive valuations and identifiable future earnings and cash flow growth. These strategies cover the market-cap spectrum over $100 million. The Small Cap Core Portfolio typically holds 70-85 positions and is benchmarked against the Russell 2000 Index. The Large Cap Core Portfolio typically holds 30-40 positions and is benchmarked against the Russell 1000 Value Index. The All Cap Value Equity Portfolio typically holds 15-20 of the highest conviction names across LCP's Small and Large Cap Value strategies. It is benchmarked against the Russell 3000 Index. LCP’s International Equity Value (IEV) and Global Equity Value (GEV) strategies utilize a fundamental, bottom-up, Graham and Dodd, deep-absolute value approach to identify investment opportunities. The strategies seek to achieve long-term capital appreciation. The IEV strategy invests only in the equity securities of non-US companies. The GEV strategy invests in the equities of US and non-US companies. Both portfolios are usually invested 40 to 60 issues. Typically, no more than 5% of the value of each portfolio's total assets are invested in any one security at the time of purchase.
