WCAS’s strategy is to (i) buy growth businesses, (ii) partner with outstanding management teams, and (iii) build value for the WCAS’s investors through a combination of operational improvements, internal growth initiatives, and strategic acquisitions. WCAS differentiates itself from other private equity firms by industry specialization, investment track record, growth oriented and operational focus, repeat management teams, and the continuity and financial commitment of WCAS.

The Resources Group assists the firm’s portfolio companies by identifying and implementing initiatives focused on growth and operational improvement. The Resources Group works with the firm’s investment professionals and portfolio company management teams to develop value maximization plans ("VMPs") for each new investment. These VMPs are unique for each portfolio company and encompass a wide range of strategic initiatives, including revenue enhancement and cost management strategies, corporate governance, motivation of key management team members, financial reporting dashboards, as well as potential acquisitions and integration timelines.

WCAS was formed in 1979 by three founders, Patrick Welsh, Russell Carson, and Bruce Anderson. Patrick Welsh and Russ Carson had previously served as President and Chairman of Citicorp Venture Capital. Bruce Anderson was formerly Executive Vice President of Automatic Data Processing. WCAS was originally a venture capital firm, and WCAS’s first Equity Partnership totaled $33 million in commitments. In 1979, Richard Stowe joined WCAS as a General Partner, having worked previously at New Court Securities Corporation, now Rothschild Inc.
Today, WCAS has been in business for over 38 years, having raised over $22 billion of capital in 12 equity partnerships and four subordinated debt partnerships. WCAS has 15 General Partners, who work in New York and San Francisco offices.

Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe to Acquire Majority Position in Spine Firm K2M














LEESBURG, VA … July 8, 2010 – K2M, Inc. (“K2M” or the “Company”), a spinal device company developing innovative solutions for the treatment of complex spinal pathologies, and Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe (“Welsh Carson”), a leading private equity firm, have entered into a transaction in which Welsh Carson will acquire the outstanding stock and become the majority shareholder of K2M, along with longtime K2M investor, Ferrer Freeman & Co., and K2M’s management.
Under this agreement, K2M’s global headquarters will remain in Leesburg, Virginia, and the Company will continue to operate under its existing management team led by Eric Major, President and CEO, and Dr. John Kostuik, Chief Medical Officer. The Welsh Carson investment will allow K2M to substantially scale its business to meet the high demand for its innovative product portfolio by expanding its worldwide sales force and accelerating the research and development of its next generation technologies.
“K2M has proven over the past several years to be one of the most innovative and fastest growing spine companies in the industry. We are excited to add K2M to our portfolio of medical device companies,” said Paul Queally, Welsh Carson Co-President.
“We are extremely proud that Welsh Carson, a world class private equity firm, has decided to back K2M to serve as the foundation platform to aggressively scale and become a leader in the spine market,” stated Eric Major. “In a relatively short period of time, we have built a profitable organization that has experienced rapid growth since its inception. June was another record breaking sales month for K2M. This strategic transaction will enable us to leverage the success of our existing business and reaffirm our commitment to becoming a leader in the global spine market. Welsh Carson has the unique combination of investment expertise, industry focus, and capital resources to react quickly to prospective opportunities and provide significant strategic and operational value to K2M.”
Dr. John Kostuik added, “This agreement with Welsh Carson will allow us to expand our R&D efforts and portfolio of differentiated technologies to enhance global patient care, which will always remain K2M’s number one priority.”
The transaction is expected to close at the end of July. Piper Jaffray & Co. served as the exclusive financial advisor to K2M in this transaction.
