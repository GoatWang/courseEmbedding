Muscarinic receptor antagonists



Patent number:  5281601
                                            

Abstract:  A series of novel 3-phenyl-3-[1-(cyclicalkyl)pyrrolidin-3-yl]glutarimide derivatives have been prepared, including their pharmaceutically acceptable salts. The cyclic moiety present in these compounds is derived from either benzene or a heteroaryl such as benzofuran or 2,3-dihydrobenzofuran, or it is derived from an aromatic heterocyclic such as pyridine, pyrazine or thiophene, and it is attached to the adjacent alkyl group of the molecule by means of one of the available ring carbon atoms situated in the aromatic ring of the aforementioned cyclic ring moiety. These particular compounds are useful in therapy as selective muscarinic receptor antagonists, which are selective for smooth muscle muscarinic sites over cardiac muscarinic sites and therefore, are of value in the treatment of diseases associated with altered motility and/or smooth muscle tone as found in the gut, trachea and bladder. Methods for preparing these compounds from known starting materials are provided.
