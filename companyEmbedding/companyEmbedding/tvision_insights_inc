Investor
Online advertising is built from the ground up with robust data that allows advertisers to deeply understand users’ engagement with their ads. At a very basic level, impressions and click-through rates, all correlated with user data, have become the driver... more for billions of dollars of automated ad spend. Very little of this real-time, impression data exists in television ad spending, yet TV ad spending is the largest advertising market in the world. TVision started with a simple proposition to understand 3 basic principles:Who is in the room with the television?How engaged are each of these people with the shows and ads?What is their emotional reaction from the content?Building insight through these questions will be the future of television media planning. We're excited about TVision vision and passion to creatively apply new technology and data platforms to rethink television audience measurement!
