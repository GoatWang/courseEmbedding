This report is not for commercial use. Thorough reviews have been conducted to assure this data accurately reflects disclosures. However for a complete and definitive understanding of the pay practices of any company, users should refer directly to the actual, complete proxy statement. 
Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement. You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code). You may also find the annual proxy statement by going directly to the company's website.
What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.

AMENDED AND
RESTATED

EMPLOYMENT
AGREEMENT

THIS AMENDED AND RESTATED EMPLOYMENT
AGREEMENT (this “Agreement”) by and between LHC Group,
Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Company”), and Keith
G. Myers (“Executive”), is dated as of January 1,
2011 (the “Agreement Date”).

BACKGROUND

WHEREAS, the Company and the
Executive are parties to that certain Employment Agreement dated as
of January 1, 2008 (the “Original Agreement”),
pursuant to which the Executive currently serves as the chief
executive officer of the Company;

WHEREAS, the Original Agreement will
expire by its terms on December 31, 2010, and the Company
desires to retain the services of the Executive and engage
Executive as Chief Executive Officer from and after the Agreement
Date, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and Executive
is willing to serve as such in accordance with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement;

WHEREAS, the Original Agreement, and
any other prior employment agreements between Executive and the
Company, shall be terminated upon the Agreement Date and neither
party shall have any further obligations under any such terminated
employment agreements.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of
the foregoing and of the mutual covenants and agreements set forth
herein, and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto
agree as follows:

1. Effective Date . The
Original Agreement originally became effective as of
January 1, 2008 (the “Effective Date”) with a term
expiring on December 31, 2010. This Agreement, which amends
and restates the Original Agreement, is effective as of the
Agreement Date.

2. Employment . Executive is
hereby employed as Chief Executive Officer. In his capacity as
Chief Executive Officer, Executive shall have the duties,
responsibilities and authority commensurate with such position as
shall be assigned to him by the Board of Directors of the Company.
In his capacity as Chief Executive Officer of the Company,
Executive will report directly to the Board of Directors of the
Company.

3. Term . Executive’s
employment shall be governed by the terms and conditions of this
Agreement for a period beginning on the Agreement Date and ending
on December 31, 2013 (“Term”). Beginning on
January 1, 2014, and on each subsequent January 1, the
Term shall, without further action by Executive or the Company, be
extended by an additional one-year period ; provided,
however, that either the Company or the Executive may, by
notice to the other given at least six months prior to the
scheduled expiration of the then-current Term, cause the Term to
cease to extend automatically. Upon such notice, the Term shall
terminate upon the expiration of the then-current Term, including
any prior extensions. Notwithstanding the
 
1


foregoing, following the occurrence of a Change
of Control, the Company may not cause the Term to expire earlier
than the second anniversary of the Change of Control.

4. Extent of Service . During
the Term, and excluding any periods of vacation, holiday, sick
leave and Company-approved leave of absence to which Executive is
entitled in accordance with Company policies, Executive agrees to
devote substantially all of his business time, attention, skill and
efforts exclusively to the faithful performance of his duties
hereunder. It shall not be a violation of this Agreement for
Executive to (i) devote reasonable time to charitable or
community activities, (ii) serve on corporate, civic,
educational or charitable boards or committees, subject to the
Company’s standards of business conduct or other code of
ethics, (iii) deliver lectures or fulfill speaking engagements
from time to time on an infrequent basis, and/or (iv) manage
personal business interests and investments, subject to the
Company’s standards of business conduct or other code of
ethics, and so long as such activities do not interfere in a
material manner or on a routine basis with the performance of
Executive’s responsibilities under this Agreement.

5. Compensation and Benefits
.

(a) Base Salary . During the
Term, the Company will pay to Executive base salary at the rate of
U.S. $585,000 per year (“Base Salary”), less normal
withholdings, payable in approximately equal bi-weekly or other
installments as are or become customary under the Company’s
payroll practices for its employees from time to time. The
compensation committee of the Board of Directors of the Company (or
the full Board, if there is no compensation committee) shall review
Executive’s Base Salary annually and may increase (but not
decrease) Executive’s Base Salary from year to year. Such
adjusted salary then shall become Executive’s Base Salary for
purposes of this Agreement. The annual review of Executive’s
salary by the Board will consider, among other things,
Executive’s own performance, and the Company’s
performance.

(b) Incentive, Savings and
Retirement Plans . During the Term, Executive shall be entitled
to participate in all incentive, savings and retirement plans,
practices, policies and programs available to senior executive
officers of the Company (“Peer Executives”). Without
limiting the foregoing, the following shall apply:

(i) during the Term, Executive will
be entitled to participate in the Company’s executive bonus
plan, pursuant to which he will have an opportunity to receive an
annual cash bonus based upon the achievement of performance goals
established from year to year by the compensation committee of the
Board of Directors of the Company (such bonus earned at the stated
“goal” level of achievement being referred to herein as

Company representing 35% or more of the combined voting power of
the Company’s then outstanding securities eligible to vote
for the election of directors (the “Company Voting

Company, (C) an acquisition by any employee benefit plan (or
related trust) sponsored or maintained by the Company or any

of, respectively, the then outstanding shares of common stock and
the combined voting power of the then outstanding voting securities
entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, as the
case may be, of the entity resulting from or surviving such
Reorganization, Sale or Acquisition (including, without limitation,
an entity which as a result of such transaction owns the Company or
all or substantially all of the Company’s assets or stock
either directly or through one or more subsidiary entities, the
“Surviving Entity”) in substantially the same
proportions as their ownership, immediately prior to such
Reorganization, Sale or Acquisition, of the outstanding Company
Common Stock and the outstanding Company Voting Securities, as the
case may be, and (B) no person (other than (x) the
Company or any subsidiary of the Company, (y) the Surviving
Entity or its ultimate parent entity, or (z) any employee
benefit plan (or related trust) sponsored or maintained by any of
the foregoing) is the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of
35% or more of the total common stock or 35% or more of the total
voting power of the outstanding voting securities eligible to elect
directors of the Surviving Entity, and (C) at least a majority
of the members of the board of directors of the Surviving Entity
were Incumbent Directors at the time of the Board’s approval
of the execution of the initial agreement providing for such
Reorganization, Sale or Acquisition (any Reorganization, Sale or
Acquisition which satisfies all of the criteria specified in (A),
(B) and (C) above shall be deemed to be a
“Non-Qualifying Transaction”); or

(d) approval by the members or
stockholders of the Company, as the case may be, of a complete
liquidation or dissolution of the Company.

(iii) any failure to abide by any
material laws applicable to him in his capacity as an employee or
executive of Company or applicable to Company or any of its parents
or subsidiaries;

(iv) any failure or refusal on the
part of Executive to perform his duties under this Agreement or to
obey lawful directives from the Board of Directors of Company, or
either of their designees, if not remedied within ten
(10) business days after Company’s providing notice
thereof;

(v) any violation of any policy of
Company relating to equal employment opportunity, harassment,
business conduct or conflict of interest;

(vi) use of illegal drugs, abuse of
other controlled substances or working under the influence of
alcohol or other controlled substances; and
 
5



(vii) any breach by Executive of any
obligation under this Agreement if not remedied within ten
(10) business days after Company’s providing notice
thereof.

(d) Termination by Executive
. Executive’s employment may be terminated by Executive
during the Term for Good Reason or no reason. For purposes of this
Agreement, unless written consent of Executive is obtained,
“Good Reason” shall mean:

(i) a material reduction by the
Company in Executive’s Base Salary as in effect on the
Effective Date (which reduction in base salary is not permitted by
Section 5(a) hereof) or as the same may be increased from time
to time;

(ii) any failure by the Company to
comply with and satisfy 16(c) of this Agreement; or

(iii) the material breach by the
Company of any of the financial obligations of Company set forth in
this Agreement.

Any claim of “Good
Reason” under this Agreement shall be communicated by
Executive to the Company in writing, which writing shall
specifically identify the factual details concerning the event(s)
giving rise to Executive’s claim of Good Reason under this
Section 7(d). The Company shall have an opportunity to cure
any claimed event of Good Reason within 30 days of such notice from
Executive. Good Reason shall cease to exist for an event or
condition described in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) above
on the 90th day following its occurrence, unless Executive has
given the Company written notice thereof prior to such
date.

(e) Notice of Termination .
Any termination by the Company for Cause, or by Executive for Good
Reason, shall be communicated by Notice of Termination to the other
party hereto given in accordance with Section 17(f) of this
Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, a “Notice of
Termination” means a written notice which (i) indicates
the specific termination provision in this Agreement relied upon,
(ii) to the extent applicable, sets forth in reasonable detail
the facts and circumstances claimed to provide a basis for
termination of Executive’s employment under the provision so
indicated, and (iii) specifies the termination date. The
failure by Executive or the Company to set forth in the Notice of
Termination any fact or circumstance which contributes to a showing
of Good Reason or Cause shall not waive any right of Executive or
the Company, respectively, hereunder or preclude Executive or the
Company, respectively, from asserting such fact or circumstance in
enforcing Executive’s or the Company’s rights
hereunder.

(f) Date of Termination .
“Date of Termination” means (i) if
Executive’s employment is terminated by the Company for
Cause, or by Executive for Good Reason, the date of receipt of the
Notice of Termination or a date within 30 days after receipt of the
Notice of Termination, as specified in such notice, (ii) if
Executive’s employment is terminated by the Company other
than for Cause or Disability, the Date of Termination shall be the
date of receipt of the Notice of Termination or a date within 90
days after receipt of the Notice of Termination, as specified in
such notice, (iii) if Executive’s employment is
terminated by reason of death or Disability, the Date of
Termination shall be the date of death of Executive or the
Disability Effective Date, as the case may be, and (iv) if
Executive’s employment is terminated by
 
6


Executive without Good Reason, the Date of
Termination shall be 60 days following the Company’s receipt
of the Notice of Termination, unless the Company specifies an
earlier Date of Termination.

8. Obligations of the Company
upon Termination .
 

(a) Termination by Executive for
Good Reason; Termination by the Company Other Than for Cause or
Disability . If, during the Term, the Company shall terminate
Executive’s employment other than for Cause or Disability, or
Executive shall terminate employment for Good Reason within a
period of 180 days after the occurrence of the event giving rise to
Good Reason, then and, with respect to the payments and benefits
described below, only if Executive executes a Release in
substantially the form of Exhibit A hereto (the
“Release”):

(i) the Company shall provide to
Executive in a single lump sum cash payment within 30 days after
the Date of Termination, or if later, within five days after the
Release becomes effective and nonrevocable (but in no event shall
such amount be payable later than March 15 of the year
following the year in with the Executive’s employment was
terminated), the aggregate of the following amounts:

A. the sum of the following amounts,
to the extent not previously paid to Executive (the “Accrued
Obligations”): (1) Executive’s Base Salary through
the Date of Termination, and (2) any accrued pay in lieu of
unused vacation (in accordance with the Company’s vacation
policy; and

B. a severance payment as determined
pursuant to clause (x) or (y) below, as
applicable:

(x) if the Date of Termination
occurs before, or more than two years after, the occurrence of a
Change of Control, the severance payment shall be the product of
1.5 times the sum of (i) Executive’s Base Salary in
effect as of the Date of Termination (ignoring any decrease in
Executive’s Base Salary unless consented to by Executive),
and (2) the greater of the average of the annual cash bonuses
earned by Executive for the two fiscal years in which annual
bonuses were paid immediately preceding the year in which the Date
of Termination occurs, or Executive’s Target Bonus for the
year in which the Date of Termination occurs; or

(y) if the Date of Termination
occurs within two years after the occurrence of a Change of
Control, the severance payment shall be the product of 2.5 times
the sum of (1) Executive’s Base Salary in effect as of
the Date of Termination, and (2) the greater of the average of
the annual bonuses earned by Executive for the two fiscal years in
which annual bonuses were paid immediately preceding the year in
which the Date of Termination occurs, or Executive’s Target
Bonus for the year in which the Date of Termination occurs;
and

(ii) the Company shall pay to
Executive, in a single lump sum cash payment at the time that
annual bonuses are paid to Peer Executives, or such later date as
may be required pursuant to Section 17(i), an annual bonus for
the year in which the Date of
 
7



Termination occurs, equal to
(i) the bonus, if any, that would have been earned by
Executive under the annual incentive bonus plan for such year if he
had remained employed on such payment date, based on actual
performance under applicable financial metrics, multiplied by
(ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days
worked by Executive during such final year and the denominator of
which is 365 (the “Prorated Final Year Bonus”);
and

(iii) to the extent not theretofore
paid or provided, the Company shall timely pay or deliver, as
appropriate, all other benefits due to the Executive pursuant to
any employee benefit plans or incentive plans maintained by the
Company with respect to services rendered by the Executive prior to
the Date of Termination (such other amounts and benefits shall be
hereinafter referred to as the “Other
Benefits”).

(iv) In addition to the payments and
benefits described in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) above,
the Executive shall be entitled to the following additional
benefits:

A. If the Date of Termination occurs
within two years after the occurrence of a Change of Control, all
grants of stock options and other equity awards granted by the
Company and held by Executive as of the Date of Termination will
become immediately vested and exercisable as of the Date of
Termination and, to the extent necessary, this Agreement is hereby
deemed an amendment of any such outstanding stock option or other
equity award;

B. If the Date of Termination occurs
before a Change of Control or two years following the occurrence of
a Change of Control, then, except as provided below, all grants of
stock options and other equity awards granted by the Company and
held by Executive as of the Date of Termination will remain
outstanding and will (i) continue to vest and become
exercisable in accordance with their current vesting schedule
provided that Executive continues to comply with the provisions of
Article 14 hereof following the Date of Termination and during the
Restricted Period (and any unvested award shall be forfeited in the
event Executive breaches any of the provisions of Article 14 during
such period), and (ii) continue to vest and become exercisable
in accordance with their current vesting schedule without condition
following the end of the Restricted Period provided that Executive
complied with the provisions of Article 14 hereof during the
Restricted Period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Executive
incurs a tax liability with respect to an award of restricted stock
prior to the time the restrictions on such restricted stock would
lapse in accordance with this Section 8(a)(iv)(B), the
restrictions shall lapse on the date such tax liability arises with
respect to the number of whole shares of the Company’s common
stock having a fair market value at such time no greater than the
amount required to satisfy all tax withholding requirements
applicable thereto. The Company shall withhold such released shares
to satisfy such withholding obligations, and any unvested shares of
restricted stock will be subject to the remaining vesting schedule.
To the extent necessary, this Agreement is hereby deemed an
amendment of any such outstanding stock option or other equity
award; and

C. If Executive elects to continue
participation in any group medical, dental, vision and/or
prescription drug plan benefits to which Executive
and/or
 
8



Executive’s eligible
dependents would be entitled under Section 4980B of the Code
(COBRA), then during the period that Executive is entitled to such
coverage under COBRA (the “Coverage Period”), the
Company shall pay the excess of (i) the COBRA cost of such
coverage, over (ii) the amount that Executive would have had
to pay for such coverage if he had remained employed during the
Coverage Period and paid the active employee rate for such
coverage, provided, however , that the cost so paid on
behalf of Executive by the Company will be deemed taxable income to
Executive to the extent required by law, and provided,
further , that if Executive becomes eligible to receive group
health benefits under a program of a subsequent employer or
otherwise (including coverage available to Executive’s
spouse), the Company’s obligation to pay the cost of health
coverage as described herein shall cease, except as otherwise
provided by law.

If Executive’s employment is
terminated by the Company without Cause prior to the occurrence of
a Change of Control and if it can reasonably be shown that
Executive’s termination (i) was at the direction or
request of a third party that had taken steps reasonably calculated
to effect a Change of Control after such termination, or
(ii) otherwise occurred in anticipation of a Change of
Control, and in either case a Change of Control as defined
hereunder does, in fact, occur, then Executive shall have the
rights described in this Section 8(a) as if the Change of
Control had occurred on the date immediately preceding the Date of
Termination.

Executive acknowledges and agrees
that the receipt of severance benefits provided in this
Section 8(a) constitutes consideration for the restrictions on
the conduct of Executive contained in Section 14 of this
Agreement.

(b) Death or Disability . If
Executive’s employment is terminated by reason of his death
or Disability during the Term, all grants of stock options and
other equity awards granted by the Company and held by Executive
will become immediately vested and exercisable as of the Date of
Termination (and this Agreement is hereby deemed an amendment of
any such outstanding stock option or other equity award to the
extent necessary), and this Agreement shall terminate without
further obligations to Executive or his estate, beneficiaries or
legal representatives, other than for payment of Accrued
Obligations and the timely payment or provision of Other Benefits.
Accrued Obligations shall be paid to Executive or his estate,
beneficiary or legal representative, as applicable, in a lump sum
in cash within 30 days of the Date of Termination. With respect to
the provision of Other Benefits, the term Other Benefits as used in
this Section 8(b) shall include, without limitation, and
Executive or his estate, beneficiaries or legal representatives, as
applicable, shall be entitled to receive, benefits under such
plans, programs, practices and policies relating to death,
disability or retirement benefits, if any, as are applicable to
Executive or his family on the Date of Termination.

(c) Cause, Voluntary Termination
without Good Reason or Retirement . If Executive’s
employment shall be terminated for Cause during the Term, or if
Executive voluntarily terminates employment during the Term without
Good Reason or by reason of his Retirement, this Agreement shall
terminate without further obligations to Executive, other than for
payment of Accrued Obligations and the timely payment or provision
of Other Benefits.

(d) Expiration of Term Following
Notice . If either party gives notice under Section 3 to
cause the Term to cease to extend automatically, this Agreement

An employment agreement is a document which delineates the terms of the relationship between an employer and employee. If you are hiring a new employee, this document can help form a solid foundation for your business relationship. The document will specify expectations for both parties and may include items such as terms of conduct, employee benefits, vacation time, medical leave, hours, and other issues that may be up for consideration, depending on the business' needs.

An employment agreement might also incorporate arbitration conditions, confidentiality terms and non-compete clauses, provided that separate documents do not address these issues. Some employers may include a progressive disciplinary policy section in the agreement, wherein conditions and repercussions for employee misconduct are explained.

Once signed, an employment agreement is a legally binding contract that can be enforced in a court of law. Often an employer or company makes their offer of employment contingent on an employee signing the agreement.
