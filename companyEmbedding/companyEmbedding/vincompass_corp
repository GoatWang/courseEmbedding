We're almost finished with this section!
We can't wait to reveal what we have in store for you!
            




Discover

	With the rise of such unprecedented access come too many choices. Restaurant wine lists can seem like a set of encyclopedias, and regardless of your level of wine knowledge, choosing a wine in your restaurant of choice can be intimidating.

	VinCompass can help.

	Whether you wish to visit a Michelin-starred restaurant in a new city or your favorite neighborhood bistro, VinCompass can help you discover the greatest wine you have never had or your favorite wine producer in multiple vintages.

	The VinCompass mobile application will quickly present to you a list of nearby restaurants, whose wine lists you can peruse before you even walk in the door.

	Before the sommelier hands you the wine list, VinCompass will help select your ideal bottle based on your wine tastes and food preferences.

	Never fear the wine list again. 



Archive
Snap a photo of the label. Add the wine to your wish list for future purchasing. You can quickly retrieve this information from your phone while walking through a wine shop, or from the VinCompass website in the comfort of your home. 
With VinCompass, you will spend less time trying to remember the wine and more time enjoying it.  



Socialize
Wine is an inherently social beverage, best enjoyed in the company of family and friends (though sipping a glass or two alone after a long day of making business deals is certainly permissible). 
Once you have discovered and archived your wine, you can use VinCompass to share your wine experience with friends in your social networks. 
Whether your preferred network is Affluence, Twitter, Facebook, or LinkedIn, you have the opportunity to include your contacts in your wine discoveries.  



Acquire
Your restaurant wine experience need not end with the empty bottle. 
Once the dishes have been cleared away, you can revisit VinCompass and place an order for the wine that enlivened your evening. Once VinCompass receives your request, our staff will endeavor to have your desired quantity sent to your door as quickly as possible.

Fear of the Wine List (FoWL™) Research White Paper
 VinCompass Corp. announced the release of a research study that indicated that 92% of consumers experience anxiety when pairing wine in a restaurant. This phenomenon, Fear Of the Wine List (FoWL™), is pervasive across all age and financial demographics. Consumers are faced with millions of wine choices in tens of thousands of restaurants with limited time to choose, resulting in a billion dollar a month opportunity for a company that can solve this anxiety.
 

VinCompass is the first comprehensive wine app available on the market to address this phenomenon. “There is only one real pain point in the consumer experience, and it is often when a consumer is in a white table cloth restaurant and staring at wines they don’t understand. The only app, though through an invite-only, closed network, trying to fix that goal is VinCompass,” said Paul Mabray, Chief Strategy Officer of VinTank, now a W2O Group company.

The Opinions takes up to 2 years worth of historical data and runs these prices through thirteen different technical indicators. After each calculation the program assigns a buy, sell or hold value for each study, depending on where the price lies in reference to the common interpretation of the study. Barchart Opinions are not a recommendation to buy or sell a security.

The Opinions takes up to 2 years worth of historical data and runs these prices through thirteen different technical indicators. After each calculation the program assigns a buy, sell or hold value for each study, depending on where the price lies in reference to the common interpretation of the study. For example if the price is above the moving average of the stock then this is generally considered an upward trend or a buy. Note: A security needs to have at least 101 active trading days in order to generate an Opinion reading. Calculations The Short, Medium and Long term indicators are grouped together and calculated separately for their groups. The overall indicator is a composite of all 13 studies listed on the page.  A Buy is assigned 1 point A Sell is assigned -1 point A Hold is assigned 0 points  The indicator value is determined by adding up the totals for the different groups and dividing this sum by the number of studies in the group, The indicator is expressed in terms of a percentage. If the total is greater than zero, then this is a Buy. If the total is zero, then this is a Hold. If the total is less than zero, then this is a Sell. To keep the results in a more logical format, we factor the overall opinion by 1.04 to keep the end result in multiples of 8 percentage points, with the exception of a 100% buy or sell. This is why the opinion indicators will be displayed as 8%, 16%, ... 88%, 96% and 100%, for example, rather the exact percentage value. Opinions are updated every ten minutes throughout the day, using delayed data from the exchanges.Support and Resistance This section shows a snapshot view of the Trader's Cheat Sheet with the Last Price, and four separate pivot points (2 Support Levels, and 2 Resistance Points). The Last Price shown is the last trade price at the time the quote page was displayed, and will not update every 10 seconds (as the Last Price at the top of the Quote page does). The Last Price will update only when the page is refreshed. Pivot points are used to identify intraday support, resistance and target levels. The pivot point and its support and resistance pairs are defined as follows, where H, L, C are the current day's high, low and close, respectively. Support and Resistance points are based on end-of-day prices and are intended for the current trading session if the market is open, or the next trading session if the market is closed.   Pivot Point: (P) = (H + L + C) / 3 First Resistance Level: (R1) = (2 * P) - L First Support Level: (S1) = (2 * P) - H Second Resistance Level: (R2) = P + (R1 - S1) Second Support Level: (S2) = P - (R1 - S1) Signal Strength The signal strength is a long-term measurement of the strength of the signal compared to the strength of the signal historically. The strength can be one of the following five readings:  Maximum Strong Average Weak Minimum   Maximum is the strongest this signal has been in the historical period, and minimum is the weakest the signal has been in the historical period. The stronger a signal strength, the less volatile the signal. For example, a maximum buy signal is less likely to change to a hold or a sell signal than a weak buy signal. A hold signal does not have any strength. Signal Direction  Buy/Sell Signal Direction The signal direction is a short-term (3-day) measurement of the current movement of the signal. Regardless if signal is a buy or sell, the direction is an indication of whether the most recent price movement is going along with the signal. The buy/sell direction can be one of the following five readings:  Strongest Strengthening Average Weakening Weakest  A buy signal with a "strongest" direction means a buy signal which is becoming stronger. Similarly, a sell signal with a "strongest" direction is becoming stronger. The direction goes with the signal. Hold Signal Direction The signal direction of a hold signal is a short-term (3-day) measurement of where the signal is heading, be it toward a buy signal or a sell signal. The hold direction can be one of the following five readings:  Bullish Rising Steady Falling Bearish  A bullish hold signal indicates that the signal is heading toward a buy configuration, and a bearish hold signal indicates that the signal is heading toward a sell configuration.  Barchart Opinion & Trading Performance Barchart Opinions add market-timing information by calculating and interpreting signal strength and direction.
