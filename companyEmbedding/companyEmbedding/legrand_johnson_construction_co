Written by Concrete News 



Published: 24 September 2015 














Denver-based Summit Materials Inc. has acquired LeGrand Johnson Construction Co., serving northern and central Utah, western Wyoming and southern Idaho through four ready mixed concrete, five sand & gravel and five asphalt plants. The Logan, Utah, operator becomes the 12th brand integrated with Kilgore Companies, an Intermountain platform launched in 2009 and now spanning upwards of 20 ready mixed and 20 aggregate sites, plus newer asphalt capacity.
“This acquisition is consistent with our materials-based growth strategy and a great fit with our Kilgore business in Utah and surrounding states,” says Summit CEO Tom Hill. “LeGrand has established many strong customer relationships and an excellent reputation for high-quality products and services over its long history.”
The deal enables the business to continue what LeGrand Johnson CEO Larry Jardin notes is “the legacy of its founders, LeGrand and LaRee Johnson, and their family members who, together with hundreds of employees over the years, have worked so hard to make the company a success.” Tags:  Summit Materials  LeGrand Johnson Construction  Kilgore Companies  Related Articles   New FHWA index measures materials’ steady cost escalation...

BBB Accreditation





                This Business Is Not BBB Accredited
            

                
                Businesses are under no obligation to seek BBB accreditation, and some businesses are not accredited because they have not sought BBB accreditation.
            

                To be accredited by BBB, a business must apply for accreditation and BBB must determine that the business meets
                BBB accreditation standards, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses must pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB: 
1. meet all applicable standards within this Code of Business Practices

                            2. cooperate with BBB's activities and efforts to promote voluntary self- regulation within the business' industry
                        
3. honor any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process

                            4. complete the required application and pay all monetary obligations to BBB in a timely manner
                        









Advertise Honestly









            Adhere to established standards of advertising and selling.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Follow federal, state/provincial and local advertising laws.
                

                    2. Abide by the BBB Code of Advertising. Supply, upon request, substantiation for advertising and selling claims. Correct advertising and selling practices, when recommended by BBB.
                
3. Adhere to applicable BBB industry codes of advertising.
4. Cooperate with BBB self-regulatory programs for the resolution of advertising disputes.
5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

                    6. Avoid misleading customers by creating the false impression of sponsorship, endorsement, popularity, trustworthiness, product quality or business size through the misuse of logos, trustmarks, pictures, testimonials, or other means
                







Tell the Truth









            Honestly represent products and services, including clear and adequate disclosures of all material terms.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Make known all material facts in both written and verbal representations, remembering that misrepresentation may result not only from direct statements but by omitting or obscuring relevant facts.
                

                    2. Ensure that any written materials are readily available, clear, accurate and complete.
                







Be Transparent









            Openly identify the nature, location, and ownership of the business, and clearly disclose all policies, guarantees and procedures that bear on a customer's decision to buy.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Upon request, provide BBB with all information required to evaluate compliance with BBB standards. This may include, but is not limited to business name, address and contact information; names and background of principles; business and banking references; licensing and/or professional accreditation; and a complete description of the nature of the business.
                

                    2. Clearly disclose to customers:

                    
1. direct and effective means to contact the business
2. terms of any written contract
3. any guarantees or warranties accompanying a product

                            4. any restrictions or limitations imposed (e.g. limited supply,maximum number available per customer)
                        
5. the business' return/refund policy

                            6. any recurring commitment into which the customer may be entering, including information on how future billing will occur
                        
7. total cost of the transaction, including tax, shipping and handling, and other related charges



                    3. If selling products or providing services on Web sites or via other electronic means:

                            2. disclose the nature and terms of shipping, including any known delays or shortages of stock
                        
3. provide an opportunity to review and confirm the transaction before the sale is completed

                            4. provide a receipt summarizing the transaction after the purchase
                        









Honor Promises









            Abide by all written agreements and verbal representations.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 
1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached. 2. Honor representations by correcting mistakes as quickly as possible.







Be Responsive









            Address marketplace disputes quickly, professionally, and in good faith.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Promptly respond to all complaints forwarded by BBB by: 
1. Resolving the complaint directly with the complainant and notifying BBB, or

                            2. Providing BBB with a response that BBB determines: 

                                    1. is professional,
                                
2. addresses all of the issues raised by the complainant,
3. includes appropriate evidence and documents supporting the business' position, and

                                    4. explains why any relief sought by the complainant cannot or should not be granted.
                                





                    2. Make a good faith effort to resolve disputes, which includes mediation if requested by BBB. Other dispute resolution options, including arbitration, may be recommended by BBB when other efforts to resolve a dispute have failed. BBB may consider a business' willingness to participate in recommended dispute resolution options in determining compliance with these standards.
                

                    3. Comply with any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process.
                

                    4. Cooperate with BBB in efforts to eliminate the underlying cause of patterns of customer complaints that are identified by BBB.

        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.

Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Utah:













Does Legrand Johnson Construction Co carry a valid contracting license?



Contractors in Utah are required to be licensed to perform work on residential properties. The Utah Division of Occupational and Professional Licensing issues over fifty separate license classifications to contractors. Licensing standards in Utah are very strict, offering homeowners peace of mind when hiring contractors. Always check a contractor's references to avoid problems during a construction project. 
Legrand Johnson Construction Co currently holds license 229671-5501 (Contractor, Contractor With Lrf, E100 General Engineering Qualifier), which was Active when we last checked. 











How important is contractor licensing in Utah?



Utah requires contractors to pass a business and law exam, as well as a trade exam to become licensed. Six hours of continuing education is required to maintain a license in the state. 











Your liability risk when hiring Legrand Johnson Construction Co



Utah requires licensed contractors to carry workers' compensation and general liability insurance policies. Request a copy of both insurance certificates for your records before the start of any work.











Financial recourse when hiring Legrand Johnson Construction Co



Licensed contractors in Utah must obtain a surety bond before performing work on residential properties. Home owners can file a claim against this bond to recoup losses or damages in the event of faulty work.











What else should I know before hiring Legrand Johnson Construction Co



Utah requires license applicants to submit a credit report with their application.











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



Before hiring a contractor in Utah, be sure to get at least 3 detailed bids. Quality contractors will take the time to explain their budget proposal, and help guide you through the estimate process. Be wary of an abnormally low bid, they are not worth the risk. These underpriced projects often do not end well for the homeowner, choose a contractor you trust and can clearly communicate with. BuildZoom has made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.

			    adorne wall plates come in many fashions, materials and gang sizes. After you choose your module functions, pick the wall plate that matches your fixtures or wall decor!
		








  


It's time for a beautiful switch!

			   adorne light switches turn beautiful on in your home. Make the switch to Legrand and turn your lights on in style today.
		








  


A Perfect Match

			   The modern style of adorne meets the unique craftsmanship of Hubbardton Forge to deliver hand-made forged metal wall plates. 
		







About Legrand

	         As the leading provider of products and systems for electrical installations and information networks wherever people live and work, Legrand delivers an unequaled depth and breadth of innovative solutions.


The adorne Collection

		         You've spent countless hours planning your remodel. Why not extend your new design down to the last detail?
	

		         Put the perfect finishing touches on your home with:
	

adorne Light Switches
adorne Light Dimmers
adorne Electrical Outlets
adorne Wall Plates

Perfect for Remodels

		         adorne elements fit in existing electrical boxes and require only 15 minutes and a screwdriver to install. It's the perfect Saturday morning project that takes minimal effort, but makes a big impact on your home.
	

		         Each switch, dimmer, or outlet wires the same way as existing electrical products. To install adorne, you simply remove the existing switch, mount adorne's included metal frame to the wall, then pull the wires through the frame and attach them to the device. Then, snap on any adorne wall plate (all of them screwless) and you are done!

Building a sustainable future








At BASF, we create more than just chemicals - we create chemistry. For over 50 years, we have worked closely with industry stakeholders to enable successful sustainable construction projects. With BASF chemistry, buildings can be more durable and require fewer resources for maintenance. Chemistry also makes buildings more energy efficient, thus protecting our environment.

In 2050, nine billion people will live on this planet. Three-quarters of this population will live in cities. The increasing urbanization of the population will require new concepts for housing and construction. Sustainability is therefore a crucial issue for our future. What is our way ahead? How should we tackle new challenges together? You will get these answers and further inspiration through these authentic stories!  



























Sustainable ConstructionWith more than 600 technologies in 75 construction product categories, BASF offers the broadest portfolio of products used on construction sites — or integrated into other products to improve system performance. Our R&D and field teams are constantly upgrading the contribution of these products to help lower energy consumption, increase building life expectancy and offer a faster construction process.

We combine extensive know-how and industry expertise with a diverse portfolio of high-performance products including pigments, pigment preparations, dispersions, resins and additives. Our solutions not only improve surface properties such as appearance and enable unique effects, but also enhance resistance to corrosion or scratching for instance. At the same time, our products meet the growing needs for more sustainable paints and coatings.











 Dispersions, Pigments, Resins, Additives

Our product range includes solvent-based, water-based or universal systems, light stabilizers, dispersants, rheology modifiers and formulation additives as well as a variety of pigments and pigment preparations – both for interior and exterior applications.

Our product portfolio includes a full range of organic, inorganic and effect pigments for attractive coloristic and surface effects as well as specialized resins and additives for enhanced coating performance.






 Pigments, Resins, Additives 












Raw materials for Industrial CoatingsIndustrial coatings are especially used for protective purposes.

Why don't we show the price?

					Like many retailers, LightingDirect.com can choose to set its own prices independently. And even though manufacturers require LightingDirect.com and other retailers to display a product's "minimum advertised price" (or MAP), the retailer can choose to sell for less than that. But the price must be conveyed in other ways, and each individual manufacturer's MAP policy determines where the price can be seen.
				

					To see the price for this product at LightingDirect.com, you'll need to place it in your shopping cart, and maybe even proceed to final checkout. If you're not ready to buy the product, simply remove it from the cart.
				

					LightingDirect.com apologizes for any inconvenience. We'd just like to offer you the chance to save extra money while we adhere to manufacturers' MAP policies. LightingDirect.com is also working to educate manufacturers on how their policies impact customers and their buying behavior.

Why don't we show the price?

					Like many retailers, LightingDirect.com can choose to set its own prices independently. And even though manufacturers require LightingDirect.com and other retailers to display a product's "minimum advertised price" (or MAP), the retailer can choose to sell for less than that. But the price must be conveyed in other ways, and each individual manufacturer's MAP policy determines where the price can be seen.
				

					To see the price for this product at LightingDirect.com, you'll need to place it in your shopping cart, and maybe even proceed to final checkout. If you're not ready to buy the product, simply remove it from the cart.
				

					LightingDirect.com apologizes for any inconvenience. We'd just like to offer you the chance to save extra money while we adhere to manufacturers' MAP policies. LightingDirect.com is also working to educate manufacturers on how their policies impact customers and their buying behavior.
