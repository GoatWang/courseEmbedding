Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/26/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

As with all your investments through Fidelity, you must make your own determination whether an investment is appropriate for you.  Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.  Foreign securities are subject to interest-rate, currency-exchange-rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.  Illiquidity is an inherent risk associated with investing in real estate and REITs.  There is no guarantee the issuer of a REIT will maintain the secondary market for its shares and redemptions may be at a price which is more or less than the original price paid.  Closed-end funds can trade at a discount to their NAV.  Shareholders of Master Limited Partnerships may be treated as partners for tax purposes.  Partnerships issue a Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) rather than a Form 1099 form for tax purposes. It lists the partner's share of income, deductions, credits, etc.  Speak with your tax advisor to determine how this may affect you.  A royalty trust is a type of corporation, mostly in the United States or Canada, usually involved in oil and gas production or mining.  Royalty trusts may have special tax treatment, so you should consult a tax advisor on the potential tax consequences of investing in them.News, commentary and events are from third-party sources unaffiliated with Fidelity.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/26/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

As with all your investments through Fidelity, you must make your own determination whether an investment is appropriate for you.  Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.  Foreign securities are subject to interest-rate, currency-exchange-rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.  Illiquidity is an inherent risk associated with investing in real estate and REITs.  There is no guarantee the issuer of a REIT will maintain the secondary market for its shares and redemptions may be at a price which is more or less than the original price paid.  Closed-end funds can trade at a discount to their NAV.  Shareholders of Master Limited Partnerships may be treated as partners for tax purposes.  Partnerships issue a Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) rather than a Form 1099 form for tax purposes. It lists the partner's share of income, deductions, credits, etc.  Speak with your tax advisor to determine how this may affect you.  A royalty trust is a type of corporation, mostly in the United States or Canada, usually involved in oil and gas production or mining.  Royalty trusts may have special tax treatment, so you should consult a tax advisor on the potential tax consequences of investing in them.News, commentary and events are from third-party sources unaffiliated with Fidelity.

Integrated wavelength tunable single and two-stage all-optical wavelength converter



Patent number:  7310363
                                            

Abstract:  A semiconductor tunable laser (10) and an interferometer (12) coupled to the tunable laser (10) are monolithically fabricated in a semiconductor heterostructure. The laser also comprises a buried ridge stripe waveguide laser. The interferometer (12) has a semiconductor optical amplifier (38) coupled in each arm. A cross-gain semiconductor optical amplifier converter is coupled to the interferometer (12). The semiconductor optical amplifier (38) coupled in each arm is biased so that an optical path length difference between the two arms is in antiphase which results in destructive interference. The output of the tunable laser (10) is coupled to a coupler. A semiconductor optical amplifier (38) is used as a gain controller for the semiconductor optical amplifiers in the interferometer (12) to allow wavelength conversion over a larger range of input signal powers.

Electroabsorption modulator with tunable chirp



Patent number:  6778309
                                            

Abstract:  An electroabsorption modulator comprises a tandem arrangement of a conventional electroabsorption (EA) modulator element and a phase modulator element. The EA modulator element is driven by the digital data signal and the phase modulator is driven by a chirp tuning control signal, such as the complement of the data signal. By controlling the amplitude and/or bias of the chirp tuning control signal, the frequency chirp of the intensity-modulated output signal from the EA modulator element can be controlled.

Tunable laser source with an integrated wavelength monitor and method of operating same



Patent number:  6714566
                                            

Abstract:  A wavelength monitor is provided based on the transmission response of an optical filter. The monitor provides feedback to the laser enabling it to lock to any given wavelength within its tuning range. The invention is also a process for integrating the wavelength monitor directly on chip with a variety of tunable semiconductor lasers. The invention also comprises a method for controlling the wavelength of a tunable laser by using a wavelength monitor to measure the output light and provide feedback to a control system. The laser and wavelength monitor are integrated together on a single indium phosphide chip. The wavelength monitor comprises a filter with a wavelength dependent transmission function and a pair of detectors. One detector is illuminated with light that has passed through the filter and the other provides a reference to measure the input intensity. Taking the ratio of the filtered light level to the unfiltered light provides a wavelength dependent wavelength.

Electroabsorption modulator with tunable chirp



Publication number:  20040036943
                                            

Abstract:  An electroabsorption modulator comprises a tandem arrangement of a conventional electroabsorption (EA) modulator element and a phase modulator element. The EA modulator element is driven by the digital data signal and the phase modulator is driven by a chirp tuning control signal, such as the complement of the data signal. By controlling the amplitude and/or bias of the chirp tuning control signal, the frequency chirp of the intensity-modulated output signal from the EA modulator element can be controlled.

Segmented modulator for high-speed opto-electronics



Publication number:  20030235359
                                            

Abstract:  An optical modulator includes first and second modulator segments. The first and second modulator segments form an optical signal path for an optical signal. The optical modulator also includes an electrical signal path capable of receiving and carrying a modulation signal, which is applied to the optical signal at the first and second modulation segments to generate a modulated optical signal. An inductive element may be disposed between electrical inputs to the first and second modulator segments. The optical modulator may be an electro-absorption modulator (EAM). The inductive element may be an inductor or a transmission line segment.

Wide bandwidth high efficiency photodiode



Publication number:  20030098490
                                            

Abstract:  The present invention is directed toward an edge detecting photodiode that includes a waveguide comprising a p-doped InP cladding layer, an n-doped InP cladding layer, a p-side waveguide layer, an n-side waveguide layer, and an InGaAs absorption layer therebetween, in which the absorption layer is doped to have an absorption region and a depletion region that, when under bias, will overlap by an amount sufficient to substantially balance the transit time of positive and negative charged carriers across the waveguide. The photodiode is preferably formed on an InP substrate. The photodiode preferably has a planar polymer layer in contact with the InP substrate. The polymer layer also preferably has a ridge formed therein for the photodiode waveguide. The polymer layer may have a coplanar transmission line deposited thereon, and a pair of metal-insulator-metal (“MIM”) capacitors may be incorporated into the coplanar transmission line.

Simultaneous demultiplexing and clock recovery of high-speed OTDM signals using a tandem electro-absorption modulator



Publication number:  20030043431
                                            

Abstract:  Simultaneous demultiplexing and clock recovery of high-speed (e.g., 80 Gbps or 160 Gbps) optical time division multiplexing (OTDM) signals is achieved using a tandem electro-absorption modulator (TEAM). The TEAM has a monolithically integrated SOA to compensate the insertion loss and two EAMs to reduce the switching window. The demultiplexing and clock recovery may be performed by a single TEAM, or by two or more TEAMs. A fiber Raman amplifier may be used to boost the intensity of the OTDM signals during transmission.
