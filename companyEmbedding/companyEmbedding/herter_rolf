As with all your investments through Fidelity, you must make your own determination whether an investment is appropriate for you.  Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.  Foreign securities are subject to interest-rate, currency-exchange-rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.  Illiquidity is an inherent risk associated with investing in real estate and REITs.  There is no guarantee the issuer of a REIT will maintain the secondary market for its shares and redemptions may be at a price which is more or less than the original price paid.  Closed-end funds can trade at a discount to their NAV.  Shareholders of Master Limited Partnerships may be treated as partners for tax purposes.  Partnerships issue a Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) rather than a Form 1099 form for tax purposes. It lists the partner's share of income, deductions, credits, etc.  Speak with your tax advisor to determine how this may affect you.  A royalty trust is a type of corporation, mostly in the United States or Canada, usually involved in oil and gas production or mining.  Royalty trusts may have special tax treatment, so you should consult a tax advisor on the potential tax consequences of investing in them.News, commentary and events are from third-party sources unaffiliated with Fidelity.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/28/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

Wallet Insert Info
By adding a clear plastic insert to your wallet you will instantly increase your wallet's storage space. You will be able to add more credit cards and photos to your existing wallet without having to buy a new wallet. Plastic card holders for wallets can be carried in an open credit card slot, in an open pocket, or in your bill compartment to increase your wallet's space. Most wallet inserts have a plastic tab allowing it to fit inside an open credit card slot or pocket. 
Wallet windows come in many sizes and styles to fit the various wallet styles including the trifold, bifold, secretary, hipster, and zipper wallets. The accordion style inserts are seen in many television programs and movies. When someone is asked to see their family or showing of their variety of credit cards quickly you'll see the accordion wallet insert expand down as it unfolds.
The trifold and bifold inserts have various size options for credit cards and photos.
A secretary wallet insert has staggered pages down the spine to easily flip through. Made for secretary and checkbook wallets.
The popular double high hipster credit card holder is for wallets like the Double High Executive Men's Hipster Wallet

About Leather Wallets for Men & Women
Everyone has different preferences in mens wallets. From the size to the style will differ as well as where it is carried. One person might carry their wallet in their coat pocket, while another may carry it in their back or front pocket.
Some men might want a slim front pocket wallet so the wallet bulge in their pants is at a minimum. Others will want to carry as many credit cards, cash, coins, receipts, debit cards, rewards cards, credit card size address books, wallet magnifiers, and more with trifold wallets, coat wallets, or hipster wallets.
For those who do not like to carry wallets, there are other leather goods and wallet alternatives such as our popular money clips. There are a wide variety of money clip wallets such as magnetic money clips, hinged money clips, money clips with credit card cases, and many more. Some men prefer to carry credit card holders with their money folded to conserve space in their pockets. ID holders are nice alternative as well as you only carry the necessary items you need.
Women, too, can easily go through wallets. Whether it's simple checkbook wallets or multi-pocket credit card cases what they carry can vary for the perfect accessory for them.
Whatever the kind of wallet you need, find it at WalletGear. It doesn't matter if its wallets for men like the bifold wallets or zipper wallets to secure your cash in a full zip around wallet you will find the right style and size wallet for your needs here.

Add extra storage to your wallet with a credit card insert:

If you carry a bulky wallet in your back pocket then you should switch over to a thin front pocket wallet. It will be much more comfortable when sitting down. For health reasons you should carry your wallet in your front pocket. Not only will it be better for you, it makes it much easier to access and thwart off pick pocketers.
These wallets are slim but can still pack a punch. You will find they still have credit card slots, bill compartment or money clip, ID windows, and room for your other essentials. For additional money clips visit our Money Clips section.
