                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES




General



The following generally describes the anticipated material
federal income tax consequences of purchasing, owning and
disposing of the Offered Certificates. It does not address
special rules which may apply to particular types of investors.
The authorities on which this discussion is based are subject to
change or differing interpretations, and any such change or
interpretation could apply retroactively. Investors should
consult their own tax advisors regarding the specific tax
consequences to such investors of owning Offered Certificates.


74





For purposes of this discussion, unless otherwise
specified, the term "Mortgage Loans" will be used to refer to
Mortgage Loans, Mortgaged-Backed Securities and Contracts, and
the term "Owner" will refer to the beneficial owner of an Offered
Certificate.



REMIC Elections



Under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the "Code"), an
election may be made to treat the Trust Fund related to each
Series of Certificates (or segregated pools of assets within the
Trust Fund) as a "real estate mortgage investment conduit"
("REMIC") within the meaning of Section 860D(a) of the Code. If
one or more REMIC elections are made, the Certificates of any
Class will be either "regular interests" in a REMIC within the
meaning of Section 860G(a)(1) of the Code ("Regular
Certificates") or "residual interests" in a REMIC within the
meaning of Section 860G(a)(2) of the Code ("Residual
Certificates"). The related Prospectus Supplement for each Series
of Certificates will indicate whether an election will be made to
treat the Trust Fund as one or more REMICs, and if so, which
Certificates will be Regular Certificates and which will be
Residual Certificates.


If a REMIC election is made, the Trust Fund, or each
portion thereof that is treated as a separate REMIC, will be
referred to as a "REMIC Pool". If the Trust Fund is comprised of
two REMIC Pools, one will be an "Upper-Tier REMIC" and one a
"Lower-Tier REMIC". The assets of the Lower-Tier REMIC will
consist of the Mortgage Loans and related Trust Fund assets. The
assets of the Upper-Tier REMIC will consist of all of the regular
interests issued by the Lower-Tier REMIC.


The discussion below under the heading "REMIC Certificates"
considers Series for which a REMIC election will be made. Series
for which no such election will be made are addressed under
"Non-REMIC Certificates".



REMIC Certificates



The discussion in this section applies only to a Series of
Certificates for which a REMIC election is made.



Tax Opinion.



Qualification as a REMIC requires ongoing compliance with
certain conditions. Upon the issuance of each Series of
Certificates for which a REMIC election is made, Cleary,
Gottlieb, Steen & Hamilton or another law firm identified in the
related Prospectus Supplement, counsel to the Company, will
deliver its opinion generally to the effect that, with respect to
each such Series of Certificates, under then existing law and
assuming compliance by the Company, the Servicer or Master
Servicer and the Trustee for such Series with all of the
provisions of the related Agreement (and such other agreements
and representations as may be referred to in such opinion), each
REMIC Pool will be a REMIC, and the Certificates of such Series
will be treated as either Regular Certificates or Residual
Certificates. This opinion will be filed as an Exhibit to the
Form 8-K relating to such Series of Certificates.



Status of Certificates.



The Certificates will be:


-  "qualifying real property loans" under Code

Section 593(d)(1);


-  assets described in Code Section 7701(a)(19)(C);
and


-  "real estate assets" under Code Section

856(c)(5)(A),


75





to the extent the assets of the related REMIC Pool are so
treated. Interest on the Regular Certificates will be "interest
on obligations secured by mortgages on real property or on
interests in real property" within the meaning of Code Section
856(c)(3)(B) in the same proportion that the income of the REMIC
Pool is so treated. If at all times 95% or more of the assets or
income of the REMIC Pool qualifies under the foregoing Code
sections, the Certificates (and income thereon) will so qualify
in their entirety.


In the event the assets of the related REMIC Pool include
buy-down Mortgage Loans, it is unclear whether the related
buy-down funds would qualify under the foregoing Code sections.
Also, Contracts may be considered to qualify under the foregoing
sections only if the Manufactured Homes securing such Contracts
are considered to be "permanently fixed" or "permanently
installed". Contracts may limit the ability of a borrower to
permanently attach a Manufactured Home to its site.


The rules described in the two preceding paragraphs will be
applied to a Trust Fund consisting of two REMIC Pools as if the
Trust Fund were a single REMIC holding the assets of the
Lower-Tier REMIC.



Income from Regular Certificates.



General. Except as otherwise provided in this tax
discussion, Regular Certificates will be taxed as newly
originated debt instruments for federal income tax purposes.
Interest, original issue discount and market discount accrued on
a Regular Certificate will be ordinary income to the Owner.

All Owners must account for interest income under the accrual
method of accounting, which may result in the inclusion of
amounts in income that are not currently distributed in cash.


Original Issue Discount. Certain Regular Certificates may
have "original issue discount." An Owner must include original
issue discount in income as it accrues, without regard to the
timing of payments.


The total amount of original issue discount on a Regular
Certificate is the excess of its "stated redemption price at
maturity" over its "issue price." The issue price for any Regular
Certificate is the price (including any accrued interest) at
which a substantial portion of the Class of Certificates
including such Regular Certificate are first sold to the public.
In general, the stated redemption price at maturity is the sum of
all payments made on the Regular Certificate, other than payments
of interest that (i) are actually payable at least annually over
the entire life of the Certificates and (ii) are based on a
single fixed rate or variable rate (or certain combinations of
fixed and variable rates). The stated redemption price at
maturity of a Regular Certificate always includes its original
principal amount, but generally does not include distributions of
stated interest, except in the case of Accrual Certificates, and,
as discussed below, Interest Only Certificates. An "Interest Only
Certificate" is a Certificate entitled to receive distributions
of some or all of the interest on the Mortgage Loans or other
assets in a REMIC Pool and that has either a notional or nominal
principal amount. Special rules for Regular Certificates that
provide for interest based on a variable rate are discussed below
in "Income from Regular Certificates-Variable Rate Regular
Certificates".


With respect to an Interest Only Certificate, the stated
redemption price at maturity is likely to be the sum of all
payments thereon, determined in accordance with the Prepayment
Assumption (as defined below). In that event, Interest Only
Certificates would always have original issue discount.
Alternatively, in the case of an Interest Only Certificate with
some principal amount, the stated redemption price at maturity
might be determined under the general rules described in the
preceding paragraph. If, applying those rules, the stated
redemption price at maturity were considered to equal the
principal amount of such Certificate, then the rules described
below under "Premium" would apply. The Prepayment Assumption is
the assumed rate of prepayment of the Mortgage Loans used in
pricing the Regular Certificates. The Prepayment Assumption will
be set forth in the related Supplement.


76





Under a de minimis rule, original issue discount on a
Regular Certificate will be considered zero if it is less than
0.25% of the Certificate's stated redemption price at maturity
multiplied by the Certificate's weighted average maturity. The
weighted average maturity of a Regular Certificate is computed
based on the number of full years (i.e., rounding down partial
years) each distribution of principal (or other amount included
in the stated redemption price at maturity) is scheduled to be
outstanding. The schedule of such distributions likely should be
determined in accordance with the Prepayment Assumption.


The Owner of a Regular Certificate generally must include
in income the original issue discount that accrues for each day
on which the Owner holds such Certificate, including the date of
purchase, but excluding the date of disposition. The original
issue discount accruing in any period equals:





PV End + Dist = PV Beg




Where:



PV End = present value of all remaining distributions to be made






         as of the end of the period;
Dist   = distributions made during the period includible in the
         stated redemption price at maturity; and
PV Be  = present value of all remaining distributions as of the
         beginning of the period.

       The present value of the remaining distributions is








calculated based on (i) the original yield to maturity of the
Regular Certificate, (ii) events (including actual prepayments)
that have occurred prior to the end of the period and (iii) the
Prepayment Assumption. For these purposes, the original yield to
maturity of a Regular Certificate will be calculated based on its
issue price, assuming that the Certificate will be prepaid in all
periods in accordance with the Prepayment Assumption, and with
compounding at the end of each accrual period used in the
formula.


Assuming the Regular Certificates have monthly
Distribution Dates, discount would be computed under the formula
generally for the one-month periods (or shorter initial period)
ending on each Distribution Date. The original issue discount
accruing during any accrual period is divided by the number of
days in the period to determine the daily portion of original
issue discount for each day.


The daily portions of original issue discount generally
will increase if prepayments on the underlying Mortgage Loans
exceed the Prepayment Assumption and decrease if prepayments are
slower than the Prepayment Assumption (changes in the rate of
prepayments having the opposite effect in the case of an Interest
Only Certificate). If the relative principal payment priorities
of the Classes of Regular Certificates of a Series change, any
increase or decrease in the present value of the remaining
payments to be made on any such Class will affect the computation
of original issue discount for the period in which the change in
payment priority occurs.


If original issue discount computed as described above is
negative for any period, the Owner generally will not be allowed
a current deduction for the negative amount but instead will be
entitled to offset such amount only against future positive
original issue discount from such Certificate. However, while not
free from doubt, such an Owner may be entitled to deduct
"negative original issue discount" to the extent the Owner's
adjusted basis (as defined in "Sale or Exchange of Certificates"
below) in the Certificate remaining after such deduction is not
less than the principal amount of the Certificate.


Acquisition Premium. If an Owner of a Regular Certificate
acquires such Certificate at a price greater than its "adjusted
issue price," but less than its remaining stated redemption price
at maturity, the daily portion for any day (as computed above) is
reduced by an amount equal to the


77





product of (i) such daily portion and (ii) a fraction, the
numerator of which is the amount by which the price exceeds the
adjusted issue price and the denominator of which is the sum of
the daily portions for such Regular Certificate for all days on
and after the date of purchase. The adjusted issue price of a
Regular Certificate on any given day is its issue price,
increased by all original issue discount that has accrued on such
Certificate and reduced by the amount of all previous
distributions on such Certificate of amounts included in its
stated redemption price at maturity.


Market Discount. A Regular Certificate may have market
discount (as defined in the Code). Market discount equals the
excess of the adjusted issue price of a Certificate over the
Owner's adjusted basis in the Certificate. The Owner of a
Certificate with market discount must report ordinary interest
income, as the Owner receives distributions on the Certificate of
principal or other amounts included in its stated redemption
price at maturity, equal to the lesser of (a) the excess of the
amount of those distributions over the amount, if any, of accrued
original issue discount on the Certificate or (b) the portion of
the market discount that has accrued and not previously been
included in income. Also, such Owner must treat gain from the
disposition of the Certificate as ordinary income to the extent
of any accrued, but unrecognized, market discount. Alternatively,
an Owner may elect in any taxable year to include market discount
in income currently as it accrues on all market discount
instruments acquired by the Owner in that year or thereafter. An
Owner may revoke such an election only with the consent of the
Internal Revenue Service.


In general terms, market discount on a Regular Certificate
may be treated, at the Owner's election, as accruing either (a)
on the basis of a constant yield (similar to the method described
above for accruing original issue discount) or (b) alternatively,
either (i) in the case of a Regular Certificate issued without
original issue discount, in the ratio of stated interest
distributable in the relevant period to the total stated interest
remaining to be distributed from the beginning of such period

(computed taking into account the Prepayment Assumption) or (ii)

in the case of a Regular Certificate issued with original issue
discount, in the ratio of the amount of original issue discount
accruing in the relevant period to the total remaining original
issue discount at the beginning of such period. An election to
accrue market discount on a Regular Certificate on a constant
yield basis is irrevocable with respect to that Certificate.


An Owner may be required to defer a portion of the
deduction for interest expense on any indebtedness that the Owner
incurs or maintains in order to purchase or carry a Regular
Certificate that has market discount. The deferred amount would
not exceed the market discount that has accrued but not been
taken into income. Any such deferred interest expense is, in
general, allowed as a deduction not later than the year in which
the related market discount income is recognized.


Market discount with respect to a Regular Certificate will
be considered to be zero if such market discount is de minimis
under a rule similar to that described above in the fourth
paragraph under "Original Issue Discount". Owners should consult
their own tax advisors regarding the application of the market
discount rules as well as the advisability of making any election
with respect to market discount.


Discount on a Regular Certificate that is neither original
issue discount nor market discount, as defined above, must be
allocated ratably among the principal payments on the Certificate
and included in income (as gain from the sale or exchange of the
Certificate) as the related principal payments are made (whether
as scheduled payments or prepayments).


Premium. A Regular Certificate, other than an Accrual
Certificate or, as discussed above under "Original Issue
Discount", an Interest Only Certificate, purchased at a cost (net
of accrued interest) greater than its principal amount generally
is considered to be purchased at a premium. The Owner may elect
under Code Section 171 to amortize such premium under the
constant yield method, using the Prepayment Assumption. To the
extent the amortized premium is allocable to interest income from
the Regular Certificate, it is treated as an offset to such
interest rather than as


78





a separate deduction. An election made by an Owner would
generally apply to all its debt instruments and may not be
revoked without the consent of the Internal Revenue Service.


Special Election to Apply OID Rules. In lieu of the rules
described above with respect to de minimis discount, acquisition
premium, market discount and premium, an Owner of a Regular
Certificate may elect to accrue such discount, or adjust for such
premium, by applying the principles of the OID rules described
above. The election is only available for debt instruments
acquired on or after April 4, 1994. An election made by a
taxpayer with respect to one obligation can affect other
obligations it holds. Owners should consult with their tax
advisors regarding the merits of making this election.


Retail Regular Certificates. For purposes of the original
issue and market discount rules, a repayment in full of a Retail
Certificate that is subject to payment in units or other
increments, rather than on a pro rata basis with other Retail
Certificates, will be treated in the same manner as any other
prepayment.


Variable Rate Regular Certificates. The Regular
Certificates may provide for interest that varies based on an
interest rate index. The OID Regulations provide special rules
for calculating income from certain "variable rate debt
instruments" or "VRDIs." A debt instrument must meet certain
technical requirements to qualify as a VRDI, which are outlined
in the next paragraph. Under the regulations, income on a VRDI is
calculated by (1) creating a hypothetical debt instrument that
pays fixed interest at rates equivalent to the variable interest,

(2) applying the original issue discount rules of the Code to
that fixed rate instrument, and (3) adjusting the income accruing
in any accrual period by the difference between the assumed fixed
interest amount and the actual amount for the period. In general,
where a variable rate on a debt instrument is based on an
interest rate index (such as LIBOR), a fixed rate equivalent to a
variable rate is determined based on the value of the index as of
the issue date of the debt instrument. In cases where rates are
reset at different intervals over the life of a VRDI, adjustments
are made to ensure that the equivalent fixed rate for each
accrual period is based on the same reset interval.


A debt instrument must meet a number of requirements in
order to qualify as a VRDI. A VRDI cannot be issued at a premium
above its principal amount that exceeds a specified percentage of
its principal amount (15%, or if less 1.5% times its weighted
average life). As a result, Interest Only Certificates will never
be VRDIs. Also, a debt instrument that pays interest based on a
multiple of an interest rate index is not a VRDI if the multiple
is less than zero or greater than 1.35, unless, in general,
interest is paid based on a single formula that lasts over the
life of the instrument. A debt instrument is not a VRDI if it is
subject to caps and floors, unless they remain the same over the
life of the instrument or are not expected to change
significantly the yield on the instrument. Variable rate Regular
Certificates other than Interest Only Certificates may or may not
qualify as VRDIs depending on their terms.


In a case where a variable rate Regular Certificate does
not qualify as a VRDI, it will be treated under the OID
Regulations as a contingent payment debt instrument. Proposed
regulations addressing contingent payment debt instruments were
issued on December 16, 1994, but such regulations are not
applicable by their terms to Regular Certificates. Until further
guidance is forthcoming, one method of calculating income on such
a Regular Certificate that appears to be reasonable would be to
apply the principles governing VRDIs outlined above.


Subordinated Certificates. Certain Series of Certificates
may contain one or more Classes of subordinated Certificates. In
the event there are defaults or delinquencies on the related
Mortgage Loans, amounts that otherwise would be distributed on a
Class of subordinated Certificates may instead be distributed on
other more senior Classes of Certificates. Since Owners of
Regular Certificates are required to report income under an
accrual method, Owners of subordinated Certificates will be
required to report income without giving effect to delays and


79





reductions in distributions on such Certificates attributable to
defaults or delinquencies on the Mortgage Loans, except to the
extent that it can be established that amounts are uncollectible.
As a result, the amount of income reported by an Owner of a
subordinated Certificate in any period could significantly exceed
the amount of cash distributed to such Owner in that period. The
Owner will eventually be allowed a loss (or be allowed to report
a lesser amount of income) to the extent that the aggregate
amount of distributions on the subordinated Certificate is
reduced as a result of defaults and delinquencies on the Mortgage
Loans. Such a loss could in some circumstances be a capital loss.
Also, the timing and amount of such losses or reductions in
income are uncertain. Owners of subordinated Certificates should
consult their tax advisors on these points.



Income from Residual Certificates.



Taxation of REMIC Income. Generally, Owners of Residual
Certificates in a REMIC Pool ("Residual Owners") must report
ordinary income or loss equal to their pro rata shares (based on
the portion of all Residual Certificates they own) of the taxable
income or net loss of the REMIC. Such income must be reported
regardless of the timing or amounts of distributions on the
Residual Certificates.


The taxable income of a REMIC Pool is generally determined
under the accrual method of accounting in the same manner as the
taxable income of an individual taxpayer. Taxable income is
generally gross income, including interest and original issue
discount income, if any, on the assets of the REMIC Pool and
income from the amortization of any premium on Regular
Certificates, minus deductions. Market discount (as defined in
the Code) with respect to Mortgage Loans held by a REMIC Pool is
recognized in the same fashion as if it were original issue
discount. Deductions include interest and original issue discount
expense on the Regular Certificates, reasonable servicing fees
attributable to the REMIC Pool, other administrative expenses and
amortization of any premium on assets of the REMIC Pool. As
previously discussed, the timing of recognition of "negative
original issue discount," if any, on a Regular Certificate is
uncertain; as a result, the timing of recognition of the
corresponding income to the REMIC Pool is also uncertain.


If the Trust Fund consists of an Upper-Tier REMIC and a
Lower-Tier REMIC, the regular interests issued by the Lower-Tier
REMIC to the Upper- Tier REMIC will be treated as a single debt
instrument for purposes of the original issue discount
provisions.


A Residual Owner may not amortize the cost of its Residual
Certificate. Taxable income of the REMIC Pool, however, will not
include cash received by the REMIC Pool that represents a
recovery of the REMIC Pool's initial basis in its assets, and
such basis will include the issue price of the Residual
Certificates (assuming the issue price is positive). Such
recovery of basis by the REMIC Pool will have the effect of
amortization of the issue price of the Residual Certificate over
its life. The period of time over which such issue price is
effectively amortized, however, may be longer than the economic
life of the Residual Certificate. The issue price of a Residual
Certificate is the price at which a substantial portion of the
Class of Certificates including the Residual Certificate are
first sold to the public (or if the Residual Certificate is not
publicly offered, the price paid by the first buyer).


A subsequent Residual Owner must report the same amounts
of taxable income or net loss attributable to the REMIC Pool as
an original Owner. No adjustments are made to reflect the
purchase price.


Losses. A Residual Owner that is allocated a net loss of
the REMIC Pool may not deduct such loss currently to the extent
it exceeds the Owner's adjusted basis (as defined in "Sale or
Exchange of Certificates" below) in its Residual Certificate. A
Residual Owner that is a U.S. person (as defined below in
"Taxation of Certain Foreign Investors"), however, may carry over
any disallowed loss to offset any taxable income generated by the
same REMIC Pool.


80





Excess Inclusions. A portion of the taxable income
allocated to a Residual Certificate is subject to special tax
rules. That portion, referred to as an "excess inclusion," is
calculated for each calendar quarter and equals the excess of
such taxable income for the quarter over the daily accruals for
the quarter. The daily accruals equal the product of (i) 120% of
the federal long-term rate under Code Section 1274(d) for the
month which includes the Closing Date (determined on the basis of
quarterly compounding and properly adjusted for the length of the
quarter) and (ii) the adjusted issue price of the Certificate at
the beginning of such quarter. The adjusted issue price of a
Residual Certificate at the beginning of a quarter is the issue
price of the Certificate, plus the amount of daily accruals on
the Certificate for all prior quarters, decreased (but not below
zero) by any prior distributions on the Certificate. If the
aggregate value of the Residual Certificates is not considered to
be "significant," then to the extent provided in Treasury
regulations, a Residual Owner's entire share of REMIC taxable
income will be treated as an excess inclusion. The regulations
that have been adopted under Code Sections 860A through 86OG (the
"REMIC Regulations") do not contain such a rule.


Excess inclusions generally may not be offset by unrelated
losses or loss carryforwards or carrybacks of a Residual Owner.
An Owner that is a thrift institution, however, is generally
permitted to use losses to offset excess inclusions from a
Residual Certificate if such Certificate has "significant value."
The REMIC Regulations provide that a REMIC residual interest has
significant value if (i) the issue price of such interest equals
at least 2% of the aggregate of the issue prices of all interests
in the REMIC and (ii) the anticipated weighted average life of
such REMIC residual interest is at least 20% of the anticipated
weighted average life of the REMIC.


Excess inclusions are treated as unrelated business
taxable income for an organization subject to the tax on
unrelated business income. In addition, under Treasury
regulations yet to be issued, if a real estate investment trust,
regulated investment company or certain other pass-through
entities are Residual Owners, a portion of the distributions made
by such entities may be treated as excess inclusions.


Distributions. Distributions on a Residual Certificate

(whether at their scheduled times or as a result of prepayments)

generally will not result in any taxable income or loss to the
Residual Owner. If the amount of any distribution exceeds a
Residual Owner's adjusted basis in its Residual Certificate,
however, the Residual Owner will recognize gain (treated as gain
from the sale or exchange of its Residual Certificate) to the
extent of such excess. See "Sale or Exchange of Certificates"
below.


Prohibited Transactions; Special Taxes. Net income
recognized by a REMIC Pool from "prohibited transactions" is
subject to a 100% tax and is disregarded in calculating the REMIC
Pool's taxable income. In addition, a REMIC Pool is subject to
federal income tax at the highest corporate rate on "net income
from foreclosure property" (which has a technical definition). A
100% tax also applies to certain contributions to a REMIC Pool
made after it is formed. It is not anticipated that any REMIC
Pool will (i) engage in prohibited transactions in which it
recognizes a significant amount of net income, (ii) receive
contributions of property that are subject to tax, or (iii)
derive a significant amount of net income from foreclosure
property that is subject to tax.


Negative Value Residual Certificates. The federal income
tax treatment of any consideration paid to a transferee on a
transfer of a Residual Certificate is unclear. Such a transferee
should consult its tax advisor. The preamble to the REMIC
Regulations indicates that the Internal Revenue Service may issue
future guidance on the tax treatment of such payments.


Securities Dealers. On December 28, 1993, the Internal
Revenue Service released temporary regulations under Code Section

475 (the "Temporary Section 475 Regulations") relating to the
requirement that a dealer in securities mark certain securities
to market. On January 3, 1995,


81





the Internal Revenue Service released proposed regulations
containing additional guidance on section 475 (the "Proposed

Section 475 Regulations").


In general, the Temporary Section 475 Regulations provide
that a REMIC residual interest that has negative value when
acquired is not a "security" for purposes of Code Section 475.
Whether a residual interest has negative value is determined
under a present value formula described in the Temporary Section
475 Regulations. The Temporary Section 475 Regulations apply to
taxable years ending on or after December 31, 1993. Furthermore,
the Temporary Section 475 Regulations provide the Internal
Revenue Service with the authority to treat any interest or
arrangement having substantially the same economic effect as a
"negative value" residual interest as a "negative value" residual
interest.


The Proposed Section 475 Regulations provide that any
residual interest (regardless of whether it has negative value as
described in the preceding paragraph), and any arrangement having
substantially the same economic effect, that is acquired on or
after January 4, 1995 is not a "security" for the purposes of
Code Section 475. Under the Proposed Section 475 Regulations,
residual interests acquired before January 4, 1995 would be
subject to the rules in the Temporary Section 475 Regulations
relating to negative value residual interests.


Prospective purchasers of a Residual Certificate should
consult their tax advisors regarding the possible application of
the Temporary Section 475 Regulations and the Proposed Section
475 Regulations.


The method of taxation of Residual Certificates described
in this section can produce a significantly less favorable
after-tax return for a Residual Certificate than would be the
case if the Certificate were taxable as a debt instrument. Also,
a Residual Owner's return may be adversely affected by the excess
inclusions rules described above. In certain periods, taxable
income and the resulting tax liability for a Residual Owner may
exceed any distributions it receives. In addition, a substantial
tax may be imposed on certain transferors of a Residual
Certificate and certain Residual Owners that are "pass-thru"
entities. See "Transfers of Residual Certificates" below.
Investors should consult their tax advisors before purchasing a
Residual Certificate.



Sale or Exchange of Certificates.



An Owner generally will recognize gain or loss upon sale
or exchange of a Regular or Residual Certificate equal to the
difference between the amount realized and the Owner's adjusted
basis in the Certificate. The adjusted basis in a Certificate
generally will equal the cost of the Certificate, increased by
income previously recognized, and reduced (but not below zero) by
previous distributions, and by any amortized premium in the case
of a Regular Certificate, or net losses allowed as a deduction in
the case of a Residual Certificate.


Except as described below, any gain or loss on the sale or
exchange of a Certificate held as a capital asset will be capital
gain or loss and will be long-term or short-term depending on
whether the Certificate has been held for more than one year.
Such gain or loss will be ordinary income or loss (i) for a bank
or thrift institution, and (ii) in the case of a Regular
Certificate, (a) to the extent of any accrued, but unrecognized,
market discount, or (b) to the extent income recognized by the
Owner is less than the income that would have been recognized if
the yield on such Certificate were 110% of the applicable federal
rate under Code Section 1274(d).


A Residual Owner should be allowed a loss upon termination
of the REMIC Pool equal to the amount of the Owner's remaining
adjusted basis in its Residual Certificates. Whether the
termination will be treated as a sale or exchange (resulting in a
capital loss) is unclear.


82





Except as provided in Treasury regulations, the wash sale
rules of Code Section 1091 will apply to dispositions of a
Residual Certificate where the seller of the interest, during the
period beginning six months before the sale or disposition of the
interest and ending six months after such sale or disposition,
acquires (or enters into any other transaction that results in
the application of Code Section 1091) any REMIC residual
interest, or any interest in a "taxable mortgage pool" (such as a
non-REMIC owner trust) that is economically comparable to a
residual interest.



Taxation of Certain Foreign Investors.



Regular Certificates. A Regular Certificate held by an
Owner that is a non-U.S. person (as defined below), and that has
no connection with the United States other than owning the
Certificate, will not be subject to U.S. withholding or income
tax with respect to the Certificate provided such Owner (i) is
not a "10-percent shareholder" within the meaning of Code Section
871(h)(3)(B) or a controlled foreign corporation described in
Code Section 881(c)(3)(C), and (ii) provides an appropriate
statement, signed under penalties of perjury, identifying the
Owner and stating, among other things, that the Owner is a
non-U.S. person. If these conditions are not met, a 30%
withholding tax will apply to interest (including original issue
discount) unless an income tax treaty reduces or eliminates such
tax or unless the interest is effectively connected with the
conduct of a trade or business within the United States by such
Owner. In the latter case, such Owner will be subject to United
States federal income tax with respect to all income from the
Certificate at regular rates then applicable to U.S. taxpayers
(and in the case of a corporation, possibly also the branch
profits tax).


The term "non-U.S. person" means any person other than a
U.S. person. A U.S. person is a citizen or resident of the United
States, a corporation, partnership or other entity created or
organized in or under the laws of the United States or any
political subdivision thereof, or an estate or trust that is
subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of the source of
its income.


Residual Certificates. A Residual Owner that is a non-U.S.
person, and that has no connection with the United States other
than owning a Residual Certificate, will not be subject to U.S.
withholding or income tax with respect to the Certificate (other
than with respect to excess inclusions) provided that (i) the
conditions described in the second preceding paragraph with
respect to Regular Certificates are met and (ii) in the case of a
Residual Certificate in a REMIC Pool holding Mortgage Loans, the
Mortgage Loans were originated after July 18, 1984. Excess
inclusions are subject to a 30% withholding tax in all events
(notwithstanding any contrary tax treaty provisions) when
distributed to the Residual Owner (or when the Residual
Certificate is disposed of). The Code grants the Treasury
Department authority to issue regulations requiring excess
inclusions to be taken into account earlier if necessary to
prevent avoidance of tax. The REMIC Regulations do not contain
such a rule. The preamble thereto states that the Internal
Revenue Service is considering issuing regulations concerning
withholding on distributions to foreign holders of residual
interests to satisfy accrued tax liability due to excess
inclusions.


With respect to a Residual Certificate that has been held
at any time by a non-U.S. person, the Trustee (or its agent) will
be entitled to withhold (and to pay to the Internal Revenue
Service) any portion of any payment on such Residual Certificate
that the Trustee reasonably determines is required to be
withheld. If the Trustee (or its agent) reasonably determines
that a more accurate determination of the amount required to be
withheld from a distribution can be made within a reasonable
period after the scheduled date for such distribution, it may
hold such distribution in trust for the Residual Owner until such
determination can be made.


Special tax rules and restrictions that apply to transfers
of Residual Certificates to and from non-U.S. persons are
discussed in the next section.


83






Transfers of Residual Certificates.



Special tax rules and restrictions apply to transfers of
Residual Certificates to disqualified organizations or foreign
investors, and to transfers of noneconomic Residual Certificates.


Disqualified Organizations. In order to comply with the
REMIC rules of the Code, the Agreement will provide that no legal
or beneficial interest in a Residual Certificate may be
transferred to, or registered in the name of, any person unless

(i) the proposed purchaser provides to the Trustee an "affidavit"
(within the meaning of the REMIC Regulations) to the effect that,
among other items, such transferee is not a "disqualified
organization" (as defined below), is not purchasing a Residual
Certificate as an agent for a disqualified organization (i.e., as
a broker, nominee, or other middleman) and is not an entity (a
"Book-Entry Nominee") that holds REMIC residual securities as
nominee to facilitate the clearance and settlement of such
securities through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of
participating organizations and (ii) the transferor states in
writing to the Trustee that it has no actual knowledge that such
affidavit is false.


If despite these restrictions a Residual Certificate is
transferred to a disqualified organization, the transfer may
result in a tax equal to the product of (i) the present value of
the total anticipated future excess inclusions with respect to
such Certificate and (ii) the highest corporate marginal federal
income tax rate. Such a tax generally is imposed on the
transferor, except that if the transfer is through an agent for a
disqualified organization, the agent is liable for the tax. A
transferor is not liable for such tax if the transferee furnishes
to the transferor an affidavit that the transferee is not a
disqualified organization and, as of the time of the transfer,
the transferor does not have actual knowledge that the affidavit
is false.


A disqualified organization may hold an interest in a
REMIC Certificate through a "pass-thru entity" (as defined
below). In that event, the pass-thru entity is subject to tax (at
the highest corporate marginal federal income tax rate) on excess
inclusions allocable to the disqualified organization. However,
such tax will not apply to the extent the pass-thru entity
receives affidavits from record holders of interests in the
entity stating that they are not disqualified organizations and
the entity does not have actual knowledge that the affidavits are
false.


For these purposes, (i) "disqualified organization" means
the United States, any state or political subdivision thereof,
any foreign government, any international organization, any
agency or instrumentality of any of the foregoing, certain
organizations that are exempt from taxation under the Code
(including tax on excess inclusions) and certain corporations
operating on a cooperative basis, and (ii) "pass-thru entity"
means any regulated investment company, real estate investment
trust, common trust fund, partnership, trust or estate and
certain corporations operating on a cooperative basis. Except as
may be provided in Treasury regulations, any person holding an
interest in a pass-thru entity as a nominee for another will,
with respect to that interest, be treated as a pass-thru entity.


Foreign Investors. Under the REMIC Regulations, a transfer
of a Residual Certificate to a non-U.S. person that will not hold
the Certificate in connection with a U.S. trade or business will
be disregarded for all federal tax purposes if the Certificate
has "tax avoidance potential." A Residual Certificate has tax
avoidance potential unless, at the time of transfer, the
transferor reasonably expects that:


(i) for each excess inclusion, the REMIC will distribute
to the transferee residual interest holder an amount that will
equal at least 30 percent of the excess inclusion, and


(ii) each such amount will be distributed at or after the
time at which the excess inclusion accrues and not later than the
close of the calendar year following the calendar year of
accrual. A transferor has such reasonable expectation if the
above test would be met assuming that the REMIC's Mortgage Loans
will prepay at each rate between 50 percent and 200 percent of
the Prepayment Assumption.


84





The REMIC Regulations also provide that a transfer of a
Residual Certificate from a non-U.S. person to a U.S. person (or
to a non-U.S. person that will hold the Certificate in connection
with a U.S. trade or business) is disregarded if the transfer has
"the effect of allowing the transferor to avoid tax on accrued
excess inclusions."


In light of these provisions, the Agreement provides that
a Residual Certificate may not be purchased by or transferred to
any person that is not a U.S. person, unless (i) such person
holds the Certificate in connection with the conduct of a trade
or business within the United States and furnishes the transferor
and the Trustee with an effective Internal Revenue Service Form
4224, or (ii) the transferee delivers to both the transferor and
the Trustee an opinion of nationally recognized tax counsel to
the effect that such transfer is in accordance with the
requirements of the Code and the regulations promulgated
thereunder and that such transfer will not be disregarded for
federal income tax purposes.


Noneconomic Residual Certificates. Under the REMIC
Regulations, a transfer of a "noneconomic" Residual Certificate
will be disregarded for all federal income tax purposes if a
significant purpose of the transfer is to impede the assessment
or collection of tax. Such a purpose exists if the transferor, at
the time of the transfer, either knew or should have known that
the transferee would be unwilling or unable to pay taxes due on
its share of the taxable income of the REMIC. A transferor is
presumed to lack such knowledge if:


(i) the transferor conducted, at the time of the transfer,
a reasonable investigation of the financial condition of the
transferee and found that the transferee had historically paid
its debts as they came due and found no significant evidence to
indicate that the transferee will not continue to pay its debts
as they become due, and


(ii) the transferee represents to the transferor that it
understands that, as the holder of the noneconomic residual
interest, it may incur tax liabilities in excess of any cash
flows generated by the interest and that it intends to pay taxes
associated with holding the residual interest as they become due.
A Residual Certificate (including a Certificate with significant
value at issuance) is noneconomic unless, at the time of the
transfer, (i) the present value of the expected future
distributions on the Certificate at least equals the product of
the present value of the anticipated excess inclusions and the
highest corporate income tax rate in effect for the year in which
the transfer occurs, and (ii) the transferor reasonably expects
that the transferee will receive distributions on the
Certificate, at or after the time at which taxes accrue, in an
amount sufficient to pay the taxes.


The Agreement will provide that no legal or beneficial
interest in a Residual Certificate may be transferred to, or
registered in the name of, any person unless the transferor
represents to the Trustee that it has conducted the investigation
of the transferee, and made the findings, described in the
preceding paragraph, and the proposed transferee provides to the
Trustee the transferee representations described in the preceding
paragraph, and agrees that it will not transfer the Certificate
to any person unless that person agrees to comply with the same
restrictions on future transfers.



Pending Legislation.



Legislation has been proposed which would provide that,
effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1986,
alternative minimum taxable income of a Residual Owner cannot be
less than the Owner's excess inclusions. Legislation has also
been proposed which would, effective for taxable years beginning
after December 31, 1995, eliminate the exception to the excess
inclusion rules for thrift institutions that hold residual
interests with significant value. No prediction can be made
whether any such proposed legislation will be enacted.


85






Servicing Compensation and Other REMIC Pool Expenses.



Under Code Section 67, an individual, estate or trust is
allowed certain itemized deductions only to the extent that such
deductions, in the aggregate, exceed 2% of the Owner's adjusted
gross income, and such a person is not allowed such deductions to
any extent in computing its alterative minimum tax liability.
Under Treasury regulations, if such a person is an Owner of a
REMIC Certificate, the REMIC Pool is required to allocate to such
a person its share of the servicing fees and administrative
expenses paid by a REMIC together with an equal amount of income.
Those fees and expenses are deductible as an offset to the
additional income, but subject to the 2% floor.


In the case of a REMIC Pool that has multiple classes of
Regular Certificates with staggered maturities, fees and expenses
of the REMIC Pool would be allocated entirely to the Owners of
Residual Certificates. However, if the REMIC Pool were a
"single-class REMIC" as defined in applicable Treasury
regulations, such deductions would be allocated proportionately
among the Regular and Residual Certificates.



Reporting and Administrative Matters.



Annual reports will be made to the Internal Revenue
Service, and to Holders of record of Regular Certificates, and
Owners of Regular Certificates holding through a broker, nominee
or other middleman, that are not excepted from the reporting
requirements, of accrued interest, original issue discount,
information necessary to compute accruals of market discount,
information regarding the percentage of the REMIC Pool's assets
meeting the qualified assets tests described above under "Status
of Certificates" and, where relevant, allocated amounts of
servicing fees and other Code Section 67 expenses. Holders not
receiving such reports may obtain such information from the
related REMIC by contacting the person designated in IRS
Publication 938. Quarterly reports will be made to Residual
Holders showing their allocable shares of income or loss from the
REMIC Pool, excess inclusions, and Code Section 67 expenses.


The Trustee will sign and file federal income tax returns
for each REMIC Pool. To the extent allowable, the Company will
act as the tax matters person for each REMIC Pool. Each Owner of
a Residual Certificate, by the acceptance of its Residual
Certificate, agrees that the Company will act as the Owner's
agent in the performance of any duties required of the Owner in
the event that the Owner is the tax matters person.


An Owner of a Residual Certificate is required to treat
items on its federal income tax return consistently with the
treatment of the items on the REMIC Pool's return, unless the
Owner owns 100% of the Residual Certificate for the entire
calendar year or the Owner either files a statement identifying
the inconsistency or establishes that the inconsistency resulted
from incorrect information received from the REMIC Pool. The
Internal Revenue Service may assess a deficiency resulting from a
failure to comply with the consistency requirement without
instituting an administrative proceeding at the REMIC level. Any
person that holds a Residual Certificate as a nominee for another
person may be required to furnish the REMIC Pool, in a manner to
be provided in Treasury regulations, the name and address of such
other person and other information.



Non-REMIC Certificates



The discussion in this Section applies only to a Series of
Certificates for which no REMIC election is made.



Trust Fund as Grantor Trust.



Upon issuance of each Series of Certificates, Cleary,
Gottlieb, Steen & Hamilton or another law firm identified in the
related Prospectus Supplement, counsel to the Company, will
deliver its


86





opinion to the effect that, under then current law, assuming
compliance by the Company, the Servicer or Master Servicer and
the Trustee with all the provisions of the Agreement (and such
other agreements and representations as may be referred to in the
opinion), the Trust Fund will be classified for federal income
tax purposes as a grantor trust and not as an association taxable
as a corporation. This opinion will be filed as an Exhibit to the
Form 8-K relating to such Series of Certificates.


Under the grantor trust rules of the Code, each Owner of a
Certificate will be treated for federal income tax purposes as
the owner of an undivided interest in the Mortgage Loans (and any
related assets) included in the Trust Fund. The Owner will
include in its gross income, gross income from the portion of the
Mortgage Loans allocable to the Certificate, and may deduct its
share of the expenses paid by the Trust Fund that are allocable
to the Certificate, at the same time and to the same extent as if
it had directly purchased and held such interest in the Mortgage
Loans and had directly received payments thereon and paid such
expenses. If an Owner is an individual, trust or estate, the
Owner will be allowed deductions for its share of Trust Fund
expenses (including reasonable servicing fees) only to the extent
that the sum of those expenses and the Owner's other
miscellaneous itemized deductions exceeds 2% of adjusted gross
income, and will not be allowed to deduct such expenses for
purposes of the alternative minimum tax. Distributions on a
Certificate will not be taxable to the Owner, and the timing or
amount of distributions will not affect the timing or amount of
income or deductions relating to a Certificate.



Status of the Certificates.



The Offered Certificates, other than Interest Only
Certificates, will be:


-  "qualifying real property loans" under Code

Section 593(d);


-  "real estate assets" under Code Section

856(c)(5)(A); and


-  assets described in Section 7701(a)(19)(C) of
the Code,


to the extent the assets of the Trust Fund are so treated.
Interest income from such Certificates will be "interest on
obligations secured by mortgages on real property" under Code

Section 856(c)(3)(B) to the extent the income of the Trust Fund
qualifies under that section. An "Interest Only Certificate" is a
Certificate which is entitled to receive distributions of some or
all of the interest on the Mortgage Loans or other assets in a
REMIC Pool and that has either a notional or nominal principal
amount. Although not certain, Certificates that are Interest Only
Certificates should qualify under the foregoing Code sections to
the same extent as other Certificates.



Possible Application of Stripped Bond Rules.



The federal income tax treatment of Certificates will
depend on whether they are subject to the "stripped bond" rules
of Code Section 1286. In general, Certificates will be subject to
those rules in the hands of an Owner if (i) the Company (or
anyone else) retains rights to receive more than 100 basis points
of interest on any Mortgage Loans assigned to the Trust Fund
(disregarding rights to reasonable servicing compensation, but
including rights to fees in excess of reasonable compensation),
or (ii) Certificates are issued in two or more Classes
representing rights to non-pro rata shares of interest and
principal payments on the Mortgage Loans.


Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Certificate will not be
subject to the stripped bond rules in the hands of an Owner
unless, viewing the Certificate as a debt instrument issued by
the Trust Fund, it would have original issue discount. In
general, a Certificate will not have original issue discount if
it pays interest at a fixed rate, or a single variable rate,
monthly over its entire life, is issued within one month of the
first Distribution Date, and is issued with no more than a de
minimis


87





amount of discount below its principal amount. Discount is de
minimis if the Certificate has an issue price (generally the
initial offering price at which a substantial amount of
Certificates are sold) that is not less than its principal amount
by more than .25% times the weighted average life of the
Certificate (calculated by rounding down the number of years to
each principal payment to the next lowest number). For a more
detailed discussion of the definition of original issue discount,
see "REMIC Certificates-Income from Regular Certificates-Original
Issue Discount" above.



Taxation of Certificates if Stripped Bond Rules Do Not Apply.



If the stripped bond rules do not apply to a Certificate,
then the Owner will be required to include in income its share of
the interest payments on the Mortgage Loans held by the Trust
Fund in accordance with its tax accounting method. The Owner must
also account for discount or premium on the Mortgage Loans if it
is considered to have purchased its interest in the Mortgage
Loans at a discount or premium. An Owner will be considered to
have purchased an interest in each Mortgage Loan at a price
determined by allocating its purchase price for the Certificate
among the Mortgage Loans in proportion to their fair market
values at the time of purchase. It is likely that discount would
be considered to accrue and premium would be amortized, as
described below, based on an assumption that there will be no
future prepayments of the Mortgage Loans, and not based on a
reasonable prepayment assumption.


Discount. The treatment of any discount relating to a
Mortgage Loan will depend on whether the discount is original
issue discount or market discount. Discount at which a Mortgage
Loan is purchased will be original issue discount only if the
Mortgage Loan itself has original issue discount; the issuance of
Certificates is not considered a new issuance of a debt
instrument that can give rise to original issue discount. A
Mortgage Loan generally will be considered to have original issue
discount if the greater of the amount of points charged to the
borrower, or the amount of any interest foregone during any
initial teaser period, exceeds .167% of the principal amount of
the Mortgage Loan times the number of full years to maturity
(i.e., 5% of the principal amount for a 30 year loan), or if
interest is not paid at a fixed rate or a single variable rate
(disregarding any initial teaser rate) over the life of the
Mortgage Loan. It is not anticipated that the amount of original
issue discount, if any, accruing on the Mortgage Loans in each
month will be significant relative to the interest paid currently
on the Mortgage Loans, but there can be no assurance that this
will be the case.


In the case of a Mortgage Loan that is considered to have
been purchased with market discount that exceeds a de minimis
amount (generally, .167% of the principal amount times the number
of whole years to maturity remaining at the time of purchase),
the Owner will be required to include in income in each month the
amount of such discount that has accrued through such month and
not previously been included in income, but limited to the amount
of principal on the Mortgage Loan that is received by the Trust
Fund in that month. Because the Mortgage Loans will provide for
monthly principal payments, such discount may be required to be
included in income at a rate that is not significantly slower
than the rate at which such discount accrues. Any market discount
that has not previously been included in income will be
recognized as ordinary income if and when the Mortgage Loan is
prepaid in full. For a more detailed discussion of the market
discount rules of the Code, see "REMIC Certificates-Income from
Regular Certificates-Market Discount" above.


In the case of market discount that does not exceed a de
minimis amount, the Owner generally will be required to allocate
ratably the portion of such discount that is allocable to a
Mortgage Loan among the principal payments on the Mortgage Loan
and to include the discount in ordinary income as the related
principal payments are made (whether as scheduled payments or
prepayments).


Premium. In the event that a Mortgage Loan is purchased at
a premium, the Owner may elect under Section 171 of the Code to
amortize such premium under a constant yield method based


88





on the yield of the Mortgage Loan to such Owner, provided that
such Mortgage Loan was originated after September 27, 1985.
Premium allocable to a Mortgage Loan originated on or before that
date should be allocated among the principal payments on the
Mortgage Loan and allowed as an ordinary deduction as principal
payments are made (whether as scheduled payments or prepayments).



Taxation of Certificates if Stripped Bond Rules Apply.



If the stripped bond rules apply to a Certificate, income
on the Certificate will be treated as original issue discount and
will be included in income as it accrues under a constant yield
method. More specifically, for purposes of applying the original
issue discount rules of the Code, the Owner will likely be taxed
as if it had purchased a newly issued, single debt instrument
providing for payments equal to the payments on the interests in
the Mortgage Loans allocable to the Certificate, and having
original issue discount equal to the excess of the sum of such
payments over the Owner's purchase price for the Certificate
(which would be treated as the issue price). The amount of
original issue discount income accruing in any taxable year will
be computed generally as described above under "REMIC
Certificates-Income from Regular Certificates-Original Issue
Discount". It is possible, however, that the calculation must be
made using as the Prepayment Assumption an assumption of zero
prepayments. If the calculation is made assuming no future
prepayments, then the Owner should be allowed to deduct currently
any negative amount of original issue discount produced by the
accrual formula.


Different approaches could be applied in calculating
income under the stripped bond rules. For example, a Certificate
could be viewed as a collection of separate debt instruments (one
for each payment allocable to the Certificate) rather than a
single debt instrument. Also, in the case of an Interest-Only
Certificate, it could be argued that certain proposed regulations
governing contingent payment debt obligations apply. Owners
should consult their own tax advisors regarding the calculation
of income under the stripped bond rules.



Sales of Certificates.



A Certificateholder that sells a Certificate will
recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount
realized in the sale and its adjusted tax basis in the
Certificate. In general, such adjusted basis will equal the
Certificateholder's cost for the Certificate, increased by the
amount of any income previously reported with respect to the
Certificate and decreased (but not below zero) by the amount of
any distributions received thereon, the amount of any losses
previously allowable to such Owner with respect to such
Certificate and any premium amortization thereon. Any such gain
or loss would be capital gain or loss if the Certificate was held
as a capital asset, subject to the potential treatment of gain as
ordinary income to the extent of any accrued but unrecognized
market discount under the market discount rules of the Code, if
applicable.



Foreign Investors.



Except as described in the following paragraph, an Owner
that is not a U. S. person (as defined under "REMIC Certificates-
Taxation of Certain Foreign Investors" above) and that is not
subject to federal income tax as a result of any direct or
indirect connection to the United States in addition to its
ownership of a Certificate will not be subject to United States
income or withholding tax in respect of a Certificate (assuming
the underlying Mortgage Loans were originated after July 18,
1984), if the Owner provides an appropriate statement, signed
under penalties of perjury, identifying the Owner and stating,
among other things, that the Owner is not a U.S. person. If these
conditions are not met, a 30% withholding tax will apply to
interest (including original issue discount) unless an income tax
treaty reduces or eliminates such tax or unless the interest is
effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business
within the United States by such Owner. Income effectively
connected with a U.S. trade or business will be subject to United
States


89





federal income tax at regular rates then applicable to
U.S. taxpayers (and in the case of a corporation, possibly also
the branch profits tax).


In the event the Trust Fund acquires ownership of real
property located in the United States in connection with a
default on a Mortgage Loan, then any rental income from such
property allocable to an Owner that is not a U.S. person
generally will be subject to a 30% withholding tax. In addition,
any gain from the disposition of such real property allocable to
an Owner that is not a U.S. person may be treated as income that
is effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business under
special rules governing United States real property interests.
The Trust Fund may be required to withhold tax on gain realized
upon a disposition of such real property by the Trust Fund at a
35% rate.



Reporting.



Tax information will be reported annually to the Internal
Revenue Service and to Holders of Certificates that are not
excluded from the reporting requirements.



Backup Withholding



Distributions made on a Certificate and proceeds from the
sale of a Certificate to or through certain brokers may be
subject to a "backup" withholding tax of 31% unless, in general,
the Owner of the Certificate complies with certain procedures or
is a corporation or other person exempt from such withholding.
Any amounts so withheld from distributions on the Certificates
would be refunded by the Internal Revenue Service or allowed as a
credit against the Owner's federal income tax.



STATE TAX CONSIDERATIONS



In addition to the Federal income tax consequences
described in "Federal Income Tax Consequences," potential
investors should consider the state income tax consequences of
the acquisition, ownership, and disposition of the Offered
Certificates. State income tax law may differ substantially from
the corresponding federal law, and this discussion does not
purport to describe any aspect of the income tax laws of any
state. Therefore, potential investors should consult their own
tax advisors with respect to the various state tax consequences
of an investment in the Offered Certificates.
