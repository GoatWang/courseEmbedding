Oil & Gas Investment Fraud Scams & Lawsuits Attorneys
























































































Oil & Gas Investment Scams
With the drop in oil prices in 2014 and 2015, thousands of investors are realizing they have been taken advantage of in investments related to oil and gas. There are two types of investment losses in oil and gas securities that are potentially recoverable through the FIRNA arbitration process or via lawsuit.
Unsuitable Investment Recommendations In Oil and Gas Stocks, Bonds, Master Limited Partnerships and Mutual Funds: Negligence based unsuitable investment recommendations in oil, gas and energy related companies make up a majority of the cases we’ve handled for investors. For example, brokers at full service brokerage firms recommended oil and gas stocks, master limited partnerships and other related investments heavily to investors between 2010 and 2014. With the massive slide in oil prices in 2014 and 2015 caused by the jump in domestic oil stockpiles due to new, highly efficient drilling techniques like horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracking techniques, companies affiliated with the oil industries have lost substantial value resulting in devastating investment losses for many investors. Unfortunately, many small oil and gas producers have lost a majority of their value in 2014 and 2015. These companies have heavy debt loads that simply couldn’t be maintained with the oil price slide.
Dozens of master limited partnerships have declined in value in 2014 and 2015. The $500 billion master-limited-partnership sector is the sausage maker of the investment world. Buyers love the yields — now averaging about 6% — but many know little about how the yields are generated. The bullish pitch by brokers in favor of the investments centered around the high-yielding way to participate in the booming U.S. energy infrastructure build-out. Unfortunately, the investments, while providing generous yields, masked the substantial high risks of these investments.
Many of these investments were pitched to elderly and conservative investors because of the relatively high dividends and yields that the investments paid out. These losses are potentially recoverable through either FINRA arbitration claims against the brokerage firms whose brokers recommended the investments or lawsuits against the promoters of the investments.
Fraud Based Claims: The second type of oil and gas actions deal with fraud based claims. Oil and gas investments take many forms, including limited partnership interests, master limited partnerships, ownership of fractional undivided interests in leases, and general partnerships. Risk level, tax consequences and investor liability vary according to the type of program. Drilling partnerships have always been a gamble, but unfortunately many oil and gas scams have been perpetrated by bad actors in the securities industry. Although some of the con artists moved on to more lucrative venues since the oil boom ended in the mid-1980s, many continued to linger on in the oil field and the results of their actions are being felt now. Fraudulent oil and gas deals are frequently structured with the limited partnership (or other legal entity) in one state, the operation and physical presence of the field in a second state, and the offerings made to prospective investors in states other than the initial two states. Thus there is less chance of an investor dropping by a well site or a nonexistent company headquarters. Such a structure also makes it difficult for law enforcement officials and victims to identify and expose the fraud.
Our Securities Law Firm Holds Financial Advisors Accountable
Brokers at major brokerage firms like Linsco LPL, UBS, Merrill Lynch, Raymond James, Citgroup and Stifel Nicolaus also sometimes engage in an activity called “selling away”. When a broker sells a customer an “investment” outside the investment products offered by the brokerage firm and outside the client’s account, there may be a selling away issue. These investments, known as Private Securities, often involve investments in oil and gas related limited partnerships, privately held companies, private placements, promissory notes, and other similar investments. Sometimes they are real investments. Other times they are completely bogus and used as a means for the advisor to convert client funds.
Unfortunately, unscrupulous oil promoters and stockbrokers frequently use the Internet and “boiler room” offices with banks of phones manned by salespeople with little or no background in energy exploration, but plenty of experience in high-pressure sales. Their techniques include repeated unsolicited phone calls to potential investors, hyping the profitability of the deal and promises of safe but secure returns. Some examples of these pitches include:
• You will have an interest in a well that cannot miss;
• The risks are minimal;
• A geologist has given the salesperson a tip;
• The broker or salesperson has personally invested in the venture;
• The promoter has “hit” on every well drilled so far;
• There has been a tremendous “discovery” in an adjacent field;
• A large, reputable oil company like Chevron is operating or planning to operate in the area;
• Only a few interests remain to be sold and you should immediately send in your money in order to assure the purchase of an interest;
• This is a special private deal open only to a lucky chosen few investors.
