History[edit]
According to the company, founder Allen Stoltzfus learned German through immersion while living in Germany and found it relatively easy. In the 1980s, Stoltzfus began learning Russian in a classroom setting, but found the classroom setting much more difficult. He wanted to simulate the German experience, and he decided to use computer technology to create a similar learning experience. He enlisted the aid of his brother-in-law, John Fairfield, who held a PhD in computer science.
By 1992 CD-ROM technology made the project possible. They formed a company known as Fairfield Language Technologies in Harrisonburg, Virginia. Allen and John hired Eugene Stoltzfus (Allen's brother), Greg Keim and Michael Silverman. They released their software product under the title The Rosetta Stone. In 2003 the company announced the hiring of Tom Adams, a businessman with international experience, as President and CEO.
In 2006 the company changed names to Rosetta Stone, Ltd., and converted from an S corporation to a C corporation. Ownership transferred to investment firms ABS Capital Partners and Northwest Equity Partners. On September 23, 2008, Rosetta Stone Inc. filed an Initial public offering with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
On April 15, 2009, the company was listed as the Rosetta Stone on the New York Stock Exchange. Since 2016, the company's president and CEO has been John Hass.[2] Rosetta Stone is transitioning to a cloud-based business model that goes beyond language learning and deeper into education technology. In 2013, it acquired four companies—Vivity Labs Inc (creators of the Fit Brains Trainer),[3] Livemocha,[4] Tell Me More,[5] and Lexia Learning.[6]
On September 17, 2013, Rosetta Stone announced the launch of a new Kids Division [7] and in November, 2014 it debuted its first kids reading program for consumers, Rosetta Stone Kids Reading.[8]
IPO[edit]
On April 15, 2009, Rosetta Stone raised $112 million in its initial public offering of stock shares.[9] In its first full day of trading on the New York Stock Exchange, the stock gained 39% from its opening price.[10] After a strong opening, however, the stock stumbled amid reports of weaknesses in Rosetta Stone's US business, resulting in the cancellation of a second offering, and a disappointing year end price just 5 cents off its opening price.[11] The stock trades under ticker symbol RST.[9][10] As of December 2015, the stock was at approximately $68.20 (USD) per share.[12]
Offices[edit]

Corporate headquarters are in Arlington, Virginia.
There are also offices in Harrisonburg, Virginia; Boulder, Colorado; Austin, Texas; Seattle, Washington; Boston/Concord, Massachusetts; London, United Kingdom; and Seoul, South Korea.

Endangered language communities[edit]
In 2004, Rosetta Stone Ltd. established its Endangered Language Program to contract with endangered language communities interested in custom software development to support language revitalization efforts.[13]
Support for the Combating Online Infringement and Counterfeits Act[edit]
Rosetta Stone was among a group of companies signed to a letter supporting Combating Online Infringement and Counterfeits Act (COICA), a bill which opponents argue amounts to censorship.[14]

Rosetta Stone Language Learning is proprietary computer-assisted language learning (CALL) software published by Rosetta Stone Inc. The software uses images, text, and sound to teach words and grammar by spaced repetition, without translation. Rosetta Stone calls its approach Dynamic Immersion (a term which has been trademarked).
The software's name and logo allude to the Rosetta Stone, an ancient stone slab on which the Decree of Memphis is inscribed in three writing systems.

Dynamic Immersion[edit]
In a Rosetta Stone Language Learning exercise, the student pairs sound or text to one of several images. The number of images per screen varies.
For example, the software shows the student four photographs. A native speaker makes a statement that describes one of the photographs, and the statement is printed on the screen; the student chooses the photograph that the speaker described. In another variation, the student completes a textual description of a photograph.
In writing exercises, the software provides an on-screen keyboard for the user to type characters that are not in the Latin alphabet.
Grammar lessons cover grammatical tense and grammatical mood. In grammar lessons, the program firstly shows the learner several examples of a grammatical concept, and in some levels the word or words the learner should focus on are highlighted. Then the learner is given a sentence with several options for a word or phrase, and the student chooses the correct option.
If the student has a microphone, the software can attempt to evaluate word pronunciation.
Each lesson concludes with a review of the content in that lesson, and each unit concludes with a milestone, which is a simulated conversation that includes the content of the unit.
Scoring[edit]
The program immediately informs whether the answer is right or wrong. Through the Preferences screen, the student can choose whether a sound is played or not when an answer is clicked. At the bottom of the window, the program shows all the screens for the current lesson. If all answers for that screen are correct, the button for that screen turns green. If some answers are correct, the border of the button turns green, but the screen number itself turns orange. If all answers for a screen are wrong, the button turns orange. This applies to all lessons except review and milestone lessons, which are treated as tests. In those lessons, the buttons for each screen all remain brown. In all lessons there is a button in the bottom-right of the window which can be hovered over to display how many answers are correct, wrong or have not been answered. Each time an answer is clicked, one point is given. At the end of the lesson, the total number of correct, wrong or skipped answers is shown alongside the percentage of correct answers for that lesson. If too many questions were answered incorrectly, the program suggests the learner should retry the lesson.
Software versions[edit]
To use Rosetta Stone Language Learning, a student needs the Rosetta Stone application software and at least one level of a language pack. The latest major version of Rosetta Stone is Rosetta Stone Language Learning 5.0.13.
Language packs also have version numbers. The version number of the language pack is distinct from the version numbering scheme of the Rosetta Stone application, and a language pack is only compatible with specific versions of the application. Version 4 and 5 are backward compatible with language packs developed for Version 3, but not older ones.[2]
Version 1[edit]
By the end of 1996, Rosetta Stone Version 1 had a selection of nine level-one language courses (Dutch, English, French, German, Italian, Mandarin Chinese, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish) and four level-two courses (English, French, German, Spanish). A CD-ROM product called The Rosetta Stone PowerPac featured introductory versions of seven of the courses.
At this time, Fairfield Language Technologies had already begun development of the Arabic, Esperanto, Hebrew, Indonesian, Japanese, Korean, Swahili, Thai, and Vietnamese courses. Within a few months, the Japanese, Thai, and Vietnamese courses were complete, and development of Latin, Polish, and Welsh courses were underway. The Latin course was the next to be completed, followed by Hebrew. In this fashion, Fairfield introduced new courses to market gradually.
Rosetta Stone Version 1 was developed for Macintosh System 6 and higher, and Windows 3.0 and higher. Later revisions of Version 1 for Macintosh required System 7. The final revision of Version 1 was v1.9.[2]
Version 2[edit]
At Version 2, Fairfield continued to add more language courses, but also marketed more editions of The Rosetta Stone software.
The PowerPac CD-ROM introduced in Version 1 now featured basic lessons in seven languages. One complete level of a language course was now called a Personal Edition of the software.
Because many consumers found The Rosetta Stone to be too expensive, Fairfield started a series of "Explorer" editions. An Explorer CD-ROM was a lower-cost excerpt of a Version 2 course. Each edition of the Rosetta Stone Explorer series (Japanese Explorer, Welsh Explorer, etc.) included three units (22 lessons) from Level 1. The company no longer sells Explorer editions.
Then there was Global Traveler, a CD-ROM and electronic translation dictionary package for people requiring some facility in English, French, Spanish, Italian, or German. The lessons on the CD-ROM teach words and phrases for travelers. The electronic translator was programmed with about 60,000 words and 720 phrases.
Compatibility[edit]
The Rosetta Stone v2.0.x is backward compatible with some of the later language packs for Version 1; specifically languages courses with a version number of 3.0 or 4.0.x.[2]
The Rosetta Stone v2.1 through v2.2.x are only compatible with v6.x language courses. These versions of the language packs and software engine are neither backward compatible nor forward compatible.[2] Language discs developed for The Rosetta Stone v2.0.x are incompatible with these later revisions of the software.
In v2.1.4.1A of The Rosetta Stone, the program began using copy protection software called SafeDisc.
Version 3[edit]
Rosetta Stone Version 3 is not backward compatible with language packs developed for Rosetta Stone Versions 1 or 2.[2]
The final revision of Version 3 is v3.4.7.r1.[2][3]
Homeschool Edition[edit]
Homeschool Edition introduces additional features that keep track of time spent per lesson, scores achieved on lessons, lesson plans, and instructional objectives. This edition includes a supplemental CD-ROM that has workbooks, quizzes, lesson transcripts, and exams.
Unlike the Personal Edition, the Homeschool Edition application does not recommend reviews. Aside from the minor differences, the homeschool edition is essentially the same as the personal edition—except for the supplemental CD with written exercises and lesson plans. The language discs in the two editions are identical and are interchangeable. Some may have 3 discs and some may have 5. Much of the information on the supplemental CD-ROM is available online from Rosetta Stone.[4]

Version 4 TOTALe[edit]
Version 4 is backward compatible with all language packs developed for Version 3.[2]
Rosetta Stone released Version 4 TOTALe on September 14, 2010. TOTALe is a software suite comprising Rosetta Course, Rosetta Studio, Rosetta World, and TOTALe Mobile Companion. Users of the Rosetta Studio software subscribe to a service that videoconferences them with a language coach.[5] Rosetta World is a social gaming service. TOTALe Mobile Companion is a Rosetta Stone mobile app for iOS and Android devices.
With Version 4, Rosetta Stone adds stricter copy protection measures.
Rosetta Stone Language Learning 5.0.13[edit]
Rosetta Stone released Version 5 on October 9, 2014. The notable changes are the change in brand name ("Rosetta Course" has become "Language Training"), a new interactive demo is built into the application based on user feedback and a new minimalist UI with no beveled edges or drop shadows.
The software is offered in three variants

Discover Languages[edit]
Rosetta Stone’s Discover Languages is an app currently only available on Xbox One. It is very different from the traditional design, involving a virtual world and more of a focus on games in order to appeal more strongly to game playing audiences. The only language currently supported are English and Spanish.[6]

Language courses[edit]
As of January 2015[update], there are 28[7] Language Training courses offered by Rosetta. This count places it in the top half of language publishers by number of languages taught.[8] Each language course requires its own language pack which is offered in CD-ROMs or download. The online subscription doesn't require any language packs.

Language Course organization[edit]
The language courses are divided into three to five levels offered as language packs either in CD-ROMs or Download. In the retail software packages of Rosetta Stone, each CD-ROM has one level.
All languages, except Latin, use mostly the same set of words and sentences in almost the same order, with mainly the same images. Some of the material is reused from lesson to lesson to invoke long-term retention.
In version 3 pack, there are four units per language level. Each unit has four core lessons that are about 30 minutes long. The student then moves on to one of the following lesson modes: Pronunciation, Writing, Vocabulary, Grammar, Listening, Reading, Speaking. The Milestone is an exercise at the end of each unit in which students apply what they learned in the unit.
Rosetta Stone v2 Language Pack[edit]
In Rosetta Stone version 2 Language Packs, most lessons have two levels; a few have three.
Level 1 (8 units)[edit]
The first eight units have 84 lessons, plus eight reviews. The lessons reiterate simple vocabulary and grammatical tenses. The lessons conclude with a unit on giving directions.
Units 1–4 have 10 lessons and one review. Units 5–8 have 11 lessons and a review.
Level 2 (11 units)[edit]
The 11 units of Level 2 include a total of 118 lessons. The lessons in the first nine units have a format similar to those in Level 1. The final two units are "Glossary" units devoted to single words pertaining to a particular topic, such as school, nature, or automobiles.
Level 2 units cover more advanced grammar, as well as preparation for common situations, such as banking, shopping, and tourism. Short videos (in QuickTime format) illustrate some verbs.
Units 16 and 17 use single-panel comics from the Saturday Evening Post as a teaching tool.
Level 3[edit]
Level 3 expands on Level 2 with longer videos and written passages.
Rosetta Stone v3 Language Pack[edit]
Rosetta Stone version 3 Language Pack has 3–5 levels. The lessons differ by language. Compared with Version 2, Version 3 lessons focus more on conversation and less on grammar rules.
Level 1 (4 units)[edit]
In level one, each unit has a 30-minute lesson and some activities that are five to fifteen minutes long. Level 1 takes up to 24 hours to complete.
Starting from simple vocabulary such as basic greetings, "boy", "girl", "man", and "woman", moving up through numbers, comparisons, adjectives, nouns, verb conjugation, and telling time. Each unit also contains a ten-minute simulated conversation called a "Milestone".
The units are: Language Basics, Greetings and Introductions, Work and School, and Shopping.
Level 2 (4 units)[edit]
Level 2 offers a total of about twenty-four hours designed to teach the user to "navigate your surroundings as you build on the vocabulary and essential language structure in Level 1." More grammar is covered, including past and future tenses, and imperative forms. Topics such as giving directions, writing letters, workplace terms, apologies, discussing emotions, and criticizing art are also covered. As in Level 1, each unit is followed by a ten-minute "Milestone".
The four units in Level 2 are Travel, Past and Future, Friends and Social Life, and Dining and Vacation.
Level 3 (4 units)[edit]
Level 3 offers instruction designed to help "connect with the world around you by building on the language fundamentals and conversational skills you developed in Levels 1 and 2." In addition to expanding upon grammar learned in Levels 1 and 2, Level 3 teaches more in depth vocabulary, including botanical terms, culinary terms, how to express detailed opinions and judgments, and how to discuss politics, religion, and business. As in the first two levels, each unit contains a ten-minute "Milestone" activity in which the user participates in a simulated conversation.
The four units in Level 3 are Home and Health, Life and World, Everyday Things, and Places and Events.
Level 4 (4 units)[edit]
The four units are Tourism and Recreation, Professions and Hobbies, At Home and Around Town, and Style and Personal Wellness.
Level 5 (4 units)[edit]
The four units are Business and Industry, Arts and Academics, Emergency Situations, and Family and Community.
Levels 4 and 5 teach more complex sentence structures, higher verbal tenses, and more irregular verbs, and introduce more vocabulary.
Audio Companion[edit]
On 9 June 2008, Rosetta Stone introduced an addition to its Version 3 product line: Audio Companion, supplemental audio recordings of words and phrases. The student is meant to repeat the spoken words and phrases for practice and memorization.[9] Unlike recordings based on the Pimsleur method, the Audio Companion provides neither narration nor translations. Rosetta Stone distributes the audio supplements on audio CD and as MP3 files. Each Audio Companion supplements one level of the language course, and each disc supplements a specific unit. Complete Version 4 course packages include Audio Companion material for each level.
Endangered Language Program[edit]
The Endangered Language Program was created in 2004 for use by endangered language communities engaged in language revitalization.[10]
Organizations that contract the Endangered Language Program to develop custom software own the sales and distribution rights over their final product, allowing communities control over this language resource and respecting indigenous intellectual property rights.[11] These versions are thus not marketed via the usual outlets such as bookstores or commercial websites.
Based in Harrisonburg, Virginia, the Endangered Language Program began offering a corporate grant program in 2007 to underwrite development costs for awarded communities.[12] Rosetta Stone Inc. offered the first awards of the grant program to the Chitimacha Tribe of Louisiana[13] and the Navajo Language Renaissance coalition.[14]
The Endangered Language Program also offers paid internships to graduate and undergraduate students interested in contributing to the work of the program.[15]

In November 2015 the Chickasaw Nation, through the Chickasaw Language Revitalization Program established in 2007, contracted with Rosetta Stone to customize language learning content to preserve and introduce the Chickasaw language to its 60,000+ members worldwide.[16][17] This effort comes as the Chickasaw Nation has approximately 50 native speakers remaining, with its last monolingual speaker having died in 2013.[18]
Reception and efficacy[edit]
Critiques from language experts[edit]
Frequent criticism of the program arises in its lack of sensitivity to the differences between the various languages it comes in and their respective cultures.[19] Early versions of the software presented the same concepts in the same order, using the same images taken mostly in the Washington, D.C. area near the company's headquarters at the time in Harrisonburg, Virginia. In the most recent version, there have been some modifications to the picture set for certain languages or regions.
Another frequent issue was the use of more formal vocabulary than that regularly used by native speakers. In 2006, Macworld reviewer Cyrus Farivar noted that his Persian CD used khodrow for "car", although most native speakers use a French loanword, ma:sheen. The same course did not teach words that would be important to someone learning Persian, such as "bread" and "tea"; however, it very curiously included the word "elephant" in a basic vocabulary lesson. Perplexed by the question of why the word "elephant" would be taught in a language where it might never be used (there are not many elephants in Iran), Farivar called Rosetta Stone, Inc. He was told that the company makes four different picture sets: one for Western languages, another for Asian languages, and two sets unique to each Swahili and Latin. The Persian language CD was using the Western picture set, which explains why the images were not culturally relevant.[20]
Donald McRae on the German course[edit]
Writing in 1997, Donald McRae of Brock University said that Rosetta Stone represented "good pedagogy" and that "the authors of the program never lose sight of solid teaching methodology". He described the Version 2 German language course as "very good", but indicated that he had "some reservations".[further explanation needed][21]
Mark Kaiser on the Russian course[edit]
In a 1997 review of the Version 2 Russian language course, Mark Kaiser, director of the Language Media Center at the University of California, Berkeley, called the program "woefully inadequate for a number of reasons".[22]
One of Kaiser's observations was that Rosetta Stone software fails to provide a relevant cultural context. Because the company uses the same stock photographs for all its language courses, they depict people, activities, and manufactured goods that are conspicuously American. Kaiser also found that Rosetta Stone Version 2 does not provide a way for students to evaluate their conversation skills, and that some of the words and phrases are too English-based.
"The entire package lacks any pedagogical foundation," he concluded. "Rather, it utilizes the glitz of the multimedia capabilities of the computer, a dearth of quality foreign language software, and clever marketing to create an economically successful product."[22][dead link]
Brendan Lewis, a world traveler, made similar observations in his critique nearly 14 years later.[23]
Stephen Krashen's Review[edit]
The language-learning specialist Stephen Krashen found that the few studies on the software produced learning results that were "about as effective as traditional instruction on traditional tests."[24]
End User License Agreement[edit]
The user purchases a licence to use the software, which is non-transferable. Up to five members of a household may use a single licence.[25]

Institutional use[edit]
United States Army[edit]
In December 2007, the United States Army offered a special military version of Arabic to help troops deploying to the Middle East learn the language for conversations and phrases important in a military situation.[38] It was available to all US Army personnel, US Military Academy cadets, contracted US Army ROTC Cadets and other special guests with a sponsor.
The United States Army "E-Learning", a SkillPort product, offered the full Version 3 Online, with the exception of only a few languages. The Army E-Learning web site was accessible by most Army members with a valid AKO (Army Knowledge Online) e-mail address or CAC (Common Access Card).[39]
Rosetta Stone's Army contract ended on September 24, 2011.[40]
Other branches of the U.S military also offered Rosetta Stone software. The United States Air Force also offers a similar version to company-grade officers.[41] The United States Marine Corps also offers an online version of all the languages that Rosetta Stone offers through their MarineNet Distance Learning portal.[42]
The U.S. Department of State uses Rosetta Stone (Version 3 as of 2009) as a companion to their in-class and distance learning language programs provided through the Foreign Service Institute. It is free for civil and foreign service employees.[citation needed]
James Madison University[edit]
In April 2011, James Madison University was the first university to partner with Rosetta Stone to offer the Rosetta Stone Version 4 TOTALe as an accredited Conversational Spanish I language learning course. The program teaches Spanish through a series of images that, when clicked on, show the vocabulary word. The student will speak into a microphone and speech recognition software will correct mispronounced words, according to Reilly Brennan, Rosetta Stone's Director of Public Relations. The course is available to adults who want to complete a degree for teaching and non-degree seeking students are eligible to take the class. The Rosetta Stone TOTALe accredited offering is a 16-week, intensive language-learning program. The program is accessed completely online and follows a syllabus approved by Rosetta Stone and James Madison University.[43]

History[edit]
According to the company, founder Allen Stoltzfus learned German through immersion while living in Germany and found it relatively easy. In the 1980s, Stoltzfus began learning Russian in a classroom setting, but found the classroom setting much more difficult. He wanted to simulate the German experience, and he decided to use computer technology to create a similar learning experience. He enlisted the aid of his brother-in-law, John Fairfield, who held a PhD in computer science.
By 1992 CD-ROM technology made the project possible. They formed a company known as Fairfield Language Technologies in Harrisonburg, Virginia. Allen and John hired Eugene Stoltzfus (Allen's brother), Greg Keim and Michael Silverman. They released their software product under the title The Rosetta Stone. In 2003 the company announced the hiring of Tom Adams, a businessman with international experience, as President and CEO.
In 2006 the company changed names to Rosetta Stone, Ltd., and converted from an S corporation to a C corporation. Ownership transferred to investment firms ABS Capital Partners and Northwest Equity Partners. On September 23, 2008, Rosetta Stone Inc. filed an Initial public offering with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
On April 15, 2009, the company was listed as the Rosetta Stone on the New York Stock Exchange. Since 2016, the company's president and CEO has been John Hass.[2] Rosetta Stone is transitioning to a cloud-based business model that goes beyond language learning and deeper into education technology. In 2013, it acquired four companies—Vivity Labs Inc (creators of the Fit Brains Trainer),[3] Livemocha,[4] Tell Me More,[5] and Lexia Learning.[6]
On September 17, 2013, Rosetta Stone announced the launch of a new Kids Division [7] and in November, 2014 it debuted its first kids reading program for consumers, Rosetta Stone Kids Reading.[8]
IPO[edit]
On April 15, 2009, Rosetta Stone raised $112 million in its initial public offering of stock shares.[9] In its first full day of trading on the New York Stock Exchange, the stock gained 39% from its opening price.[10] After a strong opening, however, the stock stumbled amid reports of weaknesses in Rosetta Stone's US business, resulting in the cancellation of a second offering, and a disappointing year end price just 5 cents off its opening price.[11] The stock trades under ticker symbol RST.[9][10] As of December 2015, the stock was at approximately $68.20 (USD) per share.[12]
Offices[edit]

Corporate headquarters are in Arlington, Virginia.
There are also offices in Harrisonburg, Virginia; Boulder, Colorado; Austin, Texas; Seattle, Washington; Boston/Concord, Massachusetts; London, United Kingdom; and Seoul, South Korea.

Endangered language communities[edit]
In 2004, Rosetta Stone Ltd. established its Endangered Language Program to contract with endangered language communities interested in custom software development to support language revitalization efforts.[13]
Support for the Combating Online Infringement and Counterfeits Act[edit]
Rosetta Stone was among a group of companies signed to a letter supporting Combating Online Infringement and Counterfeits Act (COICA), a bill which opponents argue amounts to censorship.[14]

Rosetta Stone Language Learning is proprietary computer-assisted language learning (CALL) software published by Rosetta Stone Inc. The software uses images, text, and sound to teach words and grammar by spaced repetition, without translation. Rosetta Stone calls its approach Dynamic Immersion (a term which has been trademarked).
The software's name and logo allude to the Rosetta Stone, an ancient stone slab on which the Decree of Memphis is inscribed in three writing systems.

Dynamic Immersion[edit]
In a Rosetta Stone Language Learning exercise, the student pairs sound or text to one of several images. The number of images per screen varies.
For example, the software shows the student four photographs. A native speaker makes a statement that describes one of the photographs, and the statement is printed on the screen; the student chooses the photograph that the speaker described. In another variation, the student completes a textual description of a photograph.
In writing exercises, the software provides an on-screen keyboard for the user to type characters that are not in the Latin alphabet.
Grammar lessons cover grammatical tense and grammatical mood. In grammar lessons, the program firstly shows the learner several examples of a grammatical concept, and in some levels the word or words the learner should focus on are highlighted. Then the learner is given a sentence with several options for a word or phrase, and the student chooses the correct option.
If the student has a microphone, the software can attempt to evaluate word pronunciation.
Each lesson concludes with a review of the content in that lesson, and each unit concludes with a milestone, which is a simulated conversation that includes the content of the unit.
Scoring[edit]
The program immediately informs whether the answer is right or wrong. Through the Preferences screen, the student can choose whether a sound is played or not when an answer is clicked. At the bottom of the window, the program shows all the screens for the current lesson. If all answers for that screen are correct, the button for that screen turns green. If some answers are correct, the border of the button turns green, but the screen number itself turns orange. If all answers for a screen are wrong, the button turns orange. This applies to all lessons except review and milestone lessons, which are treated as tests. In those lessons, the buttons for each screen all remain brown. In all lessons there is a button in the bottom-right of the window which can be hovered over to display how many answers are correct, wrong or have not been answered. Each time an answer is clicked, one point is given. At the end of the lesson, the total number of correct, wrong or skipped answers is shown alongside the percentage of correct answers for that lesson. If too many questions were answered incorrectly, the program suggests the learner should retry the lesson.
Software versions[edit]
To use Rosetta Stone Language Learning, a student needs the Rosetta Stone application software and at least one level of a language pack. The latest major version of Rosetta Stone is Rosetta Stone Language Learning 5.0.13.
Language packs also have version numbers. The version number of the language pack is distinct from the version numbering scheme of the Rosetta Stone application, and a language pack is only compatible with specific versions of the application. Version 4 and 5 are backward compatible with language packs developed for Version 3, but not older ones.[2]
Version 1[edit]
By the end of 1996, Rosetta Stone Version 1 had a selection of nine level-one language courses (Dutch, English, French, German, Italian, Mandarin Chinese, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish) and four level-two courses (English, French, German, Spanish). A CD-ROM product called The Rosetta Stone PowerPac featured introductory versions of seven of the courses.
At this time, Fairfield Language Technologies had already begun development of the Arabic, Esperanto, Hebrew, Indonesian, Japanese, Korean, Swahili, Thai, and Vietnamese courses. Within a few months, the Japanese, Thai, and Vietnamese courses were complete, and development of Latin, Polish, and Welsh courses were underway. The Latin course was the next to be completed, followed by Hebrew. In this fashion, Fairfield introduced new courses to market gradually.
Rosetta Stone Version 1 was developed for Macintosh System 6 and higher, and Windows 3.0 and higher. Later revisions of Version 1 for Macintosh required System 7. The final revision of Version 1 was v1.9.[2]
Version 2[edit]
At Version 2, Fairfield continued to add more language courses, but also marketed more editions of The Rosetta Stone software.
The PowerPac CD-ROM introduced in Version 1 now featured basic lessons in seven languages. One complete level of a language course was now called a Personal Edition of the software.
Because many consumers found The Rosetta Stone to be too expensive, Fairfield started a series of "Explorer" editions. An Explorer CD-ROM was a lower-cost excerpt of a Version 2 course. Each edition of the Rosetta Stone Explorer series (Japanese Explorer, Welsh Explorer, etc.) included three units (22 lessons) from Level 1. The company no longer sells Explorer editions.
Then there was Global Traveler, a CD-ROM and electronic translation dictionary package for people requiring some facility in English, French, Spanish, Italian, or German. The lessons on the CD-ROM teach words and phrases for travelers. The electronic translator was programmed with about 60,000 words and 720 phrases.
Compatibility[edit]
The Rosetta Stone v2.0.x is backward compatible with some of the later language packs for Version 1; specifically languages courses with a version number of 3.0 or 4.0.x.[2]
The Rosetta Stone v2.1 through v2.2.x are only compatible with v6.x language courses. These versions of the language packs and software engine are neither backward compatible nor forward compatible.[2] Language discs developed for The Rosetta Stone v2.0.x are incompatible with these later revisions of the software.
In v2.1.4.1A of The Rosetta Stone, the program began using copy protection software called SafeDisc.
Version 3[edit]
Rosetta Stone Version 3 is not backward compatible with language packs developed for Rosetta Stone Versions 1 or 2.[2]
The final revision of Version 3 is v3.4.7.r1.[2][3]
Homeschool Edition[edit]
Homeschool Edition introduces additional features that keep track of time spent per lesson, scores achieved on lessons, lesson plans, and instructional objectives. This edition includes a supplemental CD-ROM that has workbooks, quizzes, lesson transcripts, and exams.
Unlike the Personal Edition, the Homeschool Edition application does not recommend reviews. Aside from the minor differences, the homeschool edition is essentially the same as the personal edition—except for the supplemental CD with written exercises and lesson plans. The language discs in the two editions are identical and are interchangeable. Some may have 3 discs and some may have 5. Much of the information on the supplemental CD-ROM is available online from Rosetta Stone.[4]

Version 4 TOTALe[edit]
Version 4 is backward compatible with all language packs developed for Version 3.[2]
Rosetta Stone released Version 4 TOTALe on September 14, 2010. TOTALe is a software suite comprising Rosetta Course, Rosetta Studio, Rosetta World, and TOTALe Mobile Companion. Users of the Rosetta Studio software subscribe to a service that videoconferences them with a language coach.[5] Rosetta World is a social gaming service. TOTALe Mobile Companion is a Rosetta Stone mobile app for iOS and Android devices.
With Version 4, Rosetta Stone adds stricter copy protection measures.
Rosetta Stone Language Learning 5.0.13[edit]
Rosetta Stone released Version 5 on October 9, 2014. The notable changes are the change in brand name ("Rosetta Course" has become "Language Training"), a new interactive demo is built into the application based on user feedback and a new minimalist UI with no beveled edges or drop shadows.
The software is offered in three variants

Discover Languages[edit]
Rosetta Stone’s Discover Languages is an app currently only available on Xbox One. It is very different from the traditional design, involving a virtual world and more of a focus on games in order to appeal more strongly to game playing audiences. The only language currently supported are English and Spanish.[6]

Language courses[edit]
As of January 2015[update], there are 28[7] Language Training courses offered by Rosetta. This count places it in the top half of language publishers by number of languages taught.[8] Each language course requires its own language pack which is offered in CD-ROMs or download. The online subscription doesn't require any language packs.

Language Course organization[edit]
The language courses are divided into three to five levels offered as language packs either in CD-ROMs or Download. In the retail software packages of Rosetta Stone, each CD-ROM has one level.
All languages, except Latin, use mostly the same set of words and sentences in almost the same order, with mainly the same images. Some of the material is reused from lesson to lesson to invoke long-term retention.
In version 3 pack, there are four units per language level. Each unit has four core lessons that are about 30 minutes long. The student then moves on to one of the following lesson modes: Pronunciation, Writing, Vocabulary, Grammar, Listening, Reading, Speaking. The Milestone is an exercise at the end of each unit in which students apply what they learned in the unit.
Rosetta Stone v2 Language Pack[edit]
In Rosetta Stone version 2 Language Packs, most lessons have two levels; a few have three.
Level 1 (8 units)[edit]
The first eight units have 84 lessons, plus eight reviews. The lessons reiterate simple vocabulary and grammatical tenses. The lessons conclude with a unit on giving directions.
Units 1–4 have 10 lessons and one review. Units 5–8 have 11 lessons and a review.
Level 2 (11 units)[edit]
The 11 units of Level 2 include a total of 118 lessons. The lessons in the first nine units have a format similar to those in Level 1. The final two units are "Glossary" units devoted to single words pertaining to a particular topic, such as school, nature, or automobiles.
Level 2 units cover more advanced grammar, as well as preparation for common situations, such as banking, shopping, and tourism. Short videos (in QuickTime format) illustrate some verbs.
Units 16 and 17 use single-panel comics from the Saturday Evening Post as a teaching tool.
Level 3[edit]
Level 3 expands on Level 2 with longer videos and written passages.
Rosetta Stone v3 Language Pack[edit]
Rosetta Stone version 3 Language Pack has 3–5 levels. The lessons differ by language. Compared with Version 2, Version 3 lessons focus more on conversation and less on grammar rules.
Level 1 (4 units)[edit]
In level one, each unit has a 30-minute lesson and some activities that are five to fifteen minutes long. Level 1 takes up to 24 hours to complete.
Starting from simple vocabulary such as basic greetings, "boy", "girl", "man", and "woman", moving up through numbers, comparisons, adjectives, nouns, verb conjugation, and telling time. Each unit also contains a ten-minute simulated conversation called a "Milestone".
The units are: Language Basics, Greetings and Introductions, Work and School, and Shopping.
Level 2 (4 units)[edit]
Level 2 offers a total of about twenty-four hours designed to teach the user to "navigate your surroundings as you build on the vocabulary and essential language structure in Level 1." More grammar is covered, including past and future tenses, and imperative forms. Topics such as giving directions, writing letters, workplace terms, apologies, discussing emotions, and criticizing art are also covered. As in Level 1, each unit is followed by a ten-minute "Milestone".
The four units in Level 2 are Travel, Past and Future, Friends and Social Life, and Dining and Vacation.
Level 3 (4 units)[edit]
Level 3 offers instruction designed to help "connect with the world around you by building on the language fundamentals and conversational skills you developed in Levels 1 and 2." In addition to expanding upon grammar learned in Levels 1 and 2, Level 3 teaches more in depth vocabulary, including botanical terms, culinary terms, how to express detailed opinions and judgments, and how to discuss politics, religion, and business. As in the first two levels, each unit contains a ten-minute "Milestone" activity in which the user participates in a simulated conversation.
The four units in Level 3 are Home and Health, Life and World, Everyday Things, and Places and Events.
Level 4 (4 units)[edit]
The four units are Tourism and Recreation, Professions and Hobbies, At Home and Around Town, and Style and Personal Wellness.
Level 5 (4 units)[edit]
The four units are Business and Industry, Arts and Academics, Emergency Situations, and Family and Community.
Levels 4 and 5 teach more complex sentence structures, higher verbal tenses, and more irregular verbs, and introduce more vocabulary.
Audio Companion[edit]
On 9 June 2008, Rosetta Stone introduced an addition to its Version 3 product line: Audio Companion, supplemental audio recordings of words and phrases. The student is meant to repeat the spoken words and phrases for practice and memorization.[9] Unlike recordings based on the Pimsleur method, the Audio Companion provides neither narration nor translations. Rosetta Stone distributes the audio supplements on audio CD and as MP3 files. Each Audio Companion supplements one level of the language course, and each disc supplements a specific unit. Complete Version 4 course packages include Audio Companion material for each level.
Endangered Language Program[edit]
The Endangered Language Program was created in 2004 for use by endangered language communities engaged in language revitalization.[10]
Organizations that contract the Endangered Language Program to develop custom software own the sales and distribution rights over their final product, allowing communities control over this language resource and respecting indigenous intellectual property rights.[11] These versions are thus not marketed via the usual outlets such as bookstores or commercial websites.
Based in Harrisonburg, Virginia, the Endangered Language Program began offering a corporate grant program in 2007 to underwrite development costs for awarded communities.[12] Rosetta Stone Inc. offered the first awards of the grant program to the Chitimacha Tribe of Louisiana[13] and the Navajo Language Renaissance coalition.[14]
The Endangered Language Program also offers paid internships to graduate and undergraduate students interested in contributing to the work of the program.[15]

In November 2015 the Chickasaw Nation, through the Chickasaw Language Revitalization Program established in 2007, contracted with Rosetta Stone to customize language learning content to preserve and introduce the Chickasaw language to its 60,000+ members worldwide.[16][17] This effort comes as the Chickasaw Nation has approximately 50 native speakers remaining, with its last monolingual speaker having died in 2013.[18]
Reception and efficacy[edit]
Critiques from language experts[edit]
Frequent criticism of the program arises in its lack of sensitivity to the differences between the various languages it comes in and their respective cultures.[19] Early versions of the software presented the same concepts in the same order, using the same images taken mostly in the Washington, D.C. area near the company's headquarters at the time in Harrisonburg, Virginia. In the most recent version, there have been some modifications to the picture set for certain languages or regions.
Another frequent issue was the use of more formal vocabulary than that regularly used by native speakers. In 2006, Macworld reviewer Cyrus Farivar noted that his Persian CD used khodrow for "car", although most native speakers use a French loanword, ma:sheen. The same course did not teach words that would be important to someone learning Persian, such as "bread" and "tea"; however, it very curiously included the word "elephant" in a basic vocabulary lesson. Perplexed by the question of why the word "elephant" would be taught in a language where it might never be used (there are not many elephants in Iran), Farivar called Rosetta Stone, Inc. He was told that the company makes four different picture sets: one for Western languages, another for Asian languages, and two sets unique to each Swahili and Latin. The Persian language CD was using the Western picture set, which explains why the images were not culturally relevant.[20]
Donald McRae on the German course[edit]
Writing in 1997, Donald McRae of Brock University said that Rosetta Stone represented "good pedagogy" and that "the authors of the program never lose sight of solid teaching methodology". He described the Version 2 German language course as "very good", but indicated that he had "some reservations".[further explanation needed][21]
Mark Kaiser on the Russian course[edit]
In a 1997 review of the Version 2 Russian language course, Mark Kaiser, director of the Language Media Center at the University of California, Berkeley, called the program "woefully inadequate for a number of reasons".[22]
One of Kaiser's observations was that Rosetta Stone software fails to provide a relevant cultural context. Because the company uses the same stock photographs for all its language courses, they depict people, activities, and manufactured goods that are conspicuously American. Kaiser also found that Rosetta Stone Version 2 does not provide a way for students to evaluate their conversation skills, and that some of the words and phrases are too English-based.
"The entire package lacks any pedagogical foundation," he concluded. "Rather, it utilizes the glitz of the multimedia capabilities of the computer, a dearth of quality foreign language software, and clever marketing to create an economically successful product."[22][dead link]
Brendan Lewis, a world traveler, made similar observations in his critique nearly 14 years later.[23]
Stephen Krashen's Review[edit]
The language-learning specialist Stephen Krashen found that the few studies on the software produced learning results that were "about as effective as traditional instruction on traditional tests."[24]
End User License Agreement[edit]
The user purchases a licence to use the software, which is non-transferable. Up to five members of a household may use a single licence.[25]

Institutional use[edit]
United States Army[edit]
In December 2007, the United States Army offered a special military version of Arabic to help troops deploying to the Middle East learn the language for conversations and phrases important in a military situation.[38] It was available to all US Army personnel, US Military Academy cadets, contracted US Army ROTC Cadets and other special guests with a sponsor.
The United States Army "E-Learning", a SkillPort product, offered the full Version 3 Online, with the exception of only a few languages. The Army E-Learning web site was accessible by most Army members with a valid AKO (Army Knowledge Online) e-mail address or CAC (Common Access Card).[39]
Rosetta Stone's Army contract ended on September 24, 2011.[40]
Other branches of the U.S military also offered Rosetta Stone software. The United States Air Force also offers a similar version to company-grade officers.[41] The United States Marine Corps also offers an online version of all the languages that Rosetta Stone offers through their MarineNet Distance Learning portal.[42]
The U.S. Department of State uses Rosetta Stone (Version 3 as of 2009) as a companion to their in-class and distance learning language programs provided through the Foreign Service Institute. It is free for civil and foreign service employees.[citation needed]
James Madison University[edit]
In April 2011, James Madison University was the first university to partner with Rosetta Stone to offer the Rosetta Stone Version 4 TOTALe as an accredited Conversational Spanish I language learning course. The program teaches Spanish through a series of images that, when clicked on, show the vocabulary word. The student will speak into a microphone and speech recognition software will correct mispronounced words, according to Reilly Brennan, Rosetta Stone's Director of Public Relations. The course is available to adults who want to complete a degree for teaching and non-degree seeking students are eligible to take the class. The Rosetta Stone TOTALe accredited offering is a 16-week, intensive language-learning program. The program is accessed completely online and follows a syllabus approved by Rosetta Stone and James Madison University.[43]

History[edit]
According to the company, founder Allen Stoltzfus learned German through immersion while living in Germany and found it relatively easy. In the 1980s, Stoltzfus began learning Russian in a classroom setting, but found the classroom setting much more difficult. He wanted to simulate the German experience, and he decided to use computer technology to create a similar learning experience. He enlisted the aid of his brother-in-law, John Fairfield, who held a PhD in computer science.
By 1992 CD-ROM technology made the project possible. They formed a company known as Fairfield Language Technologies in Harrisonburg, Virginia. Allen and John hired Eugene Stoltzfus (Allen's brother), Greg Keim and Michael Silverman. They released their software product under the title The Rosetta Stone. In 2003 the company announced the hiring of Tom Adams, a businessman with international experience, as President and CEO.
In 2006 the company changed names to Rosetta Stone, Ltd., and converted from an S corporation to a C corporation. Ownership transferred to investment firms ABS Capital Partners and Northwest Equity Partners. On September 23, 2008, Rosetta Stone Inc. filed an Initial public offering with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
On April 15, 2009, the company was listed as the Rosetta Stone on the New York Stock Exchange. Since 2016, the company's president and CEO has been John Hass.[2] Rosetta Stone is transitioning to a cloud-based business model that goes beyond language learning and deeper into education technology. In 2013, it acquired four companies—Vivity Labs Inc (creators of the Fit Brains Trainer),[3] Livemocha,[4] Tell Me More,[5] and Lexia Learning.[6]
On September 17, 2013, Rosetta Stone announced the launch of a new Kids Division [7] and in November, 2014 it debuted its first kids reading program for consumers, Rosetta Stone Kids Reading.[8]
IPO[edit]
On April 15, 2009, Rosetta Stone raised $112 million in its initial public offering of stock shares.[9] In its first full day of trading on the New York Stock Exchange, the stock gained 39% from its opening price.[10] After a strong opening, however, the stock stumbled amid reports of weaknesses in Rosetta Stone's US business, resulting in the cancellation of a second offering, and a disappointing year end price just 5 cents off its opening price.[11] The stock trades under ticker symbol RST.[9][10] As of December 2015, the stock was at approximately $68.20 (USD) per share.[12]
Offices[edit]

Corporate headquarters are in Arlington, Virginia.
There are also offices in Harrisonburg, Virginia; Boulder, Colorado; Austin, Texas; Seattle, Washington; Boston/Concord, Massachusetts; London, United Kingdom; and Seoul, South Korea.

Endangered language communities[edit]
In 2004, Rosetta Stone Ltd. established its Endangered Language Program to contract with endangered language communities interested in custom software development to support language revitalization efforts.[13]
Support for the Combating Online Infringement and Counterfeits Act[edit]
Rosetta Stone was among a group of companies signed to a letter supporting Combating Online Infringement and Counterfeits Act (COICA), a bill which opponents argue amounts to censorship.[14]

Rosetta Stone Language Learning is proprietary computer-assisted language learning (CALL) software published by Rosetta Stone Inc. The software uses images, text, and sound to teach words and grammar by spaced repetition, without translation. Rosetta Stone calls its approach Dynamic Immersion (a term which has been trademarked).
The software's name and logo allude to the Rosetta Stone, an ancient stone slab on which the Decree of Memphis is inscribed in three writing systems.

Dynamic Immersion[edit]
In a Rosetta Stone Language Learning exercise, the student pairs sound or text to one of several images. The number of images per screen varies.
For example, the software shows the student four photographs. A native speaker makes a statement that describes one of the photographs, and the statement is printed on the screen; the student chooses the photograph that the speaker described. In another variation, the student completes a textual description of a photograph.
In writing exercises, the software provides an on-screen keyboard for the user to type characters that are not in the Latin alphabet.
Grammar lessons cover grammatical tense and grammatical mood. In grammar lessons, the program firstly shows the learner several examples of a grammatical concept, and in some levels the word or words the learner should focus on are highlighted. Then the learner is given a sentence with several options for a word or phrase, and the student chooses the correct option.
If the student has a microphone, the software can attempt to evaluate word pronunciation.
Each lesson concludes with a review of the content in that lesson, and each unit concludes with a milestone, which is a simulated conversation that includes the content of the unit.
Scoring[edit]
The program immediately informs whether the answer is right or wrong. Through the Preferences screen, the student can choose whether a sound is played or not when an answer is clicked. At the bottom of the window, the program shows all the screens for the current lesson. If all answers for that screen are correct, the button for that screen turns green. If some answers are correct, the border of the button turns green, but the screen number itself turns orange. If all answers for a screen are wrong, the button turns orange. This applies to all lessons except review and milestone lessons, which are treated as tests. In those lessons, the buttons for each screen all remain brown. In all lessons there is a button in the bottom-right of the window which can be hovered over to display how many answers are correct, wrong or have not been answered. Each time an answer is clicked, one point is given. At the end of the lesson, the total number of correct, wrong or skipped answers is shown alongside the percentage of correct answers for that lesson. If too many questions were answered incorrectly, the program suggests the learner should retry the lesson.
Software versions[edit]
To use Rosetta Stone Language Learning, a student needs the Rosetta Stone application software and at least one level of a language pack. The latest major version of Rosetta Stone is Rosetta Stone Language Learning 5.0.13.
Language packs also have version numbers. The version number of the language pack is distinct from the version numbering scheme of the Rosetta Stone application, and a language pack is only compatible with specific versions of the application. Version 4 and 5 are backward compatible with language packs developed for Version 3, but not older ones.[2]
Version 1[edit]
By the end of 1996, Rosetta Stone Version 1 had a selection of nine level-one language courses (Dutch, English, French, German, Italian, Mandarin Chinese, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish) and four level-two courses (English, French, German, Spanish). A CD-ROM product called The Rosetta Stone PowerPac featured introductory versions of seven of the courses.
At this time, Fairfield Language Technologies had already begun development of the Arabic, Esperanto, Hebrew, Indonesian, Japanese, Korean, Swahili, Thai, and Vietnamese courses. Within a few months, the Japanese, Thai, and Vietnamese courses were complete, and development of Latin, Polish, and Welsh courses were underway. The Latin course was the next to be completed, followed by Hebrew. In this fashion, Fairfield introduced new courses to market gradually.
Rosetta Stone Version 1 was developed for Macintosh System 6 and higher, and Windows 3.0 and higher. Later revisions of Version 1 for Macintosh required System 7. The final revision of Version 1 was v1.9.[2]
Version 2[edit]
At Version 2, Fairfield continued to add more language courses, but also marketed more editions of The Rosetta Stone software.
The PowerPac CD-ROM introduced in Version 1 now featured basic lessons in seven languages. One complete level of a language course was now called a Personal Edition of the software.
Because many consumers found The Rosetta Stone to be too expensive, Fairfield started a series of "Explorer" editions. An Explorer CD-ROM was a lower-cost excerpt of a Version 2 course. Each edition of the Rosetta Stone Explorer series (Japanese Explorer, Welsh Explorer, etc.) included three units (22 lessons) from Level 1. The company no longer sells Explorer editions.
Then there was Global Traveler, a CD-ROM and electronic translation dictionary package for people requiring some facility in English, French, Spanish, Italian, or German. The lessons on the CD-ROM teach words and phrases for travelers. The electronic translator was programmed with about 60,000 words and 720 phrases.
Compatibility[edit]
The Rosetta Stone v2.0.x is backward compatible with some of the later language packs for Version 1; specifically languages courses with a version number of 3.0 or 4.0.x.[2]
The Rosetta Stone v2.1 through v2.2.x are only compatible with v6.x language courses. These versions of the language packs and software engine are neither backward compatible nor forward compatible.[2] Language discs developed for The Rosetta Stone v2.0.x are incompatible with these later revisions of the software.
In v2.1.4.1A of The Rosetta Stone, the program began using copy protection software called SafeDisc.
Version 3[edit]
Rosetta Stone Version 3 is not backward compatible with language packs developed for Rosetta Stone Versions 1 or 2.[2]
The final revision of Version 3 is v3.4.7.r1.[2][3]
Homeschool Edition[edit]
Homeschool Edition introduces additional features that keep track of time spent per lesson, scores achieved on lessons, lesson plans, and instructional objectives. This edition includes a supplemental CD-ROM that has workbooks, quizzes, lesson transcripts, and exams.
Unlike the Personal Edition, the Homeschool Edition application does not recommend reviews. Aside from the minor differences, the homeschool edition is essentially the same as the personal edition—except for the supplemental CD with written exercises and lesson plans. The language discs in the two editions are identical and are interchangeable. Some may have 3 discs and some may have 5. Much of the information on the supplemental CD-ROM is available online from Rosetta Stone.[4]

Version 4 TOTALe[edit]
Version 4 is backward compatible with all language packs developed for Version 3.[2]
Rosetta Stone released Version 4 TOTALe on September 14, 2010. TOTALe is a software suite comprising Rosetta Course, Rosetta Studio, Rosetta World, and TOTALe Mobile Companion. Users of the Rosetta Studio software subscribe to a service that videoconferences them with a language coach.[5] Rosetta World is a social gaming service. TOTALe Mobile Companion is a Rosetta Stone mobile app for iOS and Android devices.
With Version 4, Rosetta Stone adds stricter copy protection measures.
Rosetta Stone Language Learning 5.0.13[edit]
Rosetta Stone released Version 5 on October 9, 2014. The notable changes are the change in brand name ("Rosetta Course" has become "Language Training"), a new interactive demo is built into the application based on user feedback and a new minimalist UI with no beveled edges or drop shadows.
The software is offered in three variants

Discover Languages[edit]
Rosetta Stone’s Discover Languages is an app currently only available on Xbox One. It is very different from the traditional design, involving a virtual world and more of a focus on games in order to appeal more strongly to game playing audiences. The only language currently supported are English and Spanish.[6]

Language courses[edit]
As of January 2015[update], there are 28[7] Language Training courses offered by Rosetta. This count places it in the top half of language publishers by number of languages taught.[8] Each language course requires its own language pack which is offered in CD-ROMs or download. The online subscription doesn't require any language packs.

Language Course organization[edit]
The language courses are divided into three to five levels offered as language packs either in CD-ROMs or Download. In the retail software packages of Rosetta Stone, each CD-ROM has one level.
All languages, except Latin, use mostly the same set of words and sentences in almost the same order, with mainly the same images. Some of the material is reused from lesson to lesson to invoke long-term retention.
In version 3 pack, there are four units per language level. Each unit has four core lessons that are about 30 minutes long. The student then moves on to one of the following lesson modes: Pronunciation, Writing, Vocabulary, Grammar, Listening, Reading, Speaking. The Milestone is an exercise at the end of each unit in which students apply what they learned in the unit.
Rosetta Stone v2 Language Pack[edit]
In Rosetta Stone version 2 Language Packs, most lessons have two levels; a few have three.
Level 1 (8 units)[edit]
The first eight units have 84 lessons, plus eight reviews. The lessons reiterate simple vocabulary and grammatical tenses. The lessons conclude with a unit on giving directions.
Units 1–4 have 10 lessons and one review. Units 5–8 have 11 lessons and a review.
Level 2 (11 units)[edit]
The 11 units of Level 2 include a total of 118 lessons. The lessons in the first nine units have a format similar to those in Level 1. The final two units are "Glossary" units devoted to single words pertaining to a particular topic, such as school, nature, or automobiles.
Level 2 units cover more advanced grammar, as well as preparation for common situations, such as banking, shopping, and tourism. Short videos (in QuickTime format) illustrate some verbs.
Units 16 and 17 use single-panel comics from the Saturday Evening Post as a teaching tool.
Level 3[edit]
Level 3 expands on Level 2 with longer videos and written passages.
Rosetta Stone v3 Language Pack[edit]
Rosetta Stone version 3 Language Pack has 3–5 levels. The lessons differ by language. Compared with Version 2, Version 3 lessons focus more on conversation and less on grammar rules.
Level 1 (4 units)[edit]
In level one, each unit has a 30-minute lesson and some activities that are five to fifteen minutes long. Level 1 takes up to 24 hours to complete.
Starting from simple vocabulary such as basic greetings, "boy", "girl", "man", and "woman", moving up through numbers, comparisons, adjectives, nouns, verb conjugation, and telling time. Each unit also contains a ten-minute simulated conversation called a "Milestone".
The units are: Language Basics, Greetings and Introductions, Work and School, and Shopping.
Level 2 (4 units)[edit]
Level 2 offers a total of about twenty-four hours designed to teach the user to "navigate your surroundings as you build on the vocabulary and essential language structure in Level 1." More grammar is covered, including past and future tenses, and imperative forms. Topics such as giving directions, writing letters, workplace terms, apologies, discussing emotions, and criticizing art are also covered. As in Level 1, each unit is followed by a ten-minute "Milestone".
The four units in Level 2 are Travel, Past and Future, Friends and Social Life, and Dining and Vacation.
Level 3 (4 units)[edit]
Level 3 offers instruction designed to help "connect with the world around you by building on the language fundamentals and conversational skills you developed in Levels 1 and 2." In addition to expanding upon grammar learned in Levels 1 and 2, Level 3 teaches more in depth vocabulary, including botanical terms, culinary terms, how to express detailed opinions and judgments, and how to discuss politics, religion, and business. As in the first two levels, each unit contains a ten-minute "Milestone" activity in which the user participates in a simulated conversation.
The four units in Level 3 are Home and Health, Life and World, Everyday Things, and Places and Events.
Level 4 (4 units)[edit]
The four units are Tourism and Recreation, Professions and Hobbies, At Home and Around Town, and Style and Personal Wellness.
Level 5 (4 units)[edit]
The four units are Business and Industry, Arts and Academics, Emergency Situations, and Family and Community.
Levels 4 and 5 teach more complex sentence structures, higher verbal tenses, and more irregular verbs, and introduce more vocabulary.
Audio Companion[edit]
On 9 June 2008, Rosetta Stone introduced an addition to its Version 3 product line: Audio Companion, supplemental audio recordings of words and phrases. The student is meant to repeat the spoken words and phrases for practice and memorization.[9] Unlike recordings based on the Pimsleur method, the Audio Companion provides neither narration nor translations. Rosetta Stone distributes the audio supplements on audio CD and as MP3 files. Each Audio Companion supplements one level of the language course, and each disc supplements a specific unit. Complete Version 4 course packages include Audio Companion material for each level.
Endangered Language Program[edit]
The Endangered Language Program was created in 2004 for use by endangered language communities engaged in language revitalization.[10]
Organizations that contract the Endangered Language Program to develop custom software own the sales and distribution rights over their final product, allowing communities control over this language resource and respecting indigenous intellectual property rights.[11] These versions are thus not marketed via the usual outlets such as bookstores or commercial websites.
Based in Harrisonburg, Virginia, the Endangered Language Program began offering a corporate grant program in 2007 to underwrite development costs for awarded communities.[12] Rosetta Stone Inc. offered the first awards of the grant program to the Chitimacha Tribe of Louisiana[13] and the Navajo Language Renaissance coalition.[14]
The Endangered Language Program also offers paid internships to graduate and undergraduate students interested in contributing to the work of the program.[15]

In November 2015 the Chickasaw Nation, through the Chickasaw Language Revitalization Program established in 2007, contracted with Rosetta Stone to customize language learning content to preserve and introduce the Chickasaw language to its 60,000+ members worldwide.[16][17] This effort comes as the Chickasaw Nation has approximately 50 native speakers remaining, with its last monolingual speaker having died in 2013.[18]
Reception and efficacy[edit]
Critiques from language experts[edit]
Frequent criticism of the program arises in its lack of sensitivity to the differences between the various languages it comes in and their respective cultures.[19] Early versions of the software presented the same concepts in the same order, using the same images taken mostly in the Washington, D.C. area near the company's headquarters at the time in Harrisonburg, Virginia. In the most recent version, there have been some modifications to the picture set for certain languages or regions.
Another frequent issue was the use of more formal vocabulary than that regularly used by native speakers. In 2006, Macworld reviewer Cyrus Farivar noted that his Persian CD used khodrow for "car", although most native speakers use a French loanword, ma:sheen. The same course did not teach words that would be important to someone learning Persian, such as "bread" and "tea"; however, it very curiously included the word "elephant" in a basic vocabulary lesson. Perplexed by the question of why the word "elephant" would be taught in a language where it might never be used (there are not many elephants in Iran), Farivar called Rosetta Stone, Inc. He was told that the company makes four different picture sets: one for Western languages, another for Asian languages, and two sets unique to each Swahili and Latin. The Persian language CD was using the Western picture set, which explains why the images were not culturally relevant.[20]
Donald McRae on the German course[edit]
Writing in 1997, Donald McRae of Brock University said that Rosetta Stone represented "good pedagogy" and that "the authors of the program never lose sight of solid teaching methodology". He described the Version 2 German language course as "very good", but indicated that he had "some reservations".[further explanation needed][21]
Mark Kaiser on the Russian course[edit]
In a 1997 review of the Version 2 Russian language course, Mark Kaiser, director of the Language Media Center at the University of California, Berkeley, called the program "woefully inadequate for a number of reasons".[22]
One of Kaiser's observations was that Rosetta Stone software fails to provide a relevant cultural context. Because the company uses the same stock photographs for all its language courses, they depict people, activities, and manufactured goods that are conspicuously American. Kaiser also found that Rosetta Stone Version 2 does not provide a way for students to evaluate their conversation skills, and that some of the words and phrases are too English-based.
"The entire package lacks any pedagogical foundation," he concluded. "Rather, it utilizes the glitz of the multimedia capabilities of the computer, a dearth of quality foreign language software, and clever marketing to create an economically successful product."[22][dead link]
Brendan Lewis, a world traveler, made similar observations in his critique nearly 14 years later.[23]
Stephen Krashen's Review[edit]
The language-learning specialist Stephen Krashen found that the few studies on the software produced learning results that were "about as effective as traditional instruction on traditional tests."[24]
End User License Agreement[edit]
The user purchases a licence to use the software, which is non-transferable. Up to five members of a household may use a single licence.[25]

Institutional use[edit]
United States Army[edit]
In December 2007, the United States Army offered a special military version of Arabic to help troops deploying to the Middle East learn the language for conversations and phrases important in a military situation.[38] It was available to all US Army personnel, US Military Academy cadets, contracted US Army ROTC Cadets and other special guests with a sponsor.
The United States Army "E-Learning", a SkillPort product, offered the full Version 3 Online, with the exception of only a few languages. The Army E-Learning web site was accessible by most Army members with a valid AKO (Army Knowledge Online) e-mail address or CAC (Common Access Card).[39]
Rosetta Stone's Army contract ended on September 24, 2011.[40]
Other branches of the U.S military also offered Rosetta Stone software. The United States Air Force also offers a similar version to company-grade officers.[41] The United States Marine Corps also offers an online version of all the languages that Rosetta Stone offers through their MarineNet Distance Learning portal.[42]
The U.S. Department of State uses Rosetta Stone (Version 3 as of 2009) as a companion to their in-class and distance learning language programs provided through the Foreign Service Institute. It is free for civil and foreign service employees.[citation needed]
James Madison University[edit]
In April 2011, James Madison University was the first university to partner with Rosetta Stone to offer the Rosetta Stone Version 4 TOTALe as an accredited Conversational Spanish I language learning course. The program teaches Spanish through a series of images that, when clicked on, show the vocabulary word. The student will speak into a microphone and speech recognition software will correct mispronounced words, according to Reilly Brennan, Rosetta Stone's Director of Public Relations. The course is available to adults who want to complete a degree for teaching and non-degree seeking students are eligible to take the class. The Rosetta Stone TOTALe accredited offering is a 16-week, intensive language-learning program. The program is accessed completely online and follows a syllabus approved by Rosetta Stone and James Madison University.[43]

History[edit]
According to the company, founder Allen Stoltzfus learned German through immersion while living in Germany and found it relatively easy. In the 1980s, Stoltzfus began learning Russian in a classroom setting, but found the classroom setting much more difficult. He wanted to simulate the German experience, and he decided to use computer technology to create a similar learning experience. He enlisted the aid of his brother-in-law, John Fairfield, who held a PhD in computer science.
By 1992 CD-ROM technology made the project possible. They formed a company known as Fairfield Language Technologies in Harrisonburg, Virginia. Allen and John hired Eugene Stoltzfus (Allen's brother), Greg Keim and Michael Silverman. They released their software product under the title The Rosetta Stone. In 2003 the company announced the hiring of Tom Adams, a businessman with international experience, as President and CEO.
In 2006 the company changed names to Rosetta Stone, Ltd., and converted from an S corporation to a C corporation. Ownership transferred to investment firms ABS Capital Partners and Northwest Equity Partners. On September 23, 2008, Rosetta Stone Inc. filed an Initial public offering with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
On April 15, 2009, the company was listed as the Rosetta Stone on the New York Stock Exchange. Since 2016, the company's president and CEO has been John Hass.[2] Rosetta Stone is transitioning to a cloud-based business model that goes beyond language learning and deeper into education technology. In 2013, it acquired four companies—Vivity Labs Inc (creators of the Fit Brains Trainer),[3] Livemocha,[4] Tell Me More,[5] and Lexia Learning.[6]
On September 17, 2013, Rosetta Stone announced the launch of a new Kids Division [7] and in November, 2014 it debuted its first kids reading program for consumers, Rosetta Stone Kids Reading.[8]
IPO[edit]
On April 15, 2009, Rosetta Stone raised $112 million in its initial public offering of stock shares.[9] In its first full day of trading on the New York Stock Exchange, the stock gained 39% from its opening price.[10] After a strong opening, however, the stock stumbled amid reports of weaknesses in Rosetta Stone's US business, resulting in the cancellation of a second offering, and a disappointing year end price just 5 cents off its opening price.[11] The stock trades under ticker symbol RST.[9][10] As of December 2015, the stock was at approximately $68.20 (USD) per share.[12]
Offices[edit]

Corporate headquarters are in Arlington, Virginia.
There are also offices in Harrisonburg, Virginia; Boulder, Colorado; Austin, Texas; Seattle, Washington; Boston/Concord, Massachusetts; London, United Kingdom; and Seoul, South Korea.

Endangered language communities[edit]
In 2004, Rosetta Stone Ltd. established its Endangered Language Program to contract with endangered language communities interested in custom software development to support language revitalization efforts.[13]
Support for the Combating Online Infringement and Counterfeits Act[edit]
Rosetta Stone was among a group of companies signed to a letter supporting Combating Online Infringement and Counterfeits Act (COICA), a bill which opponents argue amounts to censorship.[14]

Rosetta Stone Language Learning is proprietary computer-assisted language learning (CALL) software published by Rosetta Stone Inc. The software uses images, text, and sound to teach words and grammar by spaced repetition, without translation. Rosetta Stone calls its approach Dynamic Immersion (a term which has been trademarked).
The software's name and logo allude to the Rosetta Stone, an ancient stone slab on which the Decree of Memphis is inscribed in three writing systems.

Dynamic Immersion[edit]
In a Rosetta Stone Language Learning exercise, the student pairs sound or text to one of several images. The number of images per screen varies.
For example, the software shows the student four photographs. A native speaker makes a statement that describes one of the photographs, and the statement is printed on the screen; the student chooses the photograph that the speaker described. In another variation, the student completes a textual description of a photograph.
In writing exercises, the software provides an on-screen keyboard for the user to type characters that are not in the Latin alphabet.
Grammar lessons cover grammatical tense and grammatical mood. In grammar lessons, the program firstly shows the learner several examples of a grammatical concept, and in some levels the word or words the learner should focus on are highlighted. Then the learner is given a sentence with several options for a word or phrase, and the student chooses the correct option.
If the student has a microphone, the software can attempt to evaluate word pronunciation.
Each lesson concludes with a review of the content in that lesson, and each unit concludes with a milestone, which is a simulated conversation that includes the content of the unit.
Scoring[edit]
The program immediately informs whether the answer is right or wrong. Through the Preferences screen, the student can choose whether a sound is played or not when an answer is clicked. At the bottom of the window, the program shows all the screens for the current lesson. If all answers for that screen are correct, the button for that screen turns green. If some answers are correct, the border of the button turns green, but the screen number itself turns orange. If all answers for a screen are wrong, the button turns orange. This applies to all lessons except review and milestone lessons, which are treated as tests. In those lessons, the buttons for each screen all remain brown. In all lessons there is a button in the bottom-right of the window which can be hovered over to display how many answers are correct, wrong or have not been answered. Each time an answer is clicked, one point is given. At the end of the lesson, the total number of correct, wrong or skipped answers is shown alongside the percentage of correct answers for that lesson. If too many questions were answered incorrectly, the program suggests the learner should retry the lesson.
Software versions[edit]
To use Rosetta Stone Language Learning, a student needs the Rosetta Stone application software and at least one level of a language pack. The latest major version of Rosetta Stone is Rosetta Stone Language Learning 5.0.13.
Language packs also have version numbers. The version number of the language pack is distinct from the version numbering scheme of the Rosetta Stone application, and a language pack is only compatible with specific versions of the application. Version 4 and 5 are backward compatible with language packs developed for Version 3, but not older ones.[2]
Version 1[edit]
By the end of 1996, Rosetta Stone Version 1 had a selection of nine level-one language courses (Dutch, English, French, German, Italian, Mandarin Chinese, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish) and four level-two courses (English, French, German, Spanish). A CD-ROM product called The Rosetta Stone PowerPac featured introductory versions of seven of the courses.
At this time, Fairfield Language Technologies had already begun development of the Arabic, Esperanto, Hebrew, Indonesian, Japanese, Korean, Swahili, Thai, and Vietnamese courses. Within a few months, the Japanese, Thai, and Vietnamese courses were complete, and development of Latin, Polish, and Welsh courses were underway. The Latin course was the next to be completed, followed by Hebrew. In this fashion, Fairfield introduced new courses to market gradually.
Rosetta Stone Version 1 was developed for Macintosh System 6 and higher, and Windows 3.0 and higher. Later revisions of Version 1 for Macintosh required System 7. The final revision of Version 1 was v1.9.[2]
Version 2[edit]
At Version 2, Fairfield continued to add more language courses, but also marketed more editions of The Rosetta Stone software.
The PowerPac CD-ROM introduced in Version 1 now featured basic lessons in seven languages. One complete level of a language course was now called a Personal Edition of the software.
Because many consumers found The Rosetta Stone to be too expensive, Fairfield started a series of "Explorer" editions. An Explorer CD-ROM was a lower-cost excerpt of a Version 2 course. Each edition of the Rosetta Stone Explorer series (Japanese Explorer, Welsh Explorer, etc.) included three units (22 lessons) from Level 1. The company no longer sells Explorer editions.
Then there was Global Traveler, a CD-ROM and electronic translation dictionary package for people requiring some facility in English, French, Spanish, Italian, or German. The lessons on the CD-ROM teach words and phrases for travelers. The electronic translator was programmed with about 60,000 words and 720 phrases.
Compatibility[edit]
The Rosetta Stone v2.0.x is backward compatible with some of the later language packs for Version 1; specifically languages courses with a version number of 3.0 or 4.0.x.[2]
The Rosetta Stone v2.1 through v2.2.x are only compatible with v6.x language courses. These versions of the language packs and software engine are neither backward compatible nor forward compatible.[2] Language discs developed for The Rosetta Stone v2.0.x are incompatible with these later revisions of the software.
In v2.1.4.1A of The Rosetta Stone, the program began using copy protection software called SafeDisc.
Version 3[edit]
Rosetta Stone Version 3 is not backward compatible with language packs developed for Rosetta Stone Versions 1 or 2.[2]
The final revision of Version 3 is v3.4.7.r1.[2][3]
Homeschool Edition[edit]
Homeschool Edition introduces additional features that keep track of time spent per lesson, scores achieved on lessons, lesson plans, and instructional objectives. This edition includes a supplemental CD-ROM that has workbooks, quizzes, lesson transcripts, and exams.
Unlike the Personal Edition, the Homeschool Edition application does not recommend reviews. Aside from the minor differences, the homeschool edition is essentially the same as the personal edition—except for the supplemental CD with written exercises and lesson plans. The language discs in the two editions are identical and are interchangeable. Some may have 3 discs and some may have 5. Much of the information on the supplemental CD-ROM is available online from Rosetta Stone.[4]

Version 4 TOTALe[edit]
Version 4 is backward compatible with all language packs developed for Version 3.[2]
Rosetta Stone released Version 4 TOTALe on September 14, 2010. TOTALe is a software suite comprising Rosetta Course, Rosetta Studio, Rosetta World, and TOTALe Mobile Companion. Users of the Rosetta Studio software subscribe to a service that videoconferences them with a language coach.[5] Rosetta World is a social gaming service. TOTALe Mobile Companion is a Rosetta Stone mobile app for iOS and Android devices.
With Version 4, Rosetta Stone adds stricter copy protection measures.
Rosetta Stone Language Learning 5.0.13[edit]
Rosetta Stone released Version 5 on October 9, 2014. The notable changes are the change in brand name ("Rosetta Course" has become "Language Training"), a new interactive demo is built into the application based on user feedback and a new minimalist UI with no beveled edges or drop shadows.
The software is offered in three variants

Discover Languages[edit]
Rosetta Stone’s Discover Languages is an app currently only available on Xbox One. It is very different from the traditional design, involving a virtual world and more of a focus on games in order to appeal more strongly to game playing audiences. The only language currently supported are English and Spanish.[6]

Language courses[edit]
As of January 2015[update], there are 28[7] Language Training courses offered by Rosetta. This count places it in the top half of language publishers by number of languages taught.[8] Each language course requires its own language pack which is offered in CD-ROMs or download. The online subscription doesn't require any language packs.

Language Course organization[edit]
The language courses are divided into three to five levels offered as language packs either in CD-ROMs or Download. In the retail software packages of Rosetta Stone, each CD-ROM has one level.
All languages, except Latin, use mostly the same set of words and sentences in almost the same order, with mainly the same images. Some of the material is reused from lesson to lesson to invoke long-term retention.
In version 3 pack, there are four units per language level. Each unit has four core lessons that are about 30 minutes long. The student then moves on to one of the following lesson modes: Pronunciation, Writing, Vocabulary, Grammar, Listening, Reading, Speaking. The Milestone is an exercise at the end of each unit in which students apply what they learned in the unit.
Rosetta Stone v2 Language Pack[edit]
In Rosetta Stone version 2 Language Packs, most lessons have two levels; a few have three.
Level 1 (8 units)[edit]
The first eight units have 84 lessons, plus eight reviews. The lessons reiterate simple vocabulary and grammatical tenses. The lessons conclude with a unit on giving directions.
Units 1–4 have 10 lessons and one review. Units 5–8 have 11 lessons and a review.
Level 2 (11 units)[edit]
The 11 units of Level 2 include a total of 118 lessons. The lessons in the first nine units have a format similar to those in Level 1. The final two units are "Glossary" units devoted to single words pertaining to a particular topic, such as school, nature, or automobiles.
Level 2 units cover more advanced grammar, as well as preparation for common situations, such as banking, shopping, and tourism. Short videos (in QuickTime format) illustrate some verbs.
Units 16 and 17 use single-panel comics from the Saturday Evening Post as a teaching tool.
Level 3[edit]
Level 3 expands on Level 2 with longer videos and written passages.
Rosetta Stone v3 Language Pack[edit]
Rosetta Stone version 3 Language Pack has 3–5 levels. The lessons differ by language. Compared with Version 2, Version 3 lessons focus more on conversation and less on grammar rules.
Level 1 (4 units)[edit]
In level one, each unit has a 30-minute lesson and some activities that are five to fifteen minutes long. Level 1 takes up to 24 hours to complete.
Starting from simple vocabulary such as basic greetings, "boy", "girl", "man", and "woman", moving up through numbers, comparisons, adjectives, nouns, verb conjugation, and telling time. Each unit also contains a ten-minute simulated conversation called a "Milestone".
The units are: Language Basics, Greetings and Introductions, Work and School, and Shopping.
Level 2 (4 units)[edit]
Level 2 offers a total of about twenty-four hours designed to teach the user to "navigate your surroundings as you build on the vocabulary and essential language structure in Level 1." More grammar is covered, including past and future tenses, and imperative forms. Topics such as giving directions, writing letters, workplace terms, apologies, discussing emotions, and criticizing art are also covered. As in Level 1, each unit is followed by a ten-minute "Milestone".
The four units in Level 2 are Travel, Past and Future, Friends and Social Life, and Dining and Vacation.
Level 3 (4 units)[edit]
Level 3 offers instruction designed to help "connect with the world around you by building on the language fundamentals and conversational skills you developed in Levels 1 and 2." In addition to expanding upon grammar learned in Levels 1 and 2, Level 3 teaches more in depth vocabulary, including botanical terms, culinary terms, how to express detailed opinions and judgments, and how to discuss politics, religion, and business. As in the first two levels, each unit contains a ten-minute "Milestone" activity in which the user participates in a simulated conversation.
The four units in Level 3 are Home and Health, Life and World, Everyday Things, and Places and Events.
Level 4 (4 units)[edit]
The four units are Tourism and Recreation, Professions and Hobbies, At Home and Around Town, and Style and Personal Wellness.
Level 5 (4 units)[edit]
The four units are Business and Industry, Arts and Academics, Emergency Situations, and Family and Community.
Levels 4 and 5 teach more complex sentence structures, higher verbal tenses, and more irregular verbs, and introduce more vocabulary.
Audio Companion[edit]
On 9 June 2008, Rosetta Stone introduced an addition to its Version 3 product line: Audio Companion, supplemental audio recordings of words and phrases. The student is meant to repeat the spoken words and phrases for practice and memorization.[9] Unlike recordings based on the Pimsleur method, the Audio Companion provides neither narration nor translations. Rosetta Stone distributes the audio supplements on audio CD and as MP3 files. Each Audio Companion supplements one level of the language course, and each disc supplements a specific unit. Complete Version 4 course packages include Audio Companion material for each level.
Endangered Language Program[edit]
The Endangered Language Program was created in 2004 for use by endangered language communities engaged in language revitalization.[10]
Organizations that contract the Endangered Language Program to develop custom software own the sales and distribution rights over their final product, allowing communities control over this language resource and respecting indigenous intellectual property rights.[11] These versions are thus not marketed via the usual outlets such as bookstores or commercial websites.
Based in Harrisonburg, Virginia, the Endangered Language Program began offering a corporate grant program in 2007 to underwrite development costs for awarded communities.[12] Rosetta Stone Inc. offered the first awards of the grant program to the Chitimacha Tribe of Louisiana[13] and the Navajo Language Renaissance coalition.[14]
The Endangered Language Program also offers paid internships to graduate and undergraduate students interested in contributing to the work of the program.[15]

In November 2015 the Chickasaw Nation, through the Chickasaw Language Revitalization Program established in 2007, contracted with Rosetta Stone to customize language learning content to preserve and introduce the Chickasaw language to its 60,000+ members worldwide.[16][17] This effort comes as the Chickasaw Nation has approximately 50 native speakers remaining, with its last monolingual speaker having died in 2013.[18]
Reception and efficacy[edit]
Critiques from language experts[edit]
Frequent criticism of the program arises in its lack of sensitivity to the differences between the various languages it comes in and their respective cultures.[19] Early versions of the software presented the same concepts in the same order, using the same images taken mostly in the Washington, D.C. area near the company's headquarters at the time in Harrisonburg, Virginia. In the most recent version, there have been some modifications to the picture set for certain languages or regions.
Another frequent issue was the use of more formal vocabulary than that regularly used by native speakers. In 2006, Macworld reviewer Cyrus Farivar noted that his Persian CD used khodrow for "car", although most native speakers use a French loanword, ma:sheen. The same course did not teach words that would be important to someone learning Persian, such as "bread" and "tea"; however, it very curiously included the word "elephant" in a basic vocabulary lesson. Perplexed by the question of why the word "elephant" would be taught in a language where it might never be used (there are not many elephants in Iran), Farivar called Rosetta Stone, Inc. He was told that the company makes four different picture sets: one for Western languages, another for Asian languages, and two sets unique to each Swahili and Latin. The Persian language CD was using the Western picture set, which explains why the images were not culturally relevant.[20]
Donald McRae on the German course[edit]
Writing in 1997, Donald McRae of Brock University said that Rosetta Stone represented "good pedagogy" and that "the authors of the program never lose sight of solid teaching methodology". He described the Version 2 German language course as "very good", but indicated that he had "some reservations".[further explanation needed][21]
Mark Kaiser on the Russian course[edit]
In a 1997 review of the Version 2 Russian language course, Mark Kaiser, director of the Language Media Center at the University of California, Berkeley, called the program "woefully inadequate for a number of reasons".[22]
One of Kaiser's observations was that Rosetta Stone software fails to provide a relevant cultural context. Because the company uses the same stock photographs for all its language courses, they depict people, activities, and manufactured goods that are conspicuously American. Kaiser also found that Rosetta Stone Version 2 does not provide a way for students to evaluate their conversation skills, and that some of the words and phrases are too English-based.
"The entire package lacks any pedagogical foundation," he concluded. "Rather, it utilizes the glitz of the multimedia capabilities of the computer, a dearth of quality foreign language software, and clever marketing to create an economically successful product."[22][dead link]
Brendan Lewis, a world traveler, made similar observations in his critique nearly 14 years later.[23]
Stephen Krashen's Review[edit]
The language-learning specialist Stephen Krashen found that the few studies on the software produced learning results that were "about as effective as traditional instruction on traditional tests."[24]
End User License Agreement[edit]
The user purchases a licence to use the software, which is non-transferable. Up to five members of a household may use a single licence.[25]

Institutional use[edit]
United States Army[edit]
In December 2007, the United States Army offered a special military version of Arabic to help troops deploying to the Middle East learn the language for conversations and phrases important in a military situation.[38] It was available to all US Army personnel, US Military Academy cadets, contracted US Army ROTC Cadets and other special guests with a sponsor.
The United States Army "E-Learning", a SkillPort product, offered the full Version 3 Online, with the exception of only a few languages. The Army E-Learning web site was accessible by most Army members with a valid AKO (Army Knowledge Online) e-mail address or CAC (Common Access Card).[39]
Rosetta Stone's Army contract ended on September 24, 2011.[40]
Other branches of the U.S military also offered Rosetta Stone software. The United States Air Force also offers a similar version to company-grade officers.[41] The United States Marine Corps also offers an online version of all the languages that Rosetta Stone offers through their MarineNet Distance Learning portal.[42]
The U.S. Department of State uses Rosetta Stone (Version 3 as of 2009) as a companion to their in-class and distance learning language programs provided through the Foreign Service Institute. It is free for civil and foreign service employees.[citation needed]
James Madison University[edit]
In April 2011, James Madison University was the first university to partner with Rosetta Stone to offer the Rosetta Stone Version 4 TOTALe as an accredited Conversational Spanish I language learning course. The program teaches Spanish through a series of images that, when clicked on, show the vocabulary word. The student will speak into a microphone and speech recognition software will correct mispronounced words, according to Reilly Brennan, Rosetta Stone's Director of Public Relations. The course is available to adults who want to complete a degree for teaching and non-degree seeking students are eligible to take the class. The Rosetta Stone TOTALe accredited offering is a 16-week, intensive language-learning program. The program is accessed completely online and follows a syllabus approved by Rosetta Stone and James Madison University.[43]

History[edit]
According to the company, founder Allen Stoltzfus learned German through immersion while living in Germany and found it relatively easy. In the 1980s, Stoltzfus began learning Russian in a classroom setting, but found the classroom setting much more difficult. He wanted to simulate the German experience, and he decided to use computer technology to create a similar learning experience. He enlisted the aid of his brother-in-law, John Fairfield, who held a PhD in computer science.
By 1992 CD-ROM technology made the project possible. They formed a company known as Fairfield Language Technologies in Harrisonburg, Virginia. Allen and John hired Eugene Stoltzfus (Allen's brother), Greg Keim and Michael Silverman. They released their software product under the title The Rosetta Stone. In 2003 the company announced the hiring of Tom Adams, a businessman with international experience, as President and CEO.
In 2006 the company changed names to Rosetta Stone, Ltd., and converted from an S corporation to a C corporation. Ownership transferred to investment firms ABS Capital Partners and Northwest Equity Partners. On September 23, 2008, Rosetta Stone Inc. filed an Initial public offering with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
On April 15, 2009, the company was listed as the Rosetta Stone on the New York Stock Exchange. Since 2016, the company's president and CEO has been John Hass.[2] Rosetta Stone is transitioning to a cloud-based business model that goes beyond language learning and deeper into education technology. In 2013, it acquired four companies—Vivity Labs Inc (creators of the Fit Brains Trainer),[3] Livemocha,[4] Tell Me More,[5] and Lexia Learning.[6]
On September 17, 2013, Rosetta Stone announced the launch of a new Kids Division [7] and in November, 2014 it debuted its first kids reading program for consumers, Rosetta Stone Kids Reading.[8]
IPO[edit]
On April 15, 2009, Rosetta Stone raised $112 million in its initial public offering of stock shares.[9] In its first full day of trading on the New York Stock Exchange, the stock gained 39% from its opening price.[10] After a strong opening, however, the stock stumbled amid reports of weaknesses in Rosetta Stone's US business, resulting in the cancellation of a second offering, and a disappointing year end price just 5 cents off its opening price.[11] The stock trades under ticker symbol RST.[9][10] As of December 2015, the stock was at approximately $68.20 (USD) per share.[12]
Offices[edit]

Corporate headquarters are in Arlington, Virginia.
There are also offices in Harrisonburg, Virginia; Boulder, Colorado; Austin, Texas; Seattle, Washington; Boston/Concord, Massachusetts; London, United Kingdom; and Seoul, South Korea.

Endangered language communities[edit]
In 2004, Rosetta Stone Ltd. established its Endangered Language Program to contract with endangered language communities interested in custom software development to support language revitalization efforts.[13]
Support for the Combating Online Infringement and Counterfeits Act[edit]
Rosetta Stone was among a group of companies signed to a letter supporting Combating Online Infringement and Counterfeits Act (COICA), a bill which opponents argue amounts to censorship.[14]

History[edit]
According to the company, founder Allen Stoltzfus learned German through immersion while living in Germany and found it relatively easy. In the 1980s, Stoltzfus began learning Russian in a classroom setting, but found the classroom setting much more difficult. He wanted to simulate the German experience, and he decided to use computer technology to create a similar learning experience. He enlisted the aid of his brother-in-law, John Fairfield, who held a PhD in computer science.
By 1992 CD-ROM technology made the project possible. They formed a company known as Fairfield Language Technologies in Harrisonburg, Virginia. Allen and John hired Eugene Stoltzfus (Allen's brother), Greg Keim and Michael Silverman. They released their software product under the title The Rosetta Stone. In 2003 the company announced the hiring of Tom Adams, a businessman with international experience, as President and CEO.
In 2006 the company changed names to Rosetta Stone, Ltd., and converted from an S corporation to a C corporation. Ownership transferred to investment firms ABS Capital Partners and Northwest Equity Partners. On September 23, 2008, Rosetta Stone Inc. filed an Initial public offering with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
On April 15, 2009, the company was listed as the Rosetta Stone on the New York Stock Exchange. Since 2016, the company's president and CEO has been John Hass.[2] Rosetta Stone is transitioning to a cloud-based business model that goes beyond language learning and deeper into education technology. In 2013, it acquired four companies—Vivity Labs Inc (creators of the Fit Brains Trainer),[3] Livemocha,[4] Tell Me More,[5] and Lexia Learning.[6]
On September 17, 2013, Rosetta Stone announced the launch of a new Kids Division [7] and in November, 2014 it debuted its first kids reading program for consumers, Rosetta Stone Kids Reading.[8]
IPO[edit]
On April 15, 2009, Rosetta Stone raised $112 million in its initial public offering of stock shares.[9] In its first full day of trading on the New York Stock Exchange, the stock gained 39% from its opening price.[10] After a strong opening, however, the stock stumbled amid reports of weaknesses in Rosetta Stone's US business, resulting in the cancellation of a second offering, and a disappointing year end price just 5 cents off its opening price.[11] The stock trades under ticker symbol RST.[9][10] As of December 2015, the stock was at approximately $68.20 (USD) per share.[12]
Offices[edit]

Corporate headquarters are in Arlington, Virginia.
There are also offices in Harrisonburg, Virginia; Boulder, Colorado; Austin, Texas; Seattle, Washington; Boston/Concord, Massachusetts; London, United Kingdom; and Seoul, South Korea.

Endangered language communities[edit]
In 2004, Rosetta Stone Ltd. established its Endangered Language Program to contract with endangered language communities interested in custom software development to support language revitalization efforts.[13]
Support for the Combating Online Infringement and Counterfeits Act[edit]
Rosetta Stone was among a group of companies signed to a letter supporting Combating Online Infringement and Counterfeits Act (COICA), a bill which opponents argue amounts to censorship.[14]

History[edit]
According to the company, founder Allen Stoltzfus learned German through immersion while living in Germany and found it relatively easy. In the 1980s, Stoltzfus began learning Russian in a classroom setting, but found the classroom setting much more difficult. He wanted to simulate the German experience, and he decided to use computer technology to create a similar learning experience. He enlisted the aid of his brother-in-law, John Fairfield, who held a PhD in computer science.
By 1992 CD-ROM technology made the project possible. They formed a company known as Fairfield Language Technologies in Harrisonburg, Virginia. Allen and John hired Eugene Stoltzfus (Allen's brother), Greg Keim and Michael Silverman. They released their software product under the title The Rosetta Stone. In 2003 the company announced the hiring of Tom Adams, a businessman with international experience, as President and CEO.
In 2006 the company changed names to Rosetta Stone, Ltd., and converted from an S corporation to a C corporation. Ownership transferred to investment firms ABS Capital Partners and Northwest Equity Partners. On September 23, 2008, Rosetta Stone Inc. filed an Initial public offering with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
On April 15, 2009, the company was listed as the Rosetta Stone on the New York Stock Exchange. Since 2016, the company's president and CEO has been John Hass.[2] Rosetta Stone is transitioning to a cloud-based business model that goes beyond language learning and deeper into education technology. In 2013, it acquired four companies—Vivity Labs Inc (creators of the Fit Brains Trainer),[3] Livemocha,[4] Tell Me More,[5] and Lexia Learning.[6]
On September 17, 2013, Rosetta Stone announced the launch of a new Kids Division [7] and in November, 2014 it debuted its first kids reading program for consumers, Rosetta Stone Kids Reading.[8]
IPO[edit]
On April 15, 2009, Rosetta Stone raised $112 million in its initial public offering of stock shares.[9] In its first full day of trading on the New York Stock Exchange, the stock gained 39% from its opening price.[10] After a strong opening, however, the stock stumbled amid reports of weaknesses in Rosetta Stone's US business, resulting in the cancellation of a second offering, and a disappointing year end price just 5 cents off its opening price.[11] The stock trades under ticker symbol RST.[9][10] As of December 2015, the stock was at approximately $68.20 (USD) per share.[12]
Offices[edit]

Corporate headquarters are in Arlington, Virginia.
There are also offices in Harrisonburg, Virginia; Boulder, Colorado; Austin, Texas; Seattle, Washington; Boston/Concord, Massachusetts; London, United Kingdom; and Seoul, South Korea.

Endangered language communities[edit]
In 2004, Rosetta Stone Ltd. established its Endangered Language Program to contract with endangered language communities interested in custom software development to support language revitalization efforts.[13]
Support for the Combating Online Infringement and Counterfeits Act[edit]
Rosetta Stone was among a group of companies signed to a letter supporting Combating Online Infringement and Counterfeits Act (COICA), a bill which opponents argue amounts to censorship.[14]

Rosetta Stone Language Learning is proprietary computer-assisted language learning (CALL) software published by Rosetta Stone Inc. The software uses images, text, and sound to teach words and grammar by spaced repetition, without translation. Rosetta Stone calls its approach Dynamic Immersion (a term which has been trademarked).
The software's name and logo allude to the Rosetta Stone, an ancient stone slab on which the Decree of Memphis is inscribed in three writing systems.

Dynamic Immersion[edit]
In a Rosetta Stone Language Learning exercise, the student pairs sound or text to one of several images. The number of images per screen varies.
For example, the software shows the student four photographs. A native speaker makes a statement that describes one of the photographs, and the statement is printed on the screen; the student chooses the photograph that the speaker described. In another variation, the student completes a textual description of a photograph.
In writing exercises, the software provides an on-screen keyboard for the user to type characters that are not in the Latin alphabet.
Grammar lessons cover grammatical tense and grammatical mood. In grammar lessons, the program firstly shows the learner several examples of a grammatical concept, and in some levels the word or words the learner should focus on are highlighted. Then the learner is given a sentence with several options for a word or phrase, and the student chooses the correct option.
If the student has a microphone, the software can attempt to evaluate word pronunciation.
Each lesson concludes with a review of the content in that lesson, and each unit concludes with a milestone, which is a simulated conversation that includes the content of the unit.
Scoring[edit]
The program immediately informs whether the answer is right or wrong. Through the Preferences screen, the student can choose whether a sound is played or not when an answer is clicked. At the bottom of the window, the program shows all the screens for the current lesson. If all answers for that screen are correct, the button for that screen turns green. If some answers are correct, the border of the button turns green, but the screen number itself turns orange. If all answers for a screen are wrong, the button turns orange. This applies to all lessons except review and milestone lessons, which are treated as tests. In those lessons, the buttons for each screen all remain brown. In all lessons there is a button in the bottom-right of the window which can be hovered over to display how many answers are correct, wrong or have not been answered. Each time an answer is clicked, one point is given. At the end of the lesson, the total number of correct, wrong or skipped answers is shown alongside the percentage of correct answers for that lesson. If too many questions were answered incorrectly, the program suggests the learner should retry the lesson.
Software versions[edit]
To use Rosetta Stone Language Learning, a student needs the Rosetta Stone application software and at least one level of a language pack. The latest major version of Rosetta Stone is Rosetta Stone Language Learning 5.0.13.
Language packs also have version numbers. The version number of the language pack is distinct from the version numbering scheme of the Rosetta Stone application, and a language pack is only compatible with specific versions of the application. Version 4 and 5 are backward compatible with language packs developed for Version 3, but not older ones.[2]
Version 1[edit]
By the end of 1996, Rosetta Stone Version 1 had a selection of nine level-one language courses (Dutch, English, French, German, Italian, Mandarin Chinese, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish) and four level-two courses (English, French, German, Spanish). A CD-ROM product called The Rosetta Stone PowerPac featured introductory versions of seven of the courses.
At this time, Fairfield Language Technologies had already begun development of the Arabic, Esperanto, Hebrew, Indonesian, Japanese, Korean, Swahili, Thai, and Vietnamese courses. Within a few months, the Japanese, Thai, and Vietnamese courses were complete, and development of Latin, Polish, and Welsh courses were underway. The Latin course was the next to be completed, followed by Hebrew. In this fashion, Fairfield introduced new courses to market gradually.
Rosetta Stone Version 1 was developed for Macintosh System 6 and higher, and Windows 3.0 and higher. Later revisions of Version 1 for Macintosh required System 7. The final revision of Version 1 was v1.9.[2]
Version 2[edit]
At Version 2, Fairfield continued to add more language courses, but also marketed more editions of The Rosetta Stone software.
The PowerPac CD-ROM introduced in Version 1 now featured basic lessons in seven languages. One complete level of a language course was now called a Personal Edition of the software.
Because many consumers found The Rosetta Stone to be too expensive, Fairfield started a series of "Explorer" editions. An Explorer CD-ROM was a lower-cost excerpt of a Version 2 course. Each edition of the Rosetta Stone Explorer series (Japanese Explorer, Welsh Explorer, etc.) included three units (22 lessons) from Level 1. The company no longer sells Explorer editions.
Then there was Global Traveler, a CD-ROM and electronic translation dictionary package for people requiring some facility in English, French, Spanish, Italian, or German. The lessons on the CD-ROM teach words and phrases for travelers. The electronic translator was programmed with about 60,000 words and 720 phrases.
Compatibility[edit]
The Rosetta Stone v2.0.x is backward compatible with some of the later language packs for Version 1; specifically languages courses with a version number of 3.0 or 4.0.x.[2]
The Rosetta Stone v2.1 through v2.2.x are only compatible with v6.x language courses. These versions of the language packs and software engine are neither backward compatible nor forward compatible.[2] Language discs developed for The Rosetta Stone v2.0.x are incompatible with these later revisions of the software.
In v2.1.4.1A of The Rosetta Stone, the program began using copy protection software called SafeDisc.
Version 3[edit]
Rosetta Stone Version 3 is not backward compatible with language packs developed for Rosetta Stone Versions 1 or 2.[2]
The final revision of Version 3 is v3.4.7.r1.[2][3]
Homeschool Edition[edit]
Homeschool Edition introduces additional features that keep track of time spent per lesson, scores achieved on lessons, lesson plans, and instructional objectives. This edition includes a supplemental CD-ROM that has workbooks, quizzes, lesson transcripts, and exams.
Unlike the Personal Edition, the Homeschool Edition application does not recommend reviews. Aside from the minor differences, the homeschool edition is essentially the same as the personal edition—except for the supplemental CD with written exercises and lesson plans. The language discs in the two editions are identical and are interchangeable. Some may have 3 discs and some may have 5. Much of the information on the supplemental CD-ROM is available online from Rosetta Stone.[4]

Version 4 TOTALe[edit]
Version 4 is backward compatible with all language packs developed for Version 3.[2]
Rosetta Stone released Version 4 TOTALe on September 14, 2010. TOTALe is a software suite comprising Rosetta Course, Rosetta Studio, Rosetta World, and TOTALe Mobile Companion. Users of the Rosetta Studio software subscribe to a service that videoconferences them with a language coach.[5] Rosetta World is a social gaming service. TOTALe Mobile Companion is a Rosetta Stone mobile app for iOS and Android devices.
With Version 4, Rosetta Stone adds stricter copy protection measures.
Rosetta Stone Language Learning 5.0.13[edit]
Rosetta Stone released Version 5 on October 9, 2014. The notable changes are the change in brand name ("Rosetta Course" has become "Language Training"), a new interactive demo is built into the application based on user feedback and a new minimalist UI with no beveled edges or drop shadows.
The software is offered in three variants

Discover Languages[edit]
Rosetta Stone’s Discover Languages is an app currently only available on Xbox One. It is very different from the traditional design, involving a virtual world and more of a focus on games in order to appeal more strongly to game playing audiences. The only language currently supported are English and Spanish.[6]

Language courses[edit]
As of January 2015[update], there are 28[7] Language Training courses offered by Rosetta. This count places it in the top half of language publishers by number of languages taught.[8] Each language course requires its own language pack which is offered in CD-ROMs or download. The online subscription doesn't require any language packs.

Language Course organization[edit]
The language courses are divided into three to five levels offered as language packs either in CD-ROMs or Download. In the retail software packages of Rosetta Stone, each CD-ROM has one level.
All languages, except Latin, use mostly the same set of words and sentences in almost the same order, with mainly the same images. Some of the material is reused from lesson to lesson to invoke long-term retention.
In version 3 pack, there are four units per language level. Each unit has four core lessons that are about 30 minutes long. The student then moves on to one of the following lesson modes: Pronunciation, Writing, Vocabulary, Grammar, Listening, Reading, Speaking. The Milestone is an exercise at the end of each unit in which students apply what they learned in the unit.
Rosetta Stone v2 Language Pack[edit]
In Rosetta Stone version 2 Language Packs, most lessons have two levels; a few have three.
Level 1 (8 units)[edit]
The first eight units have 84 lessons, plus eight reviews. The lessons reiterate simple vocabulary and grammatical tenses. The lessons conclude with a unit on giving directions.
Units 1–4 have 10 lessons and one review. Units 5–8 have 11 lessons and a review.
Level 2 (11 units)[edit]
The 11 units of Level 2 include a total of 118 lessons. The lessons in the first nine units have a format similar to those in Level 1. The final two units are "Glossary" units devoted to single words pertaining to a particular topic, such as school, nature, or automobiles.
Level 2 units cover more advanced grammar, as well as preparation for common situations, such as banking, shopping, and tourism. Short videos (in QuickTime format) illustrate some verbs.
Units 16 and 17 use single-panel comics from the Saturday Evening Post as a teaching tool.
Level 3[edit]
Level 3 expands on Level 2 with longer videos and written passages.
Rosetta Stone v3 Language Pack[edit]
Rosetta Stone version 3 Language Pack has 3–5 levels. The lessons differ by language. Compared with Version 2, Version 3 lessons focus more on conversation and less on grammar rules.
Level 1 (4 units)[edit]
In level one, each unit has a 30-minute lesson and some activities that are five to fifteen minutes long. Level 1 takes up to 24 hours to complete.
Starting from simple vocabulary such as basic greetings, "boy", "girl", "man", and "woman", moving up through numbers, comparisons, adjectives, nouns, verb conjugation, and telling time. Each unit also contains a ten-minute simulated conversation called a "Milestone".
The units are: Language Basics, Greetings and Introductions, Work and School, and Shopping.
Level 2 (4 units)[edit]
Level 2 offers a total of about twenty-four hours designed to teach the user to "navigate your surroundings as you build on the vocabulary and essential language structure in Level 1." More grammar is covered, including past and future tenses, and imperative forms. Topics such as giving directions, writing letters, workplace terms, apologies, discussing emotions, and criticizing art are also covered. As in Level 1, each unit is followed by a ten-minute "Milestone".
The four units in Level 2 are Travel, Past and Future, Friends and Social Life, and Dining and Vacation.
Level 3 (4 units)[edit]
Level 3 offers instruction designed to help "connect with the world around you by building on the language fundamentals and conversational skills you developed in Levels 1 and 2." In addition to expanding upon grammar learned in Levels 1 and 2, Level 3 teaches more in depth vocabulary, including botanical terms, culinary terms, how to express detailed opinions and judgments, and how to discuss politics, religion, and business. As in the first two levels, each unit contains a ten-minute "Milestone" activity in which the user participates in a simulated conversation.
The four units in Level 3 are Home and Health, Life and World, Everyday Things, and Places and Events.
Level 4 (4 units)[edit]
The four units are Tourism and Recreation, Professions and Hobbies, At Home and Around Town, and Style and Personal Wellness.
Level 5 (4 units)[edit]
The four units are Business and Industry, Arts and Academics, Emergency Situations, and Family and Community.
Levels 4 and 5 teach more complex sentence structures, higher verbal tenses, and more irregular verbs, and introduce more vocabulary.
Audio Companion[edit]
On 9 June 2008, Rosetta Stone introduced an addition to its Version 3 product line: Audio Companion, supplemental audio recordings of words and phrases. The student is meant to repeat the spoken words and phrases for practice and memorization.[9] Unlike recordings based on the Pimsleur method, the Audio Companion provides neither narration nor translations. Rosetta Stone distributes the audio supplements on audio CD and as MP3 files. Each Audio Companion supplements one level of the language course, and each disc supplements a specific unit. Complete Version 4 course packages include Audio Companion material for each level.
Endangered Language Program[edit]
The Endangered Language Program was created in 2004 for use by endangered language communities engaged in language revitalization.[10]
Organizations that contract the Endangered Language Program to develop custom software own the sales and distribution rights over their final product, allowing communities control over this language resource and respecting indigenous intellectual property rights.[11] These versions are thus not marketed via the usual outlets such as bookstores or commercial websites.
Based in Harrisonburg, Virginia, the Endangered Language Program began offering a corporate grant program in 2007 to underwrite development costs for awarded communities.[12] Rosetta Stone Inc. offered the first awards of the grant program to the Chitimacha Tribe of Louisiana[13] and the Navajo Language Renaissance coalition.[14]
The Endangered Language Program also offers paid internships to graduate and undergraduate students interested in contributing to the work of the program.[15]

In November 2015 the Chickasaw Nation, through the Chickasaw Language Revitalization Program established in 2007, contracted with Rosetta Stone to customize language learning content to preserve and introduce the Chickasaw language to its 60,000+ members worldwide.[16][17] This effort comes as the Chickasaw Nation has approximately 50 native speakers remaining, with its last monolingual speaker having died in 2013.[18]
Reception and efficacy[edit]
Critiques from language experts[edit]
Frequent criticism of the program arises in its lack of sensitivity to the differences between the various languages it comes in and their respective cultures.[19] Early versions of the software presented the same concepts in the same order, using the same images taken mostly in the Washington, D.C. area near the company's headquarters at the time in Harrisonburg, Virginia. In the most recent version, there have been some modifications to the picture set for certain languages or regions.
Another frequent issue was the use of more formal vocabulary than that regularly used by native speakers. In 2006, Macworld reviewer Cyrus Farivar noted that his Persian CD used khodrow for "car", although most native speakers use a French loanword, ma:sheen. The same course did not teach words that would be important to someone learning Persian, such as "bread" and "tea"; however, it very curiously included the word "elephant" in a basic vocabulary lesson. Perplexed by the question of why the word "elephant" would be taught in a language where it might never be used (there are not many elephants in Iran), Farivar called Rosetta Stone, Inc. He was told that the company makes four different picture sets: one for Western languages, another for Asian languages, and two sets unique to each Swahili and Latin. The Persian language CD was using the Western picture set, which explains why the images were not culturally relevant.[20]
Donald McRae on the German course[edit]
Writing in 1997, Donald McRae of Brock University said that Rosetta Stone represented "good pedagogy" and that "the authors of the program never lose sight of solid teaching methodology". He described the Version 2 German language course as "very good", but indicated that he had "some reservations".[further explanation needed][21]
Mark Kaiser on the Russian course[edit]
In a 1997 review of the Version 2 Russian language course, Mark Kaiser, director of the Language Media Center at the University of California, Berkeley, called the program "woefully inadequate for a number of reasons".[22]
One of Kaiser's observations was that Rosetta Stone software fails to provide a relevant cultural context. Because the company uses the same stock photographs for all its language courses, they depict people, activities, and manufactured goods that are conspicuously American. Kaiser also found that Rosetta Stone Version 2 does not provide a way for students to evaluate their conversation skills, and that some of the words and phrases are too English-based.
"The entire package lacks any pedagogical foundation," he concluded. "Rather, it utilizes the glitz of the multimedia capabilities of the computer, a dearth of quality foreign language software, and clever marketing to create an economically successful product."[22][dead link]
Brendan Lewis, a world traveler, made similar observations in his critique nearly 14 years later.[23]
Stephen Krashen's Review[edit]
The language-learning specialist Stephen Krashen found that the few studies on the software produced learning results that were "about as effective as traditional instruction on traditional tests."[24]
End User License Agreement[edit]
The user purchases a licence to use the software, which is non-transferable. Up to five members of a household may use a single licence.[25]

Institutional use[edit]
United States Army[edit]
In December 2007, the United States Army offered a special military version of Arabic to help troops deploying to the Middle East learn the language for conversations and phrases important in a military situation.[38] It was available to all US Army personnel, US Military Academy cadets, contracted US Army ROTC Cadets and other special guests with a sponsor.
The United States Army "E-Learning", a SkillPort product, offered the full Version 3 Online, with the exception of only a few languages. The Army E-Learning web site was accessible by most Army members with a valid AKO (Army Knowledge Online) e-mail address or CAC (Common Access Card).[39]
Rosetta Stone's Army contract ended on September 24, 2011.[40]
Other branches of the U.S military also offered Rosetta Stone software. The United States Air Force also offers a similar version to company-grade officers.[41] The United States Marine Corps also offers an online version of all the languages that Rosetta Stone offers through their MarineNet Distance Learning portal.[42]
The U.S. Department of State uses Rosetta Stone (Version 3 as of 2009) as a companion to their in-class and distance learning language programs provided through the Foreign Service Institute. It is free for civil and foreign service employees.[citation needed]
James Madison University[edit]
In April 2011, James Madison University was the first university to partner with Rosetta Stone to offer the Rosetta Stone Version 4 TOTALe as an accredited Conversational Spanish I language learning course. The program teaches Spanish through a series of images that, when clicked on, show the vocabulary word. The student will speak into a microphone and speech recognition software will correct mispronounced words, according to Reilly Brennan, Rosetta Stone's Director of Public Relations. The course is available to adults who want to complete a degree for teaching and non-degree seeking students are eligible to take the class. The Rosetta Stone TOTALe accredited offering is a 16-week, intensive language-learning program. The program is accessed completely online and follows a syllabus approved by Rosetta Stone and James Madison University.[43]

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
