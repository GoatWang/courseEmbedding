rVue Holdings, Inc. Key Developments

rVue Holdings, Inc. Receives Notice of Default and Demand for Payment from Roche Enterprises
May 10 17
On May 3, 2017, the rVue Holdings, Inc. received a notice of default and demand for payment from Roche Enterprises, (a) stating that the company was in default under the Roche Loans, and (b) demanding payment in full of the Roche Loans, with a total amount due to Roche Enterprises of $460,558.73 as of the date of the default notice, inclusive of accrued interest, attorney's fees and expenses. The default notice further stated that Roche Enterprises intends, if the Company is unable to pay in full its obligations under the Roche Notes, to foreclose upon and sell the company's assets, and to pursue other remedies available to it, under the Uniform Commercial Code and other applicable law.


rVue Holdings, Inc. Files Form 15
Nov 8 16
rVue Holdings, Inc. has announced that it has filed a Form 15 with the Securities and Exchange Commission to voluntarily deregister its common stock under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The par value of the company's common stock was $0.001 per share.


rVue Announces Intention To Voluntarily Deregister As A Reporting Company With SEC
Oct 18 16
rVue Holdings, Inc. announced that the Company intends to voluntarily deregister as a reporting company with the SEC. Over the past several years, rVue has consistently reviewed various ways to both reduce and retain costs as it builds revenue. Over the past several months, the Company has been engaged in a study of the benefits and costs associated with being publicly traded. The decision of the Company's Board of Directors to deregister the Company's common stock was based on the consideration of several factors including the significant cost to the Company of filing periodic reports with the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) and the cost of complying with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in relationship with revenue. Therefore, the Company announced that it plans to voluntarily withdraw its common stock from registration under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), on or about November 9, 2016, thus terminating the Company's status as a public reporting company and suspending its obligation to file periodic reports, including Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K with the SEC. The Company's periodic reporting obligations under the Exchange Act will be suspended prior to November 14, 2016 (the date the Company's quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 would have otherwise been due).

rVue Digital Location Video Gallery

				All Projects 


It’s British Airways!

This clever campaign for British Airways involves digital wizardry, real-time data feeds – and digital signs and billboards in London.
Each time a British Airways plane passes overhead, a child points up and the sign displays its actual flight number and destination.






























 




rVue Standards | rVue




























































rVue Standards



ONE contact, ONE media plan, ONE post-analysis report, ONE invoice.

The Digital Location Video market is comprised of diverse venues and screens adapted to fit their locations – making standardization difficult. Consider the format of a screen designed for a taxicab compared to one for an office lobby. Or the detailed specifications required to fit different gas pumps across the country.
It’s the unique locations and venues that enable us to engage consumers at a precise moment in time. It’s what makes DLV so effective. And it’s also what makes planning, buying and implementing DLV so difficult for advertisers.
For example, across our partner networks there are hundreds of combinations of different media file specifications and encoding choices. Fortunately rVue’s technology platform provides an automated way to convert files to meet all network specifications. There are also differences in pricing, distribution and post analysis reporting. At rVue we work to homogenize and standardize these inconsistencies to streamline the process, to enable smarter strategies, and deliver a global view of media plans and reporting.
rVue is also taking a leading role in working to establish standards and find common ways of operating across the industry. We formed the rVue Network Technology Council as a forum for our partner network technologists to collaborate and work toward building consistencies and standardization, while showcasing their unique capabilities.
