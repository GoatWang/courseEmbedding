His long term experience, intelligence and his ability to interpret the facts and present them in the most straightforward and useful way, is absolutely amazing. I am a citizen of Iran who came to the United States with a dependent visa on my Iranian-Canadian husband. However, upon our arrival he started making my life terribly difficult and finally he went for a divorce and made up stories to get rid of paying me the spousal support. I was so helpless and also unable to work in the US due to visa limitations and I thought that was the end of the world and I was about to leave the US without asking for any rights out of our marriage, leave the graduate program I was attending in USC and go back to Iran.  However, upon a series of consultation sessions with Mr. Rigney that only costed $100 in total, he made me realize that I have been the victim of domestic violence and that's why I was about to give up on all my rights and leave. He advised me to just stay and tell him the story of my life with the abusive husband, and step by step he moved me forward, up to the point that in our first spousal support hearing, I was granted half of the salary of my spouse as the support which happens very rarely in California. Judge Jessop and attorney Jon D Rigney did a great job in giving life and hope back to me, especially Mr. Rigney had also a psychological role to help me see the facts and try to save myself from remaining in a victim's position. I owe a lot to this lawyer. He is defenitely not a cheap lawyer, but he deserves what he gets. HE KNOWS HIS JOB PERFECTLY and he is a very respected person. I highly recommend him to people who have family issues, whether they are American or from any other nationalities like me. He also have a very carying and smart staff and paralegal team who are always there to help you with your legal questions.Men's Legal Centeryourmagazineusa ratedMen's Legal CenterThe name on the door pretty much says it all - Men's Legal Center. They are advocates for family law, advocates for men's rights. The bottom line is, and it is so rarely heard in our society, but the facts show abused men are the hidden side of domestic violence; California State University Professor Martin summarizes some 214 empirical studies and 61 reviews and/or analyses to conclude: "Women are as physically aggressive, or more aggressive, than men in their relationships with their spouses or male partners."We (men) often lose out in a biased society and seemingly unfriendly courts. Yet Father's have rights too. I think most men in general realize this yet remain silent. Come on, how many of us are really going to admit to anybody that our wife smacked us around? We should, but we don't until it is often too late. The Men's Legal Center, however, has been doing something about it since 1985 by providing both legal and non-legal counseling, services, and referrals for men (and women) whom are victims of domestic violence. Legal services run the gamut from prenuptial agreements to divorce and everything in between including paternity tests and legal services, annulment, restraining orders, wills and trusts and alternative dispute resolutions to divorce. Most importantly however they help men assert often trampled rights in child custody, visitation and support. The San Diego chapter of the National Coalition for Men operates out of the same building, and the Center provides a monthly newsletter, with parenting and cooking advice, annual picnics, and extensive unbiased resources for men in need of support. Testimonials are very supportive and the staff is super friendly. Payment terms are reasonable and the attorneys will work with you. The Men's legal center appears to be the real deal, genuinely concerned with your rights.Bloom Allen R Attorney At LawMuchlis W. ratedAstute and Righteous Attorney.    This is  a felony case with IST (incompetent to stand trial) situation.   At the end, we got everything that we wanted, and my wife did not spend any day in custody after the first hearing (this matters the most!).    He kept informed me with his thought process - he responded to my email regardless of time (night / weekend).   Because he is looking out for our interest, he did not settle quickly (he recommended to reject the DA offer for plea bargain).  The entire case lasted 1.5 year.        When i contacted Allen, my wife had been charged with a felony case, and was deemed IST  and was sent to state hospital for up to 3 years.     The worst part is all IST persons have to wait in county jail for months before being transfer to state hospital (jail cannot take care of mentally ill person - I was absolutely devastated - my wife was so sick and by the time she got to the hospital she could not walk).   Allen helped speed her transfer from county jail to the hospital after 7 weeks (see Freddy Mille case).   After 5 months, Allen drove 120 miles to visit my wife and interviewed her with the intent to speed up her release;  and later let the hospital know that she could assist him in her defense.    After the first court hearing, my wife  was pretty much out from custody since then (again, this counted the most!) - i did not have to post another bail during the series of hearing  (my prev attorney screwed up).    In the proceeding, Allen recommended going through the criminal path (by *not* pleading guilty due to insanity / mental illness) - that was a good call.  He told me the strategy for my wife by staying out of trouble, visiting psychiatric and lengthen the hearing.   Looking back, he made all the right call... Thank you Allen.  Law TigersBrett S. ratedI was lane splitting when a car did an abrupt lane change not using her blinker. My bike was totalled and I had to have surgery on my shoulder. I was a nervous wreck not knowing how to handle all this insurance and legal stuff. I saw a bill board for the law tigers. After the initial meeting with one of their representatives I immediately felt a wave a relief that I was going to get the help I needed. I was directed to Nancy T. She helped me step by step and answered any questions I had at any time via email or phone call. She was completely amazing and handled the entire case without me needed to do anything besides fax her bills that kept pouring in from the accident. My main concern was getting as much of the bills cover as possible and guess what I did not have to pay a dime! As we are approaching the end of my case she gave me all the great news and my wife and I are so pleased with Nancy and everything she has done for us. My wife cried and to be honest I almost did to knowing that we can finally put all this behind us. Thank you Nancy, even tho we have never met face to face I love you for helping me through this. My mind is now at peace that all these bills will now dissappear and I can move on. To everyone leaving negative comments. These things take time and you must be patient. They will try to help you the best they can but somethings are out of their hands. You can't expect them to make money appear from thin air. Not everyone insurance policy's are the same. Some people have more or less coverage then others and that can determine how much an insurance company can pay out.Pacific Trial LawyersCarlos B. ratedHave you ever said to yourself, “Wow I need that guy for my lawyer”?             That’s the kind of lawyer Attorney Ray Ryan Jr. is.  I found him on a lawyer review service, AVVO.com.  I had to fire my first lawyer for messing up my personal injury case.  Several past clients gave Ray great reviews and his rating was near perfect.  We spoke about my case during the evening hours, which were convenient for me.  Ray was clear and supportive.  He explained my rights and options in language that was clear to me.  However what genuinely impressed me was his willingness to handle my case according to traditional methods.  I made the choices.  He told me my options, explained how each choice would influence my case, and he executed my choice.  He never made any assumptions or choices for me.  Sometimes we disagreed, but he was always took the time to help me understand how my choices would affect my case.  Most of the time, we compromised.   He was very, very aggressive with the other side.  When they missed a deadline to submit an item for review, they lost their rights to submit it.    Everything turned out super great!  In fact, I had to sign a confidentiality agreement not to talk about the terms of settlement.  Make it easy on yourself.  Hire this guy if you need a lawyer.  There is a strong chance you will be very happy with your outcome and you will learn a lot about what a great lawyer should be.Law Offices of Mark Deniz APLCJacob M. ratedSo My girlfriend and I moved to California from Ohio a few months ago. We are in our early 20s and have No family or fallback within 2,000 miles. One night we had gotten into a little arguement in the case where my girlfriend hit me in the head and the cops were called. She was arrested and facing a Felony. Even though I had only intended to scare her with the police.. they moved forward with charges.Long story short, We thought our adventure was over. We figured we would owe so much in lawyer fees, courth fees, bail bonds and more that we would simply lose our place and have to go back to Ohio. It was a dark time for us. I had googled for a Lawyer in my area the next day. It was Saturday evening and the first 10 didnt answer. Luckily, Mark was only 2 rings away. I explained the situation and we met the next day.Within a week, Everything was dropped! No Court, No Anything... just Vanished! We hoped maybe he could get the charge dropped to a lesser charge.. but did not expect to walk scott free!!!My girlfriend nearly cried as he gave us the good news right before we were going to walk into court.One other thing we are most pleased about is how cool he was with the Lawyer fees. He worked on a payment plan that fit us and let me tell you... lawyers can be expensive. He had every right to charge double for the magic he pulled. 100000 Stars.Give him a try if you want a little peace of mind!!!Law Offices of Shana J. Blackambrose806 ratedShana is an intelligent attorney who cares about the needs of families, and is fair and extremely knowledgeable on Family Law. During her representation of my case Shana was "realistic" about my case. She was confident and considerate about what my expectations where regarding custody of my daughter. The real success came after Shana won my case, and the relationship between my daughter & her father was restored despite my fears that he would treat her differently because of the results. In fact it strengthened because of the clear boundaries that were put in place during the hearing, and the transparency after it was over. Our family has truly healed with better communication between both parents and a common goal to raise our daughter in a loving environment. Since then when I have a family law concern that may arise, she is quick to respond whether by text or email. Due to the distance, I retained another attorney, through my employer thinking of saving money and I quickly learned what a huge mistake that was. Despite the disastrous outcome and poor service from the so-called Big Family Law Firm in my new residential area, Shana still was able to offer her professional opinion. Her superior family law counsel helped us accomplish our goals at our last hearing, and the success from that case was astounding!Law Offices Of Leslie Shaw A PCJoseph P. ratedThank you Leslie Shaw and staff....I hurt my neck and back at work. My employer wouldn't send me to see a doctor. A few weeks later they laid me off. I met with Leslie and she sentme to see Dr. Jerome Hall, one of San Diego's best Orthopedic Specialists and Spinal Surgeons. She also told me that I was eligible for Temporary, Total Disability payments from the insurance company. Two weeks later a check arrived and they've continued every two weeks. Now, two years later, I've had  spinal surgery on my neck and lower back. It's been a long two years. The insurance company had denied about 90 percent of the treatments my doctor had requested. Leslie appealed  those denials and they were all overturned. Whenever I've had questions I would send her an email and I would get an answer within a few hours. She also keeps me updated through the mail. I get copies of all documents pertaining to my case. I also see her in person, at her office, to discuss where we're at and where we're going. I have referred others to her and will continue to do so. Without her lawyer skills and hard work I might have become a cripple and probably would have become homeless. To date, I haven't paid her a penny. In the end, I don't think the fee she'll receive will be enough for all the great work she's done for me. Thank you Leslie Shaw and staff.Feuerstein & Murphy, LLPabbieab577 ratedI dont know where to start.. My husband is a retired pro boxer. He now has dementia. Michelle and her staff have been amazing. He's had issues from divorce to child support and Michelle has helped him with all of it. When he and I met he no longer had his power of attorney to help him and no money for a new lawyer. I contacted Michelle and no questions asked, she allowed me to pay payments monthly and she is still getting the mess cleaned up for us. I really don't know where I'd be without her and Linda:). I was trying to file all the paperwork for him on my own and it was no use. Almost three years went by. Now, all is being taken care of by Michelle Murphy and her firm...I've looked back on my husbands Cases and dealings with the lawyers, accountants, etc, in his life... All were just milking him dry and nothing in return. Not Michelle and her partners, and staff. I feel they truly care for us and my husbands well being. It's really good to know there are still people like this in the world. My husband fought to the death most of his life. When I hear him say "not to worry, Michelle always looked out for me" i feel so much better. No more stress. And now I don't worry... With all the other stuff I manage for my husband it's really good to know that this case isn't something for me to worry about.Law TigersTerry H. ratedVery happy and satisfied client. I got the money I needed quickly and honestly far more then I would have guessed. My medical bills were starting to back up, my bike totaled from an idiot drunk driver, and my primary transportation to work was taken away from me, THANKFULLY the law tigers took care of me to set things right again in my life. From the very first phone call to the Law Tigers to the final settlement check Michelle Hall made me feel comfortable, understanding of what to expect, and felt like I wasn’t just a number but a person with a family, life, and most importantly that I mattered to them. I wish I never was hit by a driver but if you’re looking for a place to take care of you, stop thinking about it and just call. I was like you, unsure if it’s worth my time but I quickly found out it was. They told me what to expect each step of the way, gave me updates all the time, and really took care of my needs. Now months later I am back on the road, riding my new bike, and just glad to know law tigers took care of my situation. THANKS again to Michelle Hall!! You’re such a kind soul!! Update; Michelle even made sure I got my check quickly and had no issues after it was all said and done. Asked me about my new bike and knew more about my bike then I did.  Wow! Very impressed!!!Did You Know?Types of AttorneysThe legal profession is vast, with each attorney having his or her specialties. Here are some of the most common attorneys individuals seek out when they require legal aid:Criminal Lawyer
A criminal defense lawyer is probably the attorney the average person imagines. Criminal attorneys are the men and women who defend individuals accused of a crime. The lawyer may work pro bono - for the public good - so the accused is certain to have representation, even if he or she cannot afford an attorney.Criminal lawyers are experts in the criminal justice system. They help their clients decide how to plead when first charged by the police and guide them through trial procedures. Defense lawyers must use every bit of their knowledge and resources to get their clients the fairest results from criminal proceedings.Business Lawyer
If you are a small business owner or the head of a larger corporation, you may come into contact with a business lawyer. Many big companies keep a legal staff on payroll to deal with the daily operations of running and maintaining a large enterprise. Business lawyers may have more specific specialties like copyright law, product liability and mergers and acquisitions.Business attorneys may focus their practices on certain industries. There are entertainment lawyers to guide artists through royalties and media contracts, while hospitals employ malpractice attorneys to protect doctors from aggressive litigation.Employment Lawyer
When you work for a company, you may find yourself in need of an employment lawyer - especially if the relationship between you and your employer sours. An employment attorney prevents people from losing their jobs due to unfair reasons. Workers' compensation lawyers help maintain safe employment conditions and ensure workers receive fair compensation after workplace injury or discrimination.Finance Lawyer
A personal finance attorney can protect and manage your investments and securities. You may use a finance lawyer to help you prepare your taxes, but you might be better off working with an accountant. A tax attorney is more commonly contacted after a business or individual runs into trouble with the IRS or state regulators.Real Estate Lawyer
Your family may keep a lawyer on retainer to guide you through the major expenses that come up in life. When buying a home, you could work with a real estate lawyer to make sure you get the best deal and won't get taken advantage of by tricky mortgage agreements or unfair landlords. An estate attorney can help you plan for the worst by creating a will and preparing your finances for after your death.Bankruptcy Lawyer
A bankruptcy lawyer is essential to help you resolve your financial difficulties when they start to spin out of control. Certain attorneys help create strategies to bring you out of debt and speak to your creditors. A lawyer can advise you on which type of bankruptcy you should file for.Civil Lawyer
If you are suing someone or being sued, you need a civil lawyer. Civil attorneys - and criminal lawyers - are the legal representatives who argue on your behalf in a courtroom setting. Civil lawyers may represent you on matters of business, finance or a wide variety of other specialized needs.One of the most common types of civil attorneys is a personal injury lawyer. When you're hurt by an outside party and you would like to hold them legally responsible, a personal injury attorney conducts litigation and negotiates settlements to compensate for your pain and suffering. Sometimes many wronged people will join together with a single civil lawyer or law office to form a class action lawsuit.Family/Divorce Lawyer
Most people will turn to a lawyer during a divorce to navigate the emotionally charged legal proceedings. A divorce attorney can assist in determining grounds for separation, division of property and custody of children.Family attorneys deal with much more personal matters. If you're getting married, a family lawyer can help you prepare a prenuptial agreement or other family planning paperwork such as adoption or inheritance documents.Questions One Should Ask a Lawyer Before Hiring ThemTo ensure you find a competent attorney who won't abuse your trust or drain your finances, you have to make the proper inquiries. There are several questions you should ask, but the majority will fall under three general topics:Training and Experience Questions
One of the best ways to determine quality is to examine an attorney's history. When you first step into a lawyer's office, you should check for the appropriate certifications and diplomas. You have to ask how long he or she has practiced law and request information that demonstrates the practice's success. Look for precise details such as percentage of cases settled out of court.Once you inquire about the broad details of their legal career, you should ask questions about their experience that pertains to your specific issue. You should ask how many similar cases they have handled and if they have special skills or training that applies specifically to your needs. Lawyers can't mention clients by name, but you should ask for basic details about identical past cases.Financial Questions
You need to ask about every possible fee that will come up when working with an attorney. You should request a list of all costs in advance so you won't be surprised by additional expenses like overhead. Also determine exactly when you will start being billed. You want to inspect paperwork carefully. If the attorney charges you for his or her experience, you need to make sure he or she will perform tasks personally and not hand it off to an assistant.Find out if the attorney has a flat fee or charges by the hour. Many civil lawyers work on contingency. Whatever the payment plan, make inquiries about how the lawyer plans to provide service for your money and what you can do if you start to feel unsatisfied with his or her performance.Lawyer/Client Relationship Questions
When you hire a lawyer, you're agreeing to work with someone over a certain period of time. You need to ask questions about how the attorney will communicate with you and what responsibilities you hold in the relationship. The attorney should let you know the best channel for quick communication and you need to inform him or her when you want updates.You should also ask questions to get to know the attorney as an individual in order to ensure this is a person you can trust. Ask about their legal philosophy and how he or she views the lawyer/client relationship. Great questions to start off with are ones that will make your life easier, such as how to keep fees down or what daily disruptions you should expect from a long legal battle. The more forthcoming the lawyer appears to be with individual needs, the better.Top Reasons to Hire a LawyerYou may keep a lawyer on retainer or you could turn to an attorney during specific situations. Here are some common reasons people begin seeking legal representation or advice:You Know Your Limitations
If you sign documents and you come across a word you don't recognize, you need assistance. You may need a third party to help you navigate important employment or real estate paperwork. It's essential you fully understand the terms of any legally binding documentation or activity you become a part of. If you are not an expert in a given field, you'll want to hire an attorney who is.A lawyer may find legal implications or opportunities you might miss. If you find yourself in a civil or criminal matter, a proper attorney ensures you don't receive a harsh punishment for a small mistake.You're Facing an Important Event/Decision
When making decisions critical to your financial stability or personal life, you may want a lawyer with expertise in your situation to make sure you do everything you can to arrive at the proper resolution. This is especially true when you become involved in a criminal case and your freedom is on the line.It's not just a matter of legal knowledge; lawyer's have access to numerous resources you do not. They have staff ready to work around the clock and experts in a variety of fields to give your important issues the attention they deserve.You Can't Be Impartial
During times when personal matters intersect with legal proceedings, you may need to have an advocate to prevent your emotions from getting in the way of level-headed thinking. For example, divorce lawyers can mediate a heated argument and help both partners get on with their lives.Emotional investment could be subtle. You may want to have a lawyer look over an investment opportunity that looks too good to be true or investigate the merits of a possible civil suit when you feel wronged.You're Out of Options
Many people turn to lawyers when they are in trouble. If you've been accused of a crime or are in a terrible financial situation, you can find an attorney who will work with what you have available to assist you as you deal with your problems.Personal injury lawyers find solutions for people who can no longer work under their own power and bankruptcy attorneys prevent people from giving in to debt. If you find yourself in a situation where you can't find a solution, a lawyer may be able to offer the counsel you need.How to Choose a LawyerWhen it comes time to choose a lawyer, you should start by searching close to home. While you probably don't want the conflict of interest that comes from being represented by a family member, friends and loved ones can recommend lawyers who served them well in the past. If you do have attorneys you are familiar with, ask who they believe would be best for you.After going through personal references - especially from individuals who had similar needs - you should broaden your search through public information resources. You can call your area's attorney referral service or check legal organizations like Martindale-Hubbell. There are other resources available online. You should check websites for client reviews and other third-party forms of approval.When you build a list of possible candidates, perform a background check on each one. See if you can find information on their history and success record. Once you find a possible lawyer, you should call to arrange a consultation so you can ask your important questions in person.By performing the necessary research and taking every available precaution, you can narrow your search to the attorney most suited to your needs.
