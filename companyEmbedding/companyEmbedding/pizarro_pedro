Pedro Pizarro


Born
c. 1515
Toledo


Died
c. 1602
Arequipa


Occupation
Chronicler, conquistador


Pedro Pizarro (c. 1515 – c. 1602) was a Spanish chronicler and conquistador. He took part in most events of the Spanish conquest of Peru and wrote an extensive chronicle of them under the title Relación del descubrimiento y conquista de los reinos del Perú ("Relation of the discovery and conquest of the kingdoms of Peru"), which he finished in 1571.

Biography[edit]
Pedro Pizarro was born around 1515 in the Spanish city of Toledo. Through his father he was first cousin of Francisco Pizarro and his half-brothers: Gonzalo Pizarro, Hernando Pizarro, Juan Pizarro and Martín de Alcántara.[1] When Francisco left Spain for his third expedition to Peru he was joined by his brothers and his cousin Pedro. They sailed from Sanlúcar de Barrameda in February 1530 and arrived at Tumbes in what is now Peru in January 1531.[2] Pedro initially served as page to his cousin Francisco but from about 1533 he was in active military service as a cavalryman.[3] As such he took part in most of the chief events of the conquest of the Inca empire, mainly during the campaigns against Manco Inca.[4]
Pedro Pizarro fought at the Battle of Las Salinas (April 26, 1538) against Diego de Almagro, rival and former partner of Francisco Pizarro. He then took part in the foundation of the city of Arequipa (August 15, 1540) where he established himself. The almagristas revolted again in 1541, murdering Francisco Pizarro, so Pedro Pizarro fought them at the Battle of Chupas (September 16, 1542) under the command of Cristóbal Vaca de Castro.[5] When Gonzalo Pizarro revolted against the Spanish Crown, Pedro Pizarro refused his requests to join his rebellion. However, his loyalty was put in doubt for a letter he wrote to his cousin on December 18, 1546, which shows some vacillations in his loyalty probably prompted by material considerations. This letter fell into the hands of Pedro de la Gasca, an envoy sent by the Crown to pacify the country. La Gasca used the letter as an excuse to deny Pedro Pizarro the rewards he claimed after the Battle of Xaquixaguana (April 9, 1548) where Gonzalo Pizarro was defeated.[6]
Despite this rebuff, Pedro Pizarro could be considered a rich and well-rewarded man. On November 28, 1538, he had received from Francisco Pizarro lands and native workers in Arequipa, Tacna and other regions; he received further grants from time to time by various authorities.[7] When he was very young, he fathered a natural daughter, Isabel Pizarro; he later had numerous legitimate children. Pedro Pizarro married twice: his first wife was María Cornejo, but nothing is known about his second wife.[8] The death date of Pedro Pizarro is not known. It happened after 1571 when he finished writing his chronicle and could have taken place as late as 1602 when viceroy Luis de Velasco, marqués de Salinas made a grant to a Pedro Pizarro, however, this Pedro may have been a son of the chronicler.[9]
Pizarro's Relación[edit]
Based on his personal observation from 1531 to 1555, Pedro Pizarro wrote a chronicle of the Spanish conquest of Peru, which he completed in 1571 under the title Relación del descubrimiento y conquista de los reinos del Perú ("Relation of the discovery and conquest of the kingdoms of Peru").[7] The manuscript of Relación that was at the National Library of Spain, however, been lost and the only remaining copy is located at The Huntington Library.[10] The work remained in manuscript until its inclusion in the fifth volume of the Colección de documentos inéditos para la historia de España, published in 1844 in Madrid. The first English translation was published by Philip A. Means in 1921 in New York; the standard modern edition in Spanish is that edited by Guillermo Lohmann Villena in 1978 in Lima.[11]

Pedro Pizarro, chief executive of Edison International, says the members of his team need to be comfortable enough to disagree with him.

This interview with Pedro J. Pizarro, C.E.O. of Edison International, the public utility holding company, was conducted and condensed by Adam Bryant.Q. What were your early years like?A. I had a great family — kind of middle class to lower middle class, depending on the year. But I had a bad back as a kid. I had two surgeries and spent much of my junior and senior years in and out of school. I’d be home for two months, and then I’d get a little better and catch up with all the schoolwork in two or three weeks and go back into school. I was a nerdy kid anyway, so high school was very manageable for me.That must have been tough. Those are formative years.The pain did get in the way of doing a lot of things. I had to learn some flexibility and resiliency and to be creative about how I did things. That gave me confidence. Ever since then, my back has been pretty good, so I’m just grateful.Tell me about your parents.They both grew up poor in Puerto Rico. My dad is an accountant, and my mom stayed home most of the time. Early on, they scrimped and saved to send us to private school. They would always say: “This is your inheritance. We’re focusing on trying to give you the best education we can.” Continue reading the main story

And then my dad decided to move the family to Florida from Puerto Rico to broaden our horizons and get some different opportunities. He moved us there without having a job, and with English as a second language for him. It took him about five months to get a job as a C.P.A. It was a tough time. I can remember him asking himself if he did the right thing for the family.How have your parents influenced your leadership style?They’re very different. My dad is pretty introverted, and my mom is a total extrovert. If she joined us now, you’d be lucky to get a word in. But they’re both very caring, and my approach is colored by them.I do think I have personal relationships with my team. At the same time, there’s a role I have to play. You can have a strong relationship with somebody, but you also need to be ready to be candid and give feedback.And it’s a two-way street. I say to my team that they need to be ready to call me on something, and that requires a level of trust. Because there are times when I’m flat-out wrong.It takes some really confident, comfortable people to not shut down the moment that I signal that I might disagree with them. One thing I do with some of my closest partners at work is to tell them that they should sometimes really disagree with me — genuinely, of course — in open settings, so people see that somebody whom I value can debate with me.

You can talk all you want about trust and disagreement, but unless you provide concrete examples of it in action, it’s kind of flat. Human beings are incredibly perceptive, and they seem to be more perceptive when they look at people above them than when they look down.So when you went to college, did you have a clear idea of what you wanted to do for a career?I wanted to be an orthopedic surgeon because of my experience with my back. I chose chemistry and physics as my majors, and became more interested in the science side. I then spent about six years working on a Ph.D. before deciding to make a big shift to go work at McKinsey.

What was an early leadership lesson for you?With the first group I managed, I had somebody who was very different from the rest of us. Once we reached a conclusion, we would move on, but this one person on the team tended to the leave the question open longer.As a manager, it frustrated the heck out of me for a while, and we did have some team discussions about it. But the lesson for me was that the guy actually saved our bacon a couple of times because we had reached conclusions that were off.And even though we felt he was a pain, he made us look at the question again. It was a great lesson about diversity of viewpoints. We all had to adapt to each other.Other lessons?I see a lot of leaders who want to be the hub, with their people as the spokes, bringing them information. My visual for leadership is that if the team is a wheel, I’m actually the rim. I’m not the center.My job is to keep the spokes together, keep the team together and really help that team perform because they, collectively, are going to have a lot more insights than I will. It also means that when you have to go through mud, the rim goes in first. But that’s the way it should be.How do you hire?You need smarts, because there’s just no substitute for smarts. You need folks who are going to be able to lead teams in a way that makes teams want to follow them. There has to be some chemistry as well, given the time all of us spend together at work.I really like hearing from people about a time they failed and what they learned from it, and I try to get some genuine answers to that question. That shows humility.I also really believe in hiring the person who might not necessarily do the best job in the role next Monday. Instead, I look for the person who could do the job the best a year from now and who might be able to go beyond the job to the next level. It’s about hiring for immediate skill versus hiring for potential. There’s a balance there.

One of the pieces of advice I often give to people early in their career is that they should have a general direction and aspiration for two or three potential senior jobs, and then always be working on a few things to improve themselves. In the end, life will surprise you, but working on those skills will help you get there.
