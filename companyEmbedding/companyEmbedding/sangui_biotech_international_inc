Sangui BioTech:
- Revenues of USD 67,000 in fiscal year 2017;- Granulox license income increased by 37%.
Witten, July 18, 2017
According to preliminary unaudited figures, Sangui BioTech International Inc. achieved revenues in the amount of approximately USD 67,000 from license fees in the course of its financial year 2017 (as of June 30, 2017). Due to increased revenues of the wound spray Granulox the resulting licensing income could be increased by 37% compared to the previous year. Both revenues in the first and second half of the year were significantly higher than in the corresponding prior-year periods. After a decline in sales in the third quarter as a result of the good year-end business in the second quarter, sales of Granulox rose by 58% in the fourth quarter.

While the 2016 financial year was characterized by declining sales due to a lack of comprehensive reimbursement in Germany, this trend was more than compensated for by the increase in sales in other sales areas in the financial year just ended. As a result of the reimbursement achieved in 2016 in the Netherlands and Great Britain, Granulox sales in these countries were already 20% higher than in 2016 for the period from January to June 2017. The market in Mexico continues to be very pleasing. Here, the inclusion of Granulox in the list of hospitals available products (Cuaro basico) led to increasing demand. Increasing sales are also reported from Poland: a recent study published in Poland in patients with venous ulcers supported the efforts of the Polish sales partner.
The sales partnership concluded with Zuellig AG for South-East Asia in the autumn of 2016 is developing according to plan. Thus, Granulox was presented in Thailand as part of a national wound congress. The lectures and presentation of the therapy results obtained from Thai patients were very well received and led to the first shipments to Thailand.
"We are extremely satisfied with this development, as it is within the scope of our planning and shows that our sales concept for Granulox continues to take effect. By the end of the year 2016, we will start the launch of Granulox in Malaysia, the Philippines and Singapore together with our sales partners. We are expecting approval for Granulox for Russia in December 2017 at the latest. Our Russian cooperation partners are already working very hard on the market launch today, " explains Michael Sander, Managing Director of SastoMed GmbH, to which Sangui BioTech GmbH has licensed the worldwide distribution rights for the wound spray Granulox.
Sangui BioTech International, Inc. ("SGBI") is a holding company the shares of which are being traded on the OTCQB venture stage marketplace for early stage and developing U.S. and international companies (OTCQB: SGBI). Companies are current in their reporting and undergo an annual verification and management certification process.

Sangui Bio Tech:
							- Sales of USD 35,508 in the first half year
							- Costs and loss is further reduced

Witten, Germany, February 24, 2017
In the first six months of fiscal year 2017 (to 31/12/2016) Sangui BioTech International Inc. achieved revenues from royalty income and product sales of USD 35,508. In the same period of the previous year the comparable revenue amounted to USD 26,856. Due to increased revenues of the wound spray Granulox, the resulting royalty income in the first half year increased by 32% compared to the same period of the previous year. After a cautious first quarter, especially a strong end-of-year business was responsible for this development. The cost – cutting – and liability – protection program adopted during the last year also had an effect in the reporting period: In the first half of the year, operating business expenses were reduced by a further USD 22,752 or 8% to USD 253,465. As a result of this, the operating loss of the first half year decreased compared to the prior year by USD 30,975 to USD 218,615. Accordingly, the cash position of the Company during the reporting period improved.
The sales of Granulox are subject to seasonal fluctuations. As in previous years, a strong year-end business was pleasing. As planned, sales of Granulox and royalty income in the following quarter will not reach the level of the previous quarter. For the full year 2017, however, the company is still expecting the increase in sales of Granulox and corresponding royalty revenues.
Sangui Bio Tech:
							- Revenues of USD 36,000 in the first half-year
							- Granulox license income increased by 33%

Witten, Germany, January 12, 2017
According to preliminary unaudited figures, Sangui BioTech International Inc. achieved revenues in the amount of approximately USD 36,000 from license fees in the first half year of fiscal 2017 (as of December 31, 2016). Due to increased revenues of the wound spray Granulox, the resulting licensing income in the first half year increased by 33% compared to the same period of the previous year. After a cautious first quarter, especially a strong end-of-year business was responsible for this development. Particularly pleasing was the fact that the increase in revenues was caused by expanding business with existing partners, e.g.  Silanes in Mexico, and not by one-time effects with new contract partners.
							"As in previous years, we were able to look back on a strong year-end business. The development in Mexico is more than pleasing. The fact that Granulox's foreign revenues have more than doubled over the past 12 months shows that the business is developing on an increasingly broader basis. This effect will be intensified by the planned activities of our partners in Southeast Asia, Russia and the UK, among others. Our business is also subject to seasonal fluctuations. As a result, revenues of the following quarter are not expected to reach that of the quarter under report. For the full year 2017, however, we are counting on the further growth in total revenues for Granulox, "explains Michael Sander, Managing Director of SastoMed GmbH, to which Sangui BioTech GmbH has licensed the worldwide distribution rights for the wound spray Granulox.
Sangui Bio Tech:
							- SastoMed enters into sales agreement for Turkey
							- Firm purchase commitments agreed
							- Granulox receives product approval in Kuwait

Witten, Germany, December 21, 2016
Following the successful integration of the sales regions Southeast Asia and Russia in October this year, SastoMed GmbH, to which Sangui BioTech GmbH has licensed the worldwide distribution rights for the wound spray Granulox, has also entered into a sales partnership in Turkey. With SAF Pharma Health Services S.A. (SAF), a powerful partner for the introduction of Granulox in this important territory was won. As was already the case with Zuellig Pharma for Southeast Asia and the MDP Group for Russia, it was also possible to agree with SAF guaranteed minimum purchase commitments for Turkey. In the course of the next five years, SAF will, in line with the anticipated course of the approval and reimbursement procedure, obtain annually increasing minimum volumes with a total volume in the high five-digit range.  "With Turkey a further, promising sales region with 78 million inhabitants could be awarded to an ambitious partner. The fact that minimum quantities could be agreed again underscores the confidence of our partners in the successful market launch of Granulox, "says Michael Sander, Managing Director of SastoMed GmbH.
In December, the product approval procedure for Granulox in Kuweit was successfully completed. The product approval is essential for a successful distribution of Granulox. Granulox was therefore approved for the first time in an Islamic state. "This approval demonstrates that the marketing of Granulox is also possible in countries which, due to religious practices, are actually concerned about products containing porcine ingredients. Outstanding performance from clinical and health economical perspective has convinced local authorities and helped overcome limitations. This is an important precedent that supports our efforts in other Muslim countries such as Indonesia, "says Michel Sander.
Sangui Bio Tech:
							- Sales of USD 9,711 in the first three months
							- Costs and loss halved
Witten, Germany, November 22, 2016
In the first three months of fiscal year 2017 (to 30/09/2016) Sangui BioTech International Inc. achieved revenues from royalty income and product sales of USD 9,711. In the same period of the previous year the comparable revenue amounted to USD 11.471. 
							The cost – cutting – and liability – protection program adopted during the last year shows first success. Thus, the cost of business operations for the quarter could be reduced by USD 93,490 or 54% to USD  79,322. As a result of this, the operating loss of the quarter decreased compared to the prior year quarter by USD 91,533 to USD 69,893. Accordingly, the cash position of the Company during the reporting period improved.
							After declining royalty income  due to lower turnover of the wound treatment product Granulox in previous quarters, the company expects  for the further development of the fiscal year 2017 rising sales of Granulox and accordingly increasing royalty income.
							This forecast is based on the successful integration of new sales partners (UK and Southeast Asia) as well as positive developments in already developed sales areas.
Sangui Bio Tech:
							- SastoMed enters into sales agreements for Southeast Asia, Poland and Russia
							- Firm purchase commitments agreed
Witten, Germany, November 01, 2016
SastoMed GmbH, to which Sangui BioTech GmbH has licensed the worldwide distribution rights for the wound spray Granulox, concluded  a comprehensive licensing and sales agreement for eight Southeast Asian States with Zuellig Pharma, Singapure (www.zuelligpharma.com) one of the world's leading service providers of the pharmaceuticals. Zuellig Pharma is responsible for market launch and distribution of Granulox in the territories of HongKong, Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia, Taiwan, Vietnam, Indonesia and the Philippines. In addition to the complete processing and financing of admission in the individual territories, Zuellig Pharma has committed itself to the purchase of significant quantities of Granulox within the next five years. Furthermore, two high – performance distribution partners could be bound: Hexanova Sp.z.o.o. for Poland (www.hexanova.pl) and MDP Group for Russia (www.mdp-group.net). In both cases, minimum purchase commitments were also been agreed upon.
							"With these agreements, we have succeeded in pushing forward into new dimensions. Inside the newly acquired sales areas, more than half a billion people live. We have now reached an important milestone on our path to global expansion. In addition to the quantitative dimension, the qualitative contract value of the agreements was also increased. In the past five years, Granulox has proven in field that it keeps what it promises on paper. When granting new territories, we now benefit from the appreciation Granulox has now gained. For instance, Zuellig Pharma for Southeast Asia and the MDP Group for Russia, two veritable global players with a corresponding sales force and financial strength, could be obtained for Granulox. Both partners have committed themselves to realize the necessary regulatory approvals and subsequent market launch of Granulox in the respective territories. Guaranteed purchase commitments were agreed with both partners. The annual minimum purchase quantities fixed within the next five-year period up to 2021 are based on the time-staggered progress of the product launches expected by Zuellig Pharma and MDP Group. Starting with the approval of Granulox, followed by the starts of the marketing campaigns and Granulox's positive sales development, specific verifiable milestones were established together with our partners for the individual territories. The cumulative purchase commitments for quantities over the next five years are well in the middle six-digit range. On the one hand, this minimum order gives us further planning certainty and ensures that we achieve our ambitious goals. On the other hand, this fact underscores the strong confidence our partners have in the future success of the cooperation with SastoMed ", explains Michael Sander, CEO of Sastomed GmbH.
							"We congratulate SastoMed on these breakthroughs. After the inclusion of Granulox in the Drug Tariff of the British NHS at the beginning of October 2016, SastoMed herewith has reached further trend-setting successes. Sangui as licensors for Granulox will definitively benefit from these success. In this regard, the year 2016 can be described as very successful ", says Thomas Striepe, President and CEO of Sangui BioTech International Inc.
According to preliminary, unaudited figures, Sangui Biotech International, Inc. generated revenues from royalty income of approximately tUSD 10 during the first quarter of fiscal year 2017 (as of September 30, 2016). Revenues in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 (as of September 30, 2015) amounted to t USD 11.

Sangui Bio Tech:
							- Sales of USD 48,000 in fiscal year 2016
							- Cost reduction program: Cost reduction by 50%
							- Annual loss significantly reduced
							- Sales of USD 10,000 in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017
Witten, Germany, October 13, 2016
As can be seen from the audited consolidated financial statements, Sangui BioTech International Inc. was able to generate revenues from royalty income and product sales of tUSD 48 in its fiscal year 2016 (as of June 30, 2016). In the same period of the previous year, the comparable revenues amounted to tUSDt127. This decline was attributable to a decrease in license revenues due to lower turnover of the wound treatment product Granulox. On the other hand, the cost - cutting and liability protection program implemented in the fiscal year had a positive impact. The operating expenses for the reporting year were reduced by tUSD 470 or 53% to tUSD 409. This was mainly due to cost reductions of tUSD 162 in the area of research and development as well as savings at professional fees of tUSD 273. As a result, the operating loss of the year under review decreased by tUSD 391 to tUSD 361 compared to the previous year. Lower cash drains from operating activities of tUSD 208 and a decrease of cash flow from investing and financing activities of only tUSD 55 improved the company's liquidity situation accordingly during the reporting period.
According to preliminary, unaudited figures, Sangui Biotech International, Inc. generated revenues from royalty income of approximately tUSD 10 during the first quarter of fiscal year 2017 (as of September 30, 2016). Revenues in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 (as of September 30, 2015) amounted to t USD 11.

Sangui Bio Tech:
							- British National Health Service NHS granted wound spray Granulox reimbursement
							- British National Health Service NHS confirmed effectiveness and efficiency of Granulox
							- Cost savings of several thousand British pounds per patient
Witten, Germany,  September 30, 2016
The SastoMed GmbH has announced that the British National Health Service (NHS) has taken the wound spray Granulox licensed by Sangui to SastoMed GmbH on the list of reimbursable products under a discrete category (NHS Drug Tariff Part IX) effective October 01, 2016. The NHS provides to each resident of the UK medical care in the primary (general practitioner GP) and secondary level (hospitals) free of charge. Furthermore, in a declaration recently published the Scottish Health Technologies Group (SHTG - a division of NHSScottland) has clearly recommended the application of Granulox to all doctors working for NHSScottland because of  Granulox’ efficacy and marked cost savings of several thousand British pounds proved by several studies.
							Michael Sander, Managing Director of SastoMed GmbH commented: "InFirst Healthcare as our partner in the UK, has done an excellent job. Because of the convincing data submitted a worldwide respected and efficient health care system such as the NHS has not only appreciated the significant improvement in the quality of life for millions of patients suffering from chronic wounds, but also confirmed the significant cost reduction potential by using Granulox. We see this as a breakthrough success, which will integrated Granulox in modern wound treatment system not only in Great Britain. In parallel InFirst is working hard on the approval for the US market - even for that the extensive data from England constitute an important basis ".

Sangui Bio Tech:
							- Sales of USD 37,005 in the first nine months;
							- Cost cutting program is effective: cost reduction by 60%;
							- Reimbursment Commitments  of Granulox in the Netherlands and the Czech Republic.
Witten, Germany,  June 6, 2016
In the first nine months of fiscal year 2016 (to 31/03/2016) Sangui BioTech International Inc. achieved revenues from royalty income and product sales of USD  37,005. In the same period of the previous year the comparable revenue amounted to USD 116,500.
The cost – cutting – and liability – protection program adopted during the last quarter shows first success. Thus, the cost of business operations for the quarter could be reduced by USD 124,376 or 60% to USD  81,626. For the first three quarters of the fiscal year the cost reduction totaled USD 334 414 or 48%. As a result of this, the operating loss of the quarter decreased compared to the prior year quarter by USD 88,735 to USD 106,795 respectively for the first nine months from USD 579,088 to USD 365,387. Accordingly, the cash position of the Company during the reporting period improved.
After declining royalty income  due to lower turnover of the wound treatment product Granulox in previous quarters, the company expects  for the further development of the fiscal year 2016 and the fiscal year 2017 rising sales of Granulox and accordingly increasing royalty income.
This prediction is supported by successful efforts of the licensee, the  Sastomed GmbH to grant reimbursement commitments for the costs caused by using  Granulox from the relevant health insurance companies.
During the current quarter, the reimbursement of 100 % respectively 75 %  of the costs caused by using Granulox  could be reached in the Netherlands respectively  in the Czech Republic. Discussions with the not yet reimbursing health insurance companies in Germany will continue.
Accessorily SastoMed GmbH was able to acquire a strong and experienced partner during the quarter for Poland. Negotiations with potential partners about distribution rights for territories in the South-East Asian region are in an advanced stage. In addition, the continuously increasing sales efforts of SastoMed - partners in the already developed territories will lead to increasing sales figures of Granulox. Here the partners in Mexico and Peru are mentioned in particular.

Sangui Bio Tech International publishes preliminary figures for first half year 
							- Revenues of $ 27,000 in the first half year;
							- Increase in Granulox royalty income by 28% 
							- Cost cutting program is effective
							- Sale of minority stake
Witten, Germany,  February 1, 2016
According to preliminary unaudited figures, Sangui BioTech International Inc. achieved revenues from royalty income and product sales in the amount of approximately $ 27,000 in the first half of its fiscal year 2016 (Dec. 31,.2015). The development of royalty income can be described as positive. Due to increased sales of the wound treatment product Granulox the resulting royalties increased in the second quarter by 28% as compared to the first quarter. This development reflects the successful efforts of the licensee, SastoMed GmbH, to obtain reimbursement commitments from relevant health insurance companies for costs caused by the prescription of Granulox, particularly in Europe.
The adopted cost-cutting - and liquidity-protection program has been implemented successfully in the second quarter of the fiscal year. After complete implementation costs in a significant amount will be saved per annum. Accordingly, the breakeven point will be reached considerably earlier.
Shareholders' equity of SastoMed GmbH was strengthened at the end of December 2015 by a capital increase by the majority shareholders. Due to the fact that Sangui BioTech GmbH has not exerted its subscription rights, the participation rate of Sangui BioTech GmbH of originally 25% was significantly reduced by the capital increase. Sangui BioTech GmbH sold its stake in SastoMed GmbH to the co-shareholder at the end of 2015. The persisting licensing agreement between Sangui BioTech GmbH and SastoMed GmbH is not affected by this sale.
This above-mentioned first capital increase contributes to further expand the sales and marketing activities of SastoMed GmbH for its wound treatment product Granulox at home - and abroad. This measure will have positive effects on the Sangui BioTech GmbH prospective accruing royalties.
Sluggish revenue development continues / Comprehensive cost containment program under preparation / Joachim Fleing stepped down
Witten, Germany,  October 28, 2015
According to preliminary, unaudited figures Sangui Biotech International, Inc. yielded revenues from royalties and product sales of around USD12,000 in the course of the first three months of its 2016 financial year, ended September 30, 2015. In the first quarter of the 2015 financial year (ended September 30, 2014) revenues amounted to USD73,740 due to one large order.
According to information provided by global licensee SastoMed GmbH a significant increase in revenues is not to be expected until the years 2017/2018. The Board of Directors currently works on a comprehensive cost containment concept in order to adapt the ongoing expenses to the overall income. Research and development, also in view of the SBT102 and SBT1001 projects, will be under review and stalled if necessary until separate project financing will become available.
Dr. Joachim Fleing stepped down from his positions as a Director and Officer of the Company on October 27, 2015, with immediate effect. For an interim period he has offered to assist the Company with the ongoing accounting, compliance and stock related activities. The management regrets this decision. It extended its gratitude for a good and successful cooperation and its best wishes for his future.
 
Shareholder Information (Update):
Witten, Germany,  October 6, 2015
An 8-K announcement was erroneously filed in the EDGAR system of the SEC by a company unknown to Sangui on September 18, 2015. As per our requested this announcement was removed in the meantime by the SEC.
On Monday, September 28, 2015, an information meeting of Sangui Biotech International, Inc. took place in Hamburg, Germany. In the course of the meeting Michael Sander, the Managing director of SastoMed GmbH, reported on the status of the market entry activities of the Granulox product in Germany and internationally. Among other facts he mentioned that additional, large scale wound healing studies have been applied for or are under preparation in the USA and Europe. Moreover, he explained the typical milestones of a market entry which can extend the time frame until significant revenues can be generated to up to 74 months in each individual country. While this intensive market preparation phase is currently being pushed forward in more than 20 countries, a significant increase in revenues is being expected for the years to come. As far as Sangui is concerned, the focus will remain on securing the necessary financing of its ongoing activities until reaching break-even on the basis of the revenues from license fees on Granulox sales. Additional cost reductions are to render a material contribution to attaining this goal.
 
Revenues of USD 127,000 in financial year 2015; net loss, cash burn reduced; 
							revenues from Granulox license fees in EUR up 34.4%

Witten, Germany,  September 29, 2015
For its financial year 2015 (ended June 30, 2015) Sangui BioTech International, Inc. reports revenues from product sales and royalties in the amount of USD127,469, a decrease of 4.5% as compared to the revenues in the financial year 2014, which came in at USD133,470. Revenues in the fourth quarter were recorded at USD10,909 (Q4/2014: USD43,729). The decrease for the financial year and the quarter is due primarily to a sharp decline in product sales. Royalties from the licensing agreement regarding the wound treatment product Granulox engrossed by SanguiBioTech GmbH in the operating currency EUR, however, increased by 34.4% in the 2015 financial year. Granulox is the first dressing to significantly improve oxygen supply to wounds with poor blood supply and thereby decisively accelerates wound healing.
Research and development expenses decreased to USD204,987 (FY 2014: USD543,071). The previous year position included the purchase of a comprehensive set of clinical data. This decrease along with cost saving efforts contributed to a significantly reduced net loss attributable to shareholders in the amount of USD0.7 million (FY 2014: USD1.4 million). Cash outflows from operations were also reduced and amounted to USD0.6 million (FY 2014: USD0.8 million). They were not fully offset by cash inflows from financing and investing activities which amounted to USD0.5 million (FY 2014: USD0.7 million). 
 
Positive Outlook after Weak Fourth Quarter / Cost Cutting Initiated
Witten, Germany,  August 27, 2015
According to preliminary, unaudited figures Sangui Biotech International, Inc. yielded revenues from royalties and product sales of less than USD130,000 in the course of its financial year 2015, ended June 30, 2015. In the financial year 2014 revenues amounted to USD133,470. Revenues in the fourth quarter came in at around USD11,000 (Q4/2014: USD43,729).
Royalties from the licensing agreement regarding the wound treatment product Granulox engrossed by SanguiBioTech GmbH in the operating currency EUR, however, increased by 34.4% in the 2015 financial year. 
SanguiBioTech GmbH has reacted to the sluggish top line development by starting a new round of cost cutting involving personnel expenses and office space as well as reducing patent expenses by giving up marginal patents, in particular those protecting the cosmetics business. 
According to preliminary information provided by global licensee SastoMed GmbH Granulox sales are expected to increase again slightly in the current quarter (ending September 30) and more significantly in the December quarter. 
 
Sangui BioTech International files S-1 Registration Statement with the SEC
							Prerequisite for drawing upon financial framework agreement with US investor of $5 million
Witten, Germany,  June 26, 2015
Sangui Biotech International, Inc. has filed a preliminary S-1 Registration Statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission. It is being expected that the SEC will declare the Prospectus effective within the next couple of weeks. The exact timeline depends on SEC approval procedures which cannot be anticipated by the company. The S-1 becoming effective is prerequisite for Sangui to start drawing upon the financial framework agreement with US investor Southridge as announced on May 12, 2015.
Under the terms of this agreement Sangui Biotech International, Inc. acquired the right to sell shares to a fund of Southridge LLC, an institutional investor, located in Connecticut and New York in the amount of up to $5 million over a period of three years. 
This financial instrument is one element of Sangui's plan to carry out the preclinical phase of its SBT102 product which underwent successful preclinical testing. SBT102 developed by SanguiBioTech improves the oxygen supply of vital organs. It's intraperitoneal application is an innovative and effective therapy to avoid tissue hypoxemia in cases of septic shock. It can be expected that the restoration of intestinal oxygenation will have an impact on tissue integrity and eventually on patient survival. 
 
Practitioners present wound healing case studies under Granulox treatment
							European Wound Management Congress shows increasing interest in Granulox as a successful approach to support wound therapies
Witten, Germany,  June 2, 2015
This year's annual congress of the European Wound Management Association (EWMA, May 13 - 15, 2015) in London staged medical researchers and practitioners from different European countries who reported about successful treatment of chronic wounds using the Sangui developed Granulox medical device, distributed by global licensee SastoMed GmbH. Presented were results of studies and series of therapies carried out in Birmingham and Brentwood (United Kingdom), Ljubljana (Slovenia), Zurich (Switzerland) as well as Frankfurt (Germany). 
Well attended was a symposium chaired by professor Joachim Dissemond of Essen University, on invitation of SastoMed GmbH. Speakers included Assistant Professor Severin Läuchli, Head of the Department of Dermatology of the University Hospital in Zurich/Switzerland, who presented numerous case studies and came to the conclusion that the additional use of Granulox is able to induce granulation in a large share of previously non healing wounds and that this therapeutic option means a significant improvement for patients.
Dr. Paul Chadwick and Joy Tickle are members of an expert panel convened in the United Kingdom and assessing healing technologies designed to improve wound care standards. They presented the first national consensus recommendation on use of topical hemoglobin spray for the treatment of chronic wounds. The recommendation is based on a diligent assessment of all available scientific data as well an own set of individual trials to assess viability and effectiveness of a Granulox treatment. (cf. www.wounds-uk.com, EWMA 2015 Special Edition).
In one of the plenary sessions, moreover, Assistant Professor Joachim Klode presented initial results of a study regarding the use of photo-acoustic tomography, an innovative imaging process which was deployed to reliably image and quantify the concentration of oxygenated and des-oxygenated hemoglobin in wounds. This enables practitioners to verify and document the systematic connection between improved oxygenation as induced by the use of Granulox on the one hand and the observed improvements of healing and patient quality of life on the other. Another presentation held in this session was based on a 72 patient study. The statistical assessment and simulated extrapolation of healing processes indicated a significant improvement of wound healing under a treatment with Granulox.
The proceedings of the Congress demonstrate an increasing international regard to the innovative hemoglobin spray aimed to support the healing of chronic wounds. It also exemplifies what an intensive and persistent discussion within the expert community it takes to promote the market entry of a completely innovative treatment. 
 
Lower revenues in the third quarter
Witten, Germany,  Mai 15, 2015
For the nine months (as of March 31, 2015) of its 2015 financial year Sangui BioTech International, Inc. reports revenues from product sales and royalties in the amount of USD116,560, an increase of 29.9% over the revenues in the first nine months of the financial year 2014 when revenues amounted to USD89,741 (previous period numbers not adjusted for exchange rate changes). In the third quarter (January through March 2015) revenues amounted to USD11,654 a decrease of 62.6% as compared with the most recent quarter(October through December 2014). According to information provided by global licensee SastoMed GmbH revenues from license fees are expected to increase significantly over the remaining quarters of the calendar year after the slump of the March quarter.
Research and development expenses amounted to USD171,427 (9M/2014: USD139,978). The increase is due to the preclinical trials which demonstrated the functionality of Sangui's technology with respect to the septic shock indication. The net loss attributable to shareholders of the parent company came to USD537,282 (9M/2014: USD1,257,727). In the respective period of the previous year, this position included the loss incurred from the write down of a loan extended to an unrelated party. The cash outflow from operations during the nine months amounted to USD445,557 (9M/2014: USD452,192).
As of December 31, 2014, the equity ratio was minus 113.6% (June 30, 2014: 2.8%).
In the course of the third quarter, the series of preclinical trials at Giessen University inview of the indication septic shock was concluded successfully. Sangui is currently preparing the next steps in the preclinical development of its SBT102 product. An essential sub-project will be the establishment of the final manufacturing process for the test substance and eventually for an industry scale production. 
 
Sangui BioTech International secures financial framework of $5 million over three years
Witten, Germany,  May 12, 2015
Sangui Biotech International, Inc. has signed an agreement securing a financial framework of USD 5 million. Under the terms of this agreement Sangui Biotech International, Inc. acquires the right to sell shares to a fund of Southridge LLC, an institutional investor, located in Connecticut and New York in the amount of up to $5 million over a period of three years. The dilution of existing shareholders is limited to a maximum of 25 million shares of common stock. The agreement is subject to Sangui filing a S-1 registration statement with the SEC.
Southridge is a diversified financial holding company specializing in direct investment and advisory services to small and middle market companies. Since 1996 the structured finance team has made direct investment of over $1.7 billion into growth companies globally. Southridge is dedicated to helping clients achieve their intended goals. Its expertise lies in its ability to customize a financing plan for the prospective client and then execute on that plan without fail.
Thomas Striepe, President and CEO of Sangui Biotech International, Inc., stated: "This financing enables us to proceed with our next large project: to obtain a CE certification for SBT 102, a hemoglobin formulation designed to save lives in cases of septic shock. After the great progress made in the course of the current year we are now able to finalize our detailed planning for the preclinical phase and start implementing it." 
 
Series of preclinical trials concluded successfully
Witten, Germany,  March 18, 2015
The research cooperation team embracing SanguiBioTech GmbH, the Excellence Cluster Cardio Pulmonary System (ECCPS) and TransMIT Gesellschaft für Technologietransfer mbH has now successfully concluded a series of preclinical trials at Giessen University dedicated to the indication of septic shock. The interim results which were communicated in November 2014 were now confirmed on a statistically significant basis. The hemoglobin based product SBT102 developed by SanguiBioTech does improve the oxygen supply of vital organs. Professor Ralph T. Schermuly, head of the research team alongside with Professor Ardeschir Ghofrani comes to the conclusion: "The intraperitoneal application of SBT102 is an innovative and effective therapy to avoid tissue hypoxemia. It can be expected that the restoration of intestinal oxygenation will have an impact on tissue integrity and eventually on patient survival." A comprehensive scientific report is currently being elaborated.
Severe sepsis and septic shock are among the most common causes of death in intensive care. Studies in Germany showed that sepsis had a prevalence of 11% in German intensive care units and a 90-day mortality of 54%. Direct cost associated with treating these patients amount to around EUR1.77 bn., representing 30% of the intensive care budget. Indirect cost are being estimated to reach around EUR4.5 bn. It is to be assumed, therefore, that the total cost relating to severe sepsis and septic shock for the German health system amount to approx. EUR6.3 bn. per year.
ECCPS is an organization set up jointly by the universities of Frankfurt and Giessen together with the Max Planck Institute for Heart and Lung Research in Bad Nauheim. It ranks among the world's leading organizations of this type. This unique centre for translational medicine combines innovative medical research in the field of heart and lung diseases with their practical advancements based on preclinical and clinical studies. Its aim is to work together with industry on developing innovative drugs and substances.
TransMIT Gesellschaft für Technologietransfer mbH (www.transmit.de) being the unit in charge of technology transfer at Justus-Liebig University in Giessen is involved in carrying out this project.
  
Revenues slightly improved in the first half of the 2015 financial year
							Research and development focuses on preclinical trials

Witten, Germany,  February 12, 2015
For the first half (as of December 31,  2014) of its 2015 financial year Sangui BioTech  International, Inc. reports revenues from product sales and royalties in the  amount of USD104,906 an increase of 74.0% over the revenues in the first half  of the financial year 2014. In the second quarter (October through December  2014) revenues amounted to USD31,166 a decrease of 57.7% as compared with the most  recent quarter(July through September 2014).
							Research and development expenses  amounted to USD134,977 (H1/2014: USD 107,234). The increase is due to the  ongoing preclinical trials aimed at demonstrating the functionality  of Sangui's technology with respect to various indications. The net loss attributable to shareholders of the parent company came to  USD355,928 (H1/2014: USD570,032), the cash outflow from operations during the  six months amounted to USD318,740 (H1/2014: USD337,419).
							As of December 31, 2014, the equity ratio  was minus 33.3% (June 30, 2014: 2.8%).
						In the course of the second quarter, preclinical  trials at Giessen University demonstrated that a hemoglobin based product  developed by SanguiBioTech is apt to improve the oxygen supply of vital organs.  It is now being supposed that Sangui's hemoglobin-based artificial oxygen  carriers may interrupt the self-perpetuating mechanism of septic shock, that  has so far been highly resistant to treatment, and may thus ultimately reduce  the high mortality rates.
						SastoMed closes contracts with distribution partners in six additional markets in Eastern Europe

Witten, Germany,  February 3, 2015
SastoMed GmbH has informed Sangui of having closed contracts for initiating distribution and sales of the Sangui developed dressing material Granulox in six Eastern European countries. In 2015 the three Baltic countries will join the family of Granulox territories along with the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary. 
							Like in three Scandinavian markets it will be an enterprise belonging to the Mediq group which will start initiating the distribution in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. Mediq Eesti OÜ (www.mediq.ee) is a wholesale company which has been successfully trading medical and health care products throughout the Baltic countries for many years. Its core business is in medical products and laboratory equipment. A care a.s. (http://www.acare.cz/cs) was entrusted with the Granulox business in the Czech Republic and in Slovakia. The company specializes in medical products, in particular in the fields of wound management, interventional cardiology and radiology as well as neuroradiology. Halley Pharma Ltd. (http://halleypharma.com) will look after the Hungarian market in which they already distribute a wide array of other wound management products.
							In total there are distribution partnerships in place now for 40 countries worldwide, in 24 of which Granulox is already available for doctors and patients. In the remaining 16 countries market entry is scheduled for the next few months after the training of the sales force will have been completed, or after the local registration procedures will have been accomplished, respectively, which is the case in some Central and South American countries.
Shareholder Letter

Witten, Germany,  January 28, 2015
Dear Shareholders:
Today, at the beginning of 2015, Sangui  is in a far better position than twelve months ago, though this is not  reflected in the share price. SastoMed GmbH, our sales joint venture, reported  on the stage achieved in the distribution reach of Granulox and the sales  growth during its financial year 2014. We would like to summarize their report.  In addition, the successful conclusion of the first series of preclinical  trials has delivered impressive confirmation of our theoretical approach, and  we are planning the necessary steps for obtaining certification/licensing of  our hemoglobin hyperpolymers as medical or pharmaceutical products,  respectively.
							SastoMed GmbH raised its Granulox sales  by 80 % compared with 2013 and anticipates sustained, strong growth in  2015. In the words of Michael Sander, SastoMed's Managing Director: "The  reason for the growth is the growing acceptance of the product by the expert  community: In transnational wound congresses, such as the European Wound  Management Association held in Madrid, as well as in the context of many  national events the effectiveness of Granulox was impressively illustrated  using case studies, from Croatia and Serbia, across Italy and right through to  the UK and Sweden. These events were flanked by similarly broad-based reporting  in the media: a double-digit number of specialized publications and case  studies (known as posters) also raised the awareness of patients and therapists  in 2014.
							The process of internationalization is  advancing, and Granulox has already become available as part of the health care  system in 24 countries. The product launch in Mexico was a special highlight:  Our new Mexican partner devoted a whole day to training more than 200 employees  in selling Granulox. Overall, for the first time, more sales were generated through  exports than through domestic business in 2014. In Germany, 'Plusminus' and  'Visite' ran TV documentaries which boosted demand from patients. However, the  general problem of a number of health insurance companies not reimbursing the  costs of the product has not yet been definitively resolved." 

Since sales territories in Europe have  already largely been covered, SastoMed has informed us that it will now also be  concentrating on expanding outside Europe. Acting on this, promising  discussions were held in Korea at the start of January, with further  appointments scheduled in the coming months for promoting expansion into India,  China and Russia. Growth will therefore be driven from two sources in 2015:  Depending on the degree of market penetration in countries already covered and  on the sales uptrend in these countries, new sales territories will commence  with selling. In this context, we make renewed reference to market preparation  which takes an average of three years before notable revenues can be generated  in the relevant territories.
							Let us now turn to the preclinical  trials with our hemoglobin hyperpolymers: the co-operation between our team and  the Excellence Cluster Cardio-Pulmonary System at Giessen University (ECCPS) is  progressing well towards agreed goals in a very constructive atmosphere.  Professors Ralph Schermuly and Ardeshir Ghofrani, scientific directors at  ECCPS, are especially committed as, for many years, they have both accorded  huge importance to septic shock, which is our key initial indication, and  anticipate great benefit from our approach.
							In the first phase which lasted until  November 2014 various approaches to hemoglobin formulations produced in our  Witten laboratory were tested in a process of comparison. The formulation  labeled SBT 102 achieved outstanding results as it succeeded in delivering a  significant improvement in absolute and relative terms in the oxygenation of  the internal organs examined of all the animals treated. This makes our SBT 102  the first product in the wake of a long series of earlier studies by ECCPS to  actually yield a positive effect. Summarized in the words of the researchers:  "The restoration of intestinal oxygenation will have an impact on tissue  integrity and ultimately on patient survival."
							Based on this ground-breaking intermediate  result, we are currently planning and initiating the next tasks together with  our partners: Among other activities, this stage involves:

defining  and creating a GMP compatible production process,
application  to other indications which have been jointly envisaged, and 
the  detailed planning of the regulatory parameters for certification and/or  licensing.

The year 2015 will be important for  determining the future direction. In any event, this milestone raises the issue  of financing the further development. Naturally, it is clear to all of us, you  and ourselves as shareholders, that the next steps will entail financing  instruments which take the form of an unavoidable placement of further shares  from Authorized Capital.
							You may remember that the capital was authorized  by the shareholders in 2008 for this specific purpose, and, ultimately, the  market perception will determine the value of the company while the actual  number of shares outstanding will then be irrelevant. Having a higher share  price would therefore be helpful and is more than desirable. We are convinced  that the current share price in no way appropriately reflects the progress made  by the company and its prospects: Based on the success to be achieved in the current  financing rounds, we are determined to step up our capital markets  communication and to improve the position of our share: reverse split,  preparing a prospectus and new stock markets are some of the options.

The outlook for the company is better  than ever: We have a product in the market which is already gaining momentum in  the market entry phase, and we have launched a project with leading scientists  that may prove to be life saving for many thousands of people in intensive  care. It is our firm belief that this is worth fighting for.
						Yours sincerely
						Thomas Striepe, Hubertus Schmelz, Joachim Fleing

Preclinical trials demonstrate: Sangui hemoglobin preparation improves  oxygen supply of vital organs
Witten, Germany, November 11, 2014
							A possible  success in treating septic shock has now been attained by the research team  embracing SanguiBioTech GmbH, the Excellence Cluster Cardio  Pulmonary System (ECCPS) and TransMIT Gesellschaft für Technologietransfer mbH.  Preclinical trials at Giessen University underpin that a hemoglobin based  product developed by SanguiBioTech is apt to improve the oxygen supply of vital  organs. It is now being supposed that Sangui's hemoglobin-based artificial  oxygen carriers may interrupt the self-perpetuating mechanism of septic shock,  that has so far been highly resistant to treatment, and may thus ultimately  reduce the high mortality rates. 
							A septic shock is the life  threatening final phase of a sepsis. The blood circulation, else exactly tuned  to meet the needs of the body, begins to severely malfunction which results in  deficient oxygen supply of the body tissue. This hypoxia induces a  progressional intoxication of the body with bacteria and bacteria debris.  Modern medical science has not yet identified suitable therapies to effectively  fight this self-perpetuating mechanism of septicemia, which, therefore, results  in mortality rates of 50 to 60 percent.
						Preclinical trials in Giessen now demonstrate that an oxygen-carrying  hemoglobin liquid in the abdomen did significantly improve the oxygen supply to  the intestines. This is likely to be a decisive new therapeutic approach to disrupting  this lethal loop. The preclinical trials are being continued as planned,  extending the scope to additional indications such as ARDS (acute respiratory  distress syndrome) and further hemoglobin preparations as developed by  SanguiBioTech.

Laboratorios Silanes start marketing Granulox in Mexico
							Applications for licensing in all Central American countries under way
Witten, Germany, November 3, 2014
							Laboratorios Silanes (www.silanes.com.mx) commenced with the marketing of the dressing material Granulox in Mexico on November 1, 2014, based on an exclusive agreement with SastoMed GmbH. At the same time, Silanes has taken over the distribution for the remaining countries of Central America and is currently applying for the necessary certifications in the respective individual markets. To be ready for the start of distribution, Silanes ordered, received and paid for merchandise in the previous quarter, which was reflected in a considerable five-digit license income by Sangui as of 30 September 2014.
Laboratorios Silanes was founded in 1943 and, with a workforce of around 700 employees, today ranks among the leading mid-sized pharmaceutical companies of Central America and in terms of revenues occupies third place in the league of the highest-volume suppliers of products suitable for diabetics.
Prior to the start of the distribution, 250 sales representatives took part in a training event which also included an in-depth presentation by Michael Sander, Chief Executive Officer of SastoMed GmbH, the global licensee for the sale of Granulox. The sales force was introduced to the mode of action and the application in a series of detailed scientific and practical presentations, and given the marketing goals and materials.
"The start to marketing by Silanes concludes intensive preliminary work which took two years and the restructuring of our Mexico business", explained Michael Sander. "Thanks to the support of BioMac CEO John McArdle, we now have gained a highly professional partner in Silanes which has the market position to leverage the public profile of Granulox locally and to translate it into tangible success."
Antonio Lopez de Silanes, jr., the owner of Laboratorios Silanes, explained at a national sales congress organized by his company that Granulox had the potential for developing into a core component of the product portfolio. He anticipates that the investments in pre-marketing and marketing will soon pay off.

							Michael Sander, General manager of SastoMed GmbH, the global licensee for the sale of Granulox, lectures about experiences with applying Granulox to different kinds of wounds in the course of the annual sales meeting of Laboratorios Silanes.

Revenues attain USD 133,000 in financial year 2014
Witten, Germany, September 25, 2014
							For its financial year 2014 (ended June 30, 2014) Sangui BioTech International, Inc. reports revenues from product sales and royalties in the amount of USD133,470 USD after USD105,487 in the previous financial year. This increase is primarily attributable to royalties on sales of the Granulox wound dressing, marketing and sales of which are out-licensed to SastoMed GmbH, a joint venture company in which Sangui holds a stake of 25%. Revenues in the fourth quarter of the 2014 financial year came in at USD43,729 USD (Q4/2013: USD24,056). Granulox is the first dressing to significantly improve oxygen supply to wounds with poor blood supply and thereby decisively accelerates wound healing.
Research and development expenses increased to USD543,071 (FY 2013: USD65,010). The position includes the purchase of a comprehensive set of clinical data. This also led to the increase of total operating expenses to USD1.4 million (FY 2013: USD1.3 million). The net result attributable to shareholders amounts to minus USD1.4 million up from minus USD2.1 million in the previous financial year when an impairment of receivables in the amount of USD1.0 million had occurred which had been brought in as capital into SastoMed GmbH. Cash outflow from operations in the amount of USD0.8 million (FY 2013: USD0.8 million) and from investing activities in the amount of USD0.2million (FY 2013: USD0,9 million) were offset by an cash inflow from financing of USD0.9 million (FY 2013: USD1.4 million).
 
Start of preclinical trials
							Target: certification of an oxygen carrier as a Class III medical product
UPDATE: August 8, 2014
In   order to avoid any misunderstandings we would like to point out that the ethics   commission as part of the Regional Council of Giessen did approve of the   application for the trials. 

Witten, Germany, August 6, 2014
							Together with Excellence Cluster Cardio-Pulmonary System (ECCPS) and TransMIT Gesellschaft für Technologietransfer mbH (TransMIT), Sangui is investigating new therapeutic approaches to treating septic shock and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). 
Owing to their incidence rate, complexity and poor prognosis, the two diseases constitute a huge challenge in both in terms of their socio-economic impact and the associated intensive medical care, and incur unacceptably high mortality rates, despite progress made in intensive medicine. In Germany alone, 150,000 people a year are afflicted by sepsis, and the mortality rate is 30–50% even with maximum therapy. Targeted antibiotic therapy, artificial respiration, preserving the functions of organs, and supporting circulation through liquid infusions and hypertension-inducing drugs form part of an optimised therapy. The infusions of vasoconstrictive substances, such as adrenaline or noradrenaline, are intended to normalise dangerously low blood pressure. Raising the global blood pressure (macrocirculation) is, however, detrimental to the closing of small vessels (microcirculation) whose main task is peripheral oxygen delivery. This lack of oxygen poses a huge problem for many organs, such as the kidneys or intestines.
The approach adopted here by Sangui, ECCPS and TransMIT presupposes that self-perpetuating septic shock, that has so far been highly resistant to treatment, can be interrupted by Sangui's artificial haemoglobin-based oxygen carrier, which would ultimately lower mortality rates. The preclinical trials at ECCPS which are now approved aim to investigate the effect of various haemoglobin preparations on the oxygen supply of a number of organs in septic shock and ARDS models. The research alliance has devised a plan which uses a  preparation similar to Granulox provided by Sangui and will work towards certification as a Class III medical device if the approach proves its worth and is successful.
 
Granulox technology patent now legally binding
Witten, Germany, July 31, 2014
The period for objection against European Patent EP 2550973, „Wound Spray“) elapsed without any objection being raised. The patent, therefore, has now become effective and legally binding. Sangui was notified in this respect by SastoMed GmbH.
The patent expands the existing protection of the wound therapeutic Granulox and additionally safeguards its technology in terms of production as well as in terms of application. In particular, the patent protection now applies to all member countries of the European Union and was extended for another 18 years until the year 2031. SastoMed expects to get the first patents granted resulting from the numerous patent applications filed outside Europe in the course of the coming months.
SastoMed GmbH is a joint venture of SanguiBioTech GmbH (25%) and SanderStrothmann GmbH (75%). It has been granted the global distribution rights as licensee. SanguiBioTech GmbH receives royalties on all product sales and is entitled to a share in all net profits corresponding to its share in the company.
 
SanguiBioTech yields revenues of around USD42,000 in Q4 2014 according to preliminary figures
Witten, Germany, July 29, 2014
According to preliminary, unaudited figures Sangui Biotech International, Inc. yielded revenues from royalties and product sales of USD42,000 in the course of the fourth quarter of its financial year 2014, ended June 30, 2014. In the third quarter (ended March 31, 2014) revenues had amounted to USD29,438; in the fourth quarter of its financial year 2013 (ended June 30, 2013) the company reported revenues of USD24,056. Based on this preliminary state of accounting Sangui will presumably present revenues of more than USD130,000 for its 2014 financial year (FY 2013: USD105,487).
 
Oxygen Supply for Chronic Wounds Meets Enhanced Public Awareness 
							Number of Reports about Successful Treatments with Sangui Developed Hemoglobin Based Wound Spray Keeps Increasing
Witten, Germany, May 26, 2014
Since 2002 Sangui has been pursuing the approach to fight lack of oxygen (hypoxia) as the ultimate cause of the delay in healing of chronic wounds by applying hemoglobin as oxygen carrier. Subsequent to the development of a hemoglobin based wound spray which has undergone numerous successful practical trials there is now an easy to use cost saving therapeutic at hand. Global distribution rights are out licensed to SastoMed GmbH who market the spray under the Granulox brand name (www.granulox.de). Market entry efforts include sensitizing health system, especially wound care practitioners as well as the general public for chronic wound issues, their causes and the additional healing opportunities offered by this new technology.
For the first time now, the topic of care for chronic wounds meets a higher awareness among the German public. Recent media reports in German radio (www.deutschlandfunk.de/schwerpunktthema-chronische-wunden.709.de.html?dram:article_id=285794) and television (www.daserste.de/information/wirtschaft-boerse/plusminus/sendung/ndr/2014/amputationen-100.html and www.ndr.de/fernsehen/sendungen/visite/visite9782.html) show that many patients have not been receiving the sort of systematic treatment which does aim at ultimately relieving them of their painful wounds. On the contrary, the increasing number of amputations indicates that ill-focused  incentives in the health system lead to inappropriate therapies encumbering the patients rather than providing remedy.
On the other hand doctors and institutions who were able to gather experience in applying the wound therapeutic continue to administer it to their patients because of the improved healing successes. At the German Wound Congress held in Bremen, May 7-8, 2014, a wound expert from Nordwest Hospital, Frankfurt, Germany, emphasized that they had already successfully treated more than 400 patients with the hemoglobin based therapeutic.
Experiences like this contribute to the increasing awareness of the topics of hypoxia and oxygen supply among practitioners and scientists. For the first time, they were dedicated a key session at the annual congress of the European Wound Management Association (EWMA, held in Madrid, Mai 14-16, 2014), a topic which was also highlighted by the Organizing Committee in its introductory remarks.

							The hemoglobin wound spray technology was among the topics dealt with during the key session. In the course of the congress as many as eight scientists from different regions presented case studies of successful wound treatments with the hemoglobin based spray. 
The international reach of the wound spray distribution has also increased. Over the past few weeks SastoMed has been able to sign distribution contracts with sales partners in Austria, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Romania and Peru. In total, closed for 26 countries on three continents have now been included in the distribution network, actual sales were initiated in 15 countries so far.
Market entry in each country requires registration by the local authorities, obtaining the Notified Body's approval of the country specific variation as well as the creation of local packaging and documentation. Except for the comprehensive trainings of the respective local sales force held by SastoMed staff members all expenses incurred in the market entry, marketing and sales processes are borne by the local partners. As soon as the required permissions have been granted the product is being presented to relevant opinion leaders in ambulant and stationary wound care practice as well as to the benefactors such as health insurances. This preparatory market entry phase lasts for around one year. It is only then that actual sales can be initiated. This entails that it may take up to three years from signing the distribution contract until a significant revenue stream can be expected in the respective country. The fact that as of now   only one year after the signing of the first international contracts   SastoMed has not only been receiving the usual initial orders but also the first repeat orders may serve as another indicator of the increasing market acceptance of the wound therapeutic and the expectations it raises.
SastoMed is confronted with considerable distributor interest in the few European territories currently not yet covered by distribution agreements. Sangui regards the progress achieved so far as a sound basis for extending the reach of its wound spray technology even further and for its future success also on the financial side.
 
Sangui BioTech announces results of the first nine months of its 2014 financial year
Witten, Germany, May 15, 2014
For the nine months (as of March 31, 2014) of its 2014 financial year Sangui BioTech International, Inc. reports revenues from product sales and royalties in the amount of USD89,741 (9M/2013: USD81,431). In the third quarter (January through March 2014) revenues amounted to USD29,438 (Q3/2013: USD33.388).
Because of the ongoing preparatory work aimed at the in-vitro and animal experiments for internal applications of Sangui's hemoglobin formulations research and development expenses in the nine months of FY2014 amounted to USD139,978 (9M/2013: USD29,736). General and Administrative expenses in the amount of USD1,075,392 (9M/2013: USD885,936) include a non cash effective impairment of a loan as of March 31, 2014. By contrast, the cash outflow from operations was reduced to USD452,192 (9M/2013: USD505,698).
The net loss attributable to shareholders of the parent company came to USD1,257,727 (9M/2013: USD781,253).
The wound therapeutic Granulox the technology of which was developed by Sangui and the global distribution rights of which are licensed to SastoMed GmbH is among the topics of this year's Annual Conference of the European Wound Management Association (May 14 - 16, 2014). Subsequently and in accordance with SastoMed GmbH Sangui will comment on the current development, probably around the end of this month.
 
Sangui, ECCPS and TransMIT start biological in vitro experiments aimed at the characterization of hemoglobin polymers
Witten, Germany, April 25, 2014
Staff members of the Excellence Cluster Cardio-Pulmonary System (ECCPS) have started to carry out in vitro experiments aimed at the biological characterization of Sangui's artificial oxygen carrier (hemoglobin hyperpolymers) in laboratories of Giessen University. Target of the tests are the effects of hemoglobin polymers on the blood pressure in freshly isolated ex vivo perfused and ventilated lungs of mice. Native hemoglobin (positive control) and an aqueous colloid/electrolyte solution without hemoglobin (negative control) will serve as comparison perfusion media. All test batches containing hemoglobin are being produced in the Sangui laboratories in Witten, Germany. SanguiBioTech GmbH scientists are accompanying the test series.
							Native hemoglobin in the blood plasm generates hypertension, as it effects a constriction of the arteries and arterioles of the blood vessel system. This happens because it permeates the endothelium of the vessels, thereunder it binds (and thus removes) a messenger substance that serves to relax the blood vessels. Sangui assumes that the hemoglobin hyperpolymers developed by the company are too big to permeate the vascular endothelium. Therefore, they will not induce hypertension or only to a negligible degree. This property is an important precondition for the successful application of a blood additive. 
							In the meantime TransMIT Gesellschaft für Technologietransfer mbH, which is involved in carrying out the project as co-contractor, has informed SanguiBioTech GmbH that due to changes in the formalities required for the appointment of animal protection officers recently imposed by the district president which had to be adopted beforehand by TransMIT, regrettable delays had occurred in the approval process of the animal tests applied for by Sangui. The district president boards in charge of approvals are expected to consult about the application in the course of the month of May 2014.
 
Revenues slightly improved in the first half of the 2014 financial year
							Research and development for new patent application, preparation of animal test continued
Witten, Germany, February 14, 2014
For the first half (as of December 31, 2013) of its 2014 financial year Sangui BioTech International, Inc. reports revenues from product sales and royalties in the amount of USD60,303 an increase of 25.5% over the revenues in the first half of the financial year 2013. In the second quarter (October through December 2013) revenues amounted to USD33,776 an improvement of 27.3% as compared with the most recent quarter(July through September 2013).
							Research and development expenses amounted to USD107,234 (H1/2013: USD 23,950). The increase is due to the preparations made for filing a new patent application as well as of animal testing aimed at demonstrating the functionality of Sangui's technology with respect to various indications. The net loss attributable to shareholders of the parent company came to USD570,032 (H1/2013: USD665,579), the cash outflow from operations during the six months amounted to USD337,416 (H1/2013: USD266,507).
							As of December 31, 2013, the equity ratio was 59.2% (June 30, 2013: 56.7%).
							In the course of the second quarter the shareholders of SastoMed GmbH resolved to swap the shareholder loans outstanding for equity preserving their respective share in the stock of the company. The resulting obligation to invest another EUR200,000 was fulfilled during the quarter. SanguiBioTech GmbH holds 25% in SastoMed GmbH, Sangui has granted SastoMed the global distribution rights for the wound therapeutic Granulox.
 
Shareholder Letter
Witten, Germany, January 14, 2014
Dear Shareholders, 
Our purpose with this letter is to summarise last year's  highlights and to inform you about some of our most important goals in 2014. 
SastoMed GmbH's management was unswervingly committed to  persuading the dominant operators in the German healthcare market, namely the  GKV, Germany's statutory health insurance funds, to comply with the  regulations. Regrettably, not all health insurance organisations fulfil their  duties in this respect, which has encumbered the economic performance of  Granulox in Germany. The due and proper reimbursement of healthcare benefits by  the GKV in accordance with Germany's Code of Social Law (SGB V) is the most important  pillar which supports the way business is conducted in the healthcare sector.  SastoMed GmbH submitted three legal opinions in total which clearly  substantiate the GKV's reimbursement obligation under the Code of Social Law.  This consists, on the one hand, of the expert assessment of Granulox by the  mandated parties and, on the other, the legal classification derived therefrom.  The GKV in its entirety has been called upon to fulfil its statutory  obligations. Together with SastoMed GmbH, we anticipate that this will happen.  At the same time, the option of taking legal steps as the ultima ratio is also being investigated and will be pursued if  necessary. 
Apart from this, the sale of Granulox, particularly in terms of  international circulation, has made progress. The pace of expansion into other  countries was faster than anticipated: Along with Germany, Granulox will be  available in 18 other countries in 2014, promoted by contracts signed with ten  distributors. 

Strategic  licence agreements were signed with Infirst Healthcare to cover England and  Ireland, with the optional contracts for USA, Canada, Australia and New  Zealand. Infirst has meanwhile commenced preparations for licensing in the USA.  Similar to all the other distribution partners, Infirst bears all the costs  incurred by market entry, which includes the licensing itself.
A  distribution agreement was signed in South America with a company in Colombia.  Other cooperations are at the preparation stage.

In the meantime, we can report licensing agreements for 25  countries in total.

Another gratifying development: As an organisation of the  European commission, the GMDN database has listed Granulox as a dressing and  allocated it a uniform, pan-European code.
In addition, the product portfolio of the SastoMed GmbH joint  venture has been supplemented by two other products, "Dermacyn" for  debridement and and the "Aldanex" decubitus prophylaxis and therapy  which, alongside presenting a more rounded offering for wound care, also  contribute through earnings to the overall performance. 
Lastly, the broad-based recognition of Granulox in the  scientific community and in practice also deserves a mention: 

publication  of a prospective placebo-controlled, randomised and double-blind study in the  peer-reviewed journal "Der Hautarzt" 3/2013, 
international  publication of the same study in the EWMA Journal 10/2013, 
scientific  analysis of the pharmacoeconomic benefit of using Granulox in "Healthcare  Management" 11/2013. 

Michael Sander, SastoMed GmbH's Managing Director, outlines the  goals for the coming year: 

Securing  the eligibility of Granulox for reimbursement in Germany on a broad basis. 
Successful  market launch in European and non-European territories which have been won for  distribution. 
Pursuit  of the expansion strategy through winning additional distributors and licensed  partners: Negotiations for more territories have already reached an advanced  stage. 
Development  of a Granulox Line Extension (launch envisaged for Q1/2015), with storage and  stability tests already initiated. This concerns a new form of administering  Granulox, making it even more flexible and economic for application. 

Developments with patents also deserve a mention: The European  Patents Office granted SastoMed GmbH a European patent (EP 2550973, "Wound  Spray") which significantly extends the current protection of Granulox as  a wound management product in terms of time and place. Furthermore,  SanguiBioTech GmbH has applied for patents which will considerably enlarge the  area of indications for our artificial oxygen carriers. 
The associated resumption of one of the major central projects  of our company is progressing well. With the application to the Ethics  Commission submitted last December, the topic of blood additive and  proof-of-concept studies is proceeding as planned. We anticipate a positive  response to our application over the course of the first quarter of the  calendar year 2014. Animal experiments in the ECCPS laboratories in Giessen  will commence directly afterwards. The study designs have been coordinated with  the partners and completed. We will be investigating shocks arising from sudden  ischemic conditions as indications. The series of experiments on the two  indications selected will be carried out one after the other. As things stand,  results useful to the proof of concept should be available within a period of  around two to three months.

Your active support has made this progress possible. Many  investors have individually reaffirmed their trust in us in the calendar year  2013 and provided us with funds of over € 1 million. We are more than  grateful to you for this. In 2014, our task, as before, will be to create the  prerequisites for ensuring that your commitment pays off. 
Kind regards, 
Thomas Striepe, Hubertus Schmelz, Dr. Joachim Fleing

Witten, Germany, October 14, 2013
							SastoMed GmbH, in which Sangui holds a 25% share, has expanded its product portfolio. Dermacyn is an innovative wound debridement solution, produced by the Petaluma, California, based company Oculus Innovative Sciences. We are excited about this enhancement of SastoMed's business, in the success of which we shall also participate.
Prof. Axel Kramer, a leading German hygienist, analyzed its physiological effectiveness and called it "a revolution and an outstanding alternative to other substances". The fact that the distribution of an internationally successful product like this was entrusted to SastoMed, is a strong indication of how remarkable a reputation SastoMed already enjoys in the market.

Sangui BioTech GmbH and ECCPS commence with studies on curing life-threatening ischemic conditions in the body
							Cooperation agreement signed with TransMIT Gesellschaft für Technologietransfer mbH for the "Excellence Cluster Cardio-Pulmonary System"
Witten, Germany, October 15, 2013
							Sangui BioTech GmbH and Excellence Cluster Cardio-Pulmonary System (ECCPS, www.eccps.de) will be cooperating in developing applications using artificial oxygen carriers, which also includes both eventual drug approval and medical device certification. In the first stage, the ECCPS laboratories based in Giessen will conduct animal testing to demonstrate functionality of Sangui's technology with respect to various indications. A respective application to the Ethics Commission is currently being drafted, the animal test protocols as the guiding scheme of the studies have been finalized already.
During the run-up to the agreement, ECCPS had already submitted a detailed concept for the further development. ECCPS is an organisation set up jointly by the universities of Frankfurt and Giessen together with the Max Planck Institute for Heart and Lung Research in Bad Nauheim. It ranks among the world's leading organisations of this type. This unique centre for translational medicine combines innovative medical research in the field of heart and lung diseases with their practical advancements based on preclinical and clinical studies. Its aim is to work together with industry on developing innovative drugs and substances. TransMIT Gesellschaft für Technologietransfer mbH (www.transmit.de) being the unit in charge of technology transfer at Justus-Liebig University in Giessen is involved in carrying out this project.
Curing oxygen deficiencies in the human body is the primary purpose of Sangui BioTech GmbH's business. Sangui owns numerous patents and patent applications for the production and application of oxygen carriers based on natural haemoglobin. The technologies and applications covered by these patents may be able to secure the supply of oxygen to vital organs despite vasoconstrictions or other insufficiencies, at least temporarily.
"We believe that the deliberations and research results on haemoglobin-based artificial oxygen carriers put forward by Sangui are very promising", said Prof. Dr. Ralph T. Schermuly, head of the ECCPS project team. "If this concept proves its worth the way will be paved for completely new therapeutic approaches to a whole range of application areas, especially for life-threatening conditions, such as shock lung and similarly critical indications. We are very interested in accompanying the process of clinical and regulatory developments through to market maturity."

							Hubertus Schmelz, Managing Director of SanguiBioTech GmbH, emphasised that "in ECCPS, we have gained a partner which has extensive experience and competence in the interface between research and application. Especially given the extremely constructive preliminary work, we anticipate an efficient cooperation in the first steps taken towards preclinical and clinical development."

Wound management specialist dealer will distribute 
							Granulox in Switzerland
							SastoMed GmbH and Agentur Scherrer GmbH sign agreement
Witten, Germany, October 8, 2013
							In Switzerland the wound therapeutic Granulox is going to be distributed by Agentur Scherrer GmbH (http://www.stomocur.ch) located in Weite, canton St. Gallen. The specialist wholesale dealer focused on wound and stoma care products signed an agreement to this effect with SastoMed GmbH, the global licensee for this product.
Agentur Scherrer distributes a wide range of innovative and effective products in the wound, stoma and fistula care segments including products under the Polymem, CUREA and XTRATA brands. Its customer base includes pharmacies, drug stores and users in all Swiss cantons.
Doris Scherrer, General Manager of Agentur Scherrer, explains: „For our business Granulox is more than just another complementation of our wound management product portfolio. Thanks to its proven effectiveness we expect significant attention and demand by patients and medical and care professionals throughout the country.“
„Agentur Scherrer is a well established and successful specialist wholesale dealer the sales network of which embraces all of Switzerland,“ says Michael Sander, the Managing Director of SastoMed. „The agreement with Scherrer gives us access to another interesting market in central Europe. By now Granulox is represented in eleven European and two Latin American countries with a total of around 300 million inhabitants. More agreements covering additional markets are expected to follow suit in due course.“
 
Revenues exceed USD100.000 in the 2013 financial year
							Losses reduced in spite of impairment of notes receivable, indications for increase in sales of wound therapeutic
Witten, Germany, September 27, 2013
							In its financial year 2013 (ended June 30, 2013) Sangui BioTech International, Inc. recorded revenues from product sales and licensing fees in the amount of USD105.487 after USD14.949 in the previous year. The highest annual revenues since 2007 results mainly from royalties on sales of the wound therapeutic Granulox, the distributions rights of which are licensed to the joint venture company SastoMed.
							SastoMed GmbH, in which Sangui holds a stake of 25%, now informed Sangui management, that there are firm indications that the ground breaking efforts of the recent months start to bear fruit. Granulox sales have begun to pick up by the end of the current quarter due to the growing number of international distribution partners on the one hand but also due to an increase in repeat orders in the German home market on the other. So far, distribution agreements have been signed covering eleven European and two South American countries. 
							Nevertheless, as mandated by US GAAP and in the interest of an utmost conservative bookkeeping, the outstanding notes receivable from SastoMed were fully impaired in the financial statements of the Group. Sangui, however, believes that the foreseeable increase in market penetration of the wound spray product will result in the recovery of its investment. This assumption is supported by the ongoing payments of license fees by the joint venture company.
							The impairment contributes in the amount of USD 1.0 million to the net loss after minorities for the period of USD2.1 million (2012 net loss USD3.5 million). The cash outflow from operations of USD0.8 million (2012: USD0.7 million) and from investing activities of USD0.9 million (2012: USD0.7 million) contrasts with a cash inflow ofUSD1.4 million (2012: USD1.6 million). 
							In order to guard the distribution in Mexico from political influence SastoMed GmbH in cooperation with local partners has restructured the sales network to arrive at more efficient processes aimed at a nationwide professional market development. This was also resolved before the backdrop of the fact that a large order announced in December 2012 will not be carried out due to a change of government. Currently, an additional pharmaco-economical expert study is nearing completion which will secure availability in every public hospital throughout all Mexican states. At the same time the product is being presented to all social and health security institutions as well as on the occasion of trade shows and congresses. SastoMed expects this new systematic approach to result in a far reaching and sustainable market penetration.
At the same time, SastoMed GmbH continues to negotiate with potential distribution partners for a number of additional international markets. SastoMed reckons with a significant expansion of the global distribution area in the course of the coming months.
							As could be seen from the recent filing of a new patent application SanguiBioTech GmbH in the meantime is working towards further developing in-vivo-applications of its artificial oxygen carriers.

Sangui BioTech: Start of Granulox-Sales in Greece scheduled for October 31, 2013
Witten, Germany, September 10, 2013
							Ramma Dental SA, Athens, has assumed responsibility for distributing the wound therapeutic Granulox in Greece with immediate effect. A contract to this effect was signed between Ramma Dental and SastoMed GmbH, which holds the global distribution rights as licensee. Actual sales are scheduled to begin on the occasion of the Greek Wound Management Congress on October 31, 2013.
							Established in 1992 by CEO Ioannis Katsiropoulos, Ramma Dental initially specialized in import and distribution of medical products in the fields of surgery and in particular dental surgery („ramma” being the Greek word for suture). Since then the scope of its product portfolio has expanded considerably. Ramma Dental serves as distribution partner for global medical groups such as Johnson & Johnson or Integra Life Sciences. Since 2005 Ramma Dental has also been selling wound care products on behalf of 3M.
							„In our country, the demand for special products for chronic wounds has increased noticeably”, emphasizes Ioannis Katsiropoulos. „Granulox as an innovative and effective wound therapeutic is an important complement of our respective product portfolio. Not only is it unmatched in effectiveness. This effectiveness also helps to reduce treatment costs. We are convinced that it will be highly appreciated by patients suffering from chronic wounds as well as by healthcare professionals.”
							Michael Sander, SastoMed Managing Director, underlines: „Ramma Dental is a well established, yet fast growing distributor. Thanks to its extended customer base ranging from wholesalers to hospitals and to the individual patient our new partner will tap promising sales potential in the Greek market with its almost 11 million inhabitants. We are looking forward to cooperating for the benefit of the patients and of both our enterprises.”

 
Sangui BioTech files comprehensive new patent application significantly expanding the protection of its hemoglobin formulations
Witten, Germany, September 4, 2013
							Sangui BioTech GmbH has filed another patent application with the German Patent Office (DPMA) in Munich; international applications are planned to follow. The patent application is to significantly expand the protection of the hemoglobin formulations developed by Sangui. It will encompass a greater array of ischemic conditions of the human body, for instance in the case of severe dysfunctions of the lung. If the treatment described in the patent application will successfully pass clinical development it can help save human lives in intensive care units bridging the existing gap between high pressure respiration and the costly and high-risk extra-corporeal blood oxygenation  (in the „lung“-section of a life support machine).
							The patent application also protects the option to seek new opportunities for a fast track authorization of hemoglobin formulations aiming at such indications with a high mortality.
 
SanguiBioTech: Wound therapeutic Granulox obtains another 18 years of patent protection for the entire European Union
Witten, Germany, August 13, 2013
							The European Patent Office has granted SastoMed GmbH a European patent (EP 2550973, „Wound Spray“). The patent expands the existing protection of the wound therapeutic Granulox and additionally safeguards its technology in terms of production as well as in terms of application. In particular, the patent protection now applies to all member countries of the European Union and was extended for another 18 years until the year 2031. SastoMed expects a positive decision with regard to the corresponding application for an international patent.
„With the complementary European and international patents we expand the reach of our protection well beyond the current core markets and we double the period of validity as compared with the first patent“, explains SastoMed Managing Director Michael Sander. „This move was carried out in mutual understanding among all partners and within the framework of our agreements. We are experiencing a strong interest in Granulox from numerous different European countries. The territorial and temporal extension of the patent protection is an excellent basis for a sustainable flow of revenues. SastoMed GmbH and its shareholders SanderStrothmann GmbH and SanguiBioTech GmbH will profit significantly from the enhanced revenue and earnings potential. SanguiBioTech as licensor will also be able to capitalize on an increase in royalty volume.“
SastoMed GmbH is a joint venture of SanguiBioTech GmbH (25%) and SanderStrothmann GmbH (75%). It has been granted the global distribution rights as licensee. SanguiBioTech GmbH receives royalties on all product sales and is entitled to a share in all net profits corresponding to its share in the company.

Sangui reports increase in revenue, looking at longer Granulox market entry phase
Witten, Germany, Mai 21, 2013
							In the third quarter of its 2013 financial year Sangui BioTech International, Inc., realized revenues from product sales and royalties of above USD 33,000 (Q3 2012: USD 571). In the first nine months of the financial year revenues amounted to more than USD 81,000 (9M 2012: USD 2,795). This can be derived from the quarterly 10-QSB report published today. Over the nine months the company used cash in operations of approximately USD 500,000 (9M 2012: approx. USD 461,000). It invested almost USD 900,000 of loans in promoting the market entry of its wound therapeutic Granulox (9M 2012: almost USD 667,000). Cash inflow from financing activities amounted to USD 1.27 million (9M 2012: 1.05 million).
							Sangui Director Hubertus Schmelz explained: “A year ago, when Granulox was successfully presented in the market we had hoped for a faster market penetration. We underestimated the inertia of the health system. Today it seems realistic to be prepared for a more extended market entry phase.” As before successful treatments are well received by medical experts and among patients. According to the global licensee the repurchase rate is high. In the next step its focus will be on expanding the number of doctors actually using the wound therapeutic, further stimulating the demand from patients and entering new international markets. 
							A German language independent market research study will be made available on www.sanguibiotech.com today. It covers the wound care market and discusses market entry scenarios.

  
Sangui BioTech: First Step towards a European Granulox Distribution Network
							BiologiQ and SastoMed Agree upon Exclusive Sales Partnership for the  Benelux Countries 
Witten, Germany, April 22, 2013
							The sales  area for Granulox the Sangui developed wound therapeutic is being expanded.  SastoMed GmbH global licensee for the distribution of Granulox has come to a  sales agreement with BiologiQ thus securing the first partner for the planned  European network. The Apeldoorn, Netherlands, based wound management  specialists have been operating successfully in the Benelux markets since 2005  and have already implemented some initial marketing activities. Actual sales  are to be started in summer.
							BiologiQ  and SastoMed are heading for a joint presentation of Granulox on the European  Wound Management Association (EWMA) Congress in Copenhagen in May. That was  agreed upon between Hans Willemsen, BiologiQ General Manager and SastoMed  Managing Director Michael Sander.
							Hans  Willemsen emphasized: “Granulox perfectly matches our strategy to offer the  health system effective and safe products for improved wound healing. Clinical  results and practical experience have convinced us that we are up to expanding  our portfolio by a most promising therapeutic.“
BiologiQ  is an independent Dutch medical company (est. 2005), headquartered in Apeldoorn  (NL), specialized in marketing, sales and distribution of safe and effective  Bio-active and Biotech products and therapies for Wound Care. 
  
Approval of blood additive appears possible, 
							expedient and promising
							Feasibility study available 
Witten, Germany, April 9, 2013
							An approval of Sangui's haemoglobin hyperpolymers as a blood additive appears possible, expedient and promising. This was attested  to by a feasibility study prepared by an expert panel of medics, biologists, application engineers, regulatory experts and patent  lawyers on behalf of SanguiBioTech GmbH. If approved, the product could save the lives of hundreds of thousands of people. It  functions as a carrier supplying oxygen to parts of the body which have an oxygen deficiency due to a narrowing or blocking of the  arteries (arteriosclerotic obstruction): the main cause of stroke, heart attack etc.
							Different options for financing the undertaking, initially until completion of the preclinical studies, are being reviewed,  including the procuring of public funding.  The authors of the study conclude that Sangui's haemoglobin hyperpolymers are superior to the approaches pursued by the  pharmaceuticals sector so far. The study is based on a wide-ranging critical literature review, in-deep database research and  opinions by renowned experts. After extensive scrutiny, which includes competitor approaches, the study affirms the correctness  and resilience of the concepts presented by Sangui. Accordingly, Sangui's haemoglobin hyperpolymers fulfil all the requirements  discussed to date in respect of an oxygen carrying blood additive. The study includes a discussion of two possible indications for  initial approval: acute myocardial infarction (heart attack), on the one hand, and ALI/ARDS, lung damages, on the other, both of  which often lead to death. Both acute emergency indications can be alleviated by introducing the blood additive, giving patients  valuable survival time until basic medical aid can be administered. Also, the severe multiple damages to the body after suffering  such oxygen deficiency can be minimised. 
							After due consideration, the experts initially recommend that approval for ALI/ARDS be sought. These indications have a mortality  rate of 40 percent, causing around 290,000 deaths in total in the USA and in the EU every year. The authors anticipate that  classification as an orphan disease, i.e. as a disease neglected by research, may also be possible. This would fast track the  process. 
							In the event of success, Sangui and its potential partners would tap a market worth billions. Even a slight one-percent market  penetration would yield a high return potential.


Continuous  trading in Sangui shares restored in German markets
							Additional listing on Berlin stock exchange 
Witten, Germany, March 22, 2013
							As of  today, the shares of Sangui BioTech International, Inc. can be traded continuously again on  an additional German stock exchange. Stock broker mwb Fairtrade AG had applied  for a listing on the Berlin stock exchange in addition to the one auction only  trading on the stock Hamburg exchange and the continuous trading on the OTCQB  marketplace. The German share identification number continues to be 906757.


BioTech company Sangui strikes a positive half year balance
							Revenues grow, additional investments in marketing and sales

Witten, Germany, February 15, 2013 -  While daily revenues of the wound therapeutic Granulox grew continuously, Sangui Biotech saw its revenues from product sales and royalties increasing quarter by quarter since the distribution of Granulox started in April 2012. In the first six months of its current financial year they reached almost USD50,000. 
							Increasingly, the wound therapeutic Granulox is the main growth driver. Distribution rights for this product were awarded to SastoMed GmbH by Sangui. Already, Granulox can build upon high satisfaction with patients, excellent awareness among professionals as well as a steady increase of order intake. In a recently published clinical study carried out at the Charles University in Prague (Czech Republic) a significant reduction of wound size was obtained at 97 percent of patients treated with Granulox. Documentations of scientific radiance like this one enable SastoMed to present the benefits of Granulox to patients and medical practitioners in an even more convincing way.
							„We note that all tokens lead to the right direction“, Sangui Director Hubertus Schmelz emphasizes. „Granulox business has gained considerable momentum now which can be derived from the steady increase of incoming orders and revenues. As for the quarters to come we are looking forward to additional growth in Germany and abroad, a development which will meet our unchanged support as shareholders of SastoMed.” 
 

Biotech company Sangui presents 
							Granulox wound  treatment study
							Efficiency of hemoglobin spray exceeds expectations 
Witten, Germany, February 5, 2013 -  Sangui BioTech International, Inc. (symbol: „SGBI“) underpins the efficiency of  its wound therapeutic Granulox with the results of a clinical study carried out  at the Charles University in Prague (Czech Republic). A significant reduction  of wound size was obtained at 97 percent of patients treated with Granulox.
							Positive effects of the hemoglobin spray  Granulox are being made highly evident on a scientific level by the clinical  study of wound healing of patients with venous leg ulcers. The team led by  Prof. Dr. Petr Arenberger of Charles University in Prague (Czech Republic)  observed over 13 weeks how the wound size changed under the influence of  Granulox spray as compared with a treatment with a placebo solution. In 33 of  34 patients treated with hemoglobin spray (97%) a significant reduction of  wound size was observed as compared with the control group. In the group  treated with Granulox pain also decreased significantly while the control group  continued to complain about pain in the wound area. „Based on the good  experiences practitioners persistently make using Granulox we expected to see a  convincing outcome. But the results now presented exceed all expectations,“  Sangui director Hubertus Schmelz said.
							The major areas of indication for  Granulox are chronic wounds resulting in most cases from insufficient oxygen  supply (hypoxia) to the respective part of the body due to restricted blood circulation.  One very frequent origin of this phenomenon is diabetes. Diabetes damages the  vessels leading to circulatory disorder in legs and feet. On a global scale  approximately 37 million cases of treatments of chronic wounds occur every  year. 
						The study appears in Der Hautarzt 2013/3 (Springer Publishing House, Berlin Heidelberg).  Online versions are available for download at the journal itself and at the  PubMed database.
						 



Biotech enterprise Sangui  starts expanding internationally recording large order from Mexico
Witten, Germany, December 21, 2012
							Effective now, Sangui BioTech International, Inc. (Symbol: SGBI ) has its wound therapeutic Granulox being sold in Mexico. Sangui BioTech GmbH has licensed the respective rights to its affiliate SastoMed GmbH. SastoMed is already distributing Granulox in Germany. At the outset of the international expansion a large order could be recorded yielding an expected sales volume of over EUR500,000.
							The largest customer purchasing from the first delivery of Granulox to Mexico is the State of Tamaulipas. Here, governmental health institutions will be equipped with the wound therapeutic. Granulox is being applied as a spray. Main indications are chronic wounds, originating in most cases in lack of oxygen supply (hypoxia) or insufficient blood flow to the respective part of the body. In many cases diabetes is the primary disease. Diabetes affects the blood vessels thus causing circulation disturbances in legs and feet. Around 37 million treatments per annum occur on a global scale. More than one fourth of those are being registered in Latin America. Expansion to Mexico is seen as the first step to addressing this market.
							The expansion shall be promoted based on a contractually agreed cooperation with the Mexico based distribution partner Bio-Mac Pharma the management of which has a track record of successfully supporting the sales of other renowned pharmaceutical companies like Pfizer, Novartis and Schering Plough. 




Most extensive clinical study so far at Karls University in Prague shows:
Granulox has positive influence on healing of leg ulcers
							Results to be published in issue 3/2013 of renowned medical journal
Witten, Germany, December 12, 2012
							A report on the course and results of a comparative clinical study carried out under the direction of professor Petr Arenberger, MD, at the clinic of dermatology at the Karls University in Prague was now accepted for publication. The study aimed to investigate into the influence of a hemoglobin based spray on the healing progress of leg ulcer. Leg ulcer is one the most prolific origins of chronic wounds with a prevalence of about 1.5 million cases p. a. in Germany alone. This was the most extensive clinical study regarding this technology to support wound healing as developed by Sangui. The prospective, randomized and placebo controlled study gave highly significant evidence that there is a clearly positive influence of the hemoglobin spray on wound healing. The eminent efficacy of Granulox (e. g. in patients suffering from leg ulcer) is now documented one more time on the highest scientific level. The entire study including all findings, in particular regarding the improvement of healing times and the reduction of pain experienced by the patients will be published in the 3/2013 issue of „Der Hautarzt“ (Springer Verlag (Heidelberg)). 
							„Der Hautarzt“ enjoys international acceptance and is amply quoted. The journal informs clinical and practising dermatologists on a regular basis of all important developments in all areas of dermatology. Articles are not published unless they have passed a peer review.




Sangui patent for Production of Artificial Oxygen Carriers granted
Witten, Germany, October 17, 2012
							As expected and previously indicated, the European Patent Office has granted a patent based on Sangui’s application (EP 01 945 245): “Mammalian hemoglobin compatible with blood plasma, cross-linked and conjugated with polyalkylene oxides as artificial medical oxygen carriers, production and use thereof”.
							The grant is effective today, October 17, 2012, subsequent to its official publication by the Patent Office.



Sangui and SastoMed Complement Licensing Agreement in View of Increasing Sales Success
Witten, Germany, August 27, 2012
							Sangui BioTech GmbH and SastoMed GmbH cordially adjusted the existing sales strategy as the introduction of Granulox to professional circles proves to be increasingly successful. In consideration of corresponding contributions the existing licensing contract was partially complemented resulting in the following conditions:
							As licensor SanguiBioTech GmbH is awarded a fixed licensing fee as a percentage of each and every external revenues incurred by SastoMed from sales of the Granulox product (based on SastoMed selling prices). The percentage ranges in the uppermost zone of what is usually granted in the pharmaceutical and medical products industries and thus well above the average licensing rate of 7.5% of sales revenues as calculated by market analysts. In addition and complementing this basic agreement the percentage will be permanently increased by one fourth of the current rate as soon as cumulated sales revenues at SastoMed will have exceeded the total of €50,000,000.
							As shareholder SanguiBioTech GmbH will benefit additionally from all future dividends to be paid by the subsidiary according to the percentage of its stake in SastoMed that is at a rate of 25%. Should eventually all the shares of SastoMed GmbH be sold in total to a third party, the existing licensing contract with SanguiBioTech GmbH will persist unchanged.
							„This amendment of our licensing contract“, emphasized Hubertus Schmelz, Managing Director of SanguiBioTech GmbH, „is another token of the close and cordial cooperation based on mutual trust and aiming at our joint success. Our business model proves its worth not least because of the professional and effective work of our partners which meets our support in every respect.”


Over 500 Customers: Granulox Sales Ahead of Planning
							Initial investments will have amortized by 2014 according to SastoMed / 
							Licensing agreement will yield income for Sangui with the beginning of 2013, exponential growth expected
						Witten, Germany, August 13, 2012

						SastoMed GmbH, global licensee of the Sangui patented wound spray, has submitted the announced report covering the first 100 days of Granulox product sales. Its results meet and in some parts considerably exceed the expectations which were directed at the joint venture company by SanguiBioTech GmbH as the licenser. SastoMed assumes that the initial investments will have amortized by 2014. Before that already, Sangui will participate in each Euro of revenue in Germany and abroad and will profit by the considerable growth dynamic.
						The sales strategy is based on an exemplary assessment of the complex health market the accuracy of which is underpinned by the presented sales progress. Until July 31, the sales force had arranged for almost 4,800 meetings and handed over more than 1,000 samples. After no more than 100 days about 500 customers have been registered as actively purchasing the product. With this customer base SastoMed are ahead of planning. In addition, the sales team is present at most conferences, trade shows or workshops dedicated to wound management. The communication with opinion leaders and the expert public will now be complemented by an extensive advertising campaign in the consumer media and the internet. Still, personal contact and practical experience are decisive to convince the users. 
						As had been expected according to the findings of Sangui research and development, impressive documentation of successful wound treatments underline the excellent efficacy of Granulox in everyday health care practice. For some time it had been known among medical researchers that there is a correlation between hypoxia and impeded wound healing. Thanks to its research focus on oxygen Sangui was the first and only company to draw the right conclusions and to develop a hemoglobin based technology which actually and effectively enhances the oxygen supply and thus supports wound therapies.
						The growing dynamics in penetrating the market will even increase further next year according to SastoMed: Overall another 5,000 doctors and 500 hospitals are planned to be gained to regularly administer Granulox in Germany alone. At the same time internationalizing the business will move up on the agenda.
						
						The current positive experiences made in Germany will among others also lead to entrusting the leadership in operating sales in Mexico to SastoMed - for the sake of a consistent market appearance and in accordance with the Mexican partners. In parallel, market entry in Austria, the United Kingdom and Turkey are under preparation. Additional European markets are planned to be addressed in 2014. The international business will be directed by a top marketing and sales manager with international track record. More details will be disclosed after the signing of the final articles of employment.
							Hubertus Schmelz, Managing Director of SanguiBioTech GmbH, was impressed by these preliminary statements: "We at Sangui are particularly proud of the fact that our yearlong focus on this technology was the right move. We are especially glad to obtain such a positive response from competent experts, who confirm our great expectations. And we are delighted to see how many patients now experience the benefits of Granulox treatment. Our strategic decision to transfer marketing and sales of the Sangui developed technology to highly professional partners has proven to be the best possible choice. We support this intense growth course also on the financial side and intend to push-start the international activities. We can foresee that beginning end of this year but increasingly so over the years to come the positive cash flow from the joint venture company will more than justify our decisions."

					Full Description



Sangui Biotech International, Inc., incorporated on July 14, 1995, focuses on the development of pharmaceutical, medical and cosmetic products. The Company develops its products through its German subsidiary, SanguiBioTech AG (Sangui GmbH). The Company is engaged in seeking to market and selling its products through partnerships with industry partners across the world. It focuses on the development of oxygen carriers capable of providing oxygen transport in humans in the event of acute and/or chronic lack of oxygen due to arterial occlusion, anemia or blood loss whether due to surgery, trauma, or other causes, as well as in the case of chronic wounds. It focuses its development and commercialization efforts on such artificial oxygen carriers by reproducing and synthesizing polymers out of native hemoglobin of defined molecular sizes. It offers external applications of oxygen transporters in the medical and cosmetic fields in the form of sprays for the healing of chronic wounds and of gels and emulsions for the regeneration of the skin. It also markets a wound dressing that shows properties in the support of wound healing, which it calls Chitoskin. Its subsidiary, SanguiBioTech GmbH holds distribution rights for these Chitoskin wound pads for the European Union and various other countries. It focuses on selling its existing cosmetics and wound management products through distribution partners, or by way of direct sale, to end users; identifying additional industrial and distribution partners for its patents, production techniques, and products, and obtaining the additional certifications on its products in development.The Company develops various products based on polymers of purified natural porcine hemoglobin with oxygen carrying abilities that are similar to those of native hemoglobin. These are oxygen carrying blood additives, and oxygen carrying blood volume substitutes. SanguiBioTech GmbH offers a medical product aimed at the healing of chronic wounds. Based on its concept of artificial oxygen carriers, its Hemospray wound spray product bridges the watery wound surface and permits an afflux of oxygen to the wound ground.The Company competes with Johnson & Johnson, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Coloplast A/S and BSNmedical.

With SAF Pharma Health Services S.A. (SAF), a powerful partner for the introduction of Granulox in this important territory was won. As was already the case with Zuellig Pharma for Southeast Asia and the MDP Group for Russia, it was also possible to agree with SAF guaranteed minimum purchase commitments for Turkey. In the course of the next five years, SAF will, in line with the anticipated course of the approval and reimbursement procedure, obtain annually increasing minimum volumes with a total volume in the high five-digit range. "With Turkey a further, promising sales region with 78 million inhabitants could be awarded to an ambitious partner. The fact that minimum quantities could be agreed again underscores the confidence of our partners in the successful market launch of Granulox, "says Michael Sander, Managing Director of SastoMed GmbH.  In December, the product approval procedure for Granulox in Kuweit was successfully completed. The product approval is essential for a successful distribution of Granulox. Granulox was therefore approved for the first time in an Islamic state. "This approval demonstrates that the marketing of Granulox is also possible in countries which, due to religious practices, are actually concerned about products containing porcine ingredients. Outstanding performance from clinical and health economical perspective has convinced local authorities and helped overcome limitations. This is an important precedent that supports our efforts in other Muslim countries such as Indonesia, "says Michel Sander. Sangui BioTech International, Inc. ("SGBI") is a holding company the shares of which are being traded on the OTCQB venture stage marketplace for early stage and developing U.S. and international companies (OTCQB: SGBI). Companies are current in their reporting and undergo an annual verification and management certification process. Sangui shares also trade on the OTC markets of Berlin and Hamburg-Hannover stock exchanges (symbol: SBH). Its purpose is to provide financing and access to the capital markets for the enterprises of the Sangui group. SanguiBioTech GmbH is a ninety percent subsidiary of Sangui BioTech International, Inc.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2 - Management's Discussion And Analysis Of Financial Condition And Results Of Operations  Forward-looking Statements  The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this quarterly report. Some of the information in this quarterly report contains forward-looking statements, including statements related to anticipated operating results, margins, growth, financial resources, capital requirements, adequacy of the Company's financial resources, trends in spending on research and development, the development of new markets, the development, regulatory approval, manufacture, distribution, and commercial acceptance of new products, and future product development efforts. Investors are cautioned that forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, which may affect our business and prospects, including but not limited to, the Company's expected need for additional funding and the uncertainty of receiving the additional funding, changes in economic and market conditions, acceptance of our products by the health care and reimbursement communities, new development of competitive products and treatments, administrative and regulatory approval and related considerations, health care legislation and regulation, and other factors discussed in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  GENERAL  Our mission is the development of novel and proprietary pharmaceutical, medical and cosmetic products. We develop our products through our German subsidiary, Sangui GmbH. Currently, we are seeking to market and sell our products through partnerships with industry partners worldwide.  Our focus has been the development of oxygen carriers capable of providing oxygen transport in humans in the event of acute and/or chronic lack of oxygen due to arterial occlusion, anemia or blood loss whether due to surgery, trauma, or other causes, as well as in the case of chronic wounds. We have thus far focused our development and commercialization efforts on such artificial oxygen carriers by reproducing and synthesizing polymers out of native hemoglobin of defined molecular sizes. In addition, we have developed external applications of oxygen transporters in the medical and cosmetic fields in the form of sprays for the healing of chronic wounds and of gels and emulsions for the regeneration of the skin. A wound dressing that shows outstanding properties in the support of wound healing, is distributed by SastoMed GmbH, a former joint venture company in which we held a share of 25%, as global licensee under the Granulox brand name. Effective end of second quarter of our fiscal year 2016 we sold this stake to SanderStrohmann GmbH.  SanguiBioTech GmbH holds distribution rights for our Chitoskin wound pads for the European Union and various other countries. A European patent has been granted for the production and use of improved Chitoskin wound pads.  Our current key business focuses are: (a) selling our existing cosmetics and wound management products by way of licensing through distribution partners, or by way of direct sale, to end users; (b) identifying additional industrial and distribution partners for our patents, production techniques, and products; and,  Artificial Oxygen Carriers  SanguiBioTech GmbH develops several products based on polymers of purified natural porcine hemoglobin with oxygen carrying abilities that are similar to native hemoglobin. These are (1) oxygen carrying blood additives and (2) oxygen carrying blood volume substitutes.  During the first quarter of our 2013 financial year the European Patent Office granted a patent based on Sangui's application (01 945 245) "Mammalian hemoglobin compatible with blood plasma, cross-linked and conjugated with polyalkylene oxides as artificial medical oxygen carriers, production and use thereof".  During the third quarter of our 2013 financial year the company had a feasibility study prepared by external experts inquiring into market potentials and further preclinical and clinical development requirements. The study came to the conclusion that an approval of Sangui's hemoglobin hyperpolymers as a blood additive appears possible, expedient and promising.  During the fourth quarter of our 2014 financial year the company filed a patent application aimed at significantly expanding the protection of our hemoglobin formulations. It will encompass a greater array of ischemic conditions of the human body, for instance in the case of severe dysfunctions of the lung.  During the first quarter of our 2015 financial year, we began together with Excellence Cluster Cardio-Pulmonary System (ECCPS) and TransMIT Gesellschaft f�r Technologietransfer mbH (TransMIT) to investigate therapeutic approaches to treating septic shock and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The approach adopted here by Sangui, ECCPS and TransMIT presupposes that self-perpetuating septic shock, that has so far been highly resistant to treatment, can be interrupted by Sangui's artificial haemoglobin-based oxygen carrier, which would ultimately lower mortality rates. The preclinical trials commenced at ECCPS investigate the effect of various haemoglobin preparations on the oxygen supply of a number of organs in septic shock models and ARDS.  Also during the first quarter of our financial year 2015 we were notified that the period for objection against European Patent EP 2550973,Wound Spray") elapsed without any objection being raised. The patent, therefore, has become effective and legally binding.  During the second quarter of our 2015 financial year the first phase of preclinical trials was concluded successfully. It could be demonstrated that applying an oxygen-carrying liquid (the hemoglobin hyperpolymer formulation SBT102) in the abdomen did significantly improve the oxygen supply to the intestines. The restoration of intestinal oxygenation will have an impact on tissue integrity and ultimately on patient survival.  During the third quarter of our 2015 financial year the preclinical trials were concluded successfully, the final results did fully confirm the interim results obtained in the second quarter.  According to regulatory requirements, all drugs must complete preclinical and clinical trials before approval (e.g. Federal Drug Administration approval) and market launch. The Company's management believes that the European and FDA approval process will take at a minimum several years to complete.  Our most promising potential product in the area of artificial oxygen carriers, the blood additive is still in an early development stage. In the pursuit of these projects we will need to obtain substantial additional capital to continue their development.  The blood additives project was halted in the second quarter of our financial year 2016 due to the lack of financing the further authorization.  Nano Formulations for the Regeneration of the Skin  Healthy skin is supplied with oxygen both from the inside as well as through diffusion from the outside. A lack of oxygen will cause degenerative alterations, ranging from premature aging, to surface damage, and even as extensive as causing open wounds. The cause for the lack of oxygen may be a part of the normal aging process, but it may also be caused by burns, radiation, trauma, or a medical condition. Impairment of the blood flow, for example caused by diabetes mellitus or by chronic venous insufficiency, can also lead to insufficient oxygen supply and the resulting skin damage.  Sales of this series have remained at a low level. During the first quarter of the 2016 financial year we decided to decrease our operations in this particular segment and to abandon the patent protection for this range of products.  Chitoskin Wound Pads  Usually, normal ("primary") wounds tend to heal over a couple of days without leaving scars following a certain sequence of phases. Burns and certain diseases impede the normal wound healing process, resulting in large, hardly healing ("secondary") wounds which only close by growing new tissue from the bottom. Wound dressings serve to safeguard the wound with its highly sensitive new granulation tissue from mechanical damage as well as from infection. Using the natural polymer chitosan, Sangui's Chitoskin wound dressings show outstanding properties in supporting wound healing.  It is the strategy of the company to find industry partners ready to acquire or license this product range as a whole.  Hemospray Wound Spray  SanguiBioTech GmbH has developed a novel medical technology supporting the healing of chronic wounds. Lack of oxygen supply to the cells in the wound ground is the main reason why those wounds lose their genuine healing power. Based on its concept of artificial oxygen carriers, our wound spray product bridges the watery wound surface and permits an enhanced afflux of oxygen to the wound ground.  In December 2010, SanguiBioTech GmbH established SastoMed GmbH, a joint venture company with SanderStrothmann GmbH of Georgsmarienh�tte, Germany. SanguiBioTech GmbH has granted SastoMed GmbH global distribution rights. SastoMed GmbH started to distribute the product in Germany after having obtained the CE mark authorizing the distribution of the wound spray in the countries of the European Union in April 2012.  As licensor SanguiBioTech GmbH is awarded a fixed licensing fee as a percentage of each and every external revenues incurred by SastoMed from sales of the Granulox product (based on SastoMed selling prices). The percentage ranges in the uppermost zone of what is usually granted in the pharmaceutical and medical products industries and thus well above the average licensing rate of 7.5% of sales revenues as calculated by market analysts. In addition and complementing this basic agreement the percentage will be permanently increased by one fourth of the current rate as soon as cumulated sales revenues at SastoMed will have exceeded the total of ?50,000,000.  In September 2011, the Mexican Health Authorities registered the entire current range of Sangui developed wound management products and thus granted the authorization to apply and sell these products on a nationwide level.  On April 5, 2012, SastoMed GmbH notified SanguiBioTech GmbH that the wound spray product was granted a certification as class III medical product. The CE mark according to sections 6 and 7 of the German Medical Devices Act authorizes production, distribution and sales of the product in all member countries of the European Union. According to SastoMed GmbH, sales of the product under the brand name "Granulox" started in Germany on April 16, 2012, other markets will be addressed in due course.  In August, 2012, Sangui BioTech GmbH and SastoMed GmbH cordially adjusted the existing sales strategy. In consideration of corresponding contributions the existing licensing contract was partially complemented resulting in the following conditions: As licensor SanguiBioTech GmbH is awarded a fixed licensing fee as a percentage of each and every external revenues incurred by SastoMed from sales of the Granulox product (based on SastoMed selling prices). The percentage ranges in the uppermost zone of what is usually granted in the pharmaceutical and medical products industries. In addition and complementing this basic agreement the percentage will be permanently increased by one fourth of the current rate as soon as cumulated sales revenues at SastoMed will have exceeded the total of ?50,000,000.  In December, 2012, actual distribution of the product was initiated in Mexico under the management of SastoMed GmbH and their local distribution partner Bio-Mac Pharma. International distribution has been expanded since then through cooperation agreements with local distribution partners in the Benelux countries and South Eastern Europe.  In May, 2013, the Company declared in the course of the filing of its nine month report on form 10-QSB that according to information provided by SastoMed GmbH it now expects the Granulox market entry phase to last longer than initially expected. No assurance can be given that based on royalty revenues the Company may reach break-even in the course of its current financial year.  Since December 2013, international distribution outside Germany was initiated in collaboration with local partners in more than 40 countries in Europe and Latin American.  Effective December 31, 2015 Sangui BioTech GmbH sold its stake in Sastomed GmbH of 25% to SanderStrohmann GmbH . Also effective December 31, 2015 SanderStrohmann GmbH increased the nominal capital of Sastomed GmbH for an amount of Euro 500,000 to strengthen the capital base of Sastomed GmbH.  It has to be noted, however, that Granulox sales by our distribution partner SastoMed GmbH have become more volatile and declining from time to time. We remain confident, however, that SastoMed will be able to considerably increase its sales along with more international markets entering actual distribution of the product.  FINANCIAL POSITION  During the six months ended December 31, 2016, our total assets increased $55,419 from $110,419 at June 30, 2016 to $165,838 at December 31, 2016. An increase in the cash on hand from June 30 2016, to December 31, 2016, of $46,055 was primarily responsible for the increase in the total assets.  We funded our operations primarily through our existing cash reserves and cash received from the issuance of shares of common stock. Our stockholders' equity (deficit) decreased by $24,242 from ($247,566) at June 30, 2016 to ($223,324) at December 31, 2016. The primary factor behind this was due to the issuance of stock for cash and services for $243,570, and an increase to accumulated deficit of $209,117 as well as an increase in accumulated other comprehensive income due to movements in the foreign exchange rate.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  For the three-month and six-month period ended December 31, 2016 and 2015:  REVENUES - Revenues reported were $25,797 and $15,383 for the three months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 respectively. For the six months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 revenues were $35,508 and $26,854. Revenues increased by $10,412 and $8,652 for the three and for the six months ended December 31, 2016. The increase of $8,652 from the revenues in the comparable period of our 2016 financial year can be traced back to a increase in royalties from the licensing agreement with SastoMed GmbH. Cost of sales in the first quarter were $376 and $144 for the three months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 respectively. Cost of sales for the first six months (first and second quarters of the 2017 financial year) amounted to $658 compared to $229 for the years ended 2016 and 2015.  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT - Research and development expenses increased by $2,453 to $3,908 from $1.455 for the three periods ending December 31, 2016 and 2015. Research and development expenses decreased $27,179 to approximately $8,328 in the first half-year of our 2017 financial year from approximately $35,507 in the comparable period of the previous year. This decrease is mainly attributed to lower R&D expenses after the conclusion of the animal tests of our hemoglobin hyperpolymers. The company has no plans to start activities in this area within the near future again.  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE and PROFESSIONAL FEES - For the three months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 the combined general and administrative expenses and professional fees increased by $68,285 from $101,950. Accumulated general and administrative expenses and professional fees increased $4,427 to approximately $245,137 in the half-year ended December 31, 2016, from approximately $240,710 in the respective period of the previous year, mainly due to costs for legal advice occurred during the three month period.  INTEREST EXPENSE - interest expenses for the three-month period ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were $1,053 and $14,926, a decrease of $13,873. For the six months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, interest expense decreased by $13,492 to $2,835 from $16,327.  NET LOSS - As a result of the above factors, the net loss attributed to common shareholders increased to a loss of $(141,217) compared to a loss of $(89,858) for the three months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 respectively and a loss of $(209,117) compared to a loss of $(240,186) for the six month ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 respectively . The loss per share for both periods was $(0.00).  Our consolidated net loss before non-controlling interest was $(149,775), or $(0.00) per common share, for the three months ended December 31, 2016, compared to $(96,012) or $(0.00) per common share, during the comparable period in our 2015 financial year. Our consolidated net loss before non-controlling interest was $(221,450), or $(0.00) per common share, for the six months ended December 31, 2016, compared to $(258, 839) or $(0.00) per common share, during the comparable period in our 2015 financial year.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  For the six months ended December 31, 2016, net cash used in operating activities decreased $3,739 to $186,212, compared to $189,951 in the corresponding period of the previous year mainly due to the decrease of the operating loss of approximately $39,000 from a loss of $(258,839) in 2015 to a loss of $(221,450) in 2016; refunds and receivables which decreased from 2015 to 2016 yielding a reduction in cash flow of about $20,000 and a net decrease in accounts payable and related party obligations of approximately $(30,000).  We had a working capital deficit of approximately $236,440 at December 31, 2016, a decrease of approximately $11,126 from June 30, 2016.  At December 31, 2016 compared to June 30, 2016, we had cash of $116,129 compared to $70,074, prepaid expenses of $30,297 compared to $30,292 and accounts receivable of $644 compared $504. We will need substantial additional funding to fulfill our business plan and we intend to explore financing sources for our future development activities. No assurance can be given that these efforts will be successful.  Feb 22, 2017  (c) 1995-2017 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc. All Rights Reserved

This is the most exciting time in the history of medicine. Millions of people around the world are benefiting from breakthrough treatments that save, extend and improve life.
Research, technology and genomics are coming together to create a platform that allows researchers to decipher the cause of disease as never before. Each advance opens new doors, new cures, new treatments.
And yet, it’s not enough.
"Today's breakthroughs become tomorrow's medicines." Tweet
Cures don’t appear on a schedule. In search of the unknowable, in search of curing the incurable, there is no one map, no singular template, no predictable milestones.
Finding lifesaving medicines is a life’s work – the work of thousands of researchers who never say never. It's also the work of millions of patients who fight side by side with researchers in the battle for life, against whatever odds they face together.
Now is the time to put the accelerator to the floor. The best is yet to come – like groundbreaking advances in immunotherapy and personalized medicine – where the once impossible is now reality.
Welcome to the future of medicine. Where disease is no match for tenacity. No match for ingenuity. Where together, we go boldly.
Dylan Thomas penned "Do not go gentle into that good night" in 1947, but the sentiment is as timely today as it ever was. Millions of Americans are battling serious illnesses, but they’re not alone in the fight. They have the support of thousands of biopharmaceutical researchers whose lives are dedicated to helping patients go boldly into longer, healthier, and more productive lives.

A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER 

















A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER

It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer. But what was once the fruit of a wild imagination is today a reality.
Rather than killing cancer cells directly with traditional approaches like radiation or chemotherapy, immunotherapy harnesses the immune system’s power to eliminate the cancer or slow its growth and ability to spread. Research shows immunotherapy is improving outcomes and survival rates for some patients, including kidney and lung cancer. In fact, research from the American Association for Cancer Research shows that for advanced-melanoma patients, survival rates are improving thanks in part to these new treatment options.
"It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer." Tweet
Biopharmaceutical researchers are urgently working to gain new insights into the complex interactions between patients’ immune systems and the cancer cells growing in their bodies with the goal of markedly improving outcomes in more tumor types.
With 836 medicines and vaccines in development for cancer, 80 percent of which have the potential to be first-in-class treatments, millions of Americans living with cancer have hope for a brighter future.
Welcome to the new era of medicine.
For all of us.

We cannot take progress for granted

















We cannot take progress for granted

We are in a new era of medical discovery and have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of costly and debilitating diseases. But we must not take this progress for granted.  To ensure medical innovation continues for the benefit of patients we need public policies that reward the investment and time it takes to develop life-saving treatments and cures.
In order to enhance competition and improve affordability for patients, our country must:
1)    Make medicines more affordable by rewarding value
 Today, America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies are partnering with health insurers to improve how we pay for medicines. Prices for medicines may vary based on how well an individual responds to treatment, or agreements may lower co-pays if patients achieve better health outcomes. While these partnerships will vary, they are helping to ensure we get the right medicine to the right patient at the right time – improving care and lowering costs across the health care system.
Yet, outdated regulations prevent wider use of these new payment arrangements.  Government rules and regulations should not prevent the private sector from developing better ways to pay for medicines. Rather, we must ensure health plans can cover more of the newest medicines and give patients more choices – improving care and lowering health care costs for Americans.
2)    Ensure patients get the best deal on medicines
America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies often negotiate large rebates for prescription medicines with insurers and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs). Those rebates are growing every year and now exceed $100 billion per year – helping to hold down health care costs for patients and taxpayers.
But we can do more to ensure patients benefit directly from these negotiated savings, and put an end to an unfair practice that requires patients to buy medicines at full price, even when their insurers get a rebate. In fact, patients with large deductibles can end up paying more than their insurer pays for their medicine.  That’s wrong. Health insurance companies should share with patients the discounts they receive. This could lower out-of-pocket costs for some patients by hundreds – if not thousands – of dollars every year.
3)    Make new breakthroughs accessible, and promote competition
We need to make it make it easier for patients to get access to breakthrough medicines. It simply takes too long to get new medicines approved – over 10 years and over one billion dollars, on average.  Outdated regulations and approaches for evaluating drugs can slow things down even more. To get medicines approved faster, while ensuring safety, we need to modernize the FDA with new technologies and expertise to keep up with 21st century science. Modernizing the FDA will bring down the time and cost of developing new medicines, which will bring medicines to patients faster, and enhance competition in the market.
We also need to reduce the backlog of applications for generic medicines at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  This will ensure that patients benefit as less expensive generic medicines replace higher cost treatments that have lost patent protection. 
At the same time, we must avoid policies that deter risk-taking or siphon funding away from the research and development of new medicines for patients. Learn more about our plan to build a sustainable, science-based health care system that harnesses today’s hopes to discover tomorrow’s cures here.

Finding lifesaving medicines is a life's work – the work of 140,000 researchers who never say never. As well as the millions of patients who fight side by side with researchers in the battle for life, against whatever odds they face together.
Now is the time to put the accelerator to the floor. The best is yet to come – like advancements in personalized medicine and immunotherapy – and it's coming faster than we can imagine.
Welcome to the future of medicine. Where disease is no match for tenacity. No match for ingenuity. Where together, we go boldly.
DO NOT GO GENTLE
Today's breakthroughs are becoming tomorrow's medicines.

PhRMA’s member companies are on the leading edge of personalized medicine development– an area that is transforming health care, improving patient outcomes and creating health system efficiencies. In a new video, Dr. Bernie Zeiher, president of development of Astellas, discusses his excitement around the promise of personalized medicine, which uses diagnostic tools to help assess the medical treatments and procedures that may be best for each patient.
“I am very optimistic about the future because the promise of personalized medicine has begun to be seen,” Dr. Zeiher says in the video. “Now, with more personalized-type therapies, you can test the tumor or test the blood to determine that in fact the person has a particular mutation, and then that will guide which therapy you would choose and it also increases the likelihood that the patient will respond.”
Dr. Zeiher’s enthusiasm reflects the commitment of America’s biopharmaceutical companies to the development of these targeted treatments. Although there were only 13 FDA-approved personalized medicines in 2006, today there are more than 140. Additionally, personalized medicines accounted for more than 25 percent of FDA approvals last year, marking a record year for these innovative therapies.
Cancer is an area where personalized medicines are having a particularly big impact, driving tremendous advances for patients with highly aggressive cancers, like non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In fact, research has shown nearly two-thirds of NSLCs have a genetic mutation that can be more effectively targeted with a personalized medicine.
Thanks to the hard work of biopharmaceutical researchers, like Dr. Zeiher, 42 percent of medications currently in the pipeline have the potential to be personalized. While the science has never been more complex, the future of research is bright with personalized medicine becoming a reality.

World's best overall value for natural products!


                        Since 1996, iHerb has made great efforts to enhance your online shopping experience.  Initially, our
                        company promoted the benefits of St. John's Wort; hence the name: iHerb.  We carry one of the
                        largest selections of high-quality natural products at the best overall value.  Consider iHerb your own
                        California-based natural products store!
                    










Top 10 reasons to make iHerb your number one choice!




1. Shop directly and save!

            iHerb.com is one of the world's largest online stores for natural products.
            We have been in business since 1996 and have two distribution centers, based
            in California and Kentucky.
        

            Browse our site and you'll find over 1,200 brands and 35,000 brand name products that you may also find at health food stores and natural
            pharmacies -- with one important difference: Our prices are typically 30 - 40% less. Also, don't forget to check our  Specials page for
            additional discounts on some best-selling products.
        


2. Free or discounted shipping

            Every iHerb order is eligible to receive discounted or free shipping! In general, the more products you add to your cart, the greater the likelihood that you will receive free shipping. In some cases you’ll even find that ordering one product alone may result in free shipping. We encourage you to experiment with different product combinations in order to find the best value, and share your cart with others! iHerb is the world's leader in bringing the best overall value in natural products to its customers.
        


3. Honest customer product reviews

            Unlike retailers that display third-party reviews, all of our reviews are written by iHerb customers. In order to write a review, you must
            have ordered the product from iHerb first. This means you receive honest and candid reviews, thereby helping you make a smarter buying decision.
        


4. Assurance of freshness with expiration dates

            Because we have one of the highest product turnover rates in the industry, iHerb is able to offer you the FRESHEST products possible!
            Our inventory turnover rate averages to 8.1 times per year; among the highest turnover rates, if not the highest, in our industry. This means that iHerb products are on the shelf an average of only 45 days!
        

            Plus, most products we carry have expiration or best-by dates, which can be accessed on the product page. It's like holding the real bottle or package in your hand, as you would in a typical "brick and mortar" store.
        


5. Air-conditioned, super clean warehouses

            iHerb’s distribution centers  are entirely climate-controlled, which protects the products from such conditions as humidity, heat and cold. This level of quality control is employed by iHerb to ensure product effectiveness for the customer.
            In addition, our distribution centers are industry certified by NSF International, earning Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) certification.
        


6. Solid personal privacy commitment

            Personal privacy is critically important to us. Since 1996, iHerb has never sold, leased or shared any customer information with third parties. Your personal information remains entirely confidential.
        


7. Enhanced 256-bit encryption with tokenization

            Simply put, we only store the last 4 digits and the expiration date of your credit card, so you can identify what card you are using.
        


8. 24 hour/7 day customer service

            One of the ways iHerb can offer such low prices is by automating the whole ordering process. While our customer service agents don't
            actually take orders, they do offer live  customer support from our California facility, 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. (Pacific Time), Monday - Friday.
            We are also reachable 24 hours per day, 7 days per week, by chat and email to answer questions and resolve issues with your order. Of course,
            nobody's perfect. We may get quite busy at times and we ask for a little patience. We'll do our best to take care of things promptly, efficiently
            and courteously -- this is what our customers deserve!
        


9. Save even more by helping others save!

            As an iHerb customer, share your favorite iHerb products or categories, or even a shopping cart containing multiple products with others via simple Rewards links, and you will save even more!



10. A greener way to shop

            When you shop with us, you're part of a global solution. iHerb uses 100% post-consumer recycled paper for 90% of all shipping boxes. Our bubble wrap is 40% recyclable, and we recycle virtually all packing materials received 
            from manufacturers. All in the interest of a healthier, more sustainable planet!  Read more.

Q:
Why do airplanes take longer to fly west than east?


A:
Airplanes take longer to fly west than east because of high-altitude winds that blow from west to east. The Earth has four such wind patterns, and they are called jet streams. When planes fly from west to east, the jet stream helps accelerate the aircraft. When they fly in the opposite direction, the planes cannot fly as fast into the face of the wind.

Q:
What happens if you put too much coolant in a car?


A:
The buildup of pressure caused by adding too much coolant to a car can cause the rupturing of hoses, internal pipes and even the radiator. When coolant is added to a car, it is cold, however, while the engine is running, the liquid starts to expand, causing a buildup of pressure. If the radiator is too full, this buildup of pressure is often too great for the internal workings of the car.
