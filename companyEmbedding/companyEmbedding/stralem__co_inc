Despite sub-par U.S. economic growth, equity valuations at near record highs, and domestic and geo-political uncertainty, the U.S. equity market continues to climb.

THE INVESTMENT STRATEGY
Stralem manages one strategy, the US Large Cap Equity StrategyTM (LCES),  a long-only conservative growth strategy, fully invested in large-capitalization US equities. The strategy  looks at the market in light of the belief that there are four 
                                types of market environments: two types of bull markets and two types of bear markets, each  characterized by momentum and valuation factors. 
                                By adapting portfolio construction to changing market environments, the philosophy has led to skillfully navigating the full market cycle.

What are analysts saying about Pfizer stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about Pfizer stock: 
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "Pfizer has been working on strengthening its product portfolio as well as key pipeline milestones through acquisitions and licensing deals. New products like Ibrance and contribution from acquisitions are expected to drive revenues. Also, cost-savings and share buybacks should help Pfizer achieve its earnings guidance. Investor focus will remain on the stock as Pfizer has several key pipeline milestones in 2017. However, genericization of key drugs, lost alliance revenues, pricing pressure and rising competition remain potent headwinds. Mounting competition in the immuno-oncology market is also a significant concern. Meanwhile, Pfizer’s shares have underperformed the large-cap pharma industry this year so far. The company has a mixed record of earnings surprises in recent quarters. Estimates have remained stable ahead of its Q2 earnings release. " (7/14/2017)
2. BMO Capital Markets analysts commented, "We are highly confident the deal will close as the purchase agreement removes IP risk and development risks, and creates significant shareholder value. We believe there is minimal risk for the deal being blocked due to anti-trust considerations CTP-543 Phase IIa initiated with top-line results expected 1Q18. The phase IIa trial will enroll approximately 100 patients spread across 4 active arms of differing doses (4, 8, 12 and 16 mg BID) and a placebo comparator. The primary endpoint for the trial will be measured using the severity of alopecia tool (SALT) after patients undergo 24 weeks of dosing. An additional 28 weeks of dosing of CTP-543 is planned for all patients enrolled in the study. If successfully developed, we anticipate a significant pricing discount for CTP-543 relative to Jakafi – owned by Incyte (INCY, Non-Rated). The earlier delay to initiate the trial due to clinical supply delays, which lasted around 2 months, has been resolved." (4/27/2017)
3. UBS AG analysts commented, " The FDA approved Novartis' CDK4/6 agent, Kisqali (ribociclib), in first-line treatment for HR+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer in combo with any aromatase inhibitor. Recall that MONALEESA-2 was stopped early, and while interim data demonstrated a reduction in risk of disease progression or death by 44% over letrozole alone, the mPFS had not been reached at the time. For the first time, the label presented a mPFS of 25.3 mos for Kisqali + letrozole vs 16 mos for letrozole alone. The 9.3 mos improvement over letrozole is essentially comparable to 10.3 mos improvement (24.8 mos for Ibrance vs 14.5 mos for letrozole) for Pfizer's Ibrance. Given the strong interim data that were comparable to Ibrance, we believe the approval of Kisqali was largely expected. Our takeaway: Label looks a little worse than Ibrance. Overall, we think the label looks slightly worse, particularly on safety. On the positive, the label is broader, as the indication is for use of Kisqali in combo with anyaromatase inhibitors (vs Ibrance in combo with letrozole). However, as the vast majority of first-line use letrozole, the broader label shouldn't meaningfully impact Ibrance, in our view. We're not clear on how Kisqali got the broader label, but we think this could be encouraging for Ibrance, as the Ibrance label could also become as broad with the potential April approval of the confirmatory Phase 3 PALOMA-2 (Ibrance was approved under an accelerated pathway with Phase 2 PALOMA-1 data). On safety, the Kisqali label warns of QT prolongation and liver tox, which are not in the Ibrance label. We think the QT issue could put Kisqali at a disadvantage. Thoughts on the stock: Shouldn't impact the stock much, if anyIbrance has been on the market for ~2 years and has made significant headway to becoming a standard of therapy, and we do not believe there was anything in the Kisqali label that would meaningfully impact the significant lead that Pfizer has. In our CDK4/6 model, we assign a 5% share for Kisqali in 2017 that goes to 15%, 18%, and 20% in 2018-2020E." (3/14/2017)
4. Jefferies Group LLC analysts commented, "We wanted to highlight a key data catalyst in which a positive outcome can drive shares higher: PIIa data for XEN801 for mod-to-severe acne in the latter part of Q1 (JEF est: ~Mar). We continue to like the risk/reward going into the data, especially on the heels of Dermira’s positive PIIb data for DRM01, which operates on the same pathway but more upstream. Reiterating Buy and $13 PT. Highlighting Key PIIa Data Catalyst in Latter Part of Q1: We wanted to take the opportunity to highlight a key data catalyst in which a positive outcome can drive shares higher: topline PIIa data catalyst for XEN801 for moderate-to-severe acne in the latter part of Q1 (JEF estimate: ~Mar). We previously conducted a review on XEN801 in April ’16, which can be found here, and now that the data catalyst is drawing near, we wanted to take the chance to highlight it again. To recap, the PIIa trial is a randomized, double- blind, multicentre, vehicle-controlled trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of patients with moderate-to-severe acne. The trial will compare XEN801 topical gel (1%) and matching placebo gel for 12 weeks with a 4-week follow-up. XENE has randomized 165 patients (v. 150 that was planned at conception), and has 85% power (v. 80% previously) to detect a ~16% difference." (1/19/2017)

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 1 Sell Rating, 9 Hold Ratings, 9 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Hold (Score: 2.42)Consensus Price Target: $38.00 (15.15% upside)

In An Aging Bull Market Don't Slam the Brakes, 
Proceed With Caution
The  market goes up over time, but not all the time. That's been easy to forget over  the past eight years. When bull markets get long in the tooth like the current  one, times get tough for investors who lean toward caution.

An investor should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Fund carefully before investing. Click here for a  Prospectus/Summary Prospectus, which contains this and other important information, or call 866-822-9555. Please read the prospectus carefully before investing. The Fund may not be suitable for all investors. 
*As of 6/30/17,  Morningstar rating of 3 stars overall, 3, 2 and 4 stars (STEFX)  for the three-, five- and ten-year periods among 1,223, 1,223, 1,080 and 802 large blend funds, respectively. The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three- year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.
