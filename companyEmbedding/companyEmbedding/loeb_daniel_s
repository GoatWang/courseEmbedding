LONDON — Over the past two decades, the hedge fund mogul Daniel S. Loeb has established himself as one of the biggest activist investors around. Now, he has set his sights on one of Europe’s largest corporate citizens: Nestlé, the global food giant.In a letter to investors sent on Sunday, his Third Point hedge fund argued that Nestlé, a Swiss conglomerate whose wares range from candy to baby food to pet food, should sell its stake in L’Oréal and sell off nonessential operations as part of a broad shake-up.It is the latest ambitious move by an activist investor to rattle the leaders of the corporate world. Flush with cash, these funds have taken stakes in ever-bigger companies, hoping to goad them into selling themselves or breaking themselves up to improve their stock prices.


            How Nestlé Makes Its Money        

            Nestlé’s products include candy, water, dairy and pet food, though its candy business has waned, especially as fewer Americans have displayed an appetite for sweets.

Jana Partners, for instance, prodded change at Whole Foods Market. This month, that grocery store chain announced that it was selling itself to Amazon for $13.4 billion. And Trian Fund Management took a $3.5 billion stake in Procter & Gamble, a consumer products behemoth that has sought a way to improve stagnant sales. Continue reading the main story

Third Point disclosed that it owned about 40 million shares in Nestlé, a stake that amounts to about $3.5 billion in stock. That would make the hedge fund the Swiss company’s sixth-largest shareholder, according to Standard & Poor’s Global Market Intelligence.

Behind Third Point’s investment in Nestlé is a conviction that the company must do more to reshape its product portfolio and adapt to changing consumer tastes and competition from smaller, local brands. The hedge fund argued that the company’s earnings per share figure had not meaningfully improved over the last five years.Shares in Nestlé have risen nearly 15 percent over the last 12 months, trailing those of its fellow consumer conglomerate Unilever but outpacing those of other food companies like Mondelez and Kraft Heinz.

            Third Point said Nestle should sell off nonessential operations. This is what it does.        




 



“Third Point invested in Nestlé because we recognized a familiar set of conditions that make it ripe for improvement and change,” the hedge fund wrote in its investor letter. “It is rare to find a business of Nestlé’s quality with so many avenues for improvement.”A representative for Nestlé was not available for comment.Third Point said it was encouraged by Nestlé’s announcement this month that it was weighing the sale of its American candy business, which produces stalwart sweets like Butterfingers and Gobstoppers.But the hedge fund argued that Nestlé should also sell its 23 percent stake in L’Oréal, the big cosmetics maker whose products include its namesake beauty brand and luxury products like Kiehl’s. The fund argued that the holding was nonstrategic and could be sold off without incurring huge taxes.In a change from previous investments, in which Mr. Loeb was known for his venomous attacks on the chief executives of the targeted companies, Third Point has praised Nestlé’s leader, Ulf Mark Schneider. The hedge fund pointed positively to his earlier tenure at the German medical supply company Fresenius. But to succeed at Nestlé, the hedge fund argued, he needs to present a bold strategy that would overhaul the food giant’s performance.

Mr. Loeb may not have read Nestle’s news releases over the last few weeks. In May, the company announced that it had teamed up with Amazon to offer a cooking companion with step-by-step recipe instructions, visual aids, skill demonstrations and other content to help consumers prepare meals.The same month, it announced it was retooling its Maggi line to eliminate ingredients consumers do not like and add vegetables, grains and other more nutritional items.

The company also announced this month that it was the lead investor in a $77 million investment in Freshly, a subscription meal service.In addition, the company has worked over the last several years to strip preservatives and other ingredients from its ice creams and decidedly improve its vast frozen foods portfolio.Third Point said it had hired Jan Bennink, a former executive chairman of Sara Lee, to advise the hedge fund on its investment.

Early life and education[edit]
Loeb was born to a Jewish family,[3] the son of Ronald and Clare (née Spark) Loeb,[5] was raised in Santa Monica, California where he attended Palisades Charter High School.[3][6][7] At the school, he took AP classes, started a skateboard company and was nicknamed "Milo Minderbinder" by one of his teachers (after a character in the novel Catch-22 who had a fascination with the stock market).[8] His father was a partner at the Los Angeles law firm of Irell & Manella LLP[6] and general counsel for Williams-Sonoma.[5] His father also served as an outside director of Mattel, Inc. for over 30 years and during one period became interim President of Mattel. His mother is a historian.[5][6]
Loeb's great-aunt, Ruth Handler, created the Barbie doll and co-founded Mattel Inc.[6] In 2009, Loeb told an audience "[I] associated success in business with Hot Wheels and Barbie dolls. I think it was a very powerful enforcer early on to like business."[8]
Loeb attended the University of California at Berkeley for two years and subsequently graduated from Columbia University with an economics degree.[9] By his senior year at Columbia, he had made $120,000 in the stock market, but lost it all on an investment in a firm called Puritan-Bennett Inc. The loss taught him a lesson, he later said, in "overconcentrating positions".[8]
Investing career[edit]
From 1984 to 1987, Loeb worked at private equity firm Warburg Pincus.[10] He then worked as director of corporate development at Island Records, a record label, where he focused on securing debt financing.[11] After Island Records, Loeb worked as a risk arbitrage analyst at Lafer Equity Investors and then, from 1991 to 1994, as senior vice-president in the distressed debt department at Jefferies LLC. At Jefferies, he focused on bankruptcy analysis, trading bank loans and selling distressed securities. He moved on to become a Citigroup vice president from 1994–95, in charge of high-yield bond sales.[10]
Third Point Management[edit]
Main article: Third Point Management
Loeb started Third Point Management in 1995 "with $3.3 million from family and friends".
Under Loeb’s guidance, Third Point Management’s annualized returns since inception (Dec. 1996 – Dec. 2015) total approximately +16.2%.[12] In 2012, the firm returned +21.2%, outperforming the S&P 500's return of +16.0% and making it one of best performing hedge funds that year.[13][14] In 2013, the firm returned +25.2%, while the S&P 500 returned +32.4%.[15] Loeb appeared in Forbes' 2013 list of the world's 40 richest hedge-fund managers and traders.[16][17]In 2014, the firm returned +5.7%, while the S&P 500 returned +13.7%.[18] In 2015, the firm returned -1.4%, while the S&P 500 returned +1.4%.[19]
Yahoo![edit]
In 2012, Loeb, who through Third Point LLC, held 5.8% of Yahoo! stock, sought seats on the Yahoo! board for himself, former NBC Universal CEO Jeff Zucker, former Goldman Sachs executive Harry Wilson and former MTV Networks executive Michael J. Wolf.[20]
On May 3, 2012, Loeb revealed that the new CEO of Yahoo!, Scott Thompson, did not have a computer science degree, as had been commonly assumed for many years.[21][22] Thompson resigned on May 13, 2012.[23] Reuters then announced that Loeb, Wilson and Wolf would become members of the Yahoo! board.[24] Marissa Mayer was then appointed as CEO to replace Thompson. In July 2013, Loeb, Wilson, and Wolf resigned from Yahoo!'s board, leaving Yahoo! with a seven-member board. Yahoo! agreed to buy back 40 million shares at $1.6 billion from Third Point.[25][26]
Sony[edit]
In May 2013, Loeb proposed splitting Sony's entertainment and electronics businesses, arguing that such a split would increase profits.[27][28][29]
On June 18, 2013, Third Point LLC announced it had increased its stake in Sony to 70 million shares, or about 7 percent, valued at $1.4 billion.[30] According to Bloomberg.com, Sony's board of directors considered Loeb's proposal and hired Morgan Stanley and Citigroup, Inc. to evaluate it.[31]
Actor George Clooney, whose Smokehouse Pictures production company has a contract with Sony's entertainment division, publicly opposed the proposal.[32][33]
As of May 2014, Sony remained 12 percent lower than when Loeb first suggested for them to split. Sony had its sixth annual loss in seven years with shares dropping 8.8 percent as of May 2014. In February 2014, Sony said it would sell its PC business to buyout Japan industrial Partners Inc. and split its TV manufacturing unit into an independently operated entity. Ayano Iguchi, a company spokeswoman, said Sony was "focused on creating shareholder value by executing on our plan to revitalize and grow the electronics business, while further strengthening the entertainment and financial service businesses." Chris Konstantinos, director of international portfolio managements at RiverFront stated that a breakup was "long overdue."[34]
In October 2014, Loeb sold his shares in Sony and later wrote, “They have a long way to go and we continue to believe that more urgency will be necessary to definitively turn around the company’s fortunes".[35][36]
Sotheby's[edit]
In October 2013, Loeb issued a letter scrutinizing the governance of Sotheby's.[37] It announced that Third Point had acquired "9.3% of the outstanding shares" and addressed Third Point's concerns regarding the governance of Sotheby's. These concerns are summarized as, "we are troubled by the Company's chronically weak operating margins and deteriorating competitive position relative to Christie's, as evidenced by each of the Contemporary and Modern art evening sales over the last several years."[37] The letter expressed strong skepticism of Sotheby's international strategy—"Sotheby's is struggling internationally, lagging in newer markets like China and the Middle East"—and called for the removal of William Ruprecht from all his positions.[37]
After Sotheby's instituted a "poison pill" to stop Third Point from growing its position past 10%, Third Point brought a lawsuit in the state of Delaware; however, on May 3, 2014, Vice Chancellor Donald Parsons of the Delaware Court of Chancery ruled that the auction house was justified in its use of the corporate action. On May 5, Loeb and Sotheby's reached an agreement, stipulating that Loeb, Olivier Reza and Harry J. Wilson join the board in exchange for Third Point having an ownership cap at 15%. William Ruprecht remained CEO and the proxy contest ceased.[38][39] After 35 years at Sotheby's, Ruprecht retired as CEO. On March 16, 2015, Sotheby's named Tad Smith as its new president and chief executive.[40][41]
Fanuc[edit]
In late 2014, Loeb's Third Point took a stake in Fanuc, a robotics and computer numerical controls firm. Prior, Fanuc seldom made direct contact with its investors but in March 2014, the company decided "it would start talking to shareholders" and "return some of its cash to them." Loeb met with Fanuc's President, Yoshiharu Inaba, with encouragement from Japan's government officials, and was deemed a top prospect for "shaking up Japanese firms."[42][43][44]
Ligand Pharmaceuticals[edit]
In January 2007, when John Higgins became CEO of Ligand Pharmaceuticals, Loeb bought into the biotech firm to cut its losses and grow revenue. Loeb invested $50 million, increased the company’s profit to $250 million, and bought back $68 million in stock.[45]
Seven & I[edit]
In April 2016, Loeb won a battle in his drive to shake up corporate Japan who had "been sheltered from agitating investors." Seven & I Holdings Co.'s board was planning to replace Ryuichi Isaka as head of the company however, Loeb recommended Isaka as a successor to Toshifumi Suzuki, chairman and chief executive. On April 7, Suzuki resigned after losing a boardroom dispute with Loeb. Loeb wrote in a March 27, 2016 letter to Seven & I directors, "Mr. Isaka should be rewarded—not demoted—for his performance and commitment to delivering results for shareholders... This isn’t a dynasty. This is a corporation."[46][47][48] Loeb has pushed for the company to focus on its convenience store line while ridding its plans to expand its department and supermarket store franchises.[49]
Nestle[edit]
On 27 June 2017, Loeb announced to invest $3B into Nestle shares.[50]
Investment philosophy[edit]
New York magazine noted that Loeb's "preferred strategy" is to buy into troubled companies, replace inefficient management, and return the companies to profitability, which "is the key to his success."[3]
Letters[edit]
On Wall Street, Loeb has a reputation for "financial savvy" and for "his withering criticism of corporate executives who are unfortunate enough to stumble in his sights".[9] One of Loeb's signature tactics involves letter-writing:

Loeb is well known in Hedgeworld for his attacks on what he views as greedy execs who also happen to be depressing shareholder value. Of shares he owns. "The moral-indignation business", Loeb sometimes calls it. "Hedge-fund guys love to read Loeb's attacks; 'he articulates what people feel', says one."[3]

Often these letters cite the results of investigations he has ordered, detailing management decisions and actions he considers detrimental to shareholder value. The letters usually accompany his government filings.[3] Loeb once spent more than $4 million to increase his stake in a company to more than 5%, the statutory threshold requiring investor filings with the SEC, in order to file one of his letters criticizing the firm's management.[3] According to New York magazine, "Loeb is proud of his letters, which are thorough, well argued, and filled with clever turns of phrase. (He had a batch prepared for his high-school English teacher.)"[3] A 2005 New Yorker "The Talk of the Town" item described him as "a kind of investor's H. L. Mencken."[51]
In a 2005 letter responding to a job inquiry by a U.K. fund manager Loeb bristled at the applicant's reference to his (the applicant's) "place in society", telling the applicant that he would "have plenty of time to discuss your 'place in society' with the other fellows at the club." At Third Point, Loeb explained, "'one's place in society' does not matter at all. We are a bunch of scrappy guys from diverse backgrounds (Jewish, Muslim, Hindu etc) who enjoy outwitting pompous asses like yourself in financial markets globally."[52] Similarly, in a September 2005 letter to Ligand Pharmaceuticals CEO David Robinson, Loeb expressed wonder that Ligand's board of directors had not shown Robinson "the door long ago – accompanied by a well worn boot planted in the backside."[52]
Loeb sent a letter to John Collins, chairman and CEO of InterCept, in 2004, accusing InterCept of following "a 'good ol' boy' set of ethics", pointing out that InterCept employed Collins' daughter and son-in-law, the latter of whom Loeb had recently reached by phone on a golf course during working hours. Loeb further noted his discovery that InterCept leased a jet from a partnership controlled by Collins and another board member.[52]
He wrote to Irik Sevin, CEO of Star Gas Partners, in February 2005, calling him "one of the most dangerous and incompetent executives in America" and accusing him of "ineptitude" and of using the firm as his "personal 'honey pot'". He wrote: "I was amused to learn, in the course of our investigation, that at Cornell University there is an 'Irik Sevin Scholarship'. One can only pity the poor student who suffers the indignity of attaching your name to his academic record." Loeb demanded the resignation from the firm's board of Sevin's "elderly 78-year old mum" and insisted that Sevin also "step down … so that you can do what you do best: retreat to your waterfront mansion in the Hamptons where you can play tennis and hobnob with your fellow socialites."[52]
A 2005 New York Times article reported that many hedge-fund managers were now writing letters to the SEC demanding executives take specific actions and cited Loeb's letter to Sevin as exemplary of the genre, noting that three weeks after the letter was sent, "Sevin was gone, and a jubilant Mr. Loeb sent out an e-mail message to friends and associates declaring a 'huge victory for Third Point.'"[53]
Personal life[edit]
Loeb married Margaret Davidson Munzer on July 4, 2004,[51] at his beach house in East Hampton, New York.[5] The couple has three children.[54] Loeb is a founding "Master Player" of Portfolios with Purpose, an annual virtual stock trading contest that raises money for charitable causes of the winning contestants' choice.[55]
Loeb has called himself a "lifelong surfer" with "a 'secret spot' in the Caribbean". His second favorite surfing spot is in Indonesia.[56] Third Point takes its name from "a break at Malibu's Surfrider Beach."[57]
In 2014, Loeb was reported as one of a number of "prominent investors [who] have taken to Transcendental Meditation".[58]
Loeb was co-chair of the Governors for Investors Industry (2013).[59] He is a trustee of Mount Sinai Hospital, the Manhattan Institute, the U.S. Olympic Committee and the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art. He is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and of the National Council of the American Enterprise Institute.[59]
Political and economic views[edit]
Loeb has donated to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, Friends for Harry Reid, Obama for America, Forward Together PAC, Prosperity PAC, Straight Talk America, and the Volunteer PAC. In 2013, Loeb was a signatory to an amicus curiae brief submitted to the U.S. Supreme Court in Hollingsworth v. Perry, in support of same-sex marriage.[60][61][62][63]
In 2015, Loeb, Paul Singer and Tim Gill helped fund Freedom For All Americans to promote LGBT issues in states and local communities in the United States.[64]
Wealth and philanthropy[edit]
According to Forbes Magazine, his net worth is $2.9 billion USD as of February 2017.[65]
The Daniel S Loeb Family Third Point Foundation[edit]
The Daniel S Loeb Family Third Point Foundation earned $6.39 million in profits in 2011 and had $4.45 billion in assets at the end of that year, making it one of the largest and highest-earning private foundations. Its nonprofit administrative expense ratio, a measure of its operating and administrating expenses, was 0.44%, compared to the 2011 average of 19.7% for all private foundations.[66]
Loeb is heavily involved in education reform efforts, specifically supporting charter schools.[67] Loeb is chairman of the board of Success Academy Charter Schools in Brooklyn.[16] In June 2013, he pledged to donate $3 million to Success Academy Charter Schools.[68] He endowed the Daniel S. Loeb Scholarship for undergraduate study at Columbia University. Since 2004, he has been a trustee of Prep for Prep, an organization in New York City that prepares underprivileged children to attend competitive private schools. He is active in the Jewish Enrichment Center, which provides young people with an education in Judaism. Additionally, he is a co-founder of Students First New York, the state branch of the national education advocacy organization.[10]
On February 20, 2014, Loeb attended a discussion between the American Enterprise Institute and the Dalai Lama. The two worldviews debated the morality of capitalism and free enterprise. In Loeb's presentation, he said he practices Ashtanga yoga and applies yoga principles to his business and his decision-making. He noted that these principles aided in his decision to donate to a charter school in the Bronx, which is now ranked third in the state of New York.[69][70]
In October 2011, Loeb challenged three former Navy SEALs to run the "MightyMan" Half Iron Triathlon with him and his team in Montauk, New York. He made a sizable contribution for each Navy SEAL Foundation director who completed the triathlon to raise funds for the foundation.[71][72][73]
In 2011, 2012, and 2013, Loeb and his wife made significant donations to the Alzheimer's Drug Discovery Foundation (ADDF), which funds over 400 Alzheimer's drug discovery programs in academic centers and biotechnology companies in 18 different countries.[74][75][76]
Loeb and his wife have also donated to the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, Ovarian Cancer Research Fund, Chai Lifeline, and the Michael J. Fox Foundation.[77]
Art collection[edit]
He is a prominent art collector and the walls at his Park Avenue office are covered with paintings", according to a New York Times August 26, 2013 article.[78] At a Sotheby's auction in 2009, Manhattan dealer Larry Gagosian purchased Jeff Koons' Baroque Egg With Bow (Turquoise/Magenta) for $5.4 million from Loeb, who had bought it from the Gagosian Gallery in 2004 for about $3 million.[79]
Loeb has traced his love of art to his student years at Columbia, when he saw Poussin's The Rape of the Sabine Women at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and took an art humanities class as part of the core curriculum. The "prep school kids" treated him like a "jerk", thinking they "all knew so much more", but in the end "I got one of two A's, and all the prep school snotty kids didn't."[80]
Business Insider placed Loeb at the top of its list of "Wall Street's 25 Most Serious Art Collectors", noting he owns works by Mike Kelley, Richard Prince, Basquiat, Andy Warhol and Cindy Sherman, and that he “has his own curator.”[81]

Early life and education[edit]
Loeb was born to a Jewish family,[3] the son of Ronald and Clare (née Spark) Loeb,[5] was raised in Santa Monica, California where he attended Palisades Charter High School.[3][6][7] At the school, he took AP classes, started a skateboard company and was nicknamed "Milo Minderbinder" by one of his teachers (after a character in the novel Catch-22 who had a fascination with the stock market).[8] His father was a partner at the Los Angeles law firm of Irell & Manella LLP[6] and general counsel for Williams-Sonoma.[5] His father also served as an outside director of Mattel, Inc. for over 30 years and during one period became interim President of Mattel. His mother is a historian.[5][6]
Loeb's great-aunt, Ruth Handler, created the Barbie doll and co-founded Mattel Inc.[6] In 2009, Loeb told an audience "[I] associated success in business with Hot Wheels and Barbie dolls. I think it was a very powerful enforcer early on to like business."[8]
Loeb attended the University of California at Berkeley for two years and subsequently graduated from Columbia University with an economics degree.[9] By his senior year at Columbia, he had made $120,000 in the stock market, but lost it all on an investment in a firm called Puritan-Bennett Inc. The loss taught him a lesson, he later said, in "overconcentrating positions".[8]
Investing career[edit]
From 1984 to 1987, Loeb worked at private equity firm Warburg Pincus.[10] He then worked as director of corporate development at Island Records, a record label, where he focused on securing debt financing.[11] After Island Records, Loeb worked as a risk arbitrage analyst at Lafer Equity Investors and then, from 1991 to 1994, as senior vice-president in the distressed debt department at Jefferies LLC. At Jefferies, he focused on bankruptcy analysis, trading bank loans and selling distressed securities. He moved on to become a Citigroup vice president from 1994–95, in charge of high-yield bond sales.[10]
Third Point Management[edit]
Main article: Third Point Management
Loeb started Third Point Management in 1995 "with $3.3 million from family and friends".
Under Loeb’s guidance, Third Point Management’s annualized returns since inception (Dec. 1996 – Dec. 2015) total approximately +16.2%.[12] In 2012, the firm returned +21.2%, outperforming the S&P 500's return of +16.0% and making it one of best performing hedge funds that year.[13][14] In 2013, the firm returned +25.2%, while the S&P 500 returned +32.4%.[15] Loeb appeared in Forbes' 2013 list of the world's 40 richest hedge-fund managers and traders.[16][17]In 2014, the firm returned +5.7%, while the S&P 500 returned +13.7%.[18] In 2015, the firm returned -1.4%, while the S&P 500 returned +1.4%.[19]
Yahoo![edit]
In 2012, Loeb, who through Third Point LLC, held 5.8% of Yahoo! stock, sought seats on the Yahoo! board for himself, former NBC Universal CEO Jeff Zucker, former Goldman Sachs executive Harry Wilson and former MTV Networks executive Michael J. Wolf.[20]
On May 3, 2012, Loeb revealed that the new CEO of Yahoo!, Scott Thompson, did not have a computer science degree, as had been commonly assumed for many years.[21][22] Thompson resigned on May 13, 2012.[23] Reuters then announced that Loeb, Wilson and Wolf would become members of the Yahoo! board.[24] Marissa Mayer was then appointed as CEO to replace Thompson. In July 2013, Loeb, Wilson, and Wolf resigned from Yahoo!'s board, leaving Yahoo! with a seven-member board. Yahoo! agreed to buy back 40 million shares at $1.6 billion from Third Point.[25][26]
Sony[edit]
In May 2013, Loeb proposed splitting Sony's entertainment and electronics businesses, arguing that such a split would increase profits.[27][28][29]
On June 18, 2013, Third Point LLC announced it had increased its stake in Sony to 70 million shares, or about 7 percent, valued at $1.4 billion.[30] According to Bloomberg.com, Sony's board of directors considered Loeb's proposal and hired Morgan Stanley and Citigroup, Inc. to evaluate it.[31]
Actor George Clooney, whose Smokehouse Pictures production company has a contract with Sony's entertainment division, publicly opposed the proposal.[32][33]
As of May 2014, Sony remained 12 percent lower than when Loeb first suggested for them to split. Sony had its sixth annual loss in seven years with shares dropping 8.8 percent as of May 2014. In February 2014, Sony said it would sell its PC business to buyout Japan industrial Partners Inc. and split its TV manufacturing unit into an independently operated entity. Ayano Iguchi, a company spokeswoman, said Sony was "focused on creating shareholder value by executing on our plan to revitalize and grow the electronics business, while further strengthening the entertainment and financial service businesses." Chris Konstantinos, director of international portfolio managements at RiverFront stated that a breakup was "long overdue."[34]
In October 2014, Loeb sold his shares in Sony and later wrote, “They have a long way to go and we continue to believe that more urgency will be necessary to definitively turn around the company’s fortunes".[35][36]
Sotheby's[edit]
In October 2013, Loeb issued a letter scrutinizing the governance of Sotheby's.[37] It announced that Third Point had acquired "9.3% of the outstanding shares" and addressed Third Point's concerns regarding the governance of Sotheby's. These concerns are summarized as, "we are troubled by the Company's chronically weak operating margins and deteriorating competitive position relative to Christie's, as evidenced by each of the Contemporary and Modern art evening sales over the last several years."[37] The letter expressed strong skepticism of Sotheby's international strategy—"Sotheby's is struggling internationally, lagging in newer markets like China and the Middle East"—and called for the removal of William Ruprecht from all his positions.[37]
After Sotheby's instituted a "poison pill" to stop Third Point from growing its position past 10%, Third Point brought a lawsuit in the state of Delaware; however, on May 3, 2014, Vice Chancellor Donald Parsons of the Delaware Court of Chancery ruled that the auction house was justified in its use of the corporate action. On May 5, Loeb and Sotheby's reached an agreement, stipulating that Loeb, Olivier Reza and Harry J. Wilson join the board in exchange for Third Point having an ownership cap at 15%. William Ruprecht remained CEO and the proxy contest ceased.[38][39] After 35 years at Sotheby's, Ruprecht retired as CEO. On March 16, 2015, Sotheby's named Tad Smith as its new president and chief executive.[40][41]
Fanuc[edit]
In late 2014, Loeb's Third Point took a stake in Fanuc, a robotics and computer numerical controls firm. Prior, Fanuc seldom made direct contact with its investors but in March 2014, the company decided "it would start talking to shareholders" and "return some of its cash to them." Loeb met with Fanuc's President, Yoshiharu Inaba, with encouragement from Japan's government officials, and was deemed a top prospect for "shaking up Japanese firms."[42][43][44]
Ligand Pharmaceuticals[edit]
In January 2007, when John Higgins became CEO of Ligand Pharmaceuticals, Loeb bought into the biotech firm to cut its losses and grow revenue. Loeb invested $50 million, increased the company’s profit to $250 million, and bought back $68 million in stock.[45]
Seven & I[edit]
In April 2016, Loeb won a battle in his drive to shake up corporate Japan who had "been sheltered from agitating investors." Seven & I Holdings Co.'s board was planning to replace Ryuichi Isaka as head of the company however, Loeb recommended Isaka as a successor to Toshifumi Suzuki, chairman and chief executive. On April 7, Suzuki resigned after losing a boardroom dispute with Loeb. Loeb wrote in a March 27, 2016 letter to Seven & I directors, "Mr. Isaka should be rewarded—not demoted—for his performance and commitment to delivering results for shareholders... This isn’t a dynasty. This is a corporation."[46][47][48] Loeb has pushed for the company to focus on its convenience store line while ridding its plans to expand its department and supermarket store franchises.[49]
Nestle[edit]
On 27 June 2017, Loeb announced to invest $3B into Nestle shares.[50]
Investment philosophy[edit]
New York magazine noted that Loeb's "preferred strategy" is to buy into troubled companies, replace inefficient management, and return the companies to profitability, which "is the key to his success."[3]
Letters[edit]
On Wall Street, Loeb has a reputation for "financial savvy" and for "his withering criticism of corporate executives who are unfortunate enough to stumble in his sights".[9] One of Loeb's signature tactics involves letter-writing:

Loeb is well known in Hedgeworld for his attacks on what he views as greedy execs who also happen to be depressing shareholder value. Of shares he owns. "The moral-indignation business", Loeb sometimes calls it. "Hedge-fund guys love to read Loeb's attacks; 'he articulates what people feel', says one."[3]

Often these letters cite the results of investigations he has ordered, detailing management decisions and actions he considers detrimental to shareholder value. The letters usually accompany his government filings.[3] Loeb once spent more than $4 million to increase his stake in a company to more than 5%, the statutory threshold requiring investor filings with the SEC, in order to file one of his letters criticizing the firm's management.[3] According to New York magazine, "Loeb is proud of his letters, which are thorough, well argued, and filled with clever turns of phrase. (He had a batch prepared for his high-school English teacher.)"[3] A 2005 New Yorker "The Talk of the Town" item described him as "a kind of investor's H. L. Mencken."[51]
In a 2005 letter responding to a job inquiry by a U.K. fund manager Loeb bristled at the applicant's reference to his (the applicant's) "place in society", telling the applicant that he would "have plenty of time to discuss your 'place in society' with the other fellows at the club." At Third Point, Loeb explained, "'one's place in society' does not matter at all. We are a bunch of scrappy guys from diverse backgrounds (Jewish, Muslim, Hindu etc) who enjoy outwitting pompous asses like yourself in financial markets globally."[52] Similarly, in a September 2005 letter to Ligand Pharmaceuticals CEO David Robinson, Loeb expressed wonder that Ligand's board of directors had not shown Robinson "the door long ago – accompanied by a well worn boot planted in the backside."[52]
Loeb sent a letter to John Collins, chairman and CEO of InterCept, in 2004, accusing InterCept of following "a 'good ol' boy' set of ethics", pointing out that InterCept employed Collins' daughter and son-in-law, the latter of whom Loeb had recently reached by phone on a golf course during working hours. Loeb further noted his discovery that InterCept leased a jet from a partnership controlled by Collins and another board member.[52]
He wrote to Irik Sevin, CEO of Star Gas Partners, in February 2005, calling him "one of the most dangerous and incompetent executives in America" and accusing him of "ineptitude" and of using the firm as his "personal 'honey pot'". He wrote: "I was amused to learn, in the course of our investigation, that at Cornell University there is an 'Irik Sevin Scholarship'. One can only pity the poor student who suffers the indignity of attaching your name to his academic record." Loeb demanded the resignation from the firm's board of Sevin's "elderly 78-year old mum" and insisted that Sevin also "step down … so that you can do what you do best: retreat to your waterfront mansion in the Hamptons where you can play tennis and hobnob with your fellow socialites."[52]
A 2005 New York Times article reported that many hedge-fund managers were now writing letters to the SEC demanding executives take specific actions and cited Loeb's letter to Sevin as exemplary of the genre, noting that three weeks after the letter was sent, "Sevin was gone, and a jubilant Mr. Loeb sent out an e-mail message to friends and associates declaring a 'huge victory for Third Point.'"[53]
Personal life[edit]
Loeb married Margaret Davidson Munzer on July 4, 2004,[51] at his beach house in East Hampton, New York.[5] The couple has three children.[54] Loeb is a founding "Master Player" of Portfolios with Purpose, an annual virtual stock trading contest that raises money for charitable causes of the winning contestants' choice.[55]
Loeb has called himself a "lifelong surfer" with "a 'secret spot' in the Caribbean". His second favorite surfing spot is in Indonesia.[56] Third Point takes its name from "a break at Malibu's Surfrider Beach."[57]
In 2014, Loeb was reported as one of a number of "prominent investors [who] have taken to Transcendental Meditation".[58]
Loeb was co-chair of the Governors for Investors Industry (2013).[59] He is a trustee of Mount Sinai Hospital, the Manhattan Institute, the U.S. Olympic Committee and the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art. He is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and of the National Council of the American Enterprise Institute.[59]
Political and economic views[edit]
Loeb has donated to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, Friends for Harry Reid, Obama for America, Forward Together PAC, Prosperity PAC, Straight Talk America, and the Volunteer PAC. In 2013, Loeb was a signatory to an amicus curiae brief submitted to the U.S. Supreme Court in Hollingsworth v. Perry, in support of same-sex marriage.[60][61][62][63]
In 2015, Loeb, Paul Singer and Tim Gill helped fund Freedom For All Americans to promote LGBT issues in states and local communities in the United States.[64]
Wealth and philanthropy[edit]
According to Forbes Magazine, his net worth is $2.9 billion USD as of February 2017.[65]
The Daniel S Loeb Family Third Point Foundation[edit]
The Daniel S Loeb Family Third Point Foundation earned $6.39 million in profits in 2011 and had $4.45 billion in assets at the end of that year, making it one of the largest and highest-earning private foundations. Its nonprofit administrative expense ratio, a measure of its operating and administrating expenses, was 0.44%, compared to the 2011 average of 19.7% for all private foundations.[66]
Loeb is heavily involved in education reform efforts, specifically supporting charter schools.[67] Loeb is chairman of the board of Success Academy Charter Schools in Brooklyn.[16] In June 2013, he pledged to donate $3 million to Success Academy Charter Schools.[68] He endowed the Daniel S. Loeb Scholarship for undergraduate study at Columbia University. Since 2004, he has been a trustee of Prep for Prep, an organization in New York City that prepares underprivileged children to attend competitive private schools. He is active in the Jewish Enrichment Center, which provides young people with an education in Judaism. Additionally, he is a co-founder of Students First New York, the state branch of the national education advocacy organization.[10]
On February 20, 2014, Loeb attended a discussion between the American Enterprise Institute and the Dalai Lama. The two worldviews debated the morality of capitalism and free enterprise. In Loeb's presentation, he said he practices Ashtanga yoga and applies yoga principles to his business and his decision-making. He noted that these principles aided in his decision to donate to a charter school in the Bronx, which is now ranked third in the state of New York.[69][70]
In October 2011, Loeb challenged three former Navy SEALs to run the "MightyMan" Half Iron Triathlon with him and his team in Montauk, New York. He made a sizable contribution for each Navy SEAL Foundation director who completed the triathlon to raise funds for the foundation.[71][72][73]
In 2011, 2012, and 2013, Loeb and his wife made significant donations to the Alzheimer's Drug Discovery Foundation (ADDF), which funds over 400 Alzheimer's drug discovery programs in academic centers and biotechnology companies in 18 different countries.[74][75][76]
Loeb and his wife have also donated to the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, Ovarian Cancer Research Fund, Chai Lifeline, and the Michael J. Fox Foundation.[77]
Art collection[edit]
He is a prominent art collector and the walls at his Park Avenue office are covered with paintings", according to a New York Times August 26, 2013 article.[78] At a Sotheby's auction in 2009, Manhattan dealer Larry Gagosian purchased Jeff Koons' Baroque Egg With Bow (Turquoise/Magenta) for $5.4 million from Loeb, who had bought it from the Gagosian Gallery in 2004 for about $3 million.[79]
Loeb has traced his love of art to his student years at Columbia, when he saw Poussin's The Rape of the Sabine Women at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and took an art humanities class as part of the core curriculum. The "prep school kids" treated him like a "jerk", thinking they "all knew so much more", but in the end "I got one of two A's, and all the prep school snotty kids didn't."[80]
Business Insider placed Loeb at the top of its list of "Wall Street's 25 Most Serious Art Collectors", noting he owns works by Mike Kelley, Richard Prince, Basquiat, Andy Warhol and Cindy Sherman, and that he “has his own curator.”[81]

Early life and education[edit]
Loeb was born to a Jewish family,[3] the son of Ronald and Clare (née Spark) Loeb,[5] was raised in Santa Monica, California where he attended Palisades Charter High School.[3][6][7] At the school, he took AP classes, started a skateboard company and was nicknamed "Milo Minderbinder" by one of his teachers (after a character in the novel Catch-22 who had a fascination with the stock market).[8] His father was a partner at the Los Angeles law firm of Irell & Manella LLP[6] and general counsel for Williams-Sonoma.[5] His father also served as an outside director of Mattel, Inc. for over 30 years and during one period became interim President of Mattel. His mother is a historian.[5][6]
Loeb's great-aunt, Ruth Handler, created the Barbie doll and co-founded Mattel Inc.[6] In 2009, Loeb told an audience "[I] associated success in business with Hot Wheels and Barbie dolls. I think it was a very powerful enforcer early on to like business."[8]
Loeb attended the University of California at Berkeley for two years and subsequently graduated from Columbia University with an economics degree.[9] By his senior year at Columbia, he had made $120,000 in the stock market, but lost it all on an investment in a firm called Puritan-Bennett Inc. The loss taught him a lesson, he later said, in "overconcentrating positions".[8]
Investing career[edit]
From 1984 to 1987, Loeb worked at private equity firm Warburg Pincus.[10] He then worked as director of corporate development at Island Records, a record label, where he focused on securing debt financing.[11] After Island Records, Loeb worked as a risk arbitrage analyst at Lafer Equity Investors and then, from 1991 to 1994, as senior vice-president in the distressed debt department at Jefferies LLC. At Jefferies, he focused on bankruptcy analysis, trading bank loans and selling distressed securities. He moved on to become a Citigroup vice president from 1994–95, in charge of high-yield bond sales.[10]
Third Point Management[edit]
Main article: Third Point Management
Loeb started Third Point Management in 1995 "with $3.3 million from family and friends".
Under Loeb’s guidance, Third Point Management’s annualized returns since inception (Dec. 1996 – Dec. 2015) total approximately +16.2%.[12] In 2012, the firm returned +21.2%, outperforming the S&P 500's return of +16.0% and making it one of best performing hedge funds that year.[13][14] In 2013, the firm returned +25.2%, while the S&P 500 returned +32.4%.[15] Loeb appeared in Forbes' 2013 list of the world's 40 richest hedge-fund managers and traders.[16][17]In 2014, the firm returned +5.7%, while the S&P 500 returned +13.7%.[18] In 2015, the firm returned -1.4%, while the S&P 500 returned +1.4%.[19]
Yahoo![edit]
In 2012, Loeb, who through Third Point LLC, held 5.8% of Yahoo! stock, sought seats on the Yahoo! board for himself, former NBC Universal CEO Jeff Zucker, former Goldman Sachs executive Harry Wilson and former MTV Networks executive Michael J. Wolf.[20]
On May 3, 2012, Loeb revealed that the new CEO of Yahoo!, Scott Thompson, did not have a computer science degree, as had been commonly assumed for many years.[21][22] Thompson resigned on May 13, 2012.[23] Reuters then announced that Loeb, Wilson and Wolf would become members of the Yahoo! board.[24] Marissa Mayer was then appointed as CEO to replace Thompson. In July 2013, Loeb, Wilson, and Wolf resigned from Yahoo!'s board, leaving Yahoo! with a seven-member board. Yahoo! agreed to buy back 40 million shares at $1.6 billion from Third Point.[25][26]
Sony[edit]
In May 2013, Loeb proposed splitting Sony's entertainment and electronics businesses, arguing that such a split would increase profits.[27][28][29]
On June 18, 2013, Third Point LLC announced it had increased its stake in Sony to 70 million shares, or about 7 percent, valued at $1.4 billion.[30] According to Bloomberg.com, Sony's board of directors considered Loeb's proposal and hired Morgan Stanley and Citigroup, Inc. to evaluate it.[31]
Actor George Clooney, whose Smokehouse Pictures production company has a contract with Sony's entertainment division, publicly opposed the proposal.[32][33]
As of May 2014, Sony remained 12 percent lower than when Loeb first suggested for them to split. Sony had its sixth annual loss in seven years with shares dropping 8.8 percent as of May 2014. In February 2014, Sony said it would sell its PC business to buyout Japan industrial Partners Inc. and split its TV manufacturing unit into an independently operated entity. Ayano Iguchi, a company spokeswoman, said Sony was "focused on creating shareholder value by executing on our plan to revitalize and grow the electronics business, while further strengthening the entertainment and financial service businesses." Chris Konstantinos, director of international portfolio managements at RiverFront stated that a breakup was "long overdue."[34]
In October 2014, Loeb sold his shares in Sony and later wrote, “They have a long way to go and we continue to believe that more urgency will be necessary to definitively turn around the company’s fortunes".[35][36]
Sotheby's[edit]
In October 2013, Loeb issued a letter scrutinizing the governance of Sotheby's.[37] It announced that Third Point had acquired "9.3% of the outstanding shares" and addressed Third Point's concerns regarding the governance of Sotheby's. These concerns are summarized as, "we are troubled by the Company's chronically weak operating margins and deteriorating competitive position relative to Christie's, as evidenced by each of the Contemporary and Modern art evening sales over the last several years."[37] The letter expressed strong skepticism of Sotheby's international strategy—"Sotheby's is struggling internationally, lagging in newer markets like China and the Middle East"—and called for the removal of William Ruprecht from all his positions.[37]
After Sotheby's instituted a "poison pill" to stop Third Point from growing its position past 10%, Third Point brought a lawsuit in the state of Delaware; however, on May 3, 2014, Vice Chancellor Donald Parsons of the Delaware Court of Chancery ruled that the auction house was justified in its use of the corporate action. On May 5, Loeb and Sotheby's reached an agreement, stipulating that Loeb, Olivier Reza and Harry J. Wilson join the board in exchange for Third Point having an ownership cap at 15%. William Ruprecht remained CEO and the proxy contest ceased.[38][39] After 35 years at Sotheby's, Ruprecht retired as CEO. On March 16, 2015, Sotheby's named Tad Smith as its new president and chief executive.[40][41]
Fanuc[edit]
In late 2014, Loeb's Third Point took a stake in Fanuc, a robotics and computer numerical controls firm. Prior, Fanuc seldom made direct contact with its investors but in March 2014, the company decided "it would start talking to shareholders" and "return some of its cash to them." Loeb met with Fanuc's President, Yoshiharu Inaba, with encouragement from Japan's government officials, and was deemed a top prospect for "shaking up Japanese firms."[42][43][44]
Ligand Pharmaceuticals[edit]
In January 2007, when John Higgins became CEO of Ligand Pharmaceuticals, Loeb bought into the biotech firm to cut its losses and grow revenue. Loeb invested $50 million, increased the company’s profit to $250 million, and bought back $68 million in stock.[45]
Seven & I[edit]
In April 2016, Loeb won a battle in his drive to shake up corporate Japan who had "been sheltered from agitating investors." Seven & I Holdings Co.'s board was planning to replace Ryuichi Isaka as head of the company however, Loeb recommended Isaka as a successor to Toshifumi Suzuki, chairman and chief executive. On April 7, Suzuki resigned after losing a boardroom dispute with Loeb. Loeb wrote in a March 27, 2016 letter to Seven & I directors, "Mr. Isaka should be rewarded—not demoted—for his performance and commitment to delivering results for shareholders... This isn’t a dynasty. This is a corporation."[46][47][48] Loeb has pushed for the company to focus on its convenience store line while ridding its plans to expand its department and supermarket store franchises.[49]
Nestle[edit]
On 27 June 2017, Loeb announced to invest $3B into Nestle shares.[50]
Investment philosophy[edit]
New York magazine noted that Loeb's "preferred strategy" is to buy into troubled companies, replace inefficient management, and return the companies to profitability, which "is the key to his success."[3]
Letters[edit]
On Wall Street, Loeb has a reputation for "financial savvy" and for "his withering criticism of corporate executives who are unfortunate enough to stumble in his sights".[9] One of Loeb's signature tactics involves letter-writing:

Loeb is well known in Hedgeworld for his attacks on what he views as greedy execs who also happen to be depressing shareholder value. Of shares he owns. "The moral-indignation business", Loeb sometimes calls it. "Hedge-fund guys love to read Loeb's attacks; 'he articulates what people feel', says one."[3]

Often these letters cite the results of investigations he has ordered, detailing management decisions and actions he considers detrimental to shareholder value. The letters usually accompany his government filings.[3] Loeb once spent more than $4 million to increase his stake in a company to more than 5%, the statutory threshold requiring investor filings with the SEC, in order to file one of his letters criticizing the firm's management.[3] According to New York magazine, "Loeb is proud of his letters, which are thorough, well argued, and filled with clever turns of phrase. (He had a batch prepared for his high-school English teacher.)"[3] A 2005 New Yorker "The Talk of the Town" item described him as "a kind of investor's H. L. Mencken."[51]
In a 2005 letter responding to a job inquiry by a U.K. fund manager Loeb bristled at the applicant's reference to his (the applicant's) "place in society", telling the applicant that he would "have plenty of time to discuss your 'place in society' with the other fellows at the club." At Third Point, Loeb explained, "'one's place in society' does not matter at all. We are a bunch of scrappy guys from diverse backgrounds (Jewish, Muslim, Hindu etc) who enjoy outwitting pompous asses like yourself in financial markets globally."[52] Similarly, in a September 2005 letter to Ligand Pharmaceuticals CEO David Robinson, Loeb expressed wonder that Ligand's board of directors had not shown Robinson "the door long ago – accompanied by a well worn boot planted in the backside."[52]
Loeb sent a letter to John Collins, chairman and CEO of InterCept, in 2004, accusing InterCept of following "a 'good ol' boy' set of ethics", pointing out that InterCept employed Collins' daughter and son-in-law, the latter of whom Loeb had recently reached by phone on a golf course during working hours. Loeb further noted his discovery that InterCept leased a jet from a partnership controlled by Collins and another board member.[52]
He wrote to Irik Sevin, CEO of Star Gas Partners, in February 2005, calling him "one of the most dangerous and incompetent executives in America" and accusing him of "ineptitude" and of using the firm as his "personal 'honey pot'". He wrote: "I was amused to learn, in the course of our investigation, that at Cornell University there is an 'Irik Sevin Scholarship'. One can only pity the poor student who suffers the indignity of attaching your name to his academic record." Loeb demanded the resignation from the firm's board of Sevin's "elderly 78-year old mum" and insisted that Sevin also "step down … so that you can do what you do best: retreat to your waterfront mansion in the Hamptons where you can play tennis and hobnob with your fellow socialites."[52]
A 2005 New York Times article reported that many hedge-fund managers were now writing letters to the SEC demanding executives take specific actions and cited Loeb's letter to Sevin as exemplary of the genre, noting that three weeks after the letter was sent, "Sevin was gone, and a jubilant Mr. Loeb sent out an e-mail message to friends and associates declaring a 'huge victory for Third Point.'"[53]
Personal life[edit]
Loeb married Margaret Davidson Munzer on July 4, 2004,[51] at his beach house in East Hampton, New York.[5] The couple has three children.[54] Loeb is a founding "Master Player" of Portfolios with Purpose, an annual virtual stock trading contest that raises money for charitable causes of the winning contestants' choice.[55]
Loeb has called himself a "lifelong surfer" with "a 'secret spot' in the Caribbean". His second favorite surfing spot is in Indonesia.[56] Third Point takes its name from "a break at Malibu's Surfrider Beach."[57]
In 2014, Loeb was reported as one of a number of "prominent investors [who] have taken to Transcendental Meditation".[58]
Loeb was co-chair of the Governors for Investors Industry (2013).[59] He is a trustee of Mount Sinai Hospital, the Manhattan Institute, the U.S. Olympic Committee and the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art. He is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and of the National Council of the American Enterprise Institute.[59]
Political and economic views[edit]
Loeb has donated to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, Friends for Harry Reid, Obama for America, Forward Together PAC, Prosperity PAC, Straight Talk America, and the Volunteer PAC. In 2013, Loeb was a signatory to an amicus curiae brief submitted to the U.S. Supreme Court in Hollingsworth v. Perry, in support of same-sex marriage.[60][61][62][63]
In 2015, Loeb, Paul Singer and Tim Gill helped fund Freedom For All Americans to promote LGBT issues in states and local communities in the United States.[64]
Wealth and philanthropy[edit]
According to Forbes Magazine, his net worth is $2.9 billion USD as of February 2017.[65]
The Daniel S Loeb Family Third Point Foundation[edit]
The Daniel S Loeb Family Third Point Foundation earned $6.39 million in profits in 2011 and had $4.45 billion in assets at the end of that year, making it one of the largest and highest-earning private foundations. Its nonprofit administrative expense ratio, a measure of its operating and administrating expenses, was 0.44%, compared to the 2011 average of 19.7% for all private foundations.[66]
Loeb is heavily involved in education reform efforts, specifically supporting charter schools.[67] Loeb is chairman of the board of Success Academy Charter Schools in Brooklyn.[16] In June 2013, he pledged to donate $3 million to Success Academy Charter Schools.[68] He endowed the Daniel S. Loeb Scholarship for undergraduate study at Columbia University. Since 2004, he has been a trustee of Prep for Prep, an organization in New York City that prepares underprivileged children to attend competitive private schools. He is active in the Jewish Enrichment Center, which provides young people with an education in Judaism. Additionally, he is a co-founder of Students First New York, the state branch of the national education advocacy organization.[10]
On February 20, 2014, Loeb attended a discussion between the American Enterprise Institute and the Dalai Lama. The two worldviews debated the morality of capitalism and free enterprise. In Loeb's presentation, he said he practices Ashtanga yoga and applies yoga principles to his business and his decision-making. He noted that these principles aided in his decision to donate to a charter school in the Bronx, which is now ranked third in the state of New York.[69][70]
In October 2011, Loeb challenged three former Navy SEALs to run the "MightyMan" Half Iron Triathlon with him and his team in Montauk, New York. He made a sizable contribution for each Navy SEAL Foundation director who completed the triathlon to raise funds for the foundation.[71][72][73]
In 2011, 2012, and 2013, Loeb and his wife made significant donations to the Alzheimer's Drug Discovery Foundation (ADDF), which funds over 400 Alzheimer's drug discovery programs in academic centers and biotechnology companies in 18 different countries.[74][75][76]
Loeb and his wife have also donated to the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, Ovarian Cancer Research Fund, Chai Lifeline, and the Michael J. Fox Foundation.[77]
Art collection[edit]
He is a prominent art collector and the walls at his Park Avenue office are covered with paintings", according to a New York Times August 26, 2013 article.[78] At a Sotheby's auction in 2009, Manhattan dealer Larry Gagosian purchased Jeff Koons' Baroque Egg With Bow (Turquoise/Magenta) for $5.4 million from Loeb, who had bought it from the Gagosian Gallery in 2004 for about $3 million.[79]
Loeb has traced his love of art to his student years at Columbia, when he saw Poussin's The Rape of the Sabine Women at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and took an art humanities class as part of the core curriculum. The "prep school kids" treated him like a "jerk", thinking they "all knew so much more", but in the end "I got one of two A's, and all the prep school snotty kids didn't."[80]
Business Insider placed Loeb at the top of its list of "Wall Street's 25 Most Serious Art Collectors", noting he owns works by Mike Kelley, Richard Prince, Basquiat, Andy Warhol and Cindy Sherman, and that he “has his own curator.”[81]

Early life and education[edit]
Loeb was born to a Jewish family,[3] the son of Ronald and Clare (née Spark) Loeb,[5] was raised in Santa Monica, California where he attended Palisades Charter High School.[3][6][7] At the school, he took AP classes, started a skateboard company and was nicknamed "Milo Minderbinder" by one of his teachers (after a character in the novel Catch-22 who had a fascination with the stock market).[8] His father was a partner at the Los Angeles law firm of Irell & Manella LLP[6] and general counsel for Williams-Sonoma.[5] His father also served as an outside director of Mattel, Inc. for over 30 years and during one period became interim President of Mattel. His mother is a historian.[5][6]
Loeb's great-aunt, Ruth Handler, created the Barbie doll and co-founded Mattel Inc.[6] In 2009, Loeb told an audience "[I] associated success in business with Hot Wheels and Barbie dolls. I think it was a very powerful enforcer early on to like business."[8]
Loeb attended the University of California at Berkeley for two years and subsequently graduated from Columbia University with an economics degree.[9] By his senior year at Columbia, he had made $120,000 in the stock market, but lost it all on an investment in a firm called Puritan-Bennett Inc. The loss taught him a lesson, he later said, in "overconcentrating positions".[8]
Investing career[edit]
From 1984 to 1987, Loeb worked at private equity firm Warburg Pincus.[10] He then worked as director of corporate development at Island Records, a record label, where he focused on securing debt financing.[11] After Island Records, Loeb worked as a risk arbitrage analyst at Lafer Equity Investors and then, from 1991 to 1994, as senior vice-president in the distressed debt department at Jefferies LLC. At Jefferies, he focused on bankruptcy analysis, trading bank loans and selling distressed securities. He moved on to become a Citigroup vice president from 1994–95, in charge of high-yield bond sales.[10]
Third Point Management[edit]
Main article: Third Point Management
Loeb started Third Point Management in 1995 "with $3.3 million from family and friends".
Under Loeb’s guidance, Third Point Management’s annualized returns since inception (Dec. 1996 – Dec. 2015) total approximately +16.2%.[12] In 2012, the firm returned +21.2%, outperforming the S&P 500's return of +16.0% and making it one of best performing hedge funds that year.[13][14] In 2013, the firm returned +25.2%, while the S&P 500 returned +32.4%.[15] Loeb appeared in Forbes' 2013 list of the world's 40 richest hedge-fund managers and traders.[16][17]In 2014, the firm returned +5.7%, while the S&P 500 returned +13.7%.[18] In 2015, the firm returned -1.4%, while the S&P 500 returned +1.4%.[19]
Yahoo![edit]
In 2012, Loeb, who through Third Point LLC, held 5.8% of Yahoo! stock, sought seats on the Yahoo! board for himself, former NBC Universal CEO Jeff Zucker, former Goldman Sachs executive Harry Wilson and former MTV Networks executive Michael J. Wolf.[20]
On May 3, 2012, Loeb revealed that the new CEO of Yahoo!, Scott Thompson, did not have a computer science degree, as had been commonly assumed for many years.[21][22] Thompson resigned on May 13, 2012.[23] Reuters then announced that Loeb, Wilson and Wolf would become members of the Yahoo! board.[24] Marissa Mayer was then appointed as CEO to replace Thompson. In July 2013, Loeb, Wilson, and Wolf resigned from Yahoo!'s board, leaving Yahoo! with a seven-member board. Yahoo! agreed to buy back 40 million shares at $1.6 billion from Third Point.[25][26]
Sony[edit]
In May 2013, Loeb proposed splitting Sony's entertainment and electronics businesses, arguing that such a split would increase profits.[27][28][29]
On June 18, 2013, Third Point LLC announced it had increased its stake in Sony to 70 million shares, or about 7 percent, valued at $1.4 billion.[30] According to Bloomberg.com, Sony's board of directors considered Loeb's proposal and hired Morgan Stanley and Citigroup, Inc. to evaluate it.[31]
Actor George Clooney, whose Smokehouse Pictures production company has a contract with Sony's entertainment division, publicly opposed the proposal.[32][33]
As of May 2014, Sony remained 12 percent lower than when Loeb first suggested for them to split. Sony had its sixth annual loss in seven years with shares dropping 8.8 percent as of May 2014. In February 2014, Sony said it would sell its PC business to buyout Japan industrial Partners Inc. and split its TV manufacturing unit into an independently operated entity. Ayano Iguchi, a company spokeswoman, said Sony was "focused on creating shareholder value by executing on our plan to revitalize and grow the electronics business, while further strengthening the entertainment and financial service businesses." Chris Konstantinos, director of international portfolio managements at RiverFront stated that a breakup was "long overdue."[34]
In October 2014, Loeb sold his shares in Sony and later wrote, “They have a long way to go and we continue to believe that more urgency will be necessary to definitively turn around the company’s fortunes".[35][36]
Sotheby's[edit]
In October 2013, Loeb issued a letter scrutinizing the governance of Sotheby's.[37] It announced that Third Point had acquired "9.3% of the outstanding shares" and addressed Third Point's concerns regarding the governance of Sotheby's. These concerns are summarized as, "we are troubled by the Company's chronically weak operating margins and deteriorating competitive position relative to Christie's, as evidenced by each of the Contemporary and Modern art evening sales over the last several years."[37] The letter expressed strong skepticism of Sotheby's international strategy—"Sotheby's is struggling internationally, lagging in newer markets like China and the Middle East"—and called for the removal of William Ruprecht from all his positions.[37]
After Sotheby's instituted a "poison pill" to stop Third Point from growing its position past 10%, Third Point brought a lawsuit in the state of Delaware; however, on May 3, 2014, Vice Chancellor Donald Parsons of the Delaware Court of Chancery ruled that the auction house was justified in its use of the corporate action. On May 5, Loeb and Sotheby's reached an agreement, stipulating that Loeb, Olivier Reza and Harry J. Wilson join the board in exchange for Third Point having an ownership cap at 15%. William Ruprecht remained CEO and the proxy contest ceased.[38][39] After 35 years at Sotheby's, Ruprecht retired as CEO. On March 16, 2015, Sotheby's named Tad Smith as its new president and chief executive.[40][41]
Fanuc[edit]
In late 2014, Loeb's Third Point took a stake in Fanuc, a robotics and computer numerical controls firm. Prior, Fanuc seldom made direct contact with its investors but in March 2014, the company decided "it would start talking to shareholders" and "return some of its cash to them." Loeb met with Fanuc's President, Yoshiharu Inaba, with encouragement from Japan's government officials, and was deemed a top prospect for "shaking up Japanese firms."[42][43][44]
Ligand Pharmaceuticals[edit]
In January 2007, when John Higgins became CEO of Ligand Pharmaceuticals, Loeb bought into the biotech firm to cut its losses and grow revenue. Loeb invested $50 million, increased the company’s profit to $250 million, and bought back $68 million in stock.[45]
Seven & I[edit]
In April 2016, Loeb won a battle in his drive to shake up corporate Japan who had "been sheltered from agitating investors." Seven & I Holdings Co.'s board was planning to replace Ryuichi Isaka as head of the company however, Loeb recommended Isaka as a successor to Toshifumi Suzuki, chairman and chief executive. On April 7, Suzuki resigned after losing a boardroom dispute with Loeb. Loeb wrote in a March 27, 2016 letter to Seven & I directors, "Mr. Isaka should be rewarded—not demoted—for his performance and commitment to delivering results for shareholders... This isn’t a dynasty. This is a corporation."[46][47][48] Loeb has pushed for the company to focus on its convenience store line while ridding its plans to expand its department and supermarket store franchises.[49]
Nestle[edit]
On 27 June 2017, Loeb announced to invest $3B into Nestle shares.[50]
Investment philosophy[edit]
New York magazine noted that Loeb's "preferred strategy" is to buy into troubled companies, replace inefficient management, and return the companies to profitability, which "is the key to his success."[3]
Letters[edit]
On Wall Street, Loeb has a reputation for "financial savvy" and for "his withering criticism of corporate executives who are unfortunate enough to stumble in his sights".[9] One of Loeb's signature tactics involves letter-writing:

Loeb is well known in Hedgeworld for his attacks on what he views as greedy execs who also happen to be depressing shareholder value. Of shares he owns. "The moral-indignation business", Loeb sometimes calls it. "Hedge-fund guys love to read Loeb's attacks; 'he articulates what people feel', says one."[3]

Often these letters cite the results of investigations he has ordered, detailing management decisions and actions he considers detrimental to shareholder value. The letters usually accompany his government filings.[3] Loeb once spent more than $4 million to increase his stake in a company to more than 5%, the statutory threshold requiring investor filings with the SEC, in order to file one of his letters criticizing the firm's management.[3] According to New York magazine, "Loeb is proud of his letters, which are thorough, well argued, and filled with clever turns of phrase. (He had a batch prepared for his high-school English teacher.)"[3] A 2005 New Yorker "The Talk of the Town" item described him as "a kind of investor's H. L. Mencken."[51]
In a 2005 letter responding to a job inquiry by a U.K. fund manager Loeb bristled at the applicant's reference to his (the applicant's) "place in society", telling the applicant that he would "have plenty of time to discuss your 'place in society' with the other fellows at the club." At Third Point, Loeb explained, "'one's place in society' does not matter at all. We are a bunch of scrappy guys from diverse backgrounds (Jewish, Muslim, Hindu etc) who enjoy outwitting pompous asses like yourself in financial markets globally."[52] Similarly, in a September 2005 letter to Ligand Pharmaceuticals CEO David Robinson, Loeb expressed wonder that Ligand's board of directors had not shown Robinson "the door long ago – accompanied by a well worn boot planted in the backside."[52]
Loeb sent a letter to John Collins, chairman and CEO of InterCept, in 2004, accusing InterCept of following "a 'good ol' boy' set of ethics", pointing out that InterCept employed Collins' daughter and son-in-law, the latter of whom Loeb had recently reached by phone on a golf course during working hours. Loeb further noted his discovery that InterCept leased a jet from a partnership controlled by Collins and another board member.[52]
He wrote to Irik Sevin, CEO of Star Gas Partners, in February 2005, calling him "one of the most dangerous and incompetent executives in America" and accusing him of "ineptitude" and of using the firm as his "personal 'honey pot'". He wrote: "I was amused to learn, in the course of our investigation, that at Cornell University there is an 'Irik Sevin Scholarship'. One can only pity the poor student who suffers the indignity of attaching your name to his academic record." Loeb demanded the resignation from the firm's board of Sevin's "elderly 78-year old mum" and insisted that Sevin also "step down … so that you can do what you do best: retreat to your waterfront mansion in the Hamptons where you can play tennis and hobnob with your fellow socialites."[52]
A 2005 New York Times article reported that many hedge-fund managers were now writing letters to the SEC demanding executives take specific actions and cited Loeb's letter to Sevin as exemplary of the genre, noting that three weeks after the letter was sent, "Sevin was gone, and a jubilant Mr. Loeb sent out an e-mail message to friends and associates declaring a 'huge victory for Third Point.'"[53]
Personal life[edit]
Loeb married Margaret Davidson Munzer on July 4, 2004,[51] at his beach house in East Hampton, New York.[5] The couple has three children.[54] Loeb is a founding "Master Player" of Portfolios with Purpose, an annual virtual stock trading contest that raises money for charitable causes of the winning contestants' choice.[55]
Loeb has called himself a "lifelong surfer" with "a 'secret spot' in the Caribbean". His second favorite surfing spot is in Indonesia.[56] Third Point takes its name from "a break at Malibu's Surfrider Beach."[57]
In 2014, Loeb was reported as one of a number of "prominent investors [who] have taken to Transcendental Meditation".[58]
Loeb was co-chair of the Governors for Investors Industry (2013).[59] He is a trustee of Mount Sinai Hospital, the Manhattan Institute, the U.S. Olympic Committee and the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art. He is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and of the National Council of the American Enterprise Institute.[59]
Political and economic views[edit]
Loeb has donated to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, Friends for Harry Reid, Obama for America, Forward Together PAC, Prosperity PAC, Straight Talk America, and the Volunteer PAC. In 2013, Loeb was a signatory to an amicus curiae brief submitted to the U.S. Supreme Court in Hollingsworth v. Perry, in support of same-sex marriage.[60][61][62][63]
In 2015, Loeb, Paul Singer and Tim Gill helped fund Freedom For All Americans to promote LGBT issues in states and local communities in the United States.[64]
Wealth and philanthropy[edit]
According to Forbes Magazine, his net worth is $2.9 billion USD as of February 2017.[65]
The Daniel S Loeb Family Third Point Foundation[edit]
The Daniel S Loeb Family Third Point Foundation earned $6.39 million in profits in 2011 and had $4.45 billion in assets at the end of that year, making it one of the largest and highest-earning private foundations. Its nonprofit administrative expense ratio, a measure of its operating and administrating expenses, was 0.44%, compared to the 2011 average of 19.7% for all private foundations.[66]
Loeb is heavily involved in education reform efforts, specifically supporting charter schools.[67] Loeb is chairman of the board of Success Academy Charter Schools in Brooklyn.[16] In June 2013, he pledged to donate $3 million to Success Academy Charter Schools.[68] He endowed the Daniel S. Loeb Scholarship for undergraduate study at Columbia University. Since 2004, he has been a trustee of Prep for Prep, an organization in New York City that prepares underprivileged children to attend competitive private schools. He is active in the Jewish Enrichment Center, which provides young people with an education in Judaism. Additionally, he is a co-founder of Students First New York, the state branch of the national education advocacy organization.[10]
On February 20, 2014, Loeb attended a discussion between the American Enterprise Institute and the Dalai Lama. The two worldviews debated the morality of capitalism and free enterprise. In Loeb's presentation, he said he practices Ashtanga yoga and applies yoga principles to his business and his decision-making. He noted that these principles aided in his decision to donate to a charter school in the Bronx, which is now ranked third in the state of New York.[69][70]
In October 2011, Loeb challenged three former Navy SEALs to run the "MightyMan" Half Iron Triathlon with him and his team in Montauk, New York. He made a sizable contribution for each Navy SEAL Foundation director who completed the triathlon to raise funds for the foundation.[71][72][73]
In 2011, 2012, and 2013, Loeb and his wife made significant donations to the Alzheimer's Drug Discovery Foundation (ADDF), which funds over 400 Alzheimer's drug discovery programs in academic centers and biotechnology companies in 18 different countries.[74][75][76]
Loeb and his wife have also donated to the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, Ovarian Cancer Research Fund, Chai Lifeline, and the Michael J. Fox Foundation.[77]
Art collection[edit]
He is a prominent art collector and the walls at his Park Avenue office are covered with paintings", according to a New York Times August 26, 2013 article.[78] At a Sotheby's auction in 2009, Manhattan dealer Larry Gagosian purchased Jeff Koons' Baroque Egg With Bow (Turquoise/Magenta) for $5.4 million from Loeb, who had bought it from the Gagosian Gallery in 2004 for about $3 million.[79]
Loeb has traced his love of art to his student years at Columbia, when he saw Poussin's The Rape of the Sabine Women at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and took an art humanities class as part of the core curriculum. The "prep school kids" treated him like a "jerk", thinking they "all knew so much more", but in the end "I got one of two A's, and all the prep school snotty kids didn't."[80]
Business Insider placed Loeb at the top of its list of "Wall Street's 25 Most Serious Art Collectors", noting he owns works by Mike Kelley, Richard Prince, Basquiat, Andy Warhol and Cindy Sherman, and that he “has his own curator.”[81]

Stakeholdings[edit]
Massey Energy[edit]
After a proxy fight, Third Point announced in June 2006 that Loeb and an ally, Todd Q. Swanson, would join the board of Massey Energy, the fourth-largest coal producer in the United States. The New York Times reported that Third Point owned 5.9% of Massey and that Loeb had been “feuding with the company for several months”, criticizing the management and bringing attention to executive trips to the Bahamas, Las Vegas, and West Palm Beach, Florida, on the company jet.
In one note, Loeb wrote, “Massey's C.E.O. is provided a company-owned home to live in ... In fact, after he leaves the company, the house is to be given to him as a parting gift. No one else at the company gets free housing, much less an entire home as a retirement gift. What kind of example does it set when a C.E.O. who makes $33.7 million in a single year is given free housing while the company is having difficulty retaining its mine workers?”[5]
Acorda Therapeutics[edit]
In February 2007, Loeb asked Acorda Therapeutics, in which Third Point had a 9.9% stake, to sell itself to a larger U.S. pharmaceutical firm, arguing that a larger company with more experience “would be able to expedite Fampridine SR”, a multiple sclerosis drug produced by Acorda, through the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval process "and into the hands of patients more quickly and efficiently”. He argued that if Acorda to continue going it alone or to seek partnership with a European firm “would be a tremendous injustice not only to multiple sclerosis patients, who should receive such an effective drug in the most expeditious manner possible, but also to your public shareholders, who have supported Fampridine SR's development”. His letter sent Acorda shares up nearly 6.9%.[6]
Acorda responded with a statement indicating that its board of directors “continually evaluates ways to maximize shareholder value and to serve the best interests of all shareholders”.[7] In May 2007, Third Point disclosed that it had lowered its stake in Acorda to 4.1%.[8]
Yahoo[edit]
Board appointment[edit]
After Third Point disclosed its stake in Yahoo on September 8, 2011, calling for the resignations of four directors, Yahoo set up a conference call with Loeb, Jerry Yang of Yahoo, and one of the directors in question, Roy Bostock. Loeb said that the conversation concluded with “Mr. Bostock’s abrupt unilateral termination of the call”. Bostock, however, claimed that he had “said that he had other shareholders to attend to and ended the phone call”.[9]
Loeb informed Yahoo CEO Scott Thompson in a March 2012 letter that Third Point wanted four seats on the firm's board. At the time Third Point owned about 5.3% of the firm. Yahoo sought to compromise by accepting one of Loeb's board nominees, Harry Wilson, a restructuring specialist, plus “another candidate acceptable to the two sides”, but Loeb insisted on being added himself to the board. Yahoo refused, telling Loeb, according to his own account, that “my experience and knowledge 'would not be additive to the Board' and that as Yahoo's largest outside shareholder, I would be 'conflicted' as a Director. ... Only in an illogical Alice-in-Wonderland world would a shareholder be deemed to be conflicted from representing the interests of other shareholders because he is, well, a shareholder too.” Loeb charged that the “Board's evaluation of our candidates” made “a mockery of good principles of corporate governance”. In response to Yahoo's charge that Third Point was a “short-term investor”, Loeb responded that “this 'long-term vs. short-term' excuse is a canard and particularly inapt in the case of Yahoo. If there ever was a company in need of a sense of urgency, it is this one”. Loeb added that the “real issue is not short-term versus long-term but about Board representatives who have skin in the game and will exercise sound business judgment”.[10]
In a May 2012 letter to Yahoo's directors, Loeb noted that according to Yahoo's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, newly hired CEO Scott Thompson had a bachelor's degree in accounting and computer science, whereas a simple Google search revealed that his degree was “in accounting only”; Thompson resigned ten days later.[11] On the same day, Loeb, Wilson, and another Third Point candidate, Michael J. Wolf, were named to the Yahoo's board.[12]
Resignation from board[edit]
Marissa Mayer's appointment as CEO to replace Thompson was seen as the culmination of Loeb's efforts to transform Yahoo. Loeb, Wilson, and Wolf submitted their resignations from Yahoo's board in July 2013, and Yahoo bought back 40 million shares from Third Point, leaving the hedge fund's ownership at less than 2%, so the three executives had to leave. However, the hedge fund gained a profit of $1 billion. Marissa Mayer issued a statement praising Loeb: “Daniel Loeb had the vision to see Yahoo for its immense potential...While there's still a lot of work ahead, they've given us a great foundation”.[13] Steven Davidoff of New York Times observed that Yahoo "seem[ed] like damaged goods now that it has been abandoned by one of its biggest investors, Daniel S. Loeb”, noting that Yahoo's share buyback had “the whiff of greenmail, or repurchasing stock to make an investor go away”.[14]
According to a January 2014 Vanity Fair profile, when Loeb told Mayer he wanted to sell "20 million shares, or one-third of his remaining holdings", Mayer stated Yahoo would (buy back the stock at a guaranteed $29.11 per share)—but only if he sold 40 million shares. This transaction would "bring Loeb’s stake below the 2 percent threshold, which meant that he and the other two representatives would have to leave the board".[15] Loeb also signed a standstill agreement in 2013 that bars him from activist investing in Yahoo until 2018.[16]
Sotheby's[edit]
Loeb's announcement in August 2013 stated that he acquired a 5.7% stake in Sotheby's, causing its shares to rise 3%.[17] Sotheby's announced in September 2013 that it “was considering moves like a share repurchase or raising its dividend”, a response to Third Point's having raised its stake in the company. The New York Times reported that Sotheby's share price had “climbed about 5 percent since Third Point disclosed its increased stake”.[18]
Loeb disclosed on October 2, 2013, that he was now Sotheby's largest shareholder, with a 9.3% stake. On the same date he announced his desire to join Sotheby's board and called for the resignation of chairman and CEO William F. Ruprecht. “Sotheby's is like an old master painting in desperate need of restoration”, Loeb wrote in a letter to the SEC, charging that a “crisis of management” at the firm had resulted in “dysfunctional divisions and a fractured culture”, as well as “chronically weak operating margins and deteriorating competitive position relative to Christie's”, Sotheby's main competitor. The firm, he wrote, required new directors and needed for the positions of chairman and CEO to be filled by two different persons, not one. In a later statement, Loeb said that “Sotheby's malaise is a result of a lack of leadership and strategic vision at its highest levels”, criticized Ruprecht's $6.3 million salary, and chastised the Sotheby's directors for spending “hundreds of thousands of dollars” in shareholder funds on a single extravagant meal banquet.[19]
Sotheby's replied to Loeb with a statement maintaining that its “actions as a leader in the global art business have been producing superior results—including a share price increase exceeding the Standard & Poor's MidCap Index over the one, five and ten year periods”.[20]
Adam Lindeman of the New York Observer, in an article headlined “Barbarians at Sotheby's Gate?”, suggested that the “firefight” between Loeb and Sotheby's would “benefit Sotheby's”, a place Lindeman described as having “a British, clubby feeling of privilege and stuffy pedigree”, compared to the “considerably warmer” feel of Christie's.[21]
Ruprecht announced his resignation in November 2014, sending Sotheby's shares up around 7% a day.[22]
Sony[edit]
Loeb criticized the poor performance of Sony's summer 2013 films After Earth and White House Down in a letter issued that year, expressing concern that Sony CEO Kazuo Hirai “does not worry about a division that has just released 2013’s versions of Waterworld and Ishtar back-to-back”. Loeb proposed a "partial spinoff" (handing about 15% to 20% to existing shareholders) of Sony's entertainment business", and even offered to "backstop the initial public offering up to $2 billion to ensure its success".[23][24] “Given entertainment's perpetual underperformance”, Loeb wrote, “perhaps Sony's reluctance to discuss it candidly stems from (understandable) embarrassment”.[25] In addition to asking Sony to spin off its entertainment assets, Loeb sought a spinoff of its financial services division. Loeb's letter sent Sony stock up about 10%. At the time Third Point was Sony’s largest shareholder with a 6.5% stake.[12]
Sony's board announced on May 22, 2013, that it was considering Loeb's proposal to spin off its entertainment division. “We will engage in thorough discussions at the board level to decide on Sony's response ... [I]t is an important matter that relates to Sony's core businesses and management, so the board must hold ample discussions”, Hirai said. The New York Times noted that Japanese corporations “have a history of ignoring letters from shareholders calling for overhauls”.[26]
Hirai ultimately rejected Loeb's suggestion, saying, “Sony's entertainment businesses are critical to our corporate strategy and will be important drivers of growth, and I am firmly committed to assuring their growth, to improving their profitability and to aggressively leveraging their collaboration with our electronics and service business”. One factor in Hirai's decision was the counsel of advisers who argued, “that subsidiary initial public offerings have rarely succeeded”. Sony's sole concession to Loeb was an agreement “to disclose more information about the entertainment unit's financials”. Third Point expressed disappointment in Sony's decision, but welcomed “Sony's commitment to greater transparency”.[27]
MGM[edit]
The Hollywood Reporter reported in May 2013 that Loeb was buying up shares of MGM,[12] leading CNBC commentators to note that Loeb, who already owned stakes in Yahoo, Sony, and Virgin Media, seemed to be “becoming something of a media mogul".[28] Bloomberg noted in September 2013 that Third Point was now “one of MGM’s top five owners, according to a person with knowledge of the situation”.[29]
Fanuc[edit]
In late 2014, Third Point took a stake in Fanuc, a robotics and computer numerical controls firm. Prior, Fanuc seldom made direct contact with its investors but in March 2014, the company decided "it would start talking to shareholders" and "return some of its cash to them." Loeb has met with Fanuc's President, Yoshiharu Inaba, with encouragement from Japan's government officials, who are aiming to "shak[e] up companies’ slothful boards."[30]
Ligand Pharmaceuticals[edit]
After Ligand Pharmaceuticals hired John Higgins as its new CEO in January 2007, Third Point Management invested in the biotech firm and was able to cut its losses. Since 2011, Ligand Pharmaceuticals tripled its stocks and doubled its revenue to $65 million.[31]
Baxter International[edit]
In August 2015, Third Point took a 7 percent stake, over $2 billion, in Baxter International.[32] In a letter to Baxter's board, Loeb wrote that he was “most impressed” by the company’s willingness to consider adding new directors to go along with a new CEO and requested for Baxter CEO Robert Parkinson for two seats on the board.[33][34] Baxter reached a settlement with Third Point agreeing to add Munib Islam to its board.[35] Loeb also disapproved of the board's current setup, in which directors do not face re-election every year, and described it as “shareholder-unfriendly and archaic.”[36] Baxter then agreed to hold annual elections for its board of directors after Loeb's criticism.[35]
Third Point funds[edit]
Third Point LLC serves as the investment manager of Third Point Partners Qualified L.P., Third Point Partners L.P., Third Point Offshore Master Fund L.P., and Third Point Ultra Master Fund L.P.[37] Third Point Partners is Third Point's oldest fund.[38]
According to CNBC, Third Point has ranked among the industry's best performers, returning an average of 19 percent a year since its launch.[39]
Third Point Re[edit]
Third Point Reinsurance Ltd., through its class 4 reinsurance company, Third Point Reinsurance Company Ltd., is a Bermuda-based specialty property and casualty reinsure. Together they are known as Third Point Re. The firm was incorporated on October 6, 2011. Its investable assets are managed by Third Point LLC, and Loeb is one of its founding shareholders. Third Point Re directly owns its own investments, which, according to its website, “are held in a separate account and managed by Third Point LLC on substantially the same basis as its main hedge funds, including Third Point Partners L.P., the original Third Point LLC hedge fund”. A.M. Best Company gave Third Point Re an A- (Excellent) financial strength rating in January 2012.[38] Since 1995, Third Point Re has generated one of the best long-term investment track records in history, averaging 19.5% annual returns.[40]
Third Point Re raised approximately $276 million in an IPO in August 2013. That same month, it was reported that Third Point Re qualified as an “emerging growth company” under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act.[41]
Third Point Offshore Investors Ltd.[edit]
Third Point Offshore Investors Limited is a closed-ended limited liability investment company registered and incorporated in Guernsey.[41][42] It was listed on the London Stock Exchange in 2007. “We believe that we will be the first U.S. hedge fund to list a single manager fund on the London Stock Exchange”, Loeb said.[43]
2010 letter about Bernanke[edit]
In a December 2010 letter to investors, Loeb described a recent 60 Minutes interview with Federal Reserve chairman Ben S. Bernanke as “a staged infomercial rather than a serious interview”. In the letter he largely rejected the "narrative" that Bernanke had constructed around the global financial crisis and the Fed's response to it.
Bernanke's “narrative arc...posits that the global economy would have collapsed and unemployment would have exceeded levels of the Great Depression had the Fed not intervened to rescue the financial system. Having set the stage for how we were saved from global financial Armageddon once before and therefore ought to trust the Fed’s intervention blindly again, Chairman Bernanke’s next chapter states that the Fed’s latest $600 billion market intervention will alleviate our seemingly intractable high levels of unemployment, which otherwise would continue indefinitely”, Loeb complained, rejecting Bernanke's “narrative” as contrary to “certain facts and our own experience – like the Fed's admitted inability to see the crisis coming or to regulate effectively the banks under its purview”. Loeb called “Bernanke’s devotion to the righteousness of his narrative” “striking”, adding that “every actor in the financial system still ought to be asking how things went so terribly wrong”, not inventing a narrative “that emancipates one from blame and promises future forecasting precision”.
Loeb warned of “the dangers of believing too much in the stories we tell ourselves” and said that highly placed individual such as Bernanke should “be willing to search out facts and admit wrongdoing”. At Third Point, Loeb wrote, “we are truth seekers and problem solvers. We must satisfy ourselves with determining ranges of outcomes and potential scenarios rather than searching for, and ultimately fabricating, absolute truths. The only thing we are 100 percent confident in is that we are fallible, we don't have all the answers, and we will make some mistakes”.[44]
Fairfax lawsuit[edit]
The Canadian insurance firm Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd. sued Third Point and other hedge funds in a New Jersey state court in March 2011, charging that Loeb lied to investors when he stated that his “decision to short Fairfax-related positions” was the result of extensive research.[45] New Jersey State Court Judge Stephan C. Hansbury granted the summary judgment motions of Third Point LLC, Daniel S. Loeb, and Jeffrey Perry in December 2011, dismissing the charges against them. “We are gratified that the Judge has put an end to this colossal waste of time and resources”, said Third Point, describing the case as “a blatant case of forum shopping [and] a cynical attempt by Fairfax to manipulate the judicial system and to intimidate institutional investors who had legitimate concerns about Fairfax's financial position”.[46]

Stakeholdings[edit]
Massey Energy[edit]
After a proxy fight, Third Point announced in June 2006 that Loeb and an ally, Todd Q. Swanson, would join the board of Massey Energy, the fourth-largest coal producer in the United States. The New York Times reported that Third Point owned 5.9% of Massey and that Loeb had been “feuding with the company for several months”, criticizing the management and bringing attention to executive trips to the Bahamas, Las Vegas, and West Palm Beach, Florida, on the company jet.
In one note, Loeb wrote, “Massey's C.E.O. is provided a company-owned home to live in ... In fact, after he leaves the company, the house is to be given to him as a parting gift. No one else at the company gets free housing, much less an entire home as a retirement gift. What kind of example does it set when a C.E.O. who makes $33.7 million in a single year is given free housing while the company is having difficulty retaining its mine workers?”[5]
Acorda Therapeutics[edit]
In February 2007, Loeb asked Acorda Therapeutics, in which Third Point had a 9.9% stake, to sell itself to a larger U.S. pharmaceutical firm, arguing that a larger company with more experience “would be able to expedite Fampridine SR”, a multiple sclerosis drug produced by Acorda, through the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval process "and into the hands of patients more quickly and efficiently”. He argued that if Acorda to continue going it alone or to seek partnership with a European firm “would be a tremendous injustice not only to multiple sclerosis patients, who should receive such an effective drug in the most expeditious manner possible, but also to your public shareholders, who have supported Fampridine SR's development”. His letter sent Acorda shares up nearly 6.9%.[6]
Acorda responded with a statement indicating that its board of directors “continually evaluates ways to maximize shareholder value and to serve the best interests of all shareholders”.[7] In May 2007, Third Point disclosed that it had lowered its stake in Acorda to 4.1%.[8]
Yahoo[edit]
Board appointment[edit]
After Third Point disclosed its stake in Yahoo on September 8, 2011, calling for the resignations of four directors, Yahoo set up a conference call with Loeb, Jerry Yang of Yahoo, and one of the directors in question, Roy Bostock. Loeb said that the conversation concluded with “Mr. Bostock’s abrupt unilateral termination of the call”. Bostock, however, claimed that he had “said that he had other shareholders to attend to and ended the phone call”.[9]
Loeb informed Yahoo CEO Scott Thompson in a March 2012 letter that Third Point wanted four seats on the firm's board. At the time Third Point owned about 5.3% of the firm. Yahoo sought to compromise by accepting one of Loeb's board nominees, Harry Wilson, a restructuring specialist, plus “another candidate acceptable to the two sides”, but Loeb insisted on being added himself to the board. Yahoo refused, telling Loeb, according to his own account, that “my experience and knowledge 'would not be additive to the Board' and that as Yahoo's largest outside shareholder, I would be 'conflicted' as a Director. ... Only in an illogical Alice-in-Wonderland world would a shareholder be deemed to be conflicted from representing the interests of other shareholders because he is, well, a shareholder too.” Loeb charged that the “Board's evaluation of our candidates” made “a mockery of good principles of corporate governance”. In response to Yahoo's charge that Third Point was a “short-term investor”, Loeb responded that “this 'long-term vs. short-term' excuse is a canard and particularly inapt in the case of Yahoo. If there ever was a company in need of a sense of urgency, it is this one”. Loeb added that the “real issue is not short-term versus long-term but about Board representatives who have skin in the game and will exercise sound business judgment”.[10]
In a May 2012 letter to Yahoo's directors, Loeb noted that according to Yahoo's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, newly hired CEO Scott Thompson had a bachelor's degree in accounting and computer science, whereas a simple Google search revealed that his degree was “in accounting only”; Thompson resigned ten days later.[11] On the same day, Loeb, Wilson, and another Third Point candidate, Michael J. Wolf, were named to the Yahoo's board.[12]
Resignation from board[edit]
Marissa Mayer's appointment as CEO to replace Thompson was seen as the culmination of Loeb's efforts to transform Yahoo. Loeb, Wilson, and Wolf submitted their resignations from Yahoo's board in July 2013, and Yahoo bought back 40 million shares from Third Point, leaving the hedge fund's ownership at less than 2%, so the three executives had to leave. However, the hedge fund gained a profit of $1 billion. Marissa Mayer issued a statement praising Loeb: “Daniel Loeb had the vision to see Yahoo for its immense potential...While there's still a lot of work ahead, they've given us a great foundation”.[13] Steven Davidoff of New York Times observed that Yahoo "seem[ed] like damaged goods now that it has been abandoned by one of its biggest investors, Daniel S. Loeb”, noting that Yahoo's share buyback had “the whiff of greenmail, or repurchasing stock to make an investor go away”.[14]
According to a January 2014 Vanity Fair profile, when Loeb told Mayer he wanted to sell "20 million shares, or one-third of his remaining holdings", Mayer stated Yahoo would (buy back the stock at a guaranteed $29.11 per share)—but only if he sold 40 million shares. This transaction would "bring Loeb’s stake below the 2 percent threshold, which meant that he and the other two representatives would have to leave the board".[15] Loeb also signed a standstill agreement in 2013 that bars him from activist investing in Yahoo until 2018.[16]
Sotheby's[edit]
Loeb's announcement in August 2013 stated that he acquired a 5.7% stake in Sotheby's, causing its shares to rise 3%.[17] Sotheby's announced in September 2013 that it “was considering moves like a share repurchase or raising its dividend”, a response to Third Point's having raised its stake in the company. The New York Times reported that Sotheby's share price had “climbed about 5 percent since Third Point disclosed its increased stake”.[18]
Loeb disclosed on October 2, 2013, that he was now Sotheby's largest shareholder, with a 9.3% stake. On the same date he announced his desire to join Sotheby's board and called for the resignation of chairman and CEO William F. Ruprecht. “Sotheby's is like an old master painting in desperate need of restoration”, Loeb wrote in a letter to the SEC, charging that a “crisis of management” at the firm had resulted in “dysfunctional divisions and a fractured culture”, as well as “chronically weak operating margins and deteriorating competitive position relative to Christie's”, Sotheby's main competitor. The firm, he wrote, required new directors and needed for the positions of chairman and CEO to be filled by two different persons, not one. In a later statement, Loeb said that “Sotheby's malaise is a result of a lack of leadership and strategic vision at its highest levels”, criticized Ruprecht's $6.3 million salary, and chastised the Sotheby's directors for spending “hundreds of thousands of dollars” in shareholder funds on a single extravagant meal banquet.[19]
Sotheby's replied to Loeb with a statement maintaining that its “actions as a leader in the global art business have been producing superior results—including a share price increase exceeding the Standard & Poor's MidCap Index over the one, five and ten year periods”.[20]
Adam Lindeman of the New York Observer, in an article headlined “Barbarians at Sotheby's Gate?”, suggested that the “firefight” between Loeb and Sotheby's would “benefit Sotheby's”, a place Lindeman described as having “a British, clubby feeling of privilege and stuffy pedigree”, compared to the “considerably warmer” feel of Christie's.[21]
Ruprecht announced his resignation in November 2014, sending Sotheby's shares up around 7% a day.[22]
Sony[edit]
Loeb criticized the poor performance of Sony's summer 2013 films After Earth and White House Down in a letter issued that year, expressing concern that Sony CEO Kazuo Hirai “does not worry about a division that has just released 2013’s versions of Waterworld and Ishtar back-to-back”. Loeb proposed a "partial spinoff" (handing about 15% to 20% to existing shareholders) of Sony's entertainment business", and even offered to "backstop the initial public offering up to $2 billion to ensure its success".[23][24] “Given entertainment's perpetual underperformance”, Loeb wrote, “perhaps Sony's reluctance to discuss it candidly stems from (understandable) embarrassment”.[25] In addition to asking Sony to spin off its entertainment assets, Loeb sought a spinoff of its financial services division. Loeb's letter sent Sony stock up about 10%. At the time Third Point was Sony’s largest shareholder with a 6.5% stake.[12]
Sony's board announced on May 22, 2013, that it was considering Loeb's proposal to spin off its entertainment division. “We will engage in thorough discussions at the board level to decide on Sony's response ... [I]t is an important matter that relates to Sony's core businesses and management, so the board must hold ample discussions”, Hirai said. The New York Times noted that Japanese corporations “have a history of ignoring letters from shareholders calling for overhauls”.[26]
Hirai ultimately rejected Loeb's suggestion, saying, “Sony's entertainment businesses are critical to our corporate strategy and will be important drivers of growth, and I am firmly committed to assuring their growth, to improving their profitability and to aggressively leveraging their collaboration with our electronics and service business”. One factor in Hirai's decision was the counsel of advisers who argued, “that subsidiary initial public offerings have rarely succeeded”. Sony's sole concession to Loeb was an agreement “to disclose more information about the entertainment unit's financials”. Third Point expressed disappointment in Sony's decision, but welcomed “Sony's commitment to greater transparency”.[27]
MGM[edit]
The Hollywood Reporter reported in May 2013 that Loeb was buying up shares of MGM,[12] leading CNBC commentators to note that Loeb, who already owned stakes in Yahoo, Sony, and Virgin Media, seemed to be “becoming something of a media mogul".[28] Bloomberg noted in September 2013 that Third Point was now “one of MGM’s top five owners, according to a person with knowledge of the situation”.[29]
Fanuc[edit]
In late 2014, Third Point took a stake in Fanuc, a robotics and computer numerical controls firm. Prior, Fanuc seldom made direct contact with its investors but in March 2014, the company decided "it would start talking to shareholders" and "return some of its cash to them." Loeb has met with Fanuc's President, Yoshiharu Inaba, with encouragement from Japan's government officials, who are aiming to "shak[e] up companies’ slothful boards."[30]
Ligand Pharmaceuticals[edit]
After Ligand Pharmaceuticals hired John Higgins as its new CEO in January 2007, Third Point Management invested in the biotech firm and was able to cut its losses. Since 2011, Ligand Pharmaceuticals tripled its stocks and doubled its revenue to $65 million.[31]
Baxter International[edit]
In August 2015, Third Point took a 7 percent stake, over $2 billion, in Baxter International.[32] In a letter to Baxter's board, Loeb wrote that he was “most impressed” by the company’s willingness to consider adding new directors to go along with a new CEO and requested for Baxter CEO Robert Parkinson for two seats on the board.[33][34] Baxter reached a settlement with Third Point agreeing to add Munib Islam to its board.[35] Loeb also disapproved of the board's current setup, in which directors do not face re-election every year, and described it as “shareholder-unfriendly and archaic.”[36] Baxter then agreed to hold annual elections for its board of directors after Loeb's criticism.[35]
Third Point funds[edit]
Third Point LLC serves as the investment manager of Third Point Partners Qualified L.P., Third Point Partners L.P., Third Point Offshore Master Fund L.P., and Third Point Ultra Master Fund L.P.[37] Third Point Partners is Third Point's oldest fund.[38]
According to CNBC, Third Point has ranked among the industry's best performers, returning an average of 19 percent a year since its launch.[39]
Third Point Re[edit]
Third Point Reinsurance Ltd., through its class 4 reinsurance company, Third Point Reinsurance Company Ltd., is a Bermuda-based specialty property and casualty reinsure. Together they are known as Third Point Re. The firm was incorporated on October 6, 2011. Its investable assets are managed by Third Point LLC, and Loeb is one of its founding shareholders. Third Point Re directly owns its own investments, which, according to its website, “are held in a separate account and managed by Third Point LLC on substantially the same basis as its main hedge funds, including Third Point Partners L.P., the original Third Point LLC hedge fund”. A.M. Best Company gave Third Point Re an A- (Excellent) financial strength rating in January 2012.[38] Since 1995, Third Point Re has generated one of the best long-term investment track records in history, averaging 19.5% annual returns.[40]
Third Point Re raised approximately $276 million in an IPO in August 2013. That same month, it was reported that Third Point Re qualified as an “emerging growth company” under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act.[41]
Third Point Offshore Investors Ltd.[edit]
Third Point Offshore Investors Limited is a closed-ended limited liability investment company registered and incorporated in Guernsey.[41][42] It was listed on the London Stock Exchange in 2007. “We believe that we will be the first U.S. hedge fund to list a single manager fund on the London Stock Exchange”, Loeb said.[43]
2010 letter about Bernanke[edit]
In a December 2010 letter to investors, Loeb described a recent 60 Minutes interview with Federal Reserve chairman Ben S. Bernanke as “a staged infomercial rather than a serious interview”. In the letter he largely rejected the "narrative" that Bernanke had constructed around the global financial crisis and the Fed's response to it.
Bernanke's “narrative arc...posits that the global economy would have collapsed and unemployment would have exceeded levels of the Great Depression had the Fed not intervened to rescue the financial system. Having set the stage for how we were saved from global financial Armageddon once before and therefore ought to trust the Fed’s intervention blindly again, Chairman Bernanke’s next chapter states that the Fed’s latest $600 billion market intervention will alleviate our seemingly intractable high levels of unemployment, which otherwise would continue indefinitely”, Loeb complained, rejecting Bernanke's “narrative” as contrary to “certain facts and our own experience – like the Fed's admitted inability to see the crisis coming or to regulate effectively the banks under its purview”. Loeb called “Bernanke’s devotion to the righteousness of his narrative” “striking”, adding that “every actor in the financial system still ought to be asking how things went so terribly wrong”, not inventing a narrative “that emancipates one from blame and promises future forecasting precision”.
Loeb warned of “the dangers of believing too much in the stories we tell ourselves” and said that highly placed individual such as Bernanke should “be willing to search out facts and admit wrongdoing”. At Third Point, Loeb wrote, “we are truth seekers and problem solvers. We must satisfy ourselves with determining ranges of outcomes and potential scenarios rather than searching for, and ultimately fabricating, absolute truths. The only thing we are 100 percent confident in is that we are fallible, we don't have all the answers, and we will make some mistakes”.[44]
Fairfax lawsuit[edit]
The Canadian insurance firm Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd. sued Third Point and other hedge funds in a New Jersey state court in March 2011, charging that Loeb lied to investors when he stated that his “decision to short Fairfax-related positions” was the result of extensive research.[45] New Jersey State Court Judge Stephan C. Hansbury granted the summary judgment motions of Third Point LLC, Daniel S. Loeb, and Jeffrey Perry in December 2011, dismissing the charges against them. “We are gratified that the Judge has put an end to this colossal waste of time and resources”, said Third Point, describing the case as “a blatant case of forum shopping [and] a cynical attempt by Fairfax to manipulate the judicial system and to intimidate institutional investors who had legitimate concerns about Fairfax's financial position”.[46]

Stakeholdings[edit]
Massey Energy[edit]
After a proxy fight, Third Point announced in June 2006 that Loeb and an ally, Todd Q. Swanson, would join the board of Massey Energy, the fourth-largest coal producer in the United States. The New York Times reported that Third Point owned 5.9% of Massey and that Loeb had been “feuding with the company for several months”, criticizing the management and bringing attention to executive trips to the Bahamas, Las Vegas, and West Palm Beach, Florida, on the company jet.
In one note, Loeb wrote, “Massey's C.E.O. is provided a company-owned home to live in ... In fact, after he leaves the company, the house is to be given to him as a parting gift. No one else at the company gets free housing, much less an entire home as a retirement gift. What kind of example does it set when a C.E.O. who makes $33.7 million in a single year is given free housing while the company is having difficulty retaining its mine workers?”[5]
Acorda Therapeutics[edit]
In February 2007, Loeb asked Acorda Therapeutics, in which Third Point had a 9.9% stake, to sell itself to a larger U.S. pharmaceutical firm, arguing that a larger company with more experience “would be able to expedite Fampridine SR”, a multiple sclerosis drug produced by Acorda, through the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval process "and into the hands of patients more quickly and efficiently”. He argued that if Acorda to continue going it alone or to seek partnership with a European firm “would be a tremendous injustice not only to multiple sclerosis patients, who should receive such an effective drug in the most expeditious manner possible, but also to your public shareholders, who have supported Fampridine SR's development”. His letter sent Acorda shares up nearly 6.9%.[6]
Acorda responded with a statement indicating that its board of directors “continually evaluates ways to maximize shareholder value and to serve the best interests of all shareholders”.[7] In May 2007, Third Point disclosed that it had lowered its stake in Acorda to 4.1%.[8]
Yahoo[edit]
Board appointment[edit]
After Third Point disclosed its stake in Yahoo on September 8, 2011, calling for the resignations of four directors, Yahoo set up a conference call with Loeb, Jerry Yang of Yahoo, and one of the directors in question, Roy Bostock. Loeb said that the conversation concluded with “Mr. Bostock’s abrupt unilateral termination of the call”. Bostock, however, claimed that he had “said that he had other shareholders to attend to and ended the phone call”.[9]
Loeb informed Yahoo CEO Scott Thompson in a March 2012 letter that Third Point wanted four seats on the firm's board. At the time Third Point owned about 5.3% of the firm. Yahoo sought to compromise by accepting one of Loeb's board nominees, Harry Wilson, a restructuring specialist, plus “another candidate acceptable to the two sides”, but Loeb insisted on being added himself to the board. Yahoo refused, telling Loeb, according to his own account, that “my experience and knowledge 'would not be additive to the Board' and that as Yahoo's largest outside shareholder, I would be 'conflicted' as a Director. ... Only in an illogical Alice-in-Wonderland world would a shareholder be deemed to be conflicted from representing the interests of other shareholders because he is, well, a shareholder too.” Loeb charged that the “Board's evaluation of our candidates” made “a mockery of good principles of corporate governance”. In response to Yahoo's charge that Third Point was a “short-term investor”, Loeb responded that “this 'long-term vs. short-term' excuse is a canard and particularly inapt in the case of Yahoo. If there ever was a company in need of a sense of urgency, it is this one”. Loeb added that the “real issue is not short-term versus long-term but about Board representatives who have skin in the game and will exercise sound business judgment”.[10]
In a May 2012 letter to Yahoo's directors, Loeb noted that according to Yahoo's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, newly hired CEO Scott Thompson had a bachelor's degree in accounting and computer science, whereas a simple Google search revealed that his degree was “in accounting only”; Thompson resigned ten days later.[11] On the same day, Loeb, Wilson, and another Third Point candidate, Michael J. Wolf, were named to the Yahoo's board.[12]
Resignation from board[edit]
Marissa Mayer's appointment as CEO to replace Thompson was seen as the culmination of Loeb's efforts to transform Yahoo. Loeb, Wilson, and Wolf submitted their resignations from Yahoo's board in July 2013, and Yahoo bought back 40 million shares from Third Point, leaving the hedge fund's ownership at less than 2%, so the three executives had to leave. However, the hedge fund gained a profit of $1 billion. Marissa Mayer issued a statement praising Loeb: “Daniel Loeb had the vision to see Yahoo for its immense potential...While there's still a lot of work ahead, they've given us a great foundation”.[13] Steven Davidoff of New York Times observed that Yahoo "seem[ed] like damaged goods now that it has been abandoned by one of its biggest investors, Daniel S. Loeb”, noting that Yahoo's share buyback had “the whiff of greenmail, or repurchasing stock to make an investor go away”.[14]
According to a January 2014 Vanity Fair profile, when Loeb told Mayer he wanted to sell "20 million shares, or one-third of his remaining holdings", Mayer stated Yahoo would (buy back the stock at a guaranteed $29.11 per share)—but only if he sold 40 million shares. This transaction would "bring Loeb’s stake below the 2 percent threshold, which meant that he and the other two representatives would have to leave the board".[15] Loeb also signed a standstill agreement in 2013 that bars him from activist investing in Yahoo until 2018.[16]
Sotheby's[edit]
Loeb's announcement in August 2013 stated that he acquired a 5.7% stake in Sotheby's, causing its shares to rise 3%.[17] Sotheby's announced in September 2013 that it “was considering moves like a share repurchase or raising its dividend”, a response to Third Point's having raised its stake in the company. The New York Times reported that Sotheby's share price had “climbed about 5 percent since Third Point disclosed its increased stake”.[18]
Loeb disclosed on October 2, 2013, that he was now Sotheby's largest shareholder, with a 9.3% stake. On the same date he announced his desire to join Sotheby's board and called for the resignation of chairman and CEO William F. Ruprecht. “Sotheby's is like an old master painting in desperate need of restoration”, Loeb wrote in a letter to the SEC, charging that a “crisis of management” at the firm had resulted in “dysfunctional divisions and a fractured culture”, as well as “chronically weak operating margins and deteriorating competitive position relative to Christie's”, Sotheby's main competitor. The firm, he wrote, required new directors and needed for the positions of chairman and CEO to be filled by two different persons, not one. In a later statement, Loeb said that “Sotheby's malaise is a result of a lack of leadership and strategic vision at its highest levels”, criticized Ruprecht's $6.3 million salary, and chastised the Sotheby's directors for spending “hundreds of thousands of dollars” in shareholder funds on a single extravagant meal banquet.[19]
Sotheby's replied to Loeb with a statement maintaining that its “actions as a leader in the global art business have been producing superior results—including a share price increase exceeding the Standard & Poor's MidCap Index over the one, five and ten year periods”.[20]
Adam Lindeman of the New York Observer, in an article headlined “Barbarians at Sotheby's Gate?”, suggested that the “firefight” between Loeb and Sotheby's would “benefit Sotheby's”, a place Lindeman described as having “a British, clubby feeling of privilege and stuffy pedigree”, compared to the “considerably warmer” feel of Christie's.[21]
Ruprecht announced his resignation in November 2014, sending Sotheby's shares up around 7% a day.[22]
Sony[edit]
Loeb criticized the poor performance of Sony's summer 2013 films After Earth and White House Down in a letter issued that year, expressing concern that Sony CEO Kazuo Hirai “does not worry about a division that has just released 2013’s versions of Waterworld and Ishtar back-to-back”. Loeb proposed a "partial spinoff" (handing about 15% to 20% to existing shareholders) of Sony's entertainment business", and even offered to "backstop the initial public offering up to $2 billion to ensure its success".[23][24] “Given entertainment's perpetual underperformance”, Loeb wrote, “perhaps Sony's reluctance to discuss it candidly stems from (understandable) embarrassment”.[25] In addition to asking Sony to spin off its entertainment assets, Loeb sought a spinoff of its financial services division. Loeb's letter sent Sony stock up about 10%. At the time Third Point was Sony’s largest shareholder with a 6.5% stake.[12]
Sony's board announced on May 22, 2013, that it was considering Loeb's proposal to spin off its entertainment division. “We will engage in thorough discussions at the board level to decide on Sony's response ... [I]t is an important matter that relates to Sony's core businesses and management, so the board must hold ample discussions”, Hirai said. The New York Times noted that Japanese corporations “have a history of ignoring letters from shareholders calling for overhauls”.[26]
Hirai ultimately rejected Loeb's suggestion, saying, “Sony's entertainment businesses are critical to our corporate strategy and will be important drivers of growth, and I am firmly committed to assuring their growth, to improving their profitability and to aggressively leveraging their collaboration with our electronics and service business”. One factor in Hirai's decision was the counsel of advisers who argued, “that subsidiary initial public offerings have rarely succeeded”. Sony's sole concession to Loeb was an agreement “to disclose more information about the entertainment unit's financials”. Third Point expressed disappointment in Sony's decision, but welcomed “Sony's commitment to greater transparency”.[27]
MGM[edit]
The Hollywood Reporter reported in May 2013 that Loeb was buying up shares of MGM,[12] leading CNBC commentators to note that Loeb, who already owned stakes in Yahoo, Sony, and Virgin Media, seemed to be “becoming something of a media mogul".[28] Bloomberg noted in September 2013 that Third Point was now “one of MGM’s top five owners, according to a person with knowledge of the situation”.[29]
Fanuc[edit]
In late 2014, Third Point took a stake in Fanuc, a robotics and computer numerical controls firm. Prior, Fanuc seldom made direct contact with its investors but in March 2014, the company decided "it would start talking to shareholders" and "return some of its cash to them." Loeb has met with Fanuc's President, Yoshiharu Inaba, with encouragement from Japan's government officials, who are aiming to "shak[e] up companies’ slothful boards."[30]
Ligand Pharmaceuticals[edit]
After Ligand Pharmaceuticals hired John Higgins as its new CEO in January 2007, Third Point Management invested in the biotech firm and was able to cut its losses. Since 2011, Ligand Pharmaceuticals tripled its stocks and doubled its revenue to $65 million.[31]
Baxter International[edit]
In August 2015, Third Point took a 7 percent stake, over $2 billion, in Baxter International.[32] In a letter to Baxter's board, Loeb wrote that he was “most impressed” by the company’s willingness to consider adding new directors to go along with a new CEO and requested for Baxter CEO Robert Parkinson for two seats on the board.[33][34] Baxter reached a settlement with Third Point agreeing to add Munib Islam to its board.[35] Loeb also disapproved of the board's current setup, in which directors do not face re-election every year, and described it as “shareholder-unfriendly and archaic.”[36] Baxter then agreed to hold annual elections for its board of directors after Loeb's criticism.[35]
Third Point funds[edit]
Third Point LLC serves as the investment manager of Third Point Partners Qualified L.P., Third Point Partners L.P., Third Point Offshore Master Fund L.P., and Third Point Ultra Master Fund L.P.[37] Third Point Partners is Third Point's oldest fund.[38]
According to CNBC, Third Point has ranked among the industry's best performers, returning an average of 19 percent a year since its launch.[39]
Third Point Re[edit]
Third Point Reinsurance Ltd., through its class 4 reinsurance company, Third Point Reinsurance Company Ltd., is a Bermuda-based specialty property and casualty reinsure. Together they are known as Third Point Re. The firm was incorporated on October 6, 2011. Its investable assets are managed by Third Point LLC, and Loeb is one of its founding shareholders. Third Point Re directly owns its own investments, which, according to its website, “are held in a separate account and managed by Third Point LLC on substantially the same basis as its main hedge funds, including Third Point Partners L.P., the original Third Point LLC hedge fund”. A.M. Best Company gave Third Point Re an A- (Excellent) financial strength rating in January 2012.[38] Since 1995, Third Point Re has generated one of the best long-term investment track records in history, averaging 19.5% annual returns.[40]
Third Point Re raised approximately $276 million in an IPO in August 2013. That same month, it was reported that Third Point Re qualified as an “emerging growth company” under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act.[41]
Third Point Offshore Investors Ltd.[edit]
Third Point Offshore Investors Limited is a closed-ended limited liability investment company registered and incorporated in Guernsey.[41][42] It was listed on the London Stock Exchange in 2007. “We believe that we will be the first U.S. hedge fund to list a single manager fund on the London Stock Exchange”, Loeb said.[43]
2010 letter about Bernanke[edit]
In a December 2010 letter to investors, Loeb described a recent 60 Minutes interview with Federal Reserve chairman Ben S. Bernanke as “a staged infomercial rather than a serious interview”. In the letter he largely rejected the "narrative" that Bernanke had constructed around the global financial crisis and the Fed's response to it.
Bernanke's “narrative arc...posits that the global economy would have collapsed and unemployment would have exceeded levels of the Great Depression had the Fed not intervened to rescue the financial system. Having set the stage for how we were saved from global financial Armageddon once before and therefore ought to trust the Fed’s intervention blindly again, Chairman Bernanke’s next chapter states that the Fed’s latest $600 billion market intervention will alleviate our seemingly intractable high levels of unemployment, which otherwise would continue indefinitely”, Loeb complained, rejecting Bernanke's “narrative” as contrary to “certain facts and our own experience – like the Fed's admitted inability to see the crisis coming or to regulate effectively the banks under its purview”. Loeb called “Bernanke’s devotion to the righteousness of his narrative” “striking”, adding that “every actor in the financial system still ought to be asking how things went so terribly wrong”, not inventing a narrative “that emancipates one from blame and promises future forecasting precision”.
Loeb warned of “the dangers of believing too much in the stories we tell ourselves” and said that highly placed individual such as Bernanke should “be willing to search out facts and admit wrongdoing”. At Third Point, Loeb wrote, “we are truth seekers and problem solvers. We must satisfy ourselves with determining ranges of outcomes and potential scenarios rather than searching for, and ultimately fabricating, absolute truths. The only thing we are 100 percent confident in is that we are fallible, we don't have all the answers, and we will make some mistakes”.[44]
Fairfax lawsuit[edit]
The Canadian insurance firm Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd. sued Third Point and other hedge funds in a New Jersey state court in March 2011, charging that Loeb lied to investors when he stated that his “decision to short Fairfax-related positions” was the result of extensive research.[45] New Jersey State Court Judge Stephan C. Hansbury granted the summary judgment motions of Third Point LLC, Daniel S. Loeb, and Jeffrey Perry in December 2011, dismissing the charges against them. “We are gratified that the Judge has put an end to this colossal waste of time and resources”, said Third Point, describing the case as “a blatant case of forum shopping [and] a cynical attempt by Fairfax to manipulate the judicial system and to intimidate institutional investors who had legitimate concerns about Fairfax's financial position”.[46]

LONDON — In revealing his investment position in Nestlé on Sunday, the hedge fund manager Daniel S. Loeb urged the company to consider slimming down, as well as buying back its stock.On Tuesday, Nestlé said it was indeed prepared to spend billions of dollars on buybacks — but the company also suggested that it might pursue a number of acquisitions in addition to shedding businesses.Nestlé said it could buy back almost $21 billion of its shares over the next three years to create value for its shareholders. The company added that it would consider making acquisitions in fast-growing parts of its business portfolio, including coffee, pet care, bottled water and consumer health care.The plan suggests significant change at Nestlé, the Swiss food giant whose products include Kit Kat bars and Stouffer’s frozen pizzas, at a time when its once-enviable growth rates have declined as consumer tastes change.

Nestlé said that the plans it announced on Tuesday had arisen from a regular review of the company’s capital positions — its top managers began the review in January — and that the announcement was not a response to Mr. Loeb’s activist campaign.


            How Nestlé Makes Its Money        

            Nestlé’s products include candy, water, dairy and pet food, though its candy business has waned, especially as fewer Americans have displayed an appetite for sweets.

While the company traditionally presents such proposals in September, this time it chose to release the announcement the same day it received regulatory clearance to do so.Yet Nestlé’s new strategic course came out only two days after Mr. Loeb’s hedge fund, Third Point, emerged as one of the company’s biggest shareholders and presented suggestions aimed at shaking up what Third Point described as a significant underperformer.Among Mr. Loeb’s suggestions was to trim a portfolio of some 2,000 brands to remove dead weight.Tuesday’s announcement revealed that Nestlé had reached some of the same conclusions. The company said its board was prepared to spend up to 20 billion Swiss francs on stock buybacks. And the conglomerate said it planned to continue to “adjust” its portfolio of operations.

Nestlé announced this month that it was considering a sale of its American candy business, home of Gobstoppers and Butterfinger bars, with the unit in a prolonged sales slump.Nestlé, however, also emphasized that it was prepared to spend, and potentially spend a lot, to bolster the fast-growing parts of its business. The areas it named as candidates for deal making include those that the company’s chief executive, Ulf Mark Schneider, identified this year as important growth areas.Such deals would be a higher priority than the stock buybacks: Nestlé said the bulk of its share repurchases would take place in 2019 and 2020 to let the company make takeovers first.The company said it was open to improving its profit margins, another topic broached by Third Point.But one of Mr. Loeb’s suggestions — selling off Nestlé’s 23 percent stake in L’Oréal, a cosmetics company — may not find favor among Nestlé’s top managers. In February, Mr. Schneider described the L’Oréal stake as a “strategic asset” and suggested that any change to it be done carefully.A spokeswoman for Third Point declined to comment on Nestlé’s announcement.

 Correction: June 29, 2017  
An earlier version of a graphic that accompanied this article misstated the size of Nestlé’s sales figures. They are in billions of Swiss francs, not millions.

Third Point, Loeb’s Hedge Fund, Urges Amgen to Consider a Breakup

With corporate breakups on Wall Street’s mind, one of the biggest activist hedge fund managers around thinks the maneuver could prove helpful for the drug giant Amgen.
Third Point, the hedge fund run by Daniel S. Loeb, suggested on Tuesday that the drug maker should consider splitting itself into two businesses: a faster-growing entity whose products require heavy amounts of research spending, nicknamed GrowthCo; and a slower-growing company with more mature products that can afford to pay out a hefty dividend, known as MatureCo.
After the news, shares in Amgen were up nearly 5 percent in late afternoon trading on Tuesday, valuing the company at more than $107 billion.
Corporate spinoffs have come into vogue in recent years as companies — some under pressure from shareholders eager for higher returns — have slimmed down their operations by shedding noncore assets. Corporations including eBay, DuPont and Procter & Gamble have all announced, to varying degrees, breakup plans that would leave them running more focused businesses.

 
Spinoffs are particularly attractive, because they are likely to incur far lower taxes than an outright sale of a division might. 
In the case of Amgen, such an idea isn’t new. Mr. Loeb acknowledged that the idea for splitting the drug maker in two was first proposed by Geoffrey Porges, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein. Nevertheless, such a move would make sense, given that separating the two businesses could make it easier to focus on developing new drugs and attracting executive talent.
“A separation of Amgen into MatureCo and GrowthCo would likely be very well received by investors,” Mr. Loeb wrote in his firm’s latest letter to its own investors. “Importantly, however, we believe that a separation would not just be good for shareholders, but that it is a more effective way of running each business.”
By Mr. Loeb’s reckoning, a breakup could yield significant results. Given its current corporate self-help plan, Amgen appears set to improve its stock’s valuation to $189 a share by the end of 2016. But if the company splits itself in two, the hedge fund manager contends, the company’s stock could rise to almost $249 a share — or 81 percent higher than where the stock closed on Monday.
The hedge fund manager added in his letter that he had run the ideas by Amgen’s management team, led by its chief executive, Robert A. Bradway, and found those executives “receptive” to his suggestions.
In a statement, Amgen said that it appreciated hearing from investors, including Third Point, and that its management team continued to study ways to improve the company’s stock price. Executives plan to provide an update on their strategic plan on Oct. 28.
While Third Point is trying to goad Amgen into breaking itself up, it has exited from another investment where it urged a corporate split. Mr. Loeb disclosed that his hedge fund has sold off its investment in Sony, more than a year after urging the Japanese electronics giant to partially spin off its American entertainment business. 
Though Sony rejected the suggestion — “regrettably,” according to Mr. Loeb — the hedge fund noted that the company made several moves that have helped lift its fortunes. Among them were cost-cutting, getting out of the personal computer business and improving its television unit’s profitability. 
The hedge fund magnate pointed to what he said was the most important result of his so-called constructivist campaign: Third Point generated a nearly 20 percent return on its investment before selling out.

Early life and education[edit]
Loeb was born to a Jewish family,[3] the son of Ronald and Clare (née Spark) Loeb,[5] was raised in Santa Monica, California where he attended Palisades Charter High School.[3][6][7] At the school, he took AP classes, started a skateboard company and was nicknamed "Milo Minderbinder" by one of his teachers (after a character in the novel Catch-22 who had a fascination with the stock market).[8] His father was a partner at the Los Angeles law firm of Irell & Manella LLP[6] and general counsel for Williams-Sonoma.[5] His father also served as an outside director of Mattel, Inc. for over 30 years and during one period became interim President of Mattel. His mother is a historian.[5][6]
Loeb's great-aunt, Ruth Handler, created the Barbie doll and co-founded Mattel Inc.[6] In 2009, Loeb told an audience "[I] associated success in business with Hot Wheels and Barbie dolls. I think it was a very powerful enforcer early on to like business."[8]
Loeb attended the University of California at Berkeley for two years and subsequently graduated from Columbia University with an economics degree.[9] By his senior year at Columbia, he had made $120,000 in the stock market, but lost it all on an investment in a firm called Puritan-Bennett Inc. The loss taught him a lesson, he later said, in "overconcentrating positions".[8]
Investing career[edit]
From 1984 to 1987, Loeb worked at private equity firm Warburg Pincus.[10] He then worked as director of corporate development at Island Records, a record label, where he focused on securing debt financing.[11] After Island Records, Loeb worked as a risk arbitrage analyst at Lafer Equity Investors and then, from 1991 to 1994, as senior vice-president in the distressed debt department at Jefferies LLC. At Jefferies, he focused on bankruptcy analysis, trading bank loans and selling distressed securities. He moved on to become a Citigroup vice president from 1994–95, in charge of high-yield bond sales.[10]
Third Point Management[edit]
Main article: Third Point Management
Loeb started Third Point Management in 1995 "with $3.3 million from family and friends".
Under Loeb’s guidance, Third Point Management’s annualized returns since inception (Dec. 1996 – Dec. 2015) total approximately +16.2%.[12] In 2012, the firm returned +21.2%, outperforming the S&P 500's return of +16.0% and making it one of best performing hedge funds that year.[13][14] In 2013, the firm returned +25.2%, while the S&P 500 returned +32.4%.[15] Loeb appeared in Forbes' 2013 list of the world's 40 richest hedge-fund managers and traders.[16][17]In 2014, the firm returned +5.7%, while the S&P 500 returned +13.7%.[18] In 2015, the firm returned -1.4%, while the S&P 500 returned +1.4%.[19]
Yahoo![edit]
In 2012, Loeb, who through Third Point LLC, held 5.8% of Yahoo! stock, sought seats on the Yahoo! board for himself, former NBC Universal CEO Jeff Zucker, former Goldman Sachs executive Harry Wilson and former MTV Networks executive Michael J. Wolf.[20]
On May 3, 2012, Loeb revealed that the new CEO of Yahoo!, Scott Thompson, did not have a computer science degree, as had been commonly assumed for many years.[21][22] Thompson resigned on May 13, 2012.[23] Reuters then announced that Loeb, Wilson and Wolf would become members of the Yahoo! board.[24] Marissa Mayer was then appointed as CEO to replace Thompson. In July 2013, Loeb, Wilson, and Wolf resigned from Yahoo!'s board, leaving Yahoo! with a seven-member board. Yahoo! agreed to buy back 40 million shares at $1.6 billion from Third Point.[25][26]
Sony[edit]
In May 2013, Loeb proposed splitting Sony's entertainment and electronics businesses, arguing that such a split would increase profits.[27][28][29]
On June 18, 2013, Third Point LLC announced it had increased its stake in Sony to 70 million shares, or about 7 percent, valued at $1.4 billion.[30] According to Bloomberg.com, Sony's board of directors considered Loeb's proposal and hired Morgan Stanley and Citigroup, Inc. to evaluate it.[31]
Actor George Clooney, whose Smokehouse Pictures production company has a contract with Sony's entertainment division, publicly opposed the proposal.[32][33]
As of May 2014, Sony remained 12 percent lower than when Loeb first suggested for them to split. Sony had its sixth annual loss in seven years with shares dropping 8.8 percent as of May 2014. In February 2014, Sony said it would sell its PC business to buyout Japan industrial Partners Inc. and split its TV manufacturing unit into an independently operated entity. Ayano Iguchi, a company spokeswoman, said Sony was "focused on creating shareholder value by executing on our plan to revitalize and grow the electronics business, while further strengthening the entertainment and financial service businesses." Chris Konstantinos, director of international portfolio managements at RiverFront stated that a breakup was "long overdue."[34]
In October 2014, Loeb sold his shares in Sony and later wrote, “They have a long way to go and we continue to believe that more urgency will be necessary to definitively turn around the company’s fortunes".[35][36]
Sotheby's[edit]
In October 2013, Loeb issued a letter scrutinizing the governance of Sotheby's.[37] It announced that Third Point had acquired "9.3% of the outstanding shares" and addressed Third Point's concerns regarding the governance of Sotheby's. These concerns are summarized as, "we are troubled by the Company's chronically weak operating margins and deteriorating competitive position relative to Christie's, as evidenced by each of the Contemporary and Modern art evening sales over the last several years."[37] The letter expressed strong skepticism of Sotheby's international strategy—"Sotheby's is struggling internationally, lagging in newer markets like China and the Middle East"—and called for the removal of William Ruprecht from all his positions.[37]
After Sotheby's instituted a "poison pill" to stop Third Point from growing its position past 10%, Third Point brought a lawsuit in the state of Delaware; however, on May 3, 2014, Vice Chancellor Donald Parsons of the Delaware Court of Chancery ruled that the auction house was justified in its use of the corporate action. On May 5, Loeb and Sotheby's reached an agreement, stipulating that Loeb, Olivier Reza and Harry J. Wilson join the board in exchange for Third Point having an ownership cap at 15%. William Ruprecht remained CEO and the proxy contest ceased.[38][39] After 35 years at Sotheby's, Ruprecht retired as CEO. On March 16, 2015, Sotheby's named Tad Smith as its new president and chief executive.[40][41]
Fanuc[edit]
In late 2014, Loeb's Third Point took a stake in Fanuc, a robotics and computer numerical controls firm. Prior, Fanuc seldom made direct contact with its investors but in March 2014, the company decided "it would start talking to shareholders" and "return some of its cash to them." Loeb met with Fanuc's President, Yoshiharu Inaba, with encouragement from Japan's government officials, and was deemed a top prospect for "shaking up Japanese firms."[42][43][44]
Ligand Pharmaceuticals[edit]
In January 2007, when John Higgins became CEO of Ligand Pharmaceuticals, Loeb bought into the biotech firm to cut its losses and grow revenue. Loeb invested $50 million, increased the company’s profit to $250 million, and bought back $68 million in stock.[45]
Seven & I[edit]
In April 2016, Loeb won a battle in his drive to shake up corporate Japan who had "been sheltered from agitating investors." Seven & I Holdings Co.'s board was planning to replace Ryuichi Isaka as head of the company however, Loeb recommended Isaka as a successor to Toshifumi Suzuki, chairman and chief executive. On April 7, Suzuki resigned after losing a boardroom dispute with Loeb. Loeb wrote in a March 27, 2016 letter to Seven & I directors, "Mr. Isaka should be rewarded—not demoted—for his performance and commitment to delivering results for shareholders... This isn’t a dynasty. This is a corporation."[46][47][48] Loeb has pushed for the company to focus on its convenience store line while ridding its plans to expand its department and supermarket store franchises.[49]
Nestle[edit]
On 27 June 2017, Loeb announced to invest $3B into Nestle shares.[50]
Investment philosophy[edit]
New York magazine noted that Loeb's "preferred strategy" is to buy into troubled companies, replace inefficient management, and return the companies to profitability, which "is the key to his success."[3]
Letters[edit]
On Wall Street, Loeb has a reputation for "financial savvy" and for "his withering criticism of corporate executives who are unfortunate enough to stumble in his sights".[9] One of Loeb's signature tactics involves letter-writing:

Loeb is well known in Hedgeworld for his attacks on what he views as greedy execs who also happen to be depressing shareholder value. Of shares he owns. "The moral-indignation business", Loeb sometimes calls it. "Hedge-fund guys love to read Loeb's attacks; 'he articulates what people feel', says one."[3]

Often these letters cite the results of investigations he has ordered, detailing management decisions and actions he considers detrimental to shareholder value. The letters usually accompany his government filings.[3] Loeb once spent more than $4 million to increase his stake in a company to more than 5%, the statutory threshold requiring investor filings with the SEC, in order to file one of his letters criticizing the firm's management.[3] According to New York magazine, "Loeb is proud of his letters, which are thorough, well argued, and filled with clever turns of phrase. (He had a batch prepared for his high-school English teacher.)"[3] A 2005 New Yorker "The Talk of the Town" item described him as "a kind of investor's H. L. Mencken."[51]
In a 2005 letter responding to a job inquiry by a U.K. fund manager Loeb bristled at the applicant's reference to his (the applicant's) "place in society", telling the applicant that he would "have plenty of time to discuss your 'place in society' with the other fellows at the club." At Third Point, Loeb explained, "'one's place in society' does not matter at all. We are a bunch of scrappy guys from diverse backgrounds (Jewish, Muslim, Hindu etc) who enjoy outwitting pompous asses like yourself in financial markets globally."[52] Similarly, in a September 2005 letter to Ligand Pharmaceuticals CEO David Robinson, Loeb expressed wonder that Ligand's board of directors had not shown Robinson "the door long ago – accompanied by a well worn boot planted in the backside."[52]
Loeb sent a letter to John Collins, chairman and CEO of InterCept, in 2004, accusing InterCept of following "a 'good ol' boy' set of ethics", pointing out that InterCept employed Collins' daughter and son-in-law, the latter of whom Loeb had recently reached by phone on a golf course during working hours. Loeb further noted his discovery that InterCept leased a jet from a partnership controlled by Collins and another board member.[52]
He wrote to Irik Sevin, CEO of Star Gas Partners, in February 2005, calling him "one of the most dangerous and incompetent executives in America" and accusing him of "ineptitude" and of using the firm as his "personal 'honey pot'". He wrote: "I was amused to learn, in the course of our investigation, that at Cornell University there is an 'Irik Sevin Scholarship'. One can only pity the poor student who suffers the indignity of attaching your name to his academic record." Loeb demanded the resignation from the firm's board of Sevin's "elderly 78-year old mum" and insisted that Sevin also "step down … so that you can do what you do best: retreat to your waterfront mansion in the Hamptons where you can play tennis and hobnob with your fellow socialites."[52]
A 2005 New York Times article reported that many hedge-fund managers were now writing letters to the SEC demanding executives take specific actions and cited Loeb's letter to Sevin as exemplary of the genre, noting that three weeks after the letter was sent, "Sevin was gone, and a jubilant Mr. Loeb sent out an e-mail message to friends and associates declaring a 'huge victory for Third Point.'"[53]
Personal life[edit]
Loeb married Margaret Davidson Munzer on July 4, 2004,[51] at his beach house in East Hampton, New York.[5] The couple has three children.[54] Loeb is a founding "Master Player" of Portfolios with Purpose, an annual virtual stock trading contest that raises money for charitable causes of the winning contestants' choice.[55]
Loeb has called himself a "lifelong surfer" with "a 'secret spot' in the Caribbean". His second favorite surfing spot is in Indonesia.[56] Third Point takes its name from "a break at Malibu's Surfrider Beach."[57]
In 2014, Loeb was reported as one of a number of "prominent investors [who] have taken to Transcendental Meditation".[58]
Loeb was co-chair of the Governors for Investors Industry (2013).[59] He is a trustee of Mount Sinai Hospital, the Manhattan Institute, the U.S. Olympic Committee and the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art. He is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and of the National Council of the American Enterprise Institute.[59]
Political and economic views[edit]
Loeb has donated to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, Friends for Harry Reid, Obama for America, Forward Together PAC, Prosperity PAC, Straight Talk America, and the Volunteer PAC. In 2013, Loeb was a signatory to an amicus curiae brief submitted to the U.S. Supreme Court in Hollingsworth v. Perry, in support of same-sex marriage.[60][61][62][63]
In 2015, Loeb, Paul Singer and Tim Gill helped fund Freedom For All Americans to promote LGBT issues in states and local communities in the United States.[64]
Wealth and philanthropy[edit]
According to Forbes Magazine, his net worth is $2.9 billion USD as of February 2017.[65]
The Daniel S Loeb Family Third Point Foundation[edit]
The Daniel S Loeb Family Third Point Foundation earned $6.39 million in profits in 2011 and had $4.45 billion in assets at the end of that year, making it one of the largest and highest-earning private foundations. Its nonprofit administrative expense ratio, a measure of its operating and administrating expenses, was 0.44%, compared to the 2011 average of 19.7% for all private foundations.[66]
Loeb is heavily involved in education reform efforts, specifically supporting charter schools.[67] Loeb is chairman of the board of Success Academy Charter Schools in Brooklyn.[16] In June 2013, he pledged to donate $3 million to Success Academy Charter Schools.[68] He endowed the Daniel S. Loeb Scholarship for undergraduate study at Columbia University. Since 2004, he has been a trustee of Prep for Prep, an organization in New York City that prepares underprivileged children to attend competitive private schools. He is active in the Jewish Enrichment Center, which provides young people with an education in Judaism. Additionally, he is a co-founder of Students First New York, the state branch of the national education advocacy organization.[10]
On February 20, 2014, Loeb attended a discussion between the American Enterprise Institute and the Dalai Lama. The two worldviews debated the morality of capitalism and free enterprise. In Loeb's presentation, he said he practices Ashtanga yoga and applies yoga principles to his business and his decision-making. He noted that these principles aided in his decision to donate to a charter school in the Bronx, which is now ranked third in the state of New York.[69][70]
In October 2011, Loeb challenged three former Navy SEALs to run the "MightyMan" Half Iron Triathlon with him and his team in Montauk, New York. He made a sizable contribution for each Navy SEAL Foundation director who completed the triathlon to raise funds for the foundation.[71][72][73]
In 2011, 2012, and 2013, Loeb and his wife made significant donations to the Alzheimer's Drug Discovery Foundation (ADDF), which funds over 400 Alzheimer's drug discovery programs in academic centers and biotechnology companies in 18 different countries.[74][75][76]
Loeb and his wife have also donated to the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, Ovarian Cancer Research Fund, Chai Lifeline, and the Michael J. Fox Foundation.[77]
Art collection[edit]
He is a prominent art collector and the walls at his Park Avenue office are covered with paintings", according to a New York Times August 26, 2013 article.[78] At a Sotheby's auction in 2009, Manhattan dealer Larry Gagosian purchased Jeff Koons' Baroque Egg With Bow (Turquoise/Magenta) for $5.4 million from Loeb, who had bought it from the Gagosian Gallery in 2004 for about $3 million.[79]
Loeb has traced his love of art to his student years at Columbia, when he saw Poussin's The Rape of the Sabine Women at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and took an art humanities class as part of the core curriculum. The "prep school kids" treated him like a "jerk", thinking they "all knew so much more", but in the end "I got one of two A's, and all the prep school snotty kids didn't."[80]
Business Insider placed Loeb at the top of its list of "Wall Street's 25 Most Serious Art Collectors", noting he owns works by Mike Kelley, Richard Prince, Basquiat, Andy Warhol and Cindy Sherman, and that he “has his own curator.”[81]

Early life and education[edit]
Loeb was born to a Jewish family,[3] the son of Ronald and Clare (née Spark) Loeb,[5] was raised in Santa Monica, California where he attended Palisades Charter High School.[3][6][7] At the school, he took AP classes, started a skateboard company and was nicknamed "Milo Minderbinder" by one of his teachers (after a character in the novel Catch-22 who had a fascination with the stock market).[8] His father was a partner at the Los Angeles law firm of Irell & Manella LLP[6] and general counsel for Williams-Sonoma.[5] His father also served as an outside director of Mattel, Inc. for over 30 years and during one period became interim President of Mattel. His mother is a historian.[5][6]
Loeb's great-aunt, Ruth Handler, created the Barbie doll and co-founded Mattel Inc.[6] In 2009, Loeb told an audience "[I] associated success in business with Hot Wheels and Barbie dolls. I think it was a very powerful enforcer early on to like business."[8]
Loeb attended the University of California at Berkeley for two years and subsequently graduated from Columbia University with an economics degree.[9] By his senior year at Columbia, he had made $120,000 in the stock market, but lost it all on an investment in a firm called Puritan-Bennett Inc. The loss taught him a lesson, he later said, in "overconcentrating positions".[8]
Investing career[edit]
From 1984 to 1987, Loeb worked at private equity firm Warburg Pincus.[10] He then worked as director of corporate development at Island Records, a record label, where he focused on securing debt financing.[11] After Island Records, Loeb worked as a risk arbitrage analyst at Lafer Equity Investors and then, from 1991 to 1994, as senior vice-president in the distressed debt department at Jefferies LLC. At Jefferies, he focused on bankruptcy analysis, trading bank loans and selling distressed securities. He moved on to become a Citigroup vice president from 1994–95, in charge of high-yield bond sales.[10]
Third Point Management[edit]
Main article: Third Point Management
Loeb started Third Point Management in 1995 "with $3.3 million from family and friends".
Under Loeb’s guidance, Third Point Management’s annualized returns since inception (Dec. 1996 – Dec. 2015) total approximately +16.2%.[12] In 2012, the firm returned +21.2%, outperforming the S&P 500's return of +16.0% and making it one of best performing hedge funds that year.[13][14] In 2013, the firm returned +25.2%, while the S&P 500 returned +32.4%.[15] Loeb appeared in Forbes' 2013 list of the world's 40 richest hedge-fund managers and traders.[16][17]In 2014, the firm returned +5.7%, while the S&P 500 returned +13.7%.[18] In 2015, the firm returned -1.4%, while the S&P 500 returned +1.4%.[19]
Yahoo![edit]
In 2012, Loeb, who through Third Point LLC, held 5.8% of Yahoo! stock, sought seats on the Yahoo! board for himself, former NBC Universal CEO Jeff Zucker, former Goldman Sachs executive Harry Wilson and former MTV Networks executive Michael J. Wolf.[20]
On May 3, 2012, Loeb revealed that the new CEO of Yahoo!, Scott Thompson, did not have a computer science degree, as had been commonly assumed for many years.[21][22] Thompson resigned on May 13, 2012.[23] Reuters then announced that Loeb, Wilson and Wolf would become members of the Yahoo! board.[24] Marissa Mayer was then appointed as CEO to replace Thompson. In July 2013, Loeb, Wilson, and Wolf resigned from Yahoo!'s board, leaving Yahoo! with a seven-member board. Yahoo! agreed to buy back 40 million shares at $1.6 billion from Third Point.[25][26]
Sony[edit]
In May 2013, Loeb proposed splitting Sony's entertainment and electronics businesses, arguing that such a split would increase profits.[27][28][29]
On June 18, 2013, Third Point LLC announced it had increased its stake in Sony to 70 million shares, or about 7 percent, valued at $1.4 billion.[30] According to Bloomberg.com, Sony's board of directors considered Loeb's proposal and hired Morgan Stanley and Citigroup, Inc. to evaluate it.[31]
Actor George Clooney, whose Smokehouse Pictures production company has a contract with Sony's entertainment division, publicly opposed the proposal.[32][33]
As of May 2014, Sony remained 12 percent lower than when Loeb first suggested for them to split. Sony had its sixth annual loss in seven years with shares dropping 8.8 percent as of May 2014. In February 2014, Sony said it would sell its PC business to buyout Japan industrial Partners Inc. and split its TV manufacturing unit into an independently operated entity. Ayano Iguchi, a company spokeswoman, said Sony was "focused on creating shareholder value by executing on our plan to revitalize and grow the electronics business, while further strengthening the entertainment and financial service businesses." Chris Konstantinos, director of international portfolio managements at RiverFront stated that a breakup was "long overdue."[34]
In October 2014, Loeb sold his shares in Sony and later wrote, “They have a long way to go and we continue to believe that more urgency will be necessary to definitively turn around the company’s fortunes".[35][36]
Sotheby's[edit]
In October 2013, Loeb issued a letter scrutinizing the governance of Sotheby's.[37] It announced that Third Point had acquired "9.3% of the outstanding shares" and addressed Third Point's concerns regarding the governance of Sotheby's. These concerns are summarized as, "we are troubled by the Company's chronically weak operating margins and deteriorating competitive position relative to Christie's, as evidenced by each of the Contemporary and Modern art evening sales over the last several years."[37] The letter expressed strong skepticism of Sotheby's international strategy—"Sotheby's is struggling internationally, lagging in newer markets like China and the Middle East"—and called for the removal of William Ruprecht from all his positions.[37]
After Sotheby's instituted a "poison pill" to stop Third Point from growing its position past 10%, Third Point brought a lawsuit in the state of Delaware; however, on May 3, 2014, Vice Chancellor Donald Parsons of the Delaware Court of Chancery ruled that the auction house was justified in its use of the corporate action. On May 5, Loeb and Sotheby's reached an agreement, stipulating that Loeb, Olivier Reza and Harry J. Wilson join the board in exchange for Third Point having an ownership cap at 15%. William Ruprecht remained CEO and the proxy contest ceased.[38][39] After 35 years at Sotheby's, Ruprecht retired as CEO. On March 16, 2015, Sotheby's named Tad Smith as its new president and chief executive.[40][41]
Fanuc[edit]
In late 2014, Loeb's Third Point took a stake in Fanuc, a robotics and computer numerical controls firm. Prior, Fanuc seldom made direct contact with its investors but in March 2014, the company decided "it would start talking to shareholders" and "return some of its cash to them." Loeb met with Fanuc's President, Yoshiharu Inaba, with encouragement from Japan's government officials, and was deemed a top prospect for "shaking up Japanese firms."[42][43][44]
Ligand Pharmaceuticals[edit]
In January 2007, when John Higgins became CEO of Ligand Pharmaceuticals, Loeb bought into the biotech firm to cut its losses and grow revenue. Loeb invested $50 million, increased the company’s profit to $250 million, and bought back $68 million in stock.[45]
Seven & I[edit]
In April 2016, Loeb won a battle in his drive to shake up corporate Japan who had "been sheltered from agitating investors." Seven & I Holdings Co.'s board was planning to replace Ryuichi Isaka as head of the company however, Loeb recommended Isaka as a successor to Toshifumi Suzuki, chairman and chief executive. On April 7, Suzuki resigned after losing a boardroom dispute with Loeb. Loeb wrote in a March 27, 2016 letter to Seven & I directors, "Mr. Isaka should be rewarded—not demoted—for his performance and commitment to delivering results for shareholders... This isn’t a dynasty. This is a corporation."[46][47][48] Loeb has pushed for the company to focus on its convenience store line while ridding its plans to expand its department and supermarket store franchises.[49]
Nestle[edit]
On 27 June 2017, Loeb announced to invest $3B into Nestle shares.[50]
Investment philosophy[edit]
New York magazine noted that Loeb's "preferred strategy" is to buy into troubled companies, replace inefficient management, and return the companies to profitability, which "is the key to his success."[3]
Letters[edit]
On Wall Street, Loeb has a reputation for "financial savvy" and for "his withering criticism of corporate executives who are unfortunate enough to stumble in his sights".[9] One of Loeb's signature tactics involves letter-writing:

Loeb is well known in Hedgeworld for his attacks on what he views as greedy execs who also happen to be depressing shareholder value. Of shares he owns. "The moral-indignation business", Loeb sometimes calls it. "Hedge-fund guys love to read Loeb's attacks; 'he articulates what people feel', says one."[3]

Often these letters cite the results of investigations he has ordered, detailing management decisions and actions he considers detrimental to shareholder value. The letters usually accompany his government filings.[3] Loeb once spent more than $4 million to increase his stake in a company to more than 5%, the statutory threshold requiring investor filings with the SEC, in order to file one of his letters criticizing the firm's management.[3] According to New York magazine, "Loeb is proud of his letters, which are thorough, well argued, and filled with clever turns of phrase. (He had a batch prepared for his high-school English teacher.)"[3] A 2005 New Yorker "The Talk of the Town" item described him as "a kind of investor's H. L. Mencken."[51]
In a 2005 letter responding to a job inquiry by a U.K. fund manager Loeb bristled at the applicant's reference to his (the applicant's) "place in society", telling the applicant that he would "have plenty of time to discuss your 'place in society' with the other fellows at the club." At Third Point, Loeb explained, "'one's place in society' does not matter at all. We are a bunch of scrappy guys from diverse backgrounds (Jewish, Muslim, Hindu etc) who enjoy outwitting pompous asses like yourself in financial markets globally."[52] Similarly, in a September 2005 letter to Ligand Pharmaceuticals CEO David Robinson, Loeb expressed wonder that Ligand's board of directors had not shown Robinson "the door long ago – accompanied by a well worn boot planted in the backside."[52]
Loeb sent a letter to John Collins, chairman and CEO of InterCept, in 2004, accusing InterCept of following "a 'good ol' boy' set of ethics", pointing out that InterCept employed Collins' daughter and son-in-law, the latter of whom Loeb had recently reached by phone on a golf course during working hours. Loeb further noted his discovery that InterCept leased a jet from a partnership controlled by Collins and another board member.[52]
He wrote to Irik Sevin, CEO of Star Gas Partners, in February 2005, calling him "one of the most dangerous and incompetent executives in America" and accusing him of "ineptitude" and of using the firm as his "personal 'honey pot'". He wrote: "I was amused to learn, in the course of our investigation, that at Cornell University there is an 'Irik Sevin Scholarship'. One can only pity the poor student who suffers the indignity of attaching your name to his academic record." Loeb demanded the resignation from the firm's board of Sevin's "elderly 78-year old mum" and insisted that Sevin also "step down … so that you can do what you do best: retreat to your waterfront mansion in the Hamptons where you can play tennis and hobnob with your fellow socialites."[52]
A 2005 New York Times article reported that many hedge-fund managers were now writing letters to the SEC demanding executives take specific actions and cited Loeb's letter to Sevin as exemplary of the genre, noting that three weeks after the letter was sent, "Sevin was gone, and a jubilant Mr. Loeb sent out an e-mail message to friends and associates declaring a 'huge victory for Third Point.'"[53]
Personal life[edit]
Loeb married Margaret Davidson Munzer on July 4, 2004,[51] at his beach house in East Hampton, New York.[5] The couple has three children.[54] Loeb is a founding "Master Player" of Portfolios with Purpose, an annual virtual stock trading contest that raises money for charitable causes of the winning contestants' choice.[55]
Loeb has called himself a "lifelong surfer" with "a 'secret spot' in the Caribbean". His second favorite surfing spot is in Indonesia.[56] Third Point takes its name from "a break at Malibu's Surfrider Beach."[57]
In 2014, Loeb was reported as one of a number of "prominent investors [who] have taken to Transcendental Meditation".[58]
Loeb was co-chair of the Governors for Investors Industry (2013).[59] He is a trustee of Mount Sinai Hospital, the Manhattan Institute, the U.S. Olympic Committee and the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art. He is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and of the National Council of the American Enterprise Institute.[59]
Political and economic views[edit]
Loeb has donated to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, Friends for Harry Reid, Obama for America, Forward Together PAC, Prosperity PAC, Straight Talk America, and the Volunteer PAC. In 2013, Loeb was a signatory to an amicus curiae brief submitted to the U.S. Supreme Court in Hollingsworth v. Perry, in support of same-sex marriage.[60][61][62][63]
In 2015, Loeb, Paul Singer and Tim Gill helped fund Freedom For All Americans to promote LGBT issues in states and local communities in the United States.[64]
Wealth and philanthropy[edit]
According to Forbes Magazine, his net worth is $2.9 billion USD as of February 2017.[65]
The Daniel S Loeb Family Third Point Foundation[edit]
The Daniel S Loeb Family Third Point Foundation earned $6.39 million in profits in 2011 and had $4.45 billion in assets at the end of that year, making it one of the largest and highest-earning private foundations. Its nonprofit administrative expense ratio, a measure of its operating and administrating expenses, was 0.44%, compared to the 2011 average of 19.7% for all private foundations.[66]
Loeb is heavily involved in education reform efforts, specifically supporting charter schools.[67] Loeb is chairman of the board of Success Academy Charter Schools in Brooklyn.[16] In June 2013, he pledged to donate $3 million to Success Academy Charter Schools.[68] He endowed the Daniel S. Loeb Scholarship for undergraduate study at Columbia University. Since 2004, he has been a trustee of Prep for Prep, an organization in New York City that prepares underprivileged children to attend competitive private schools. He is active in the Jewish Enrichment Center, which provides young people with an education in Judaism. Additionally, he is a co-founder of Students First New York, the state branch of the national education advocacy organization.[10]
On February 20, 2014, Loeb attended a discussion between the American Enterprise Institute and the Dalai Lama. The two worldviews debated the morality of capitalism and free enterprise. In Loeb's presentation, he said he practices Ashtanga yoga and applies yoga principles to his business and his decision-making. He noted that these principles aided in his decision to donate to a charter school in the Bronx, which is now ranked third in the state of New York.[69][70]
In October 2011, Loeb challenged three former Navy SEALs to run the "MightyMan" Half Iron Triathlon with him and his team in Montauk, New York. He made a sizable contribution for each Navy SEAL Foundation director who completed the triathlon to raise funds for the foundation.[71][72][73]
In 2011, 2012, and 2013, Loeb and his wife made significant donations to the Alzheimer's Drug Discovery Foundation (ADDF), which funds over 400 Alzheimer's drug discovery programs in academic centers and biotechnology companies in 18 different countries.[74][75][76]
Loeb and his wife have also donated to the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, Ovarian Cancer Research Fund, Chai Lifeline, and the Michael J. Fox Foundation.[77]
Art collection[edit]
He is a prominent art collector and the walls at his Park Avenue office are covered with paintings", according to a New York Times August 26, 2013 article.[78] At a Sotheby's auction in 2009, Manhattan dealer Larry Gagosian purchased Jeff Koons' Baroque Egg With Bow (Turquoise/Magenta) for $5.4 million from Loeb, who had bought it from the Gagosian Gallery in 2004 for about $3 million.[79]
Loeb has traced his love of art to his student years at Columbia, when he saw Poussin's The Rape of the Sabine Women at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and took an art humanities class as part of the core curriculum. The "prep school kids" treated him like a "jerk", thinking they "all knew so much more", but in the end "I got one of two A's, and all the prep school snotty kids didn't."[80]
Business Insider placed Loeb at the top of its list of "Wall Street's 25 Most Serious Art Collectors", noting he owns works by Mike Kelley, Richard Prince, Basquiat, Andy Warhol and Cindy Sherman, and that he “has his own curator.”[81]

Early life and education[edit]
Loeb was born to a Jewish family,[3] the son of Ronald and Clare (née Spark) Loeb,[5] was raised in Santa Monica, California where he attended Palisades Charter High School.[3][6][7] At the school, he took AP classes, started a skateboard company and was nicknamed "Milo Minderbinder" by one of his teachers (after a character in the novel Catch-22 who had a fascination with the stock market).[8] His father was a partner at the Los Angeles law firm of Irell & Manella LLP[6] and general counsel for Williams-Sonoma.[5] His father also served as an outside director of Mattel, Inc. for over 30 years and during one period became interim President of Mattel. His mother is a historian.[5][6]
Loeb's great-aunt, Ruth Handler, created the Barbie doll and co-founded Mattel Inc.[6] In 2009, Loeb told an audience "[I] associated success in business with Hot Wheels and Barbie dolls. I think it was a very powerful enforcer early on to like business."[8]
Loeb attended the University of California at Berkeley for two years and subsequently graduated from Columbia University with an economics degree.[9] By his senior year at Columbia, he had made $120,000 in the stock market, but lost it all on an investment in a firm called Puritan-Bennett Inc. The loss taught him a lesson, he later said, in "overconcentrating positions".[8]
Investing career[edit]
From 1984 to 1987, Loeb worked at private equity firm Warburg Pincus.[10] He then worked as director of corporate development at Island Records, a record label, where he focused on securing debt financing.[11] After Island Records, Loeb worked as a risk arbitrage analyst at Lafer Equity Investors and then, from 1991 to 1994, as senior vice-president in the distressed debt department at Jefferies LLC. At Jefferies, he focused on bankruptcy analysis, trading bank loans and selling distressed securities. He moved on to become a Citigroup vice president from 1994–95, in charge of high-yield bond sales.[10]
Third Point Management[edit]
Main article: Third Point Management
Loeb started Third Point Management in 1995 "with $3.3 million from family and friends".
Under Loeb’s guidance, Third Point Management’s annualized returns since inception (Dec. 1996 – Dec. 2015) total approximately +16.2%.[12] In 2012, the firm returned +21.2%, outperforming the S&P 500's return of +16.0% and making it one of best performing hedge funds that year.[13][14] In 2013, the firm returned +25.2%, while the S&P 500 returned +32.4%.[15] Loeb appeared in Forbes' 2013 list of the world's 40 richest hedge-fund managers and traders.[16][17]In 2014, the firm returned +5.7%, while the S&P 500 returned +13.7%.[18] In 2015, the firm returned -1.4%, while the S&P 500 returned +1.4%.[19]
Yahoo![edit]
In 2012, Loeb, who through Third Point LLC, held 5.8% of Yahoo! stock, sought seats on the Yahoo! board for himself, former NBC Universal CEO Jeff Zucker, former Goldman Sachs executive Harry Wilson and former MTV Networks executive Michael J. Wolf.[20]
On May 3, 2012, Loeb revealed that the new CEO of Yahoo!, Scott Thompson, did not have a computer science degree, as had been commonly assumed for many years.[21][22] Thompson resigned on May 13, 2012.[23] Reuters then announced that Loeb, Wilson and Wolf would become members of the Yahoo! board.[24] Marissa Mayer was then appointed as CEO to replace Thompson. In July 2013, Loeb, Wilson, and Wolf resigned from Yahoo!'s board, leaving Yahoo! with a seven-member board. Yahoo! agreed to buy back 40 million shares at $1.6 billion from Third Point.[25][26]
Sony[edit]
In May 2013, Loeb proposed splitting Sony's entertainment and electronics businesses, arguing that such a split would increase profits.[27][28][29]
On June 18, 2013, Third Point LLC announced it had increased its stake in Sony to 70 million shares, or about 7 percent, valued at $1.4 billion.[30] According to Bloomberg.com, Sony's board of directors considered Loeb's proposal and hired Morgan Stanley and Citigroup, Inc. to evaluate it.[31]
Actor George Clooney, whose Smokehouse Pictures production company has a contract with Sony's entertainment division, publicly opposed the proposal.[32][33]
As of May 2014, Sony remained 12 percent lower than when Loeb first suggested for them to split. Sony had its sixth annual loss in seven years with shares dropping 8.8 percent as of May 2014. In February 2014, Sony said it would sell its PC business to buyout Japan industrial Partners Inc. and split its TV manufacturing unit into an independently operated entity. Ayano Iguchi, a company spokeswoman, said Sony was "focused on creating shareholder value by executing on our plan to revitalize and grow the electronics business, while further strengthening the entertainment and financial service businesses." Chris Konstantinos, director of international portfolio managements at RiverFront stated that a breakup was "long overdue."[34]
In October 2014, Loeb sold his shares in Sony and later wrote, “They have a long way to go and we continue to believe that more urgency will be necessary to definitively turn around the company’s fortunes".[35][36]
Sotheby's[edit]
In October 2013, Loeb issued a letter scrutinizing the governance of Sotheby's.[37] It announced that Third Point had acquired "9.3% of the outstanding shares" and addressed Third Point's concerns regarding the governance of Sotheby's. These concerns are summarized as, "we are troubled by the Company's chronically weak operating margins and deteriorating competitive position relative to Christie's, as evidenced by each of the Contemporary and Modern art evening sales over the last several years."[37] The letter expressed strong skepticism of Sotheby's international strategy—"Sotheby's is struggling internationally, lagging in newer markets like China and the Middle East"—and called for the removal of William Ruprecht from all his positions.[37]
After Sotheby's instituted a "poison pill" to stop Third Point from growing its position past 10%, Third Point brought a lawsuit in the state of Delaware; however, on May 3, 2014, Vice Chancellor Donald Parsons of the Delaware Court of Chancery ruled that the auction house was justified in its use of the corporate action. On May 5, Loeb and Sotheby's reached an agreement, stipulating that Loeb, Olivier Reza and Harry J. Wilson join the board in exchange for Third Point having an ownership cap at 15%. William Ruprecht remained CEO and the proxy contest ceased.[38][39] After 35 years at Sotheby's, Ruprecht retired as CEO. On March 16, 2015, Sotheby's named Tad Smith as its new president and chief executive.[40][41]
Fanuc[edit]
In late 2014, Loeb's Third Point took a stake in Fanuc, a robotics and computer numerical controls firm. Prior, Fanuc seldom made direct contact with its investors but in March 2014, the company decided "it would start talking to shareholders" and "return some of its cash to them." Loeb met with Fanuc's President, Yoshiharu Inaba, with encouragement from Japan's government officials, and was deemed a top prospect for "shaking up Japanese firms."[42][43][44]
Ligand Pharmaceuticals[edit]
In January 2007, when John Higgins became CEO of Ligand Pharmaceuticals, Loeb bought into the biotech firm to cut its losses and grow revenue. Loeb invested $50 million, increased the company’s profit to $250 million, and bought back $68 million in stock.[45]
Seven & I[edit]
In April 2016, Loeb won a battle in his drive to shake up corporate Japan who had "been sheltered from agitating investors." Seven & I Holdings Co.'s board was planning to replace Ryuichi Isaka as head of the company however, Loeb recommended Isaka as a successor to Toshifumi Suzuki, chairman and chief executive. On April 7, Suzuki resigned after losing a boardroom dispute with Loeb. Loeb wrote in a March 27, 2016 letter to Seven & I directors, "Mr. Isaka should be rewarded—not demoted—for his performance and commitment to delivering results for shareholders... This isn’t a dynasty. This is a corporation."[46][47][48] Loeb has pushed for the company to focus on its convenience store line while ridding its plans to expand its department and supermarket store franchises.[49]
Nestle[edit]
On 27 June 2017, Loeb announced to invest $3B into Nestle shares.[50]
Investment philosophy[edit]
New York magazine noted that Loeb's "preferred strategy" is to buy into troubled companies, replace inefficient management, and return the companies to profitability, which "is the key to his success."[3]
Letters[edit]
On Wall Street, Loeb has a reputation for "financial savvy" and for "his withering criticism of corporate executives who are unfortunate enough to stumble in his sights".[9] One of Loeb's signature tactics involves letter-writing:

Loeb is well known in Hedgeworld for his attacks on what he views as greedy execs who also happen to be depressing shareholder value. Of shares he owns. "The moral-indignation business", Loeb sometimes calls it. "Hedge-fund guys love to read Loeb's attacks; 'he articulates what people feel', says one."[3]

Often these letters cite the results of investigations he has ordered, detailing management decisions and actions he considers detrimental to shareholder value. The letters usually accompany his government filings.[3] Loeb once spent more than $4 million to increase his stake in a company to more than 5%, the statutory threshold requiring investor filings with the SEC, in order to file one of his letters criticizing the firm's management.[3] According to New York magazine, "Loeb is proud of his letters, which are thorough, well argued, and filled with clever turns of phrase. (He had a batch prepared for his high-school English teacher.)"[3] A 2005 New Yorker "The Talk of the Town" item described him as "a kind of investor's H. L. Mencken."[51]
In a 2005 letter responding to a job inquiry by a U.K. fund manager Loeb bristled at the applicant's reference to his (the applicant's) "place in society", telling the applicant that he would "have plenty of time to discuss your 'place in society' with the other fellows at the club." At Third Point, Loeb explained, "'one's place in society' does not matter at all. We are a bunch of scrappy guys from diverse backgrounds (Jewish, Muslim, Hindu etc) who enjoy outwitting pompous asses like yourself in financial markets globally."[52] Similarly, in a September 2005 letter to Ligand Pharmaceuticals CEO David Robinson, Loeb expressed wonder that Ligand's board of directors had not shown Robinson "the door long ago – accompanied by a well worn boot planted in the backside."[52]
Loeb sent a letter to John Collins, chairman and CEO of InterCept, in 2004, accusing InterCept of following "a 'good ol' boy' set of ethics", pointing out that InterCept employed Collins' daughter and son-in-law, the latter of whom Loeb had recently reached by phone on a golf course during working hours. Loeb further noted his discovery that InterCept leased a jet from a partnership controlled by Collins and another board member.[52]
He wrote to Irik Sevin, CEO of Star Gas Partners, in February 2005, calling him "one of the most dangerous and incompetent executives in America" and accusing him of "ineptitude" and of using the firm as his "personal 'honey pot'". He wrote: "I was amused to learn, in the course of our investigation, that at Cornell University there is an 'Irik Sevin Scholarship'. One can only pity the poor student who suffers the indignity of attaching your name to his academic record." Loeb demanded the resignation from the firm's board of Sevin's "elderly 78-year old mum" and insisted that Sevin also "step down … so that you can do what you do best: retreat to your waterfront mansion in the Hamptons where you can play tennis and hobnob with your fellow socialites."[52]
A 2005 New York Times article reported that many hedge-fund managers were now writing letters to the SEC demanding executives take specific actions and cited Loeb's letter to Sevin as exemplary of the genre, noting that three weeks after the letter was sent, "Sevin was gone, and a jubilant Mr. Loeb sent out an e-mail message to friends and associates declaring a 'huge victory for Third Point.'"[53]
Personal life[edit]
Loeb married Margaret Davidson Munzer on July 4, 2004,[51] at his beach house in East Hampton, New York.[5] The couple has three children.[54] Loeb is a founding "Master Player" of Portfolios with Purpose, an annual virtual stock trading contest that raises money for charitable causes of the winning contestants' choice.[55]
Loeb has called himself a "lifelong surfer" with "a 'secret spot' in the Caribbean". His second favorite surfing spot is in Indonesia.[56] Third Point takes its name from "a break at Malibu's Surfrider Beach."[57]
In 2014, Loeb was reported as one of a number of "prominent investors [who] have taken to Transcendental Meditation".[58]
Loeb was co-chair of the Governors for Investors Industry (2013).[59] He is a trustee of Mount Sinai Hospital, the Manhattan Institute, the U.S. Olympic Committee and the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art. He is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and of the National Council of the American Enterprise Institute.[59]
Political and economic views[edit]
Loeb has donated to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, Friends for Harry Reid, Obama for America, Forward Together PAC, Prosperity PAC, Straight Talk America, and the Volunteer PAC. In 2013, Loeb was a signatory to an amicus curiae brief submitted to the U.S. Supreme Court in Hollingsworth v. Perry, in support of same-sex marriage.[60][61][62][63]
In 2015, Loeb, Paul Singer and Tim Gill helped fund Freedom For All Americans to promote LGBT issues in states and local communities in the United States.[64]
Wealth and philanthropy[edit]
According to Forbes Magazine, his net worth is $2.9 billion USD as of February 2017.[65]
The Daniel S Loeb Family Third Point Foundation[edit]
The Daniel S Loeb Family Third Point Foundation earned $6.39 million in profits in 2011 and had $4.45 billion in assets at the end of that year, making it one of the largest and highest-earning private foundations. Its nonprofit administrative expense ratio, a measure of its operating and administrating expenses, was 0.44%, compared to the 2011 average of 19.7% for all private foundations.[66]
Loeb is heavily involved in education reform efforts, specifically supporting charter schools.[67] Loeb is chairman of the board of Success Academy Charter Schools in Brooklyn.[16] In June 2013, he pledged to donate $3 million to Success Academy Charter Schools.[68] He endowed the Daniel S. Loeb Scholarship for undergraduate study at Columbia University. Since 2004, he has been a trustee of Prep for Prep, an organization in New York City that prepares underprivileged children to attend competitive private schools. He is active in the Jewish Enrichment Center, which provides young people with an education in Judaism. Additionally, he is a co-founder of Students First New York, the state branch of the national education advocacy organization.[10]
On February 20, 2014, Loeb attended a discussion between the American Enterprise Institute and the Dalai Lama. The two worldviews debated the morality of capitalism and free enterprise. In Loeb's presentation, he said he practices Ashtanga yoga and applies yoga principles to his business and his decision-making. He noted that these principles aided in his decision to donate to a charter school in the Bronx, which is now ranked third in the state of New York.[69][70]
In October 2011, Loeb challenged three former Navy SEALs to run the "MightyMan" Half Iron Triathlon with him and his team in Montauk, New York. He made a sizable contribution for each Navy SEAL Foundation director who completed the triathlon to raise funds for the foundation.[71][72][73]
In 2011, 2012, and 2013, Loeb and his wife made significant donations to the Alzheimer's Drug Discovery Foundation (ADDF), which funds over 400 Alzheimer's drug discovery programs in academic centers and biotechnology companies in 18 different countries.[74][75][76]
Loeb and his wife have also donated to the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, Ovarian Cancer Research Fund, Chai Lifeline, and the Michael J. Fox Foundation.[77]
Art collection[edit]
He is a prominent art collector and the walls at his Park Avenue office are covered with paintings", according to a New York Times August 26, 2013 article.[78] At a Sotheby's auction in 2009, Manhattan dealer Larry Gagosian purchased Jeff Koons' Baroque Egg With Bow (Turquoise/Magenta) for $5.4 million from Loeb, who had bought it from the Gagosian Gallery in 2004 for about $3 million.[79]
Loeb has traced his love of art to his student years at Columbia, when he saw Poussin's The Rape of the Sabine Women at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and took an art humanities class as part of the core curriculum. The "prep school kids" treated him like a "jerk", thinking they "all knew so much more", but in the end "I got one of two A's, and all the prep school snotty kids didn't."[80]
Business Insider placed Loeb at the top of its list of "Wall Street's 25 Most Serious Art Collectors", noting he owns works by Mike Kelley, Richard Prince, Basquiat, Andy Warhol and Cindy Sherman, and that he “has his own curator.”[81]

Early life and education[edit]
Loeb was born to a Jewish family,[3] the son of Ronald and Clare (née Spark) Loeb,[5] was raised in Santa Monica, California where he attended Palisades Charter High School.[3][6][7] At the school, he took AP classes, started a skateboard company and was nicknamed "Milo Minderbinder" by one of his teachers (after a character in the novel Catch-22 who had a fascination with the stock market).[8] His father was a partner at the Los Angeles law firm of Irell & Manella LLP[6] and general counsel for Williams-Sonoma.[5] His father also served as an outside director of Mattel, Inc. for over 30 years and during one period became interim President of Mattel. His mother is a historian.[5][6]
Loeb's great-aunt, Ruth Handler, created the Barbie doll and co-founded Mattel Inc.[6] In 2009, Loeb told an audience "[I] associated success in business with Hot Wheels and Barbie dolls. I think it was a very powerful enforcer early on to like business."[8]
Loeb attended the University of California at Berkeley for two years and subsequently graduated from Columbia University with an economics degree.[9] By his senior year at Columbia, he had made $120,000 in the stock market, but lost it all on an investment in a firm called Puritan-Bennett Inc. The loss taught him a lesson, he later said, in "overconcentrating positions".[8]
Investing career[edit]
From 1984 to 1987, Loeb worked at private equity firm Warburg Pincus.[10] He then worked as director of corporate development at Island Records, a record label, where he focused on securing debt financing.[11] After Island Records, Loeb worked as a risk arbitrage analyst at Lafer Equity Investors and then, from 1991 to 1994, as senior vice-president in the distressed debt department at Jefferies LLC. At Jefferies, he focused on bankruptcy analysis, trading bank loans and selling distressed securities. He moved on to become a Citigroup vice president from 1994–95, in charge of high-yield bond sales.[10]
Third Point Management[edit]
Main article: Third Point Management
Loeb started Third Point Management in 1995 "with $3.3 million from family and friends".
Under Loeb’s guidance, Third Point Management’s annualized returns since inception (Dec. 1996 – Dec. 2015) total approximately +16.2%.[12] In 2012, the firm returned +21.2%, outperforming the S&P 500's return of +16.0% and making it one of best performing hedge funds that year.[13][14] In 2013, the firm returned +25.2%, while the S&P 500 returned +32.4%.[15] Loeb appeared in Forbes' 2013 list of the world's 40 richest hedge-fund managers and traders.[16][17]In 2014, the firm returned +5.7%, while the S&P 500 returned +13.7%.[18] In 2015, the firm returned -1.4%, while the S&P 500 returned +1.4%.[19]
Yahoo![edit]
In 2012, Loeb, who through Third Point LLC, held 5.8% of Yahoo! stock, sought seats on the Yahoo! board for himself, former NBC Universal CEO Jeff Zucker, former Goldman Sachs executive Harry Wilson and former MTV Networks executive Michael J. Wolf.[20]
On May 3, 2012, Loeb revealed that the new CEO of Yahoo!, Scott Thompson, did not have a computer science degree, as had been commonly assumed for many years.[21][22] Thompson resigned on May 13, 2012.[23] Reuters then announced that Loeb, Wilson and Wolf would become members of the Yahoo! board.[24] Marissa Mayer was then appointed as CEO to replace Thompson. In July 2013, Loeb, Wilson, and Wolf resigned from Yahoo!'s board, leaving Yahoo! with a seven-member board. Yahoo! agreed to buy back 40 million shares at $1.6 billion from Third Point.[25][26]
Sony[edit]
In May 2013, Loeb proposed splitting Sony's entertainment and electronics businesses, arguing that such a split would increase profits.[27][28][29]
On June 18, 2013, Third Point LLC announced it had increased its stake in Sony to 70 million shares, or about 7 percent, valued at $1.4 billion.[30] According to Bloomberg.com, Sony's board of directors considered Loeb's proposal and hired Morgan Stanley and Citigroup, Inc. to evaluate it.[31]
Actor George Clooney, whose Smokehouse Pictures production company has a contract with Sony's entertainment division, publicly opposed the proposal.[32][33]
As of May 2014, Sony remained 12 percent lower than when Loeb first suggested for them to split. Sony had its sixth annual loss in seven years with shares dropping 8.8 percent as of May 2014. In February 2014, Sony said it would sell its PC business to buyout Japan industrial Partners Inc. and split its TV manufacturing unit into an independently operated entity. Ayano Iguchi, a company spokeswoman, said Sony was "focused on creating shareholder value by executing on our plan to revitalize and grow the electronics business, while further strengthening the entertainment and financial service businesses." Chris Konstantinos, director of international portfolio managements at RiverFront stated that a breakup was "long overdue."[34]
In October 2014, Loeb sold his shares in Sony and later wrote, “They have a long way to go and we continue to believe that more urgency will be necessary to definitively turn around the company’s fortunes".[35][36]
Sotheby's[edit]
In October 2013, Loeb issued a letter scrutinizing the governance of Sotheby's.[37] It announced that Third Point had acquired "9.3% of the outstanding shares" and addressed Third Point's concerns regarding the governance of Sotheby's. These concerns are summarized as, "we are troubled by the Company's chronically weak operating margins and deteriorating competitive position relative to Christie's, as evidenced by each of the Contemporary and Modern art evening sales over the last several years."[37] The letter expressed strong skepticism of Sotheby's international strategy—"Sotheby's is struggling internationally, lagging in newer markets like China and the Middle East"—and called for the removal of William Ruprecht from all his positions.[37]
After Sotheby's instituted a "poison pill" to stop Third Point from growing its position past 10%, Third Point brought a lawsuit in the state of Delaware; however, on May 3, 2014, Vice Chancellor Donald Parsons of the Delaware Court of Chancery ruled that the auction house was justified in its use of the corporate action. On May 5, Loeb and Sotheby's reached an agreement, stipulating that Loeb, Olivier Reza and Harry J. Wilson join the board in exchange for Third Point having an ownership cap at 15%. William Ruprecht remained CEO and the proxy contest ceased.[38][39] After 35 years at Sotheby's, Ruprecht retired as CEO. On March 16, 2015, Sotheby's named Tad Smith as its new president and chief executive.[40][41]
Fanuc[edit]
In late 2014, Loeb's Third Point took a stake in Fanuc, a robotics and computer numerical controls firm. Prior, Fanuc seldom made direct contact with its investors but in March 2014, the company decided "it would start talking to shareholders" and "return some of its cash to them." Loeb met with Fanuc's President, Yoshiharu Inaba, with encouragement from Japan's government officials, and was deemed a top prospect for "shaking up Japanese firms."[42][43][44]
Ligand Pharmaceuticals[edit]
In January 2007, when John Higgins became CEO of Ligand Pharmaceuticals, Loeb bought into the biotech firm to cut its losses and grow revenue. Loeb invested $50 million, increased the company’s profit to $250 million, and bought back $68 million in stock.[45]
Seven & I[edit]
In April 2016, Loeb won a battle in his drive to shake up corporate Japan who had "been sheltered from agitating investors." Seven & I Holdings Co.'s board was planning to replace Ryuichi Isaka as head of the company however, Loeb recommended Isaka as a successor to Toshifumi Suzuki, chairman and chief executive. On April 7, Suzuki resigned after losing a boardroom dispute with Loeb. Loeb wrote in a March 27, 2016 letter to Seven & I directors, "Mr. Isaka should be rewarded—not demoted—for his performance and commitment to delivering results for shareholders... This isn’t a dynasty. This is a corporation."[46][47][48] Loeb has pushed for the company to focus on its convenience store line while ridding its plans to expand its department and supermarket store franchises.[49]
Nestle[edit]
On 27 June 2017, Loeb announced to invest $3B into Nestle shares.[50]
Investment philosophy[edit]
New York magazine noted that Loeb's "preferred strategy" is to buy into troubled companies, replace inefficient management, and return the companies to profitability, which "is the key to his success."[3]
Letters[edit]
On Wall Street, Loeb has a reputation for "financial savvy" and for "his withering criticism of corporate executives who are unfortunate enough to stumble in his sights".[9] One of Loeb's signature tactics involves letter-writing:

Loeb is well known in Hedgeworld for his attacks on what he views as greedy execs who also happen to be depressing shareholder value. Of shares he owns. "The moral-indignation business", Loeb sometimes calls it. "Hedge-fund guys love to read Loeb's attacks; 'he articulates what people feel', says one."[3]

Often these letters cite the results of investigations he has ordered, detailing management decisions and actions he considers detrimental to shareholder value. The letters usually accompany his government filings.[3] Loeb once spent more than $4 million to increase his stake in a company to more than 5%, the statutory threshold requiring investor filings with the SEC, in order to file one of his letters criticizing the firm's management.[3] According to New York magazine, "Loeb is proud of his letters, which are thorough, well argued, and filled with clever turns of phrase. (He had a batch prepared for his high-school English teacher.)"[3] A 2005 New Yorker "The Talk of the Town" item described him as "a kind of investor's H. L. Mencken."[51]
In a 2005 letter responding to a job inquiry by a U.K. fund manager Loeb bristled at the applicant's reference to his (the applicant's) "place in society", telling the applicant that he would "have plenty of time to discuss your 'place in society' with the other fellows at the club." At Third Point, Loeb explained, "'one's place in society' does not matter at all. We are a bunch of scrappy guys from diverse backgrounds (Jewish, Muslim, Hindu etc) who enjoy outwitting pompous asses like yourself in financial markets globally."[52] Similarly, in a September 2005 letter to Ligand Pharmaceuticals CEO David Robinson, Loeb expressed wonder that Ligand's board of directors had not shown Robinson "the door long ago – accompanied by a well worn boot planted in the backside."[52]
Loeb sent a letter to John Collins, chairman and CEO of InterCept, in 2004, accusing InterCept of following "a 'good ol' boy' set of ethics", pointing out that InterCept employed Collins' daughter and son-in-law, the latter of whom Loeb had recently reached by phone on a golf course during working hours. Loeb further noted his discovery that InterCept leased a jet from a partnership controlled by Collins and another board member.[52]
He wrote to Irik Sevin, CEO of Star Gas Partners, in February 2005, calling him "one of the most dangerous and incompetent executives in America" and accusing him of "ineptitude" and of using the firm as his "personal 'honey pot'". He wrote: "I was amused to learn, in the course of our investigation, that at Cornell University there is an 'Irik Sevin Scholarship'. One can only pity the poor student who suffers the indignity of attaching your name to his academic record." Loeb demanded the resignation from the firm's board of Sevin's "elderly 78-year old mum" and insisted that Sevin also "step down … so that you can do what you do best: retreat to your waterfront mansion in the Hamptons where you can play tennis and hobnob with your fellow socialites."[52]
A 2005 New York Times article reported that many hedge-fund managers were now writing letters to the SEC demanding executives take specific actions and cited Loeb's letter to Sevin as exemplary of the genre, noting that three weeks after the letter was sent, "Sevin was gone, and a jubilant Mr. Loeb sent out an e-mail message to friends and associates declaring a 'huge victory for Third Point.'"[53]
Personal life[edit]
Loeb married Margaret Davidson Munzer on July 4, 2004,[51] at his beach house in East Hampton, New York.[5] The couple has three children.[54] Loeb is a founding "Master Player" of Portfolios with Purpose, an annual virtual stock trading contest that raises money for charitable causes of the winning contestants' choice.[55]
Loeb has called himself a "lifelong surfer" with "a 'secret spot' in the Caribbean". His second favorite surfing spot is in Indonesia.[56] Third Point takes its name from "a break at Malibu's Surfrider Beach."[57]
In 2014, Loeb was reported as one of a number of "prominent investors [who] have taken to Transcendental Meditation".[58]
Loeb was co-chair of the Governors for Investors Industry (2013).[59] He is a trustee of Mount Sinai Hospital, the Manhattan Institute, the U.S. Olympic Committee and the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art. He is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and of the National Council of the American Enterprise Institute.[59]
Political and economic views[edit]
Loeb has donated to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, Friends for Harry Reid, Obama for America, Forward Together PAC, Prosperity PAC, Straight Talk America, and the Volunteer PAC. In 2013, Loeb was a signatory to an amicus curiae brief submitted to the U.S. Supreme Court in Hollingsworth v. Perry, in support of same-sex marriage.[60][61][62][63]
In 2015, Loeb, Paul Singer and Tim Gill helped fund Freedom For All Americans to promote LGBT issues in states and local communities in the United States.[64]
Wealth and philanthropy[edit]
According to Forbes Magazine, his net worth is $2.9 billion USD as of February 2017.[65]
The Daniel S Loeb Family Third Point Foundation[edit]
The Daniel S Loeb Family Third Point Foundation earned $6.39 million in profits in 2011 and had $4.45 billion in assets at the end of that year, making it one of the largest and highest-earning private foundations. Its nonprofit administrative expense ratio, a measure of its operating and administrating expenses, was 0.44%, compared to the 2011 average of 19.7% for all private foundations.[66]
Loeb is heavily involved in education reform efforts, specifically supporting charter schools.[67] Loeb is chairman of the board of Success Academy Charter Schools in Brooklyn.[16] In June 2013, he pledged to donate $3 million to Success Academy Charter Schools.[68] He endowed the Daniel S. Loeb Scholarship for undergraduate study at Columbia University. Since 2004, he has been a trustee of Prep for Prep, an organization in New York City that prepares underprivileged children to attend competitive private schools. He is active in the Jewish Enrichment Center, which provides young people with an education in Judaism. Additionally, he is a co-founder of Students First New York, the state branch of the national education advocacy organization.[10]
On February 20, 2014, Loeb attended a discussion between the American Enterprise Institute and the Dalai Lama. The two worldviews debated the morality of capitalism and free enterprise. In Loeb's presentation, he said he practices Ashtanga yoga and applies yoga principles to his business and his decision-making. He noted that these principles aided in his decision to donate to a charter school in the Bronx, which is now ranked third in the state of New York.[69][70]
In October 2011, Loeb challenged three former Navy SEALs to run the "MightyMan" Half Iron Triathlon with him and his team in Montauk, New York. He made a sizable contribution for each Navy SEAL Foundation director who completed the triathlon to raise funds for the foundation.[71][72][73]
In 2011, 2012, and 2013, Loeb and his wife made significant donations to the Alzheimer's Drug Discovery Foundation (ADDF), which funds over 400 Alzheimer's drug discovery programs in academic centers and biotechnology companies in 18 different countries.[74][75][76]
Loeb and his wife have also donated to the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, Ovarian Cancer Research Fund, Chai Lifeline, and the Michael J. Fox Foundation.[77]
Art collection[edit]
He is a prominent art collector and the walls at his Park Avenue office are covered with paintings", according to a New York Times August 26, 2013 article.[78] At a Sotheby's auction in 2009, Manhattan dealer Larry Gagosian purchased Jeff Koons' Baroque Egg With Bow (Turquoise/Magenta) for $5.4 million from Loeb, who had bought it from the Gagosian Gallery in 2004 for about $3 million.[79]
Loeb has traced his love of art to his student years at Columbia, when he saw Poussin's The Rape of the Sabine Women at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and took an art humanities class as part of the core curriculum. The "prep school kids" treated him like a "jerk", thinking they "all knew so much more", but in the end "I got one of two A's, and all the prep school snotty kids didn't."[80]
Business Insider placed Loeb at the top of its list of "Wall Street's 25 Most Serious Art Collectors", noting he owns works by Mike Kelley, Richard Prince, Basquiat, Andy Warhol and Cindy Sherman, and that he “has his own curator.”[81]

On Wall Street, Time to Mend Fences With Obama


				By Susanne Craig and Nicholas Confessore			
November 7, 2012 8:28 pm
November 7, 2012 8:28 pm




Steve Marcus/ReutersDaniel Loeb, a hedge fund titan, backed Barack Obama in 2008, but Mitt Romney in 2012.
Del Frisco’s, an expensive steakhouse with floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the Boston harbor, was a festive scene on Tuesday evening. The hedge fund billionaires Steven A. Cohen, Paul Singer and Daniel Loeb were among the titans of finance there dining among the gray velvet banquettes before heading several blocks away to what they hoped would be a victory party for their presidential candidate, Mitt Romney.
The next morning was a cold, sobering one for these executives.
Few industries have made such a one-sided bet as Wall Street did in opposing President Obama and supporting his Republican rival. The top five sources of contributions to Mr. Romney, a former top private equity executive, were big banks like Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Wealthy financiers — led by hedge fund investors — were the biggest group of givers to the main “super PAC” backing Mr. Romney, providing almost $33 million, and gave generously to outside groups in races around the country.

DealBook's Election Coverage



 On Wednesday, Mr. Loeb, who had supported Mr. Obama in 2008, was sanguine. “You win some, you lose some,” he said in an interview. “We can all disagree. I have friends and we have spirited discussions. Sure, I am not getting invited to the White House anytime soon, but as citizens of the country we are all friendly.”
Wall Street, however, now has to come to terms with an administration it has vilified. What Washington does next will be critically important for the industry, as regulatory agencies work to put their final stamp on financial regulations and as tax increases and spending cuts are set to take effect in the new year unless a deal to avert them is reached. To not have a friend in the White House at this time is one thing, but to have an enemy is quite another.
Steve Marcus/ReutersSteven Cohen of SAC Capital supported Mr. Romney.
“Wall Street is now going to have to figure out how to make this relationship work,” said Glenn Schorr, an analyst who follows the big banks for the investment bank Nomura. “It’s not impossible, but it’s not the starting point they had hoped for.”
Traditionally, the financial industry has tended to support Republican candidates, but, being pragmatic about power, has also donated to Democrats. That script got a rewrite in 2008, when many on Wall Street supported Mr. Obama as an intelligent leader for a country reeling from the financial crisis. Goldman employees were the leading source of campaign donations for Mr. Obama, who reaped far more contributions — roughly $16 million — from Wall Street than did his opponent, John McCain.
The love affair between Wall Street and Mr. Obama soured soon after he took office and championed an overhaul in financial regulations that became the Dodd-Frank Act.
Some financial executives complained that in meetings with the president, they found him uninterested and disengaged, while others on Wall Street never forgave Mr. Obama for calling them “fat cats.”
The disillusionment with the president spawned reams of critical commentary from Wall Street executives.
“So long as our leaders tell us that we must trust them to regulate and redistribute our way back to prosperity, we will not break out of this economic quagmire,” Mr. Loeb wrote in one letter to his investors.
The rhetoric at times became extreme, like the time Steven A. Schwarzman, co-founder of the private equity firm Blackstone Group, compared a tax proposal to “when Hitler invaded Poland in 1939.” (Mr. Schwarzman later apologized for the remark.)
Mr. Loeb was not alone in switching allegiances in the recent presidential race. Hedge fund executives like Leon Cooperman who had supported Mr. Obama in 2008 were big backers of Mr. Romney in 2012. And Wall Street chieftains like Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase and Lloyd C. Blankfein of Goldman Sachs, who have publicly been Democrats in the past, kept a low profile during this election. But their firms’ employees gave money to Mr. Romney in waves.
Starting over with the Obama White House will not be easy. One senior Wall Street lawyer who spoke on condition of anonymity said Wall Street “made a bad mistake” in pushing so hard for Mr. Romney. “They are going to pay a price,” he said. “It will soften over time, but there will be a price.”
Mr. Obama is not without supporters on Wall Street. Prominent executives like Hamilton James of Blackstone, and Robert Wolf, a former top banker at UBS, were in Chicago on Tuesday night, celebrating with the president.
“What we learned is the people on Wall Street have one vote just like everyone else,” Mr. Wolf said. Still, while the support Wall Street gave Mr. Romney is undeniable, Mr. Wolf said, “Mr. Obama wants a healthy private sector, and that includes Wall Street.
“If you look at fiscal reform, infrastructure, immigration and education, they are all bipartisan issues and are more aligned than some people make it seem.”
Reshma Saujani, a former hedge fund lawyer who was among Mr. Obama’s top bundlers this year and is planning to run for city office next year, agreed.
“Most people in the financial services sector are social liberals who support gay marriage and believe in a woman’s right to choose, so I think many of them will swing back to Democrats in the future,” she said.
Correction: November 8, 2012 An earlier version of this article misidentified Reshma Saujani as a male.

<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
