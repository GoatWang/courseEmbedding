Delivery & Returns



 

Brighten blonde or grey hair with this purple shampoo
With each use, hair is temporarily more vibrant and shiny
Great for use in between salon visits to make your colour last longer
Ideal for naturally grey hair that needs a colour boost, or natural/dyed blonde hair that has started to look brassy
 



Apply to wet hair
Lather well with a gentle kneading of the scalp
Rinse and repeat if necessary
Follow with the appropriate Philip Kingsley conditioner and scalp toner


 


Optical Brighteners and Violet Hues – reduce appearance of discolouration, giving reflective shine and a brighter appearance
Ethylhexylglycerin – delivers moisture to the hair

 


Of all colouring methods, bleach is potentially the most damaging, and therefore should ideally always be done professionally. Bleaching raises your hairs’ outer cuticle, allowing the bleaching agent to fully penetrate. However, repeated bleaching can permanently raise the cuticle scales and allow rapid and continuous loss of moisture.  
Damage from bleach includes dry, brittle, inelastic hair, and hair that is more prone to breakage and split ends. Bleached hair is also more porous and swollen and therefore more vulnerable to other chemical and non-chemical processes. These include everything from permanent wave solutions in curling or straightening to regular heated styling with blow-dryers, straightening irons and brushes. While any and all bleaches have a damaging effect on your hair’s protein structure, the more often you bleach or highlight your hair, the more damaged it will be. 

 

Delivery Royal Mail (2-5 working days. Only available on items less than £40) £2.45 Next Day Delivery (Next working day, when ordered before 1pm) £4.95 Due to Royal Mail restrictions, aerosol products can only be shipped via Next Day Delivery We ship throughout Europe and Rest of World, find more information click here.

 Glowing
I am about to re-order the Pure Silver Shampoo and Conditioner and glancing at the reviews I thought I would share my experience. I am 66 years and have been turning from strawberry blonde to white around my face since my late 20's. Color treated for over 30 years and then just decided it was crazy to be eating organic/vegan and then having chemicals saturate my scalp every four weeks. My white hair had a brassy look and I decided to switch from another high end hair product to Philip Kingsley. I was sitting in my local bagel shop and a complete stranger approached me and said " your hair is beautiful and from where I am sitting you look like an angel; just stunning; is this natural?" I am now committed.

 OK but doesn't seem worth the price
I don't care for it that much, doesn't seem worth the price to me. My hair gets clean but doesn't seem much improved and I don't care for the smell - like chemicals. I splurged on this because of the glowing reviews but won't buy it again.  Others apparently like it, though, so maybe it's just me. :-)

 No more grey
Noticing a few grey hairs here and there was enough to throw me over the edge; several highlights left my hair dry and a scalp uncomfortable. I finally discovered PK Pure Silver shampoo and conditioner. Even my hairdresser has noticed a remarkable difference. Highlights last longer. No more dry hair.  Looking far younger now. I love all of PK hair products. Expensive but worth every penny.

 Great Product
I have naturally very blonde, fine hair to which I add highlights to give a bit of body. They do tend to go a bit brassy over time. This shampoo restores the cool radiance I like. It smells gorgeous and leaves my hair glossy and swishy but not lank or limp. A very nice product and as ever the quality is so high you only need to use a small amount so it is not as expensive as it appears at all.

 Changes everything
I have been using the Pure Silver Shampoo and Conditioner for about 7 months now exclusively.  I don't color my hair and the texture had changed as it's been going silver, and was looking dull and frizzy.  My husband just commented today while looking at the back of my head how really good my hair looks.  It is extremely soft to the touch, easy to style, and doesn't have the flyaways that it used to have.  It's quite an investment for shampoo and conditioner I know.  I did get the elasticizer, but don't use it or feel I need it in addition to these two products really, but it might have helped kick start the changes.  Having hair that's healthy, shiny, bouncy and feels thick makes my  silver and greys really stand out in a crowd now.  I use one pump from the large bottles each for rmy long hair and still have a few months before I run out even after I shared some with my Mom!

 Product Description
 
Designed with violet hues and Optical Brightener, gently cleanses whilst adding shine to dull, discoloured, grey hair and brassy blonde hair. Pure Silver Shampoo reduces the appearance of yellow discolouration leaving hair brighter and shinier. Directions of Use:  - Apply to your wet hair  - Lather well with a gentle kneading of your scalp - Rinse & repeat if necessary  - Follow with Pure Silver Conditioner & Scalp Toner. 



 Hair Guide

Of all colouring methods, bleach is potentially the most damaging, and therefore should ideally always be done professionally. Bleaching raises your hairs’ outer cuticle, allowing the bleaching agent to fully penetrate. However, repeated bleaching can permanently raise the cuticle scales and allow rapid and continuous loss of moisture.  
Damage from bleach includes dry, brittle, inelastic hair, and hair that is more prone to breakage and split ends. Bleached hair is also more porous and swollen and therefore more vulnerable to other chemical and non-chemical processes. These include everything from permanent wave solutions in curling or straightening to regular heated styling with blow-dryers, straightening irons and brushes. While any and all bleaches have a damaging effect on your hair’s protein structure, the more often you bleach or highlight your hair, the more damaged it will be.
