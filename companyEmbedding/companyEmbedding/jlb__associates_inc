 Our Investment Philosophy

 








We believe the most successful philosophy in building wealth for our clients requires a disciplined investment approach together with a long-term view of the markets. Consequently, market-timing and other short-term strategies are not part of the process in attempting to earn above-average rates of return. We offer portfolios that are comprised entirely of common stocks as well as a mixture of both stocks and bonds.
Our Investment Approach

Common Stocks
The center of equity (common stocks) portfolio management at JLB & Associates is a well-defined analytical process for selecting common stocks and a disciplined procedure for investing individual portfolios in those stock selections. Our common stock selection process is driven by our universe of two hundred companies, which is ranked based on their expected investment returns.
Our 200 Common Stock Universe contains companies that are highly profitable, have relatively low debt, retain a large portion of their earnings, and appear attractively valued compared with the overall market. With rare exception, the stocks are of companies incorporated in the United States, many of which have large international operations. The universe is comprised of small, medium, and large capitalization companies.
The goal of the common stock portion of a client’s portfolio is to outperform the Standard & Poor’s 500 Composite Stock Index measured over a three to five year time horizon.
Bonds

The procedure for managing fixed income portfolios is to select high quality bonds that are rated “investment grade” (Baa/BBB or better) at the time of purchase. Bonds with unusually long maturities and callable bonds are avoided.
Based on the outlook for interest rates, a decision may be made to lengthen or shorten the maturity structure of a client’s portfolio. Usually such an adjustment is gradual and without a high rate of turnover.

BBB Accreditation





                This Business Is Not BBB Accredited
            

                
                Businesses are under no obligation to seek BBB accreditation, and some businesses are not accredited because they have not sought BBB accreditation.
            

                To be accredited by BBB, a business must apply for accreditation and BBB must determine that the business meets
                BBB accreditation standards, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses must pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB:

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

                        JLB Builders & Associates, Inc. has received 3.68 out of 5 stars based on 1 Customer Reviews and a BBB Rating of A+.

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.
