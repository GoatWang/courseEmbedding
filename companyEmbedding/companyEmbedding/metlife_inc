I didn't know anything about financial investments or what i needed for the future. Jimmy met with me and he understood what i needed to invest in and what I didn't.  He's very honest and made me see the reality of things, such as what will happen in the near future and how i should prepare, cuz let's face it, we all need to prepare for ourself, our future, and for our family. i told him since im still pretty young do i need all this? but it's true, he made me realize the younger you start, it'll be more affordable and easier so in the long run the payout is higher. He was definitely not pushy AT ALL surprisingly, cuz i've met w/other advisors before, and they will always sell you plans or things that you don't need nor ever heard of. And, they don't really know what they're talking about where everything sounds like they're reciting out of a book. I had concerns whether a 401K or IRA will benefit me more and Jimmy was very knowledgeable and actually seemed to care. Very easy to talk to, and consistent. This company really has alot of options to choose from.







It was my first time meeting with a Financial Advisor so I didn't know what to expect. But I knew I had to speak to someone regarding my retirement, so I asked my close friend and she referred me to Jimmy at New England Financial. My first impression on him was that he was very friendly and knowledgeable. He gave me some great advice on my IRA and also help me figured out how much money I need and when I could retire all without any obligations. His philosiphy is to educate first so you can make an educated decision. Did not feel pressured at all and made me feel really comfortable.

Term Life Insurance


Offer your employees a fundamental part of their overall benefits program with basic, supplemental, and dependent term life insurance products to protect themselves and those they love.
Permanent Life Insurance1

Some employees may need a different type of protection to support their insurance and estate tax-planning needs. Permanent Life insurance can help provide the right solution for highly compensated employees and the broader based population.


MetLife offers a variety of AD&D products—basic, supplemental, dependent and voluntary—that provide valuable insurance protection, as well as "benefits" that your employees can take advantage of today.


In addition, MetLife offers MetLife AdvantagesSM, a comprehensive suite of services available with your Life insurance benefits offering such as Will Preparation2, MetLife Estate Resolution ServicesSM3, Travel Assistance with Identity Theft Solutions4 and Concierge services.  For more information and our complete listing of services, please visit Additional Benefits.












Like most group life insurance policies, MetLife group policies contain certain exclusions, limitations, and reductions of benefits and terms for keeping them in force. Please contact us for costs and complete details.
1 To the maturity age specified in the certificate. In some program designs, if the employer replaces MetLife permanent group life insurance with another group life insurance plan or otherwise terminates the MetLife group contract, employees' coverage may also be terminated, even after separation from employment or retirement.
2 Will Preparation Services are offered by Hyatt Legal Plans, Inc., a MetLife company, Cleveland, Ohio. In certain states, legal services benefits are provided through insurance coverage underwritten by Metropolitan Property and Casualty Insurance Company and Affiliates, Warwick, Rhode Island. For New York sitused cases, the Will Preparation service is an expanded offering that includes office consultations and telephone advice for certain other legal matters beyond Will Preparation.
3 Estate Resolution Services are offered by Hyatt Legal Plans, Inc., a MetLife company, Cleveland, Ohio. In certain states, Estate Resolution Services are provided through insurance coverage underwritten by Metropolitan Property and Casualty Insurance Company and Affiliates, Warwick, Rhode Island. Certain services are not covered by Estate Resolution Services, including matters in which there is a conflict of interest between the executor and any beneficiary or heir and the estate; any disputes with the group policyholder, MetLife and/or any of its affiliates; any disputes involving statutory benefits; will contests or litigation outside probate court; appeals; court costs, filing fees, recording fees, transcripts, witness fees, expenses to a third party, judgments or fines; and frivolous or unethical matters.
4 Travel Assistance and Identity Theft Solutions services are administered by AXA Assistance USA, Inc. Certain benefits provided under the Travel Assistance program are underwritten by the United States Fire Insurance Company, a member of the Crum & Forster group of insurers. AXA Assistance and the Crum & Forster group are not affiliated with MetLife, and the services and benefits they provide are separate and apart from the insurance provided by MetLife.
Group Term Life is issued by Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, New York, NY 10166. Policy Form GPNP99.
Optional Term Life, Dependent Life and AD&D coverage are provided under a group insurance policy (Policy Form GPNP99) issued to the group policyholder  by MetLife.

History[edit]
Early years[edit]




Home office of the New England Mutual Life Insurance Co. one of the predecessor companies of MetLife. see [30]


The predecessor company to MetLife began in 1863 when a group of New York City businessmen raised $100,000 to found the National Union Life and Limb Insurance Company. The company insured Civil War sailors and soldiers against disabilities due to wartime wounds, accidents, and sickness. On March 24, 1868, it became known as Metropolitan Life Insurance Company and shifted its focus to the life insurance business.[31][32]




The Metropolitan Life Insurance Company tower, which previously served as company headquarters, was featured in its advertising for many years.


A severe business depression that began with the Panic of 1873 forced the company to contract, until it reached its lowest point in the late 1870s. After observing the insurance industry in Great Britain in 1879, MetLife President Joseph F. Knapp brought “industrial” or “workingmen’s” insurance programs to the United States – insurance issued in small amounts on which premiums were collected weekly or monthly at the policyholder’s home. By 1880, sales had exceeded a quarter million of such policies, resulting in nearly $1 million in revenue from premiums. In 1909, MetLife had become the nation’s largest life insurer in the United States, as measured by life insurance in force (the total value of life insurance policies issued).[31][33]
In 1907, the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company tower was commissioned to serve as MetLife’s 23rd Street headquarters in Lower Manhattan. Completed two years later, the building was the world's tallest until 1913 and remained the company's headquarters until 2005. For many years, an illustration of the building (with light emanating from the tip of its spire and the slogan, "The Light That Never Fails") featured prominently in MetLife’s advertising.[34] By 1930, MetLife insured every fifth man, woman, and child in the United States and Canada.[35] During the 1930s, it also began to diversify its portfolio by reducing the percentage of individual mortgages in favor of public utility bonds, investments in government securities, and loans for commercial real estate.[35] The company financed the construction of the Empire State Building in 1929 as well as provided capital to build Rockefeller Center in 1931. During World War II, MetLife placed more than 51 percent of its total assets in war bonds, and was the largest single private contributor to the Allied cause.[35]
Postwar[edit]

During the postwar era, the company expanded its suburban presence, decentralized operations, and refocused its career agency system to serve all market segments. It also began to market group insurance products to employers and institutions. By 1979, operations were segmented into four primary businesses: group insurance, personal insurance, pensions, and investments.[35] In 1981, MetLife purchased what became known as the MetLife building for $400 million from a group that included Pan American World Airways.[36][37]

De-mutualization and IPO[edit]
In 2000, MetLife converted from a mutual insurance company operated for the benefit of its policyholders to a for-profit public company. The de-mutualization process allowed MetLife to enter unrelated insurance businesses and increase executive compensation.
Policyholders received some stock in the new company in this process.[38] MetLife was accused of breaching federal securities laws by misrepresenting and omitting information in materials given to policyholders during this process, resulting in years of litigation ending with a $50 million settlement in 2009.[39]
Acquisitions, sales, and major deals[edit]

1992 - merged with United Mutual Life Insurance Company, the only African-American life insurer in New York, in 1992.[40]
1992 - [41] acquired Executive Life's single premium deferred annuity business, which was worth approximately $1.2 billion. MetLife also acquired the firm's life insurance business, valued at about $260 million.[42]
1995 - purchased New England Mutual Life Insurance Company.[43]
1997 - acquired Security First Group in 1997 for $377 million.[44][45]
1999 - acquired Lincoln National Corporation's individual disability income unit.[46]
1999 - bought out reinsurance provider GenAmerica Corporation for $1.2 billion, as well as its subsidiaries, Reinsurance Group of America and Conning Corporation.[47][48] That year, the company had grown to serve 7 million policyholders.[49]
2000 - de-mutualization and IPO.[50][51] The initial public offering was valued at $6.5 billion, which was the largest IPO to that date in United States financial history.[50][51] MetLife policyholders were asked to choose a cash or stock stake. This IPO made MetLife the most widely owned stock in the United States, and it raised MetLife's value to over $4 billion.[52][53] By 2000, MetLife's reported number of policyholders had risen to 11 million,[53] and that year it had become the United States' number one life insurer, surpassing Prudential, according to The New York Times.[54]
2000 - $470 million voice and data network management deal with AT&T Solutions.[55]
2001 - acquired Grand Bank of Kingston, New Jersey, which was renamed MetLife Bank.[56][57]
2001 - invested $1 billion in the United States stock market during 2001, immediately after the September 11th terrorist attacks.[58]
2005 - acquired Citigroup’s Travelers Life & Annuity and all of Citigroup’s international insurance businesses for $11.8 billion.[59][60] At the time of the deal, which was completed on July 1, 2005, the Travelers acquisition made MetLife the largest individual life insurer in North America based on sales.[61]
2006 - opened joint-venture insurance company in Shanghai, in May 2006.[62][63]
2006 - sold Peter Cooper Village, or Stuyvesant Town, the largest apartment complexes in New York City at the time, for $5.4 billion.[64][65] MetLife had developed the apartment complexes between 1945 and 1947, to house veterans returning home from serving in World War II.[66]
2010 - bought American Life Insurance Company from AIG for US$15,500,000,000.[59]
2011 - sold MetLife bank to GE Capital, exiting banking business.[67]

Current era[edit]
From 2004 to 2011, MetLife continued to hold its position as the largest life insurer in the United States.[16][68] The company had $2.5 trillion in policies written, $350 billion in assets under management, over 12 million customers in the United States, 8 million customers outside the United States, and a net income in 2003 of $2.2 billion.[68] That year, Barron's reported that 13 million American households owned at least one product from MetLife.[69]
MetLife named Robert H. Benmosche as chairman and CEO in July 1999. Benmosche occupied the position until 2006, when he was replaced by C. Robert Henrikson.[16][70][71]
The company's sales grew 11.5% between 2008 and 2009, despite the national recession.[72] In 2011, CEO Robert Henrikson was replaced by Steven A. Kandarian, who had overseen the company's "US$450,000,000,000 investment portfolio" as chief investment officer.[16] Henrikson remained the company's chairman to the end of 2011, at which point he reached the company's mandatory retirement age.[16]
In 2015, MetLife was ranked as number one on Fortune magazine's list of World's Most Admired Companies in the Insurance: Life and Health category.[73]
In the summer of 2017, MetLife plans to add a third office building of 255,000 square feet at its Cary, North Carolina Global Technology Campus, giving the company a total of 655,000 square feet at a location which has over 1,000 employees in such areas as engineering, software and technology. This plan was the result of North Carolina awarding the company $94 million in incentives in 2013 for creating over 2,600 jobs, half in Cary and half in Charlotte.[74]
"Too big to fail"[edit]
In 2012, MetLife failed the Federal Reserve’s (the Fed's) Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review stress test, intended to predict the potential failure of the company in a recession. The Fed stated that the minimum total risk-based capital ratio should be 8% and it estimated MetLife's ratio at 6%. The company had requested approval for a US$2,000,000,000 share repurchase to prop up the stock price, along with an increased dividend.[75] Because MetLife owned MetLife Bank, it was subject to stricter financial regulation. To escape that level of regulation, MetLife announced the sale of its banking unit to GE Capital.[76][77] On November 2, 2012, MetLife said it was selling its US$70,000,000,000 mortgage servicing business to JPMorgan Chase for an undisclosed amount.[78] Both sales were part of its strategy to focus on the insurance side of its business.
The attempt to escape "too big to fail" regulation was not successful. In September 2014, the United States government observed the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law by proposing the application of an official label to MetLife as "systemically important" to the American economy.[79] If implemented, MetLife would be subject to different sets of rules and regulations, with increased oversight from the Federal Reserve.[79][80] The company appealed this proposal in November 2014.[81] In December 2014, federal regulators decided that MetLife required the special regulations reserved for financial companies and organizations deemed "systemically important," or "too big to fail".[82] MetLife announced in January 2015 that it would file a lawsuit against the District of Columbia to overturn the federal regulators' decision,[79] thus becoming the first nonbank to challenge such a decision.[83] Three other nonbank companies have been designated as "systemically important": AIG, General Electric and Prudential.[82][83] MetLife continued to litigate this issue as of mid-2015, with the US Department of Justice asking that their challenge be dismissed.[83]
Fines[edit]
On August 7, 2012, it was announced that MetLife will pay $3.2 million in fines after the Federal Reserve charged it used unsafe and unsound practices in handling its mortgage servicing and foreclosure operations.[84]
In 2014, MetLife paid $23 million to settle multiple lawsuits over junk fax operations used to generate leads for life insurance sales.[85]


"MetLife Bank took advantage of the FHA insurance program by knowingly turning a blind eye to mortgage loans that did not meet basic underwriting requirements, and stuck the FHA and taxpayers with the bill when those mortgages defaulted."

U.S. Attorney John Walsh
In 2015, MetLife Home Loans LLC paid $123.5 million to the United States Department of Justice to resolve allegations it knowingly made mortgages insured by the United States government that didn’t meet federal underwriting requirements.[86]

MetLife Hall of Records, Yonkers, New York.


As of 2010[update], MetLife had a "diverse product mix" which included insurance (home, car and life), variable life annuities and structured settlements, commercial mortgages and securities backed by commercial mortgages, and sovereign debt.[15]
Life insurance[edit]
MetLife’s individual life insurance products and services comprise term life insurance and several types of permanent life insurance, including whole life, universal life, and final expense whole life insurance.[87][88] These services vary in regards to the duration and amount of coverage available and whether a medical exam is required for coverage. The company also offers group life insurance, provided through employers, which consists of term life, permanent life, and accidental death and dismemberment coverage.[89][90] MetLife is the largest life insurer in the United States, based on life insurance in-force.[10][15]
Dental[edit]
MetLife offers group dental benefit plans for individuals, employees, retirees and their families and provides dental plan administration for over 20 million people.[91][92] Plans include MetLife’s Preferred Dentist Program (PPO) and the SafeGuard DHMO (available for both individuals and employees in CA, FL, TX, NJ and NY.). As of May 2010, MetLife’s dental PPO network included over 135,000 participating dentist locations nationwide while the dental HMO network included more than 13,000 participating dentist locations in California, Florida and Texas.[93] MetLife also administers dental continuing education program for dentists and allied health care professionals, which are recognized by the American Dental Association (ADA) and the Academy of General Dentistry (AGD).[94]
Disability[edit]
MetLife provides disability products for individuals as well as employee and association groups who receive them through their employer.[14][95] For individuals, the company’s individual disability income insurance can replace a portion of lost income if an individual is unable to work due to sickness or injury.[96] MetLife offers several individual disability income policies, including MetLife Income Guard, OMNI Advantage, OMNI Essential, Business Overhead Expense, and Buy-Sell.[97] The policy options provided by the company vary in terms of eligibility and the provided coverage. For groups, MetLife offers short term disability insurance and long term disability insurance.[98] Short term disability insurance is structured to replace a portion of an individual’s income during the initial weeks of a disabling illness or accident.[99] Long term disability Insurance serves to replace a portion of an individual’s income during an extended period of a disabling illness or accident.[100][101] The company also maintains an absence management product which allows employers to track and manage both planned and unplanned employee absences. The product, which MetLife calls MetLife Total Absence Management, is structured for businesses with 1,000 or more employees.[102]
Annuities[edit]
MetLife is among the largest providers of annuities in the world, recording $22.4 billion in sales during 2009.[103] MetLife offers annuities which consist of fixed annuities, variable annuities, deferred annuities and immediate annuities.[104] In 1921, MetLife was the first company to issue a group annuity contract.[105] More recently in 2004, it was the first insurer to introduce a longevity insurance product.[106] As of December 31, 2009, MetLife globally managed group annuity assets of $60 billion with $34 billion of transferred pension liabilities and provided benefit payments to over 600,000 annuitants per month.[107]
Auto & Home[edit]
MetLife Auto & Home is the brand name for MetLife’s nine affiliate personal lines insurance companies.[108] Collectively these companies offer personal lines property and casualty insurance policies in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.[109] The flagship company in the MetLife Auto & Home group, Metropolitan Property and Casualty Insurance Company, was founded in 1972.[108] MetLife Auto & Home companies presently have over 2.7 million active policies and service 58 of the Fortune 100 companies.[110][111]
MetLife's home insurance solutions include homeowners insurance, condo insurance, renters insurance, insurance for landlords, and mobile home insurance.[112][113] The available policies for MetLife's home insurance provide coverage for possessions, property damage from natural disaster or theft, and various legal expenses incurred resulting from injuries sustained on an individual's property.[114] The companies also sell RV, ATV, boat, mobile home, collectible vehicle, and motorcycle policies[115] and offers flood insurance policies as a participant in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), which is managed by the federal government.[116][117] MetLife's various types of coverage for auto insurance include liability protection, collision and comprehensive coverage, personal injury protection, rental car coverage, and uninsured and underinsured motorists coverage.[118][119] Through an arrangement with Hyatt Legal Plans, a subsidiary of MetLife, MetLife Auto & Home underwrites group legal plans in many states.[18]
It was the first national insurer in the United States to offer identity-theft resolution services at no extra premium and as of 2012 continues to do so today in most United States states.[120][121] In 2010, MetLife Auto & Home began offering their GrandProtect plan in most states. This GrandProtect policy simplifies complex insurance needs by combining a client's home, valuable items, autos, RVs, and boats into one comprehensive policy package. The ultimate benefits to the consumer are having one bill, only one deductible, comprehensive coverage, and typically lower rates than trying to get each policy individually.[122]
Other products[edit]
MetLife’s products also include critical illness insurance.[123] Financial services include fee-based financial planning, retirement planning, wealth management, 529 Plans, banking, and commercial and residential mortgages.[124] The company also provides retirement plan and other financial services to healthcare, education, and not-for-profit organizations.[125] The MetLife Center for Special Needs Planning is a group of planners which serve families and individuals with special needs.[126] In 2014, MetLife launched MetLife Defender, a digital identity theft protection product.[127]
International presence[edit]
Outside of the United States, MetLife operates in Latin America, Europe, Asia’s Pacific region, and the Middle East, with leading market positions in Mexico, Japan, South Korea and Chile.[9]
On March 8, 2010, MetLife announced its intent to purchase the international leader life-insurance business, American Life Insurance Company (Alico), from American International Group (AIG). MetLife, which completed the deal on November 1, 2010, paid approximately $7.2 billion in cash and $9.0 billion in MetLife equity and other securities.[128][129] The securities portion of the deal consisted of 78.2 million shares of MetLife common stock, 6.9 million shares of contingent convertible preferred stock and 40 million equity units.[130] The values of the common and preferred stock were based on the closing price of MetLife’s common stock on October 29.[130] Upon completion of the purchase, MetLife became a leading competitor in Japan, the world’s second-largest life insurance market, and moved into a top 5 market position in many high growth emerging markets in Central and Eastern Europe, such as Romania, the Middle East and Latin America.[131] The deal added 20 million customers to MetLife’s 70 million and according to Barron's more than doubled the percentage of operating profits that MetLife gets abroad to 40%.[15]
In India MetLife has an affiliate company India Insurance Company Limited (MetLife) which has operated in India since 2001. This company has its headquarters in Bangalore and Gurgaon and was jointly owned by MetLife and a few local Indian financial companies. In 2012 an agreement was made with local Indian bank, the Punjab National Bank to establish a strategic alliance and for it to take a 30% share in MetLife India.[132] The state owned bank would in return sell MetLife insurance products in its branches
As of 2015, Julio Garcia-Villalon leads the Middle East & Africa regional business, which is headquartered in the Dubai International Financial Centre and has operated in the region since the 1950s.[133]
MetLife Foundation[edit]
MetLife Foundation is MetLife's independent charitable and grant-awarding foundation. It was founded in 1976[134] and had provided over $650 million in grants by January 2015.[134] The foundation has partnered with and donated to a variety of organizations, including Habitat for Humanity since 2010[135] and the Martin Luther King, Jr. National Memorial Project Foundation since 2008.[136][137] In 2013, the MetLife Foundation announced a new focus on financial inclusion,[138] including educational programs on basic financial planning for disadvantaged children[139][140] and financial services aimed at low-income communities.[140][141][142]
Relationship with Peanuts[edit]
MetLife's use of comic strip characters, according to chief marketing officer Esther Lee, was intended "to make our company more friendly and approachable during a time when insurance companies were seen as cold and distant."[143]
MetLife licensed Snoopy and other Peanuts characters for promotional purposes from the Iconix Brand Group, which owns the promotional rights to the works of Charles M. Schulz. In 2010, Iconix formed a joint venture with Schulz’s heirs, buying out E. W. Scripps Co. and United Features Syndicate for $175 million. MetLife is reported to pay $12 million per year to Iconix for licensing rights.[144] Prior to the Iconix deal, MetLife had licensed the characters from other rights-holders.
The Peanuts-based campaign was developed by the advertising agency Young & Rubicam. MetLife also has used Foote Cone & Belding to develop Peanuts-related promotions.[145][146]
MetLife announced the end of its 31-year relationship with Peanuts on October 20, 2016. This decision resulted from the company's sale of its life insurance business to concentrate on corporate clients.[143] MetLife's new blue and green logo was criticized for being a knock-off of comparison website Diffen.[147][148]
Blimp and sports sponsorship[edit]




The Metlife 'Snoopy Two' blimp.


The MetLife blimp program began in 1987 with the “Snoopy 1” airship and, in 1994, expanded to include the “Snoopy 2” airship.[149] The program provides aerial coverage to over 80 major sporting events every year and is currently the official aerial coverage provider of the PGA Tour.[150] “Snoopy 1” and “Snoopy 2” also provide overhead television coverage for the NFL, CBS College Football, the LPGA, the NBA Finals, Copa Chile, the Preakness Stakes, and the Kentucky Derby.[150][151][152][153] On August 23, 2011, MetLife agreed to a 25-year sponsorship deal to rename New Meadowlands Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, home of the NFL's New York Giants and New York Jets to MetLife Stadium.[154]
MetLife and the “Ideal weight”[edit]
In 1959, The Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (as it was known at the time) released tables of the best weight for each height for longevity, based on their collected insurance data. These tables showed the “desirable weights”. In 1983, they released tables showing the “ideal” weights for greatest longevity; this information was based on data collected in the Build Study of 1979 collected by the Society of Actuaries. This data followed patients for 18 years (from 1954-1972) and was collected from 25 life insurance companies in Canada and the United States, representing 4.2 million people. These “ideal” weights were higher than the prior “desirable” weights, this was attributed to an increase in muscle mass due to improved fitness levels among the population. This study is still the largest available pool of data for this purpose. It was noticed that the average weights in the population are higher than the ideal weights for survival. The ‘’’Metropolitan Tables’’’ included ‘’small’’, ‘’medium’’ and ‘’large’’ frames, based on elbow-girth measured using calipers, as the elbows do not develop adipose tissue. They presented weight ranges for height, sex and body frame (again associated with the lowest mortality) The mid-point of the ideal weight for the medium frames for each height was selected as the “ideal” weight used for calculations of “excess weight” (initial weight-ideal weight). This led to a formula to calculate the ideal weight used by bariatric surgeons, but it had lost considerable accuracy by 2007, again due to improvements in medical care and in public health.[155]

MetLife, Inc. is the holding corporation for the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (MLIC),[4] better known as MetLife, and its affiliates. MetLife is among the largest global providers of insurance, annuities, and employee benefit programs, with 90 million customers in over 60 countries.[3][5] The firm was founded on March 24, 1868.[6]
On January 6, 1915, MetLife completed the mutualization process, changing from a stock life insurance company owned by individuals to a mutual company operating without external shareholders and for the benefit of policyholders.[7] The company went public in 2000.[8] Through its subsidiaries and affiliates, MetLife holds leading market positions in the United States, Japan, Latin America, Asia’s Pacific region, Europe, and the Middle East.[9] MetLife serves 90 of the largest Fortune 500 companies.[10] The company’s principal offices are located at 200 Park Avenue, New York City in Midtown Manhattan, New York City, though it retains some executive offices and its boardroom in the MetLife Building, located at 200 Park Avenue, New York City, which it sold in 2005.[11]
In January 2016, the company announced that it would spin off U.S. Retail business, including individual life insurance and annuities for the retail market, in a separate company called Brighthouse Financial.[12] They will maintain the MetLife name on MetLife Stadium.[13] On March 6, 2017, the separated U.S. Retail business launched Brighthouse Financial – an independent company focused on life insurance and annuities.

History[edit]
Early years[edit]




Home office of the New England Mutual Life Insurance Co. one of the predecessor companies of MetLife. see [30]


The predecessor company to MetLife began in 1863 when a group of New York City businessmen raised $100,000 to found the National Union Life and Limb Insurance Company. The company insured Civil War sailors and soldiers against disabilities due to wartime wounds, accidents, and sickness. On March 24, 1868, it became known as Metropolitan Life Insurance Company and shifted its focus to the life insurance business.[31][32]




The Metropolitan Life Insurance Company tower, which previously served as company headquarters, was featured in its advertising for many years.


A severe business depression that began with the Panic of 1873 forced the company to contract, until it reached its lowest point in the late 1870s. After observing the insurance industry in Great Britain in 1879, MetLife President Joseph F. Knapp brought “industrial” or “workingmen’s” insurance programs to the United States – insurance issued in small amounts on which premiums were collected weekly or monthly at the policyholder’s home. By 1880, sales had exceeded a quarter million of such policies, resulting in nearly $1 million in revenue from premiums. In 1909, MetLife had become the nation’s largest life insurer in the United States, as measured by life insurance in force (the total value of life insurance policies issued).[31][33]
In 1907, the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company tower was commissioned to serve as MetLife’s 23rd Street headquarters in Lower Manhattan. Completed two years later, the building was the world's tallest until 1913 and remained the company's headquarters until 2005. For many years, an illustration of the building (with light emanating from the tip of its spire and the slogan, "The Light That Never Fails") featured prominently in MetLife’s advertising.[34] By 1930, MetLife insured every fifth man, woman, and child in the United States and Canada.[35] During the 1930s, it also began to diversify its portfolio by reducing the percentage of individual mortgages in favor of public utility bonds, investments in government securities, and loans for commercial real estate.[35] The company financed the construction of the Empire State Building in 1929 as well as provided capital to build Rockefeller Center in 1931. During World War II, MetLife placed more than 51 percent of its total assets in war bonds, and was the largest single private contributor to the Allied cause.[35]
Postwar[edit]

During the postwar era, the company expanded its suburban presence, decentralized operations, and refocused its career agency system to serve all market segments. It also began to market group insurance products to employers and institutions. By 1979, operations were segmented into four primary businesses: group insurance, personal insurance, pensions, and investments.[35] In 1981, MetLife purchased what became known as the MetLife building for $400 million from a group that included Pan American World Airways.[36][37]

De-mutualization and IPO[edit]
In 2000, MetLife converted from a mutual insurance company operated for the benefit of its policyholders to a for-profit public company. The de-mutualization process allowed MetLife to enter unrelated insurance businesses and increase executive compensation.
Policyholders received some stock in the new company in this process.[38] MetLife was accused of breaching federal securities laws by misrepresenting and omitting information in materials given to policyholders during this process, resulting in years of litigation ending with a $50 million settlement in 2009.[39]
Acquisitions, sales, and major deals[edit]

1992 - merged with United Mutual Life Insurance Company, the only African-American life insurer in New York, in 1992.[40]
1992 - [41] acquired Executive Life's single premium deferred annuity business, which was worth approximately $1.2 billion. MetLife also acquired the firm's life insurance business, valued at about $260 million.[42]
1995 - purchased New England Mutual Life Insurance Company.[43]
1997 - acquired Security First Group in 1997 for $377 million.[44][45]
1999 - acquired Lincoln National Corporation's individual disability income unit.[46]
1999 - bought out reinsurance provider GenAmerica Corporation for $1.2 billion, as well as its subsidiaries, Reinsurance Group of America and Conning Corporation.[47][48] That year, the company had grown to serve 7 million policyholders.[49]
2000 - de-mutualization and IPO.[50][51] The initial public offering was valued at $6.5 billion, which was the largest IPO to that date in United States financial history.[50][51] MetLife policyholders were asked to choose a cash or stock stake. This IPO made MetLife the most widely owned stock in the United States, and it raised MetLife's value to over $4 billion.[52][53] By 2000, MetLife's reported number of policyholders had risen to 11 million,[53] and that year it had become the United States' number one life insurer, surpassing Prudential, according to The New York Times.[54]
2000 - $470 million voice and data network management deal with AT&T Solutions.[55]
2001 - acquired Grand Bank of Kingston, New Jersey, which was renamed MetLife Bank.[56][57]
2001 - invested $1 billion in the United States stock market during 2001, immediately after the September 11th terrorist attacks.[58]
2005 - acquired Citigroup’s Travelers Life & Annuity and all of Citigroup’s international insurance businesses for $11.8 billion.[59][60] At the time of the deal, which was completed on July 1, 2005, the Travelers acquisition made MetLife the largest individual life insurer in North America based on sales.[61]
2006 - opened joint-venture insurance company in Shanghai, in May 2006.[62][63]
2006 - sold Peter Cooper Village, or Stuyvesant Town, the largest apartment complexes in New York City at the time, for $5.4 billion.[64][65] MetLife had developed the apartment complexes between 1945 and 1947, to house veterans returning home from serving in World War II.[66]
2010 - bought American Life Insurance Company from AIG for US$15,500,000,000.[59]
2011 - sold MetLife bank to GE Capital, exiting banking business.[67]

Current era[edit]
From 2004 to 2011, MetLife continued to hold its position as the largest life insurer in the United States.[16][68] The company had $2.5 trillion in policies written, $350 billion in assets under management, over 12 million customers in the United States, 8 million customers outside the United States, and a net income in 2003 of $2.2 billion.[68] That year, Barron's reported that 13 million American households owned at least one product from MetLife.[69]
MetLife named Robert H. Benmosche as chairman and CEO in July 1999. Benmosche occupied the position until 2006, when he was replaced by C. Robert Henrikson.[16][70][71]
The company's sales grew 11.5% between 2008 and 2009, despite the national recession.[72] In 2011, CEO Robert Henrikson was replaced by Steven A. Kandarian, who had overseen the company's "US$450,000,000,000 investment portfolio" as chief investment officer.[16] Henrikson remained the company's chairman to the end of 2011, at which point he reached the company's mandatory retirement age.[16]
In 2015, MetLife was ranked as number one on Fortune magazine's list of World's Most Admired Companies in the Insurance: Life and Health category.[73]
In the summer of 2017, MetLife plans to add a third office building of 255,000 square feet at its Cary, North Carolina Global Technology Campus, giving the company a total of 655,000 square feet at a location which has over 1,000 employees in such areas as engineering, software and technology. This plan was the result of North Carolina awarding the company $94 million in incentives in 2013 for creating over 2,600 jobs, half in Cary and half in Charlotte.[74]
"Too big to fail"[edit]
In 2012, MetLife failed the Federal Reserve’s (the Fed's) Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review stress test, intended to predict the potential failure of the company in a recession. The Fed stated that the minimum total risk-based capital ratio should be 8% and it estimated MetLife's ratio at 6%. The company had requested approval for a US$2,000,000,000 share repurchase to prop up the stock price, along with an increased dividend.[75] Because MetLife owned MetLife Bank, it was subject to stricter financial regulation. To escape that level of regulation, MetLife announced the sale of its banking unit to GE Capital.[76][77] On November 2, 2012, MetLife said it was selling its US$70,000,000,000 mortgage servicing business to JPMorgan Chase for an undisclosed amount.[78] Both sales were part of its strategy to focus on the insurance side of its business.
The attempt to escape "too big to fail" regulation was not successful. In September 2014, the United States government observed the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law by proposing the application of an official label to MetLife as "systemically important" to the American economy.[79] If implemented, MetLife would be subject to different sets of rules and regulations, with increased oversight from the Federal Reserve.[79][80] The company appealed this proposal in November 2014.[81] In December 2014, federal regulators decided that MetLife required the special regulations reserved for financial companies and organizations deemed "systemically important," or "too big to fail".[82] MetLife announced in January 2015 that it would file a lawsuit against the District of Columbia to overturn the federal regulators' decision,[79] thus becoming the first nonbank to challenge such a decision.[83] Three other nonbank companies have been designated as "systemically important": AIG, General Electric and Prudential.[82][83] MetLife continued to litigate this issue as of mid-2015, with the US Department of Justice asking that their challenge be dismissed.[83]
Fines[edit]
On August 7, 2012, it was announced that MetLife will pay $3.2 million in fines after the Federal Reserve charged it used unsafe and unsound practices in handling its mortgage servicing and foreclosure operations.[84]
In 2014, MetLife paid $23 million to settle multiple lawsuits over junk fax operations used to generate leads for life insurance sales.[85]


"MetLife Bank took advantage of the FHA insurance program by knowingly turning a blind eye to mortgage loans that did not meet basic underwriting requirements, and stuck the FHA and taxpayers with the bill when those mortgages defaulted."

U.S. Attorney John Walsh
In 2015, MetLife Home Loans LLC paid $123.5 million to the United States Department of Justice to resolve allegations it knowingly made mortgages insured by the United States government that didn’t meet federal underwriting requirements.[86]

MetLife Hall of Records, Yonkers, New York.


As of 2010[update], MetLife had a "diverse product mix" which included insurance (home, car and life), variable life annuities and structured settlements, commercial mortgages and securities backed by commercial mortgages, and sovereign debt.[15]
Life insurance[edit]
MetLife’s individual life insurance products and services comprise term life insurance and several types of permanent life insurance, including whole life, universal life, and final expense whole life insurance.[87][88] These services vary in regards to the duration and amount of coverage available and whether a medical exam is required for coverage. The company also offers group life insurance, provided through employers, which consists of term life, permanent life, and accidental death and dismemberment coverage.[89][90] MetLife is the largest life insurer in the United States, based on life insurance in-force.[10][15]
Dental[edit]
MetLife offers group dental benefit plans for individuals, employees, retirees and their families and provides dental plan administration for over 20 million people.[91][92] Plans include MetLife’s Preferred Dentist Program (PPO) and the SafeGuard DHMO (available for both individuals and employees in CA, FL, TX, NJ and NY.). As of May 2010, MetLife’s dental PPO network included over 135,000 participating dentist locations nationwide while the dental HMO network included more than 13,000 participating dentist locations in California, Florida and Texas.[93] MetLife also administers dental continuing education program for dentists and allied health care professionals, which are recognized by the American Dental Association (ADA) and the Academy of General Dentistry (AGD).[94]
Disability[edit]
MetLife provides disability products for individuals as well as employee and association groups who receive them through their employer.[14][95] For individuals, the company’s individual disability income insurance can replace a portion of lost income if an individual is unable to work due to sickness or injury.[96] MetLife offers several individual disability income policies, including MetLife Income Guard, OMNI Advantage, OMNI Essential, Business Overhead Expense, and Buy-Sell.[97] The policy options provided by the company vary in terms of eligibility and the provided coverage. For groups, MetLife offers short term disability insurance and long term disability insurance.[98] Short term disability insurance is structured to replace a portion of an individual’s income during the initial weeks of a disabling illness or accident.[99] Long term disability Insurance serves to replace a portion of an individual’s income during an extended period of a disabling illness or accident.[100][101] The company also maintains an absence management product which allows employers to track and manage both planned and unplanned employee absences. The product, which MetLife calls MetLife Total Absence Management, is structured for businesses with 1,000 or more employees.[102]
Annuities[edit]
MetLife is among the largest providers of annuities in the world, recording $22.4 billion in sales during 2009.[103] MetLife offers annuities which consist of fixed annuities, variable annuities, deferred annuities and immediate annuities.[104] In 1921, MetLife was the first company to issue a group annuity contract.[105] More recently in 2004, it was the first insurer to introduce a longevity insurance product.[106] As of December 31, 2009, MetLife globally managed group annuity assets of $60 billion with $34 billion of transferred pension liabilities and provided benefit payments to over 600,000 annuitants per month.[107]
Auto & Home[edit]
MetLife Auto & Home is the brand name for MetLife’s nine affiliate personal lines insurance companies.[108] Collectively these companies offer personal lines property and casualty insurance policies in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.[109] The flagship company in the MetLife Auto & Home group, Metropolitan Property and Casualty Insurance Company, was founded in 1972.[108] MetLife Auto & Home companies presently have over 2.7 million active policies and service 58 of the Fortune 100 companies.[110][111]
MetLife's home insurance solutions include homeowners insurance, condo insurance, renters insurance, insurance for landlords, and mobile home insurance.[112][113] The available policies for MetLife's home insurance provide coverage for possessions, property damage from natural disaster or theft, and various legal expenses incurred resulting from injuries sustained on an individual's property.[114] The companies also sell RV, ATV, boat, mobile home, collectible vehicle, and motorcycle policies[115] and offers flood insurance policies as a participant in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), which is managed by the federal government.[116][117] MetLife's various types of coverage for auto insurance include liability protection, collision and comprehensive coverage, personal injury protection, rental car coverage, and uninsured and underinsured motorists coverage.[118][119] Through an arrangement with Hyatt Legal Plans, a subsidiary of MetLife, MetLife Auto & Home underwrites group legal plans in many states.[18]
It was the first national insurer in the United States to offer identity-theft resolution services at no extra premium and as of 2012 continues to do so today in most United States states.[120][121] In 2010, MetLife Auto & Home began offering their GrandProtect plan in most states. This GrandProtect policy simplifies complex insurance needs by combining a client's home, valuable items, autos, RVs, and boats into one comprehensive policy package. The ultimate benefits to the consumer are having one bill, only one deductible, comprehensive coverage, and typically lower rates than trying to get each policy individually.[122]
Other products[edit]
MetLife’s products also include critical illness insurance.[123] Financial services include fee-based financial planning, retirement planning, wealth management, 529 Plans, banking, and commercial and residential mortgages.[124] The company also provides retirement plan and other financial services to healthcare, education, and not-for-profit organizations.[125] The MetLife Center for Special Needs Planning is a group of planners which serve families and individuals with special needs.[126] In 2014, MetLife launched MetLife Defender, a digital identity theft protection product.[127]
International presence[edit]
Outside of the United States, MetLife operates in Latin America, Europe, Asia’s Pacific region, and the Middle East, with leading market positions in Mexico, Japan, South Korea and Chile.[9]
On March 8, 2010, MetLife announced its intent to purchase the international leader life-insurance business, American Life Insurance Company (Alico), from American International Group (AIG). MetLife, which completed the deal on November 1, 2010, paid approximately $7.2 billion in cash and $9.0 billion in MetLife equity and other securities.[128][129] The securities portion of the deal consisted of 78.2 million shares of MetLife common stock, 6.9 million shares of contingent convertible preferred stock and 40 million equity units.[130] The values of the common and preferred stock were based on the closing price of MetLife’s common stock on October 29.[130] Upon completion of the purchase, MetLife became a leading competitor in Japan, the world’s second-largest life insurance market, and moved into a top 5 market position in many high growth emerging markets in Central and Eastern Europe, such as Romania, the Middle East and Latin America.[131] The deal added 20 million customers to MetLife’s 70 million and according to Barron's more than doubled the percentage of operating profits that MetLife gets abroad to 40%.[15]
In India MetLife has an affiliate company India Insurance Company Limited (MetLife) which has operated in India since 2001. This company has its headquarters in Bangalore and Gurgaon and was jointly owned by MetLife and a few local Indian financial companies. In 2012 an agreement was made with local Indian bank, the Punjab National Bank to establish a strategic alliance and for it to take a 30% share in MetLife India.[132] The state owned bank would in return sell MetLife insurance products in its branches
As of 2015, Julio Garcia-Villalon leads the Middle East & Africa regional business, which is headquartered in the Dubai International Financial Centre and has operated in the region since the 1950s.[133]
MetLife Foundation[edit]
MetLife Foundation is MetLife's independent charitable and grant-awarding foundation. It was founded in 1976[134] and had provided over $650 million in grants by January 2015.[134] The foundation has partnered with and donated to a variety of organizations, including Habitat for Humanity since 2010[135] and the Martin Luther King, Jr. National Memorial Project Foundation since 2008.[136][137] In 2013, the MetLife Foundation announced a new focus on financial inclusion,[138] including educational programs on basic financial planning for disadvantaged children[139][140] and financial services aimed at low-income communities.[140][141][142]
Relationship with Peanuts[edit]
MetLife's use of comic strip characters, according to chief marketing officer Esther Lee, was intended "to make our company more friendly and approachable during a time when insurance companies were seen as cold and distant."[143]
MetLife licensed Snoopy and other Peanuts characters for promotional purposes from the Iconix Brand Group, which owns the promotional rights to the works of Charles M. Schulz. In 2010, Iconix formed a joint venture with Schulz’s heirs, buying out E. W. Scripps Co. and United Features Syndicate for $175 million. MetLife is reported to pay $12 million per year to Iconix for licensing rights.[144] Prior to the Iconix deal, MetLife had licensed the characters from other rights-holders.
The Peanuts-based campaign was developed by the advertising agency Young & Rubicam. MetLife also has used Foote Cone & Belding to develop Peanuts-related promotions.[145][146]
MetLife announced the end of its 31-year relationship with Peanuts on October 20, 2016. This decision resulted from the company's sale of its life insurance business to concentrate on corporate clients.[143] MetLife's new blue and green logo was criticized for being a knock-off of comparison website Diffen.[147][148]
Blimp and sports sponsorship[edit]




The Metlife 'Snoopy Two' blimp.


The MetLife blimp program began in 1987 with the “Snoopy 1” airship and, in 1994, expanded to include the “Snoopy 2” airship.[149] The program provides aerial coverage to over 80 major sporting events every year and is currently the official aerial coverage provider of the PGA Tour.[150] “Snoopy 1” and “Snoopy 2” also provide overhead television coverage for the NFL, CBS College Football, the LPGA, the NBA Finals, Copa Chile, the Preakness Stakes, and the Kentucky Derby.[150][151][152][153] On August 23, 2011, MetLife agreed to a 25-year sponsorship deal to rename New Meadowlands Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, home of the NFL's New York Giants and New York Jets to MetLife Stadium.[154]
MetLife and the “Ideal weight”[edit]
In 1959, The Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (as it was known at the time) released tables of the best weight for each height for longevity, based on their collected insurance data. These tables showed the “desirable weights”. In 1983, they released tables showing the “ideal” weights for greatest longevity; this information was based on data collected in the Build Study of 1979 collected by the Society of Actuaries. This data followed patients for 18 years (from 1954-1972) and was collected from 25 life insurance companies in Canada and the United States, representing 4.2 million people. These “ideal” weights were higher than the prior “desirable” weights, this was attributed to an increase in muscle mass due to improved fitness levels among the population. This study is still the largest available pool of data for this purpose. It was noticed that the average weights in the population are higher than the ideal weights for survival. The ‘’’Metropolitan Tables’’’ included ‘’small’’, ‘’medium’’ and ‘’large’’ frames, based on elbow-girth measured using calipers, as the elbows do not develop adipose tissue. They presented weight ranges for height, sex and body frame (again associated with the lowest mortality) The mid-point of the ideal weight for the medium frames for each height was selected as the “ideal” weight used for calculations of “excess weight” (initial weight-ideal weight). This led to a formula to calculate the ideal weight used by bariatric surgeons, but it had lost considerable accuracy by 2007, again due to improvements in medical care and in public health.[155]

History[edit]
Early years[edit]




Home office of the New England Mutual Life Insurance Co. one of the predecessor companies of MetLife. see [30]


The predecessor company to MetLife began in 1863 when a group of New York City businessmen raised $100,000 to found the National Union Life and Limb Insurance Company. The company insured Civil War sailors and soldiers against disabilities due to wartime wounds, accidents, and sickness. On March 24, 1868, it became known as Metropolitan Life Insurance Company and shifted its focus to the life insurance business.[31][32]




The Metropolitan Life Insurance Company tower, which previously served as company headquarters, was featured in its advertising for many years.


A severe business depression that began with the Panic of 1873 forced the company to contract, until it reached its lowest point in the late 1870s. After observing the insurance industry in Great Britain in 1879, MetLife President Joseph F. Knapp brought “industrial” or “workingmen’s” insurance programs to the United States – insurance issued in small amounts on which premiums were collected weekly or monthly at the policyholder’s home. By 1880, sales had exceeded a quarter million of such policies, resulting in nearly $1 million in revenue from premiums. In 1909, MetLife had become the nation’s largest life insurer in the United States, as measured by life insurance in force (the total value of life insurance policies issued).[31][33]
In 1907, the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company tower was commissioned to serve as MetLife’s 23rd Street headquarters in Lower Manhattan. Completed two years later, the building was the world's tallest until 1913 and remained the company's headquarters until 2005. For many years, an illustration of the building (with light emanating from the tip of its spire and the slogan, "The Light That Never Fails") featured prominently in MetLife’s advertising.[34] By 1930, MetLife insured every fifth man, woman, and child in the United States and Canada.[35] During the 1930s, it also began to diversify its portfolio by reducing the percentage of individual mortgages in favor of public utility bonds, investments in government securities, and loans for commercial real estate.[35] The company financed the construction of the Empire State Building in 1929 as well as provided capital to build Rockefeller Center in 1931. During World War II, MetLife placed more than 51 percent of its total assets in war bonds, and was the largest single private contributor to the Allied cause.[35]
Postwar[edit]

During the postwar era, the company expanded its suburban presence, decentralized operations, and refocused its career agency system to serve all market segments. It also began to market group insurance products to employers and institutions. By 1979, operations were segmented into four primary businesses: group insurance, personal insurance, pensions, and investments.[35] In 1981, MetLife purchased what became known as the MetLife building for $400 million from a group that included Pan American World Airways.[36][37]

De-mutualization and IPO[edit]
In 2000, MetLife converted from a mutual insurance company operated for the benefit of its policyholders to a for-profit public company. The de-mutualization process allowed MetLife to enter unrelated insurance businesses and increase executive compensation.
Policyholders received some stock in the new company in this process.[38] MetLife was accused of breaching federal securities laws by misrepresenting and omitting information in materials given to policyholders during this process, resulting in years of litigation ending with a $50 million settlement in 2009.[39]
Acquisitions, sales, and major deals[edit]

1992 - merged with United Mutual Life Insurance Company, the only African-American life insurer in New York, in 1992.[40]
1992 - [41] acquired Executive Life's single premium deferred annuity business, which was worth approximately $1.2 billion. MetLife also acquired the firm's life insurance business, valued at about $260 million.[42]
1995 - purchased New England Mutual Life Insurance Company.[43]
1997 - acquired Security First Group in 1997 for $377 million.[44][45]
1999 - acquired Lincoln National Corporation's individual disability income unit.[46]
1999 - bought out reinsurance provider GenAmerica Corporation for $1.2 billion, as well as its subsidiaries, Reinsurance Group of America and Conning Corporation.[47][48] That year, the company had grown to serve 7 million policyholders.[49]
2000 - de-mutualization and IPO.[50][51] The initial public offering was valued at $6.5 billion, which was the largest IPO to that date in United States financial history.[50][51] MetLife policyholders were asked to choose a cash or stock stake. This IPO made MetLife the most widely owned stock in the United States, and it raised MetLife's value to over $4 billion.[52][53] By 2000, MetLife's reported number of policyholders had risen to 11 million,[53] and that year it had become the United States' number one life insurer, surpassing Prudential, according to The New York Times.[54]
2000 - $470 million voice and data network management deal with AT&T Solutions.[55]
2001 - acquired Grand Bank of Kingston, New Jersey, which was renamed MetLife Bank.[56][57]
2001 - invested $1 billion in the United States stock market during 2001, immediately after the September 11th terrorist attacks.[58]
2005 - acquired Citigroup’s Travelers Life & Annuity and all of Citigroup’s international insurance businesses for $11.8 billion.[59][60] At the time of the deal, which was completed on July 1, 2005, the Travelers acquisition made MetLife the largest individual life insurer in North America based on sales.[61]
2006 - opened joint-venture insurance company in Shanghai, in May 2006.[62][63]
2006 - sold Peter Cooper Village, or Stuyvesant Town, the largest apartment complexes in New York City at the time, for $5.4 billion.[64][65] MetLife had developed the apartment complexes between 1945 and 1947, to house veterans returning home from serving in World War II.[66]
2010 - bought American Life Insurance Company from AIG for US$15,500,000,000.[59]
2011 - sold MetLife bank to GE Capital, exiting banking business.[67]

Current era[edit]
From 2004 to 2011, MetLife continued to hold its position as the largest life insurer in the United States.[16][68] The company had $2.5 trillion in policies written, $350 billion in assets under management, over 12 million customers in the United States, 8 million customers outside the United States, and a net income in 2003 of $2.2 billion.[68] That year, Barron's reported that 13 million American households owned at least one product from MetLife.[69]
MetLife named Robert H. Benmosche as chairman and CEO in July 1999. Benmosche occupied the position until 2006, when he was replaced by C. Robert Henrikson.[16][70][71]
The company's sales grew 11.5% between 2008 and 2009, despite the national recession.[72] In 2011, CEO Robert Henrikson was replaced by Steven A. Kandarian, who had overseen the company's "US$450,000,000,000 investment portfolio" as chief investment officer.[16] Henrikson remained the company's chairman to the end of 2011, at which point he reached the company's mandatory retirement age.[16]
In 2015, MetLife was ranked as number one on Fortune magazine's list of World's Most Admired Companies in the Insurance: Life and Health category.[73]
In the summer of 2017, MetLife plans to add a third office building of 255,000 square feet at its Cary, North Carolina Global Technology Campus, giving the company a total of 655,000 square feet at a location which has over 1,000 employees in such areas as engineering, software and technology. This plan was the result of North Carolina awarding the company $94 million in incentives in 2013 for creating over 2,600 jobs, half in Cary and half in Charlotte.[74]
"Too big to fail"[edit]
In 2012, MetLife failed the Federal Reserve’s (the Fed's) Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review stress test, intended to predict the potential failure of the company in a recession. The Fed stated that the minimum total risk-based capital ratio should be 8% and it estimated MetLife's ratio at 6%. The company had requested approval for a US$2,000,000,000 share repurchase to prop up the stock price, along with an increased dividend.[75] Because MetLife owned MetLife Bank, it was subject to stricter financial regulation. To escape that level of regulation, MetLife announced the sale of its banking unit to GE Capital.[76][77] On November 2, 2012, MetLife said it was selling its US$70,000,000,000 mortgage servicing business to JPMorgan Chase for an undisclosed amount.[78] Both sales were part of its strategy to focus on the insurance side of its business.
The attempt to escape "too big to fail" regulation was not successful. In September 2014, the United States government observed the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law by proposing the application of an official label to MetLife as "systemically important" to the American economy.[79] If implemented, MetLife would be subject to different sets of rules and regulations, with increased oversight from the Federal Reserve.[79][80] The company appealed this proposal in November 2014.[81] In December 2014, federal regulators decided that MetLife required the special regulations reserved for financial companies and organizations deemed "systemically important," or "too big to fail".[82] MetLife announced in January 2015 that it would file a lawsuit against the District of Columbia to overturn the federal regulators' decision,[79] thus becoming the first nonbank to challenge such a decision.[83] Three other nonbank companies have been designated as "systemically important": AIG, General Electric and Prudential.[82][83] MetLife continued to litigate this issue as of mid-2015, with the US Department of Justice asking that their challenge be dismissed.[83]
Fines[edit]
On August 7, 2012, it was announced that MetLife will pay $3.2 million in fines after the Federal Reserve charged it used unsafe and unsound practices in handling its mortgage servicing and foreclosure operations.[84]
In 2014, MetLife paid $23 million to settle multiple lawsuits over junk fax operations used to generate leads for life insurance sales.[85]


"MetLife Bank took advantage of the FHA insurance program by knowingly turning a blind eye to mortgage loans that did not meet basic underwriting requirements, and stuck the FHA and taxpayers with the bill when those mortgages defaulted."

U.S. Attorney John Walsh
In 2015, MetLife Home Loans LLC paid $123.5 million to the United States Department of Justice to resolve allegations it knowingly made mortgages insured by the United States government that didn’t meet federal underwriting requirements.[86]

MetLife Hall of Records, Yonkers, New York.


As of 2010[update], MetLife had a "diverse product mix" which included insurance (home, car and life), variable life annuities and structured settlements, commercial mortgages and securities backed by commercial mortgages, and sovereign debt.[15]
Life insurance[edit]
MetLife’s individual life insurance products and services comprise term life insurance and several types of permanent life insurance, including whole life, universal life, and final expense whole life insurance.[87][88] These services vary in regards to the duration and amount of coverage available and whether a medical exam is required for coverage. The company also offers group life insurance, provided through employers, which consists of term life, permanent life, and accidental death and dismemberment coverage.[89][90] MetLife is the largest life insurer in the United States, based on life insurance in-force.[10][15]
Dental[edit]
MetLife offers group dental benefit plans for individuals, employees, retirees and their families and provides dental plan administration for over 20 million people.[91][92] Plans include MetLife’s Preferred Dentist Program (PPO) and the SafeGuard DHMO (available for both individuals and employees in CA, FL, TX, NJ and NY.). As of May 2010, MetLife’s dental PPO network included over 135,000 participating dentist locations nationwide while the dental HMO network included more than 13,000 participating dentist locations in California, Florida and Texas.[93] MetLife also administers dental continuing education program for dentists and allied health care professionals, which are recognized by the American Dental Association (ADA) and the Academy of General Dentistry (AGD).[94]
Disability[edit]
MetLife provides disability products for individuals as well as employee and association groups who receive them through their employer.[14][95] For individuals, the company’s individual disability income insurance can replace a portion of lost income if an individual is unable to work due to sickness or injury.[96] MetLife offers several individual disability income policies, including MetLife Income Guard, OMNI Advantage, OMNI Essential, Business Overhead Expense, and Buy-Sell.[97] The policy options provided by the company vary in terms of eligibility and the provided coverage. For groups, MetLife offers short term disability insurance and long term disability insurance.[98] Short term disability insurance is structured to replace a portion of an individual’s income during the initial weeks of a disabling illness or accident.[99] Long term disability Insurance serves to replace a portion of an individual’s income during an extended period of a disabling illness or accident.[100][101] The company also maintains an absence management product which allows employers to track and manage both planned and unplanned employee absences. The product, which MetLife calls MetLife Total Absence Management, is structured for businesses with 1,000 or more employees.[102]
Annuities[edit]
MetLife is among the largest providers of annuities in the world, recording $22.4 billion in sales during 2009.[103] MetLife offers annuities which consist of fixed annuities, variable annuities, deferred annuities and immediate annuities.[104] In 1921, MetLife was the first company to issue a group annuity contract.[105] More recently in 2004, it was the first insurer to introduce a longevity insurance product.[106] As of December 31, 2009, MetLife globally managed group annuity assets of $60 billion with $34 billion of transferred pension liabilities and provided benefit payments to over 600,000 annuitants per month.[107]
Auto & Home[edit]
MetLife Auto & Home is the brand name for MetLife’s nine affiliate personal lines insurance companies.[108] Collectively these companies offer personal lines property and casualty insurance policies in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.[109] The flagship company in the MetLife Auto & Home group, Metropolitan Property and Casualty Insurance Company, was founded in 1972.[108] MetLife Auto & Home companies presently have over 2.7 million active policies and service 58 of the Fortune 100 companies.[110][111]
MetLife's home insurance solutions include homeowners insurance, condo insurance, renters insurance, insurance for landlords, and mobile home insurance.[112][113] The available policies for MetLife's home insurance provide coverage for possessions, property damage from natural disaster or theft, and various legal expenses incurred resulting from injuries sustained on an individual's property.[114] The companies also sell RV, ATV, boat, mobile home, collectible vehicle, and motorcycle policies[115] and offers flood insurance policies as a participant in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), which is managed by the federal government.[116][117] MetLife's various types of coverage for auto insurance include liability protection, collision and comprehensive coverage, personal injury protection, rental car coverage, and uninsured and underinsured motorists coverage.[118][119] Through an arrangement with Hyatt Legal Plans, a subsidiary of MetLife, MetLife Auto & Home underwrites group legal plans in many states.[18]
It was the first national insurer in the United States to offer identity-theft resolution services at no extra premium and as of 2012 continues to do so today in most United States states.[120][121] In 2010, MetLife Auto & Home began offering their GrandProtect plan in most states. This GrandProtect policy simplifies complex insurance needs by combining a client's home, valuable items, autos, RVs, and boats into one comprehensive policy package. The ultimate benefits to the consumer are having one bill, only one deductible, comprehensive coverage, and typically lower rates than trying to get each policy individually.[122]
Other products[edit]
MetLife’s products also include critical illness insurance.[123] Financial services include fee-based financial planning, retirement planning, wealth management, 529 Plans, banking, and commercial and residential mortgages.[124] The company also provides retirement plan and other financial services to healthcare, education, and not-for-profit organizations.[125] The MetLife Center for Special Needs Planning is a group of planners which serve families and individuals with special needs.[126] In 2014, MetLife launched MetLife Defender, a digital identity theft protection product.[127]
International presence[edit]
Outside of the United States, MetLife operates in Latin America, Europe, Asia’s Pacific region, and the Middle East, with leading market positions in Mexico, Japan, South Korea and Chile.[9]
On March 8, 2010, MetLife announced its intent to purchase the international leader life-insurance business, American Life Insurance Company (Alico), from American International Group (AIG). MetLife, which completed the deal on November 1, 2010, paid approximately $7.2 billion in cash and $9.0 billion in MetLife equity and other securities.[128][129] The securities portion of the deal consisted of 78.2 million shares of MetLife common stock, 6.9 million shares of contingent convertible preferred stock and 40 million equity units.[130] The values of the common and preferred stock were based on the closing price of MetLife’s common stock on October 29.[130] Upon completion of the purchase, MetLife became a leading competitor in Japan, the world’s second-largest life insurance market, and moved into a top 5 market position in many high growth emerging markets in Central and Eastern Europe, such as Romania, the Middle East and Latin America.[131] The deal added 20 million customers to MetLife’s 70 million and according to Barron's more than doubled the percentage of operating profits that MetLife gets abroad to 40%.[15]
In India MetLife has an affiliate company India Insurance Company Limited (MetLife) which has operated in India since 2001. This company has its headquarters in Bangalore and Gurgaon and was jointly owned by MetLife and a few local Indian financial companies. In 2012 an agreement was made with local Indian bank, the Punjab National Bank to establish a strategic alliance and for it to take a 30% share in MetLife India.[132] The state owned bank would in return sell MetLife insurance products in its branches
As of 2015, Julio Garcia-Villalon leads the Middle East & Africa regional business, which is headquartered in the Dubai International Financial Centre and has operated in the region since the 1950s.[133]
MetLife Foundation[edit]
MetLife Foundation is MetLife's independent charitable and grant-awarding foundation. It was founded in 1976[134] and had provided over $650 million in grants by January 2015.[134] The foundation has partnered with and donated to a variety of organizations, including Habitat for Humanity since 2010[135] and the Martin Luther King, Jr. National Memorial Project Foundation since 2008.[136][137] In 2013, the MetLife Foundation announced a new focus on financial inclusion,[138] including educational programs on basic financial planning for disadvantaged children[139][140] and financial services aimed at low-income communities.[140][141][142]
Relationship with Peanuts[edit]
MetLife's use of comic strip characters, according to chief marketing officer Esther Lee, was intended "to make our company more friendly and approachable during a time when insurance companies were seen as cold and distant."[143]
MetLife licensed Snoopy and other Peanuts characters for promotional purposes from the Iconix Brand Group, which owns the promotional rights to the works of Charles M. Schulz. In 2010, Iconix formed a joint venture with Schulz’s heirs, buying out E. W. Scripps Co. and United Features Syndicate for $175 million. MetLife is reported to pay $12 million per year to Iconix for licensing rights.[144] Prior to the Iconix deal, MetLife had licensed the characters from other rights-holders.
The Peanuts-based campaign was developed by the advertising agency Young & Rubicam. MetLife also has used Foote Cone & Belding to develop Peanuts-related promotions.[145][146]
MetLife announced the end of its 31-year relationship with Peanuts on October 20, 2016. This decision resulted from the company's sale of its life insurance business to concentrate on corporate clients.[143] MetLife's new blue and green logo was criticized for being a knock-off of comparison website Diffen.[147][148]
Blimp and sports sponsorship[edit]




The Metlife 'Snoopy Two' blimp.


The MetLife blimp program began in 1987 with the “Snoopy 1” airship and, in 1994, expanded to include the “Snoopy 2” airship.[149] The program provides aerial coverage to over 80 major sporting events every year and is currently the official aerial coverage provider of the PGA Tour.[150] “Snoopy 1” and “Snoopy 2” also provide overhead television coverage for the NFL, CBS College Football, the LPGA, the NBA Finals, Copa Chile, the Preakness Stakes, and the Kentucky Derby.[150][151][152][153] On August 23, 2011, MetLife agreed to a 25-year sponsorship deal to rename New Meadowlands Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, home of the NFL's New York Giants and New York Jets to MetLife Stadium.[154]
MetLife and the “Ideal weight”[edit]
In 1959, The Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (as it was known at the time) released tables of the best weight for each height for longevity, based on their collected insurance data. These tables showed the “desirable weights”. In 1983, they released tables showing the “ideal” weights for greatest longevity; this information was based on data collected in the Build Study of 1979 collected by the Society of Actuaries. This data followed patients for 18 years (from 1954-1972) and was collected from 25 life insurance companies in Canada and the United States, representing 4.2 million people. These “ideal” weights were higher than the prior “desirable” weights, this was attributed to an increase in muscle mass due to improved fitness levels among the population. This study is still the largest available pool of data for this purpose. It was noticed that the average weights in the population are higher than the ideal weights for survival. The ‘’’Metropolitan Tables’’’ included ‘’small’’, ‘’medium’’ and ‘’large’’ frames, based on elbow-girth measured using calipers, as the elbows do not develop adipose tissue. They presented weight ranges for height, sex and body frame (again associated with the lowest mortality) The mid-point of the ideal weight for the medium frames for each height was selected as the “ideal” weight used for calculations of “excess weight” (initial weight-ideal weight). This led to a formula to calculate the ideal weight used by bariatric surgeons, but it had lost considerable accuracy by 2007, again due to improvements in medical care and in public health.[155]

MetLife, Inc. is the holding corporation for the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (MLIC),[4] better known as MetLife, and its affiliates. MetLife is among the largest global providers of insurance, annuities, and employee benefit programs, with 90 million customers in over 60 countries.[3][5] The firm was founded on March 24, 1868.[6]
On January 6, 1915, MetLife completed the mutualization process, changing from a stock life insurance company owned by individuals to a mutual company operating without external shareholders and for the benefit of policyholders.[7] The company went public in 2000.[8] Through its subsidiaries and affiliates, MetLife holds leading market positions in the United States, Japan, Latin America, Asia’s Pacific region, Europe, and the Middle East.[9] MetLife serves 90 of the largest Fortune 500 companies.[10] The company’s principal offices are located at 200 Park Avenue, New York City in Midtown Manhattan, New York City, though it retains some executive offices and its boardroom in the MetLife Building, located at 200 Park Avenue, New York City, which it sold in 2005.[11]
In January 2016, the company announced that it would spin off U.S. Retail business, including individual life insurance and annuities for the retail market, in a separate company called Brighthouse Financial.[12] They will maintain the MetLife name on MetLife Stadium.[13] On March 6, 2017, the separated U.S. Retail business launched Brighthouse Financial – an independent company focused on life insurance and annuities.

History[edit]
Early years[edit]




Home office of the New England Mutual Life Insurance Co. one of the predecessor companies of MetLife. see [30]


The predecessor company to MetLife began in 1863 when a group of New York City businessmen raised $100,000 to found the National Union Life and Limb Insurance Company. The company insured Civil War sailors and soldiers against disabilities due to wartime wounds, accidents, and sickness. On March 24, 1868, it became known as Metropolitan Life Insurance Company and shifted its focus to the life insurance business.[31][32]




The Metropolitan Life Insurance Company tower, which previously served as company headquarters, was featured in its advertising for many years.


A severe business depression that began with the Panic of 1873 forced the company to contract, until it reached its lowest point in the late 1870s. After observing the insurance industry in Great Britain in 1879, MetLife President Joseph F. Knapp brought “industrial” or “workingmen’s” insurance programs to the United States – insurance issued in small amounts on which premiums were collected weekly or monthly at the policyholder’s home. By 1880, sales had exceeded a quarter million of such policies, resulting in nearly $1 million in revenue from premiums. In 1909, MetLife had become the nation’s largest life insurer in the United States, as measured by life insurance in force (the total value of life insurance policies issued).[31][33]
In 1907, the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company tower was commissioned to serve as MetLife’s 23rd Street headquarters in Lower Manhattan. Completed two years later, the building was the world's tallest until 1913 and remained the company's headquarters until 2005. For many years, an illustration of the building (with light emanating from the tip of its spire and the slogan, "The Light That Never Fails") featured prominently in MetLife’s advertising.[34] By 1930, MetLife insured every fifth man, woman, and child in the United States and Canada.[35] During the 1930s, it also began to diversify its portfolio by reducing the percentage of individual mortgages in favor of public utility bonds, investments in government securities, and loans for commercial real estate.[35] The company financed the construction of the Empire State Building in 1929 as well as provided capital to build Rockefeller Center in 1931. During World War II, MetLife placed more than 51 percent of its total assets in war bonds, and was the largest single private contributor to the Allied cause.[35]
Postwar[edit]

During the postwar era, the company expanded its suburban presence, decentralized operations, and refocused its career agency system to serve all market segments. It also began to market group insurance products to employers and institutions. By 1979, operations were segmented into four primary businesses: group insurance, personal insurance, pensions, and investments.[35] In 1981, MetLife purchased what became known as the MetLife building for $400 million from a group that included Pan American World Airways.[36][37]

De-mutualization and IPO[edit]
In 2000, MetLife converted from a mutual insurance company operated for the benefit of its policyholders to a for-profit public company. The de-mutualization process allowed MetLife to enter unrelated insurance businesses and increase executive compensation.
Policyholders received some stock in the new company in this process.[38] MetLife was accused of breaching federal securities laws by misrepresenting and omitting information in materials given to policyholders during this process, resulting in years of litigation ending with a $50 million settlement in 2009.[39]
Acquisitions, sales, and major deals[edit]

1992 - merged with United Mutual Life Insurance Company, the only African-American life insurer in New York, in 1992.[40]
1992 - [41] acquired Executive Life's single premium deferred annuity business, which was worth approximately $1.2 billion. MetLife also acquired the firm's life insurance business, valued at about $260 million.[42]
1995 - purchased New England Mutual Life Insurance Company.[43]
1997 - acquired Security First Group in 1997 for $377 million.[44][45]
1999 - acquired Lincoln National Corporation's individual disability income unit.[46]
1999 - bought out reinsurance provider GenAmerica Corporation for $1.2 billion, as well as its subsidiaries, Reinsurance Group of America and Conning Corporation.[47][48] That year, the company had grown to serve 7 million policyholders.[49]
2000 - de-mutualization and IPO.[50][51] The initial public offering was valued at $6.5 billion, which was the largest IPO to that date in United States financial history.[50][51] MetLife policyholders were asked to choose a cash or stock stake. This IPO made MetLife the most widely owned stock in the United States, and it raised MetLife's value to over $4 billion.[52][53] By 2000, MetLife's reported number of policyholders had risen to 11 million,[53] and that year it had become the United States' number one life insurer, surpassing Prudential, according to The New York Times.[54]
2000 - $470 million voice and data network management deal with AT&T Solutions.[55]
2001 - acquired Grand Bank of Kingston, New Jersey, which was renamed MetLife Bank.[56][57]
2001 - invested $1 billion in the United States stock market during 2001, immediately after the September 11th terrorist attacks.[58]
2005 - acquired Citigroup’s Travelers Life & Annuity and all of Citigroup’s international insurance businesses for $11.8 billion.[59][60] At the time of the deal, which was completed on July 1, 2005, the Travelers acquisition made MetLife the largest individual life insurer in North America based on sales.[61]
2006 - opened joint-venture insurance company in Shanghai, in May 2006.[62][63]
2006 - sold Peter Cooper Village, or Stuyvesant Town, the largest apartment complexes in New York City at the time, for $5.4 billion.[64][65] MetLife had developed the apartment complexes between 1945 and 1947, to house veterans returning home from serving in World War II.[66]
2010 - bought American Life Insurance Company from AIG for US$15,500,000,000.[59]
2011 - sold MetLife bank to GE Capital, exiting banking business.[67]

Current era[edit]
From 2004 to 2011, MetLife continued to hold its position as the largest life insurer in the United States.[16][68] The company had $2.5 trillion in policies written, $350 billion in assets under management, over 12 million customers in the United States, 8 million customers outside the United States, and a net income in 2003 of $2.2 billion.[68] That year, Barron's reported that 13 million American households owned at least one product from MetLife.[69]
MetLife named Robert H. Benmosche as chairman and CEO in July 1999. Benmosche occupied the position until 2006, when he was replaced by C. Robert Henrikson.[16][70][71]
The company's sales grew 11.5% between 2008 and 2009, despite the national recession.[72] In 2011, CEO Robert Henrikson was replaced by Steven A. Kandarian, who had overseen the company's "US$450,000,000,000 investment portfolio" as chief investment officer.[16] Henrikson remained the company's chairman to the end of 2011, at which point he reached the company's mandatory retirement age.[16]
In 2015, MetLife was ranked as number one on Fortune magazine's list of World's Most Admired Companies in the Insurance: Life and Health category.[73]
In the summer of 2017, MetLife plans to add a third office building of 255,000 square feet at its Cary, North Carolina Global Technology Campus, giving the company a total of 655,000 square feet at a location which has over 1,000 employees in such areas as engineering, software and technology. This plan was the result of North Carolina awarding the company $94 million in incentives in 2013 for creating over 2,600 jobs, half in Cary and half in Charlotte.[74]
"Too big to fail"[edit]
In 2012, MetLife failed the Federal Reserve’s (the Fed's) Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review stress test, intended to predict the potential failure of the company in a recession. The Fed stated that the minimum total risk-based capital ratio should be 8% and it estimated MetLife's ratio at 6%. The company had requested approval for a US$2,000,000,000 share repurchase to prop up the stock price, along with an increased dividend.[75] Because MetLife owned MetLife Bank, it was subject to stricter financial regulation. To escape that level of regulation, MetLife announced the sale of its banking unit to GE Capital.[76][77] On November 2, 2012, MetLife said it was selling its US$70,000,000,000 mortgage servicing business to JPMorgan Chase for an undisclosed amount.[78] Both sales were part of its strategy to focus on the insurance side of its business.
The attempt to escape "too big to fail" regulation was not successful. In September 2014, the United States government observed the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law by proposing the application of an official label to MetLife as "systemically important" to the American economy.[79] If implemented, MetLife would be subject to different sets of rules and regulations, with increased oversight from the Federal Reserve.[79][80] The company appealed this proposal in November 2014.[81] In December 2014, federal regulators decided that MetLife required the special regulations reserved for financial companies and organizations deemed "systemically important," or "too big to fail".[82] MetLife announced in January 2015 that it would file a lawsuit against the District of Columbia to overturn the federal regulators' decision,[79] thus becoming the first nonbank to challenge such a decision.[83] Three other nonbank companies have been designated as "systemically important": AIG, General Electric and Prudential.[82][83] MetLife continued to litigate this issue as of mid-2015, with the US Department of Justice asking that their challenge be dismissed.[83]
Fines[edit]
On August 7, 2012, it was announced that MetLife will pay $3.2 million in fines after the Federal Reserve charged it used unsafe and unsound practices in handling its mortgage servicing and foreclosure operations.[84]
In 2014, MetLife paid $23 million to settle multiple lawsuits over junk fax operations used to generate leads for life insurance sales.[85]


"MetLife Bank took advantage of the FHA insurance program by knowingly turning a blind eye to mortgage loans that did not meet basic underwriting requirements, and stuck the FHA and taxpayers with the bill when those mortgages defaulted."

U.S. Attorney John Walsh
In 2015, MetLife Home Loans LLC paid $123.5 million to the United States Department of Justice to resolve allegations it knowingly made mortgages insured by the United States government that didn’t meet federal underwriting requirements.[86]

MetLife Hall of Records, Yonkers, New York.


As of 2010[update], MetLife had a "diverse product mix" which included insurance (home, car and life), variable life annuities and structured settlements, commercial mortgages and securities backed by commercial mortgages, and sovereign debt.[15]
Life insurance[edit]
MetLife’s individual life insurance products and services comprise term life insurance and several types of permanent life insurance, including whole life, universal life, and final expense whole life insurance.[87][88] These services vary in regards to the duration and amount of coverage available and whether a medical exam is required for coverage. The company also offers group life insurance, provided through employers, which consists of term life, permanent life, and accidental death and dismemberment coverage.[89][90] MetLife is the largest life insurer in the United States, based on life insurance in-force.[10][15]
Dental[edit]
MetLife offers group dental benefit plans for individuals, employees, retirees and their families and provides dental plan administration for over 20 million people.[91][92] Plans include MetLife’s Preferred Dentist Program (PPO) and the SafeGuard DHMO (available for both individuals and employees in CA, FL, TX, NJ and NY.). As of May 2010, MetLife’s dental PPO network included over 135,000 participating dentist locations nationwide while the dental HMO network included more than 13,000 participating dentist locations in California, Florida and Texas.[93] MetLife also administers dental continuing education program for dentists and allied health care professionals, which are recognized by the American Dental Association (ADA) and the Academy of General Dentistry (AGD).[94]
Disability[edit]
MetLife provides disability products for individuals as well as employee and association groups who receive them through their employer.[14][95] For individuals, the company’s individual disability income insurance can replace a portion of lost income if an individual is unable to work due to sickness or injury.[96] MetLife offers several individual disability income policies, including MetLife Income Guard, OMNI Advantage, OMNI Essential, Business Overhead Expense, and Buy-Sell.[97] The policy options provided by the company vary in terms of eligibility and the provided coverage. For groups, MetLife offers short term disability insurance and long term disability insurance.[98] Short term disability insurance is structured to replace a portion of an individual’s income during the initial weeks of a disabling illness or accident.[99] Long term disability Insurance serves to replace a portion of an individual’s income during an extended period of a disabling illness or accident.[100][101] The company also maintains an absence management product which allows employers to track and manage both planned and unplanned employee absences. The product, which MetLife calls MetLife Total Absence Management, is structured for businesses with 1,000 or more employees.[102]
Annuities[edit]
MetLife is among the largest providers of annuities in the world, recording $22.4 billion in sales during 2009.[103] MetLife offers annuities which consist of fixed annuities, variable annuities, deferred annuities and immediate annuities.[104] In 1921, MetLife was the first company to issue a group annuity contract.[105] More recently in 2004, it was the first insurer to introduce a longevity insurance product.[106] As of December 31, 2009, MetLife globally managed group annuity assets of $60 billion with $34 billion of transferred pension liabilities and provided benefit payments to over 600,000 annuitants per month.[107]
Auto & Home[edit]
MetLife Auto & Home is the brand name for MetLife’s nine affiliate personal lines insurance companies.[108] Collectively these companies offer personal lines property and casualty insurance policies in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.[109] The flagship company in the MetLife Auto & Home group, Metropolitan Property and Casualty Insurance Company, was founded in 1972.[108] MetLife Auto & Home companies presently have over 2.7 million active policies and service 58 of the Fortune 100 companies.[110][111]
MetLife's home insurance solutions include homeowners insurance, condo insurance, renters insurance, insurance for landlords, and mobile home insurance.[112][113] The available policies for MetLife's home insurance provide coverage for possessions, property damage from natural disaster or theft, and various legal expenses incurred resulting from injuries sustained on an individual's property.[114] The companies also sell RV, ATV, boat, mobile home, collectible vehicle, and motorcycle policies[115] and offers flood insurance policies as a participant in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), which is managed by the federal government.[116][117] MetLife's various types of coverage for auto insurance include liability protection, collision and comprehensive coverage, personal injury protection, rental car coverage, and uninsured and underinsured motorists coverage.[118][119] Through an arrangement with Hyatt Legal Plans, a subsidiary of MetLife, MetLife Auto & Home underwrites group legal plans in many states.[18]
It was the first national insurer in the United States to offer identity-theft resolution services at no extra premium and as of 2012 continues to do so today in most United States states.[120][121] In 2010, MetLife Auto & Home began offering their GrandProtect plan in most states. This GrandProtect policy simplifies complex insurance needs by combining a client's home, valuable items, autos, RVs, and boats into one comprehensive policy package. The ultimate benefits to the consumer are having one bill, only one deductible, comprehensive coverage, and typically lower rates than trying to get each policy individually.[122]
Other products[edit]
MetLife’s products also include critical illness insurance.[123] Financial services include fee-based financial planning, retirement planning, wealth management, 529 Plans, banking, and commercial and residential mortgages.[124] The company also provides retirement plan and other financial services to healthcare, education, and not-for-profit organizations.[125] The MetLife Center for Special Needs Planning is a group of planners which serve families and individuals with special needs.[126] In 2014, MetLife launched MetLife Defender, a digital identity theft protection product.[127]
International presence[edit]
Outside of the United States, MetLife operates in Latin America, Europe, Asia’s Pacific region, and the Middle East, with leading market positions in Mexico, Japan, South Korea and Chile.[9]
On March 8, 2010, MetLife announced its intent to purchase the international leader life-insurance business, American Life Insurance Company (Alico), from American International Group (AIG). MetLife, which completed the deal on November 1, 2010, paid approximately $7.2 billion in cash and $9.0 billion in MetLife equity and other securities.[128][129] The securities portion of the deal consisted of 78.2 million shares of MetLife common stock, 6.9 million shares of contingent convertible preferred stock and 40 million equity units.[130] The values of the common and preferred stock were based on the closing price of MetLife’s common stock on October 29.[130] Upon completion of the purchase, MetLife became a leading competitor in Japan, the world’s second-largest life insurance market, and moved into a top 5 market position in many high growth emerging markets in Central and Eastern Europe, such as Romania, the Middle East and Latin America.[131] The deal added 20 million customers to MetLife’s 70 million and according to Barron's more than doubled the percentage of operating profits that MetLife gets abroad to 40%.[15]
In India MetLife has an affiliate company India Insurance Company Limited (MetLife) which has operated in India since 2001. This company has its headquarters in Bangalore and Gurgaon and was jointly owned by MetLife and a few local Indian financial companies. In 2012 an agreement was made with local Indian bank, the Punjab National Bank to establish a strategic alliance and for it to take a 30% share in MetLife India.[132] The state owned bank would in return sell MetLife insurance products in its branches
As of 2015, Julio Garcia-Villalon leads the Middle East & Africa regional business, which is headquartered in the Dubai International Financial Centre and has operated in the region since the 1950s.[133]
MetLife Foundation[edit]
MetLife Foundation is MetLife's independent charitable and grant-awarding foundation. It was founded in 1976[134] and had provided over $650 million in grants by January 2015.[134] The foundation has partnered with and donated to a variety of organizations, including Habitat for Humanity since 2010[135] and the Martin Luther King, Jr. National Memorial Project Foundation since 2008.[136][137] In 2013, the MetLife Foundation announced a new focus on financial inclusion,[138] including educational programs on basic financial planning for disadvantaged children[139][140] and financial services aimed at low-income communities.[140][141][142]
Relationship with Peanuts[edit]
MetLife's use of comic strip characters, according to chief marketing officer Esther Lee, was intended "to make our company more friendly and approachable during a time when insurance companies were seen as cold and distant."[143]
MetLife licensed Snoopy and other Peanuts characters for promotional purposes from the Iconix Brand Group, which owns the promotional rights to the works of Charles M. Schulz. In 2010, Iconix formed a joint venture with Schulz’s heirs, buying out E. W. Scripps Co. and United Features Syndicate for $175 million. MetLife is reported to pay $12 million per year to Iconix for licensing rights.[144] Prior to the Iconix deal, MetLife had licensed the characters from other rights-holders.
The Peanuts-based campaign was developed by the advertising agency Young & Rubicam. MetLife also has used Foote Cone & Belding to develop Peanuts-related promotions.[145][146]
MetLife announced the end of its 31-year relationship with Peanuts on October 20, 2016. This decision resulted from the company's sale of its life insurance business to concentrate on corporate clients.[143] MetLife's new blue and green logo was criticized for being a knock-off of comparison website Diffen.[147][148]
Blimp and sports sponsorship[edit]




The Metlife 'Snoopy Two' blimp.


The MetLife blimp program began in 1987 with the “Snoopy 1” airship and, in 1994, expanded to include the “Snoopy 2” airship.[149] The program provides aerial coverage to over 80 major sporting events every year and is currently the official aerial coverage provider of the PGA Tour.[150] “Snoopy 1” and “Snoopy 2” also provide overhead television coverage for the NFL, CBS College Football, the LPGA, the NBA Finals, Copa Chile, the Preakness Stakes, and the Kentucky Derby.[150][151][152][153] On August 23, 2011, MetLife agreed to a 25-year sponsorship deal to rename New Meadowlands Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, home of the NFL's New York Giants and New York Jets to MetLife Stadium.[154]
MetLife and the “Ideal weight”[edit]
In 1959, The Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (as it was known at the time) released tables of the best weight for each height for longevity, based on their collected insurance data. These tables showed the “desirable weights”. In 1983, they released tables showing the “ideal” weights for greatest longevity; this information was based on data collected in the Build Study of 1979 collected by the Society of Actuaries. This data followed patients for 18 years (from 1954-1972) and was collected from 25 life insurance companies in Canada and the United States, representing 4.2 million people. These “ideal” weights were higher than the prior “desirable” weights, this was attributed to an increase in muscle mass due to improved fitness levels among the population. This study is still the largest available pool of data for this purpose. It was noticed that the average weights in the population are higher than the ideal weights for survival. The ‘’’Metropolitan Tables’’’ included ‘’small’’, ‘’medium’’ and ‘’large’’ frames, based on elbow-girth measured using calipers, as the elbows do not develop adipose tissue. They presented weight ranges for height, sex and body frame (again associated with the lowest mortality) The mid-point of the ideal weight for the medium frames for each height was selected as the “ideal” weight used for calculations of “excess weight” (initial weight-ideal weight). This led to a formula to calculate the ideal weight used by bariatric surgeons, but it had lost considerable accuracy by 2007, again due to improvements in medical care and in public health.[155]

MetLife, Inc. is the holding corporation for the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (MLIC),[4] better known as MetLife, and its affiliates. MetLife is among the largest global providers of insurance, annuities, and employee benefit programs, with 90 million customers in over 60 countries.[3][5] The firm was founded on March 24, 1868.[6]
On January 6, 1915, MetLife completed the mutualization process, changing from a stock life insurance company owned by individuals to a mutual company operating without external shareholders and for the benefit of policyholders.[7] The company went public in 2000.[8] Through its subsidiaries and affiliates, MetLife holds leading market positions in the United States, Japan, Latin America, Asia’s Pacific region, Europe, and the Middle East.[9] MetLife serves 90 of the largest Fortune 500 companies.[10] The company’s principal offices are located at 200 Park Avenue, New York City in Midtown Manhattan, New York City, though it retains some executive offices and its boardroom in the MetLife Building, located at 200 Park Avenue, New York City, which it sold in 2005.[11]
In January 2016, the company announced that it would spin off U.S. Retail business, including individual life insurance and annuities for the retail market, in a separate company called Brighthouse Financial.[12] They will maintain the MetLife name on MetLife Stadium.[13] On March 6, 2017, the separated U.S. Retail business launched Brighthouse Financial – an independent company focused on life insurance and annuities.

History[edit]
Early years[edit]




Home office of the New England Mutual Life Insurance Co. one of the predecessor companies of MetLife. see [30]


The predecessor company to MetLife began in 1863 when a group of New York City businessmen raised $100,000 to found the National Union Life and Limb Insurance Company. The company insured Civil War sailors and soldiers against disabilities due to wartime wounds, accidents, and sickness. On March 24, 1868, it became known as Metropolitan Life Insurance Company and shifted its focus to the life insurance business.[31][32]




The Metropolitan Life Insurance Company tower, which previously served as company headquarters, was featured in its advertising for many years.


A severe business depression that began with the Panic of 1873 forced the company to contract, until it reached its lowest point in the late 1870s. After observing the insurance industry in Great Britain in 1879, MetLife President Joseph F. Knapp brought “industrial” or “workingmen’s” insurance programs to the United States – insurance issued in small amounts on which premiums were collected weekly or monthly at the policyholder’s home. By 1880, sales had exceeded a quarter million of such policies, resulting in nearly $1 million in revenue from premiums. In 1909, MetLife had become the nation’s largest life insurer in the United States, as measured by life insurance in force (the total value of life insurance policies issued).[31][33]
In 1907, the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company tower was commissioned to serve as MetLife’s 23rd Street headquarters in Lower Manhattan. Completed two years later, the building was the world's tallest until 1913 and remained the company's headquarters until 2005. For many years, an illustration of the building (with light emanating from the tip of its spire and the slogan, "The Light That Never Fails") featured prominently in MetLife’s advertising.[34] By 1930, MetLife insured every fifth man, woman, and child in the United States and Canada.[35] During the 1930s, it also began to diversify its portfolio by reducing the percentage of individual mortgages in favor of public utility bonds, investments in government securities, and loans for commercial real estate.[35] The company financed the construction of the Empire State Building in 1929 as well as provided capital to build Rockefeller Center in 1931. During World War II, MetLife placed more than 51 percent of its total assets in war bonds, and was the largest single private contributor to the Allied cause.[35]
Postwar[edit]

During the postwar era, the company expanded its suburban presence, decentralized operations, and refocused its career agency system to serve all market segments. It also began to market group insurance products to employers and institutions. By 1979, operations were segmented into four primary businesses: group insurance, personal insurance, pensions, and investments.[35] In 1981, MetLife purchased what became known as the MetLife building for $400 million from a group that included Pan American World Airways.[36][37]

De-mutualization and IPO[edit]
In 2000, MetLife converted from a mutual insurance company operated for the benefit of its policyholders to a for-profit public company. The de-mutualization process allowed MetLife to enter unrelated insurance businesses and increase executive compensation.
Policyholders received some stock in the new company in this process.[38] MetLife was accused of breaching federal securities laws by misrepresenting and omitting information in materials given to policyholders during this process, resulting in years of litigation ending with a $50 million settlement in 2009.[39]
Acquisitions, sales, and major deals[edit]

1992 - merged with United Mutual Life Insurance Company, the only African-American life insurer in New York, in 1992.[40]
1992 - [41] acquired Executive Life's single premium deferred annuity business, which was worth approximately $1.2 billion. MetLife also acquired the firm's life insurance business, valued at about $260 million.[42]
1995 - purchased New England Mutual Life Insurance Company.[43]
1997 - acquired Security First Group in 1997 for $377 million.[44][45]
1999 - acquired Lincoln National Corporation's individual disability income unit.[46]
1999 - bought out reinsurance provider GenAmerica Corporation for $1.2 billion, as well as its subsidiaries, Reinsurance Group of America and Conning Corporation.[47][48] That year, the company had grown to serve 7 million policyholders.[49]
2000 - de-mutualization and IPO.[50][51] The initial public offering was valued at $6.5 billion, which was the largest IPO to that date in United States financial history.[50][51] MetLife policyholders were asked to choose a cash or stock stake. This IPO made MetLife the most widely owned stock in the United States, and it raised MetLife's value to over $4 billion.[52][53] By 2000, MetLife's reported number of policyholders had risen to 11 million,[53] and that year it had become the United States' number one life insurer, surpassing Prudential, according to The New York Times.[54]
2000 - $470 million voice and data network management deal with AT&T Solutions.[55]
2001 - acquired Grand Bank of Kingston, New Jersey, which was renamed MetLife Bank.[56][57]
2001 - invested $1 billion in the United States stock market during 2001, immediately after the September 11th terrorist attacks.[58]
2005 - acquired Citigroup’s Travelers Life & Annuity and all of Citigroup’s international insurance businesses for $11.8 billion.[59][60] At the time of the deal, which was completed on July 1, 2005, the Travelers acquisition made MetLife the largest individual life insurer in North America based on sales.[61]
2006 - opened joint-venture insurance company in Shanghai, in May 2006.[62][63]
2006 - sold Peter Cooper Village, or Stuyvesant Town, the largest apartment complexes in New York City at the time, for $5.4 billion.[64][65] MetLife had developed the apartment complexes between 1945 and 1947, to house veterans returning home from serving in World War II.[66]
2010 - bought American Life Insurance Company from AIG for US$15,500,000,000.[59]
2011 - sold MetLife bank to GE Capital, exiting banking business.[67]

Current era[edit]
From 2004 to 2011, MetLife continued to hold its position as the largest life insurer in the United States.[16][68] The company had $2.5 trillion in policies written, $350 billion in assets under management, over 12 million customers in the United States, 8 million customers outside the United States, and a net income in 2003 of $2.2 billion.[68] That year, Barron's reported that 13 million American households owned at least one product from MetLife.[69]
MetLife named Robert H. Benmosche as chairman and CEO in July 1999. Benmosche occupied the position until 2006, when he was replaced by C. Robert Henrikson.[16][70][71]
The company's sales grew 11.5% between 2008 and 2009, despite the national recession.[72] In 2011, CEO Robert Henrikson was replaced by Steven A. Kandarian, who had overseen the company's "US$450,000,000,000 investment portfolio" as chief investment officer.[16] Henrikson remained the company's chairman to the end of 2011, at which point he reached the company's mandatory retirement age.[16]
In 2015, MetLife was ranked as number one on Fortune magazine's list of World's Most Admired Companies in the Insurance: Life and Health category.[73]
In the summer of 2017, MetLife plans to add a third office building of 255,000 square feet at its Cary, North Carolina Global Technology Campus, giving the company a total of 655,000 square feet at a location which has over 1,000 employees in such areas as engineering, software and technology. This plan was the result of North Carolina awarding the company $94 million in incentives in 2013 for creating over 2,600 jobs, half in Cary and half in Charlotte.[74]
"Too big to fail"[edit]
In 2012, MetLife failed the Federal Reserve’s (the Fed's) Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review stress test, intended to predict the potential failure of the company in a recession. The Fed stated that the minimum total risk-based capital ratio should be 8% and it estimated MetLife's ratio at 6%. The company had requested approval for a US$2,000,000,000 share repurchase to prop up the stock price, along with an increased dividend.[75] Because MetLife owned MetLife Bank, it was subject to stricter financial regulation. To escape that level of regulation, MetLife announced the sale of its banking unit to GE Capital.[76][77] On November 2, 2012, MetLife said it was selling its US$70,000,000,000 mortgage servicing business to JPMorgan Chase for an undisclosed amount.[78] Both sales were part of its strategy to focus on the insurance side of its business.
The attempt to escape "too big to fail" regulation was not successful. In September 2014, the United States government observed the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law by proposing the application of an official label to MetLife as "systemically important" to the American economy.[79] If implemented, MetLife would be subject to different sets of rules and regulations, with increased oversight from the Federal Reserve.[79][80] The company appealed this proposal in November 2014.[81] In December 2014, federal regulators decided that MetLife required the special regulations reserved for financial companies and organizations deemed "systemically important," or "too big to fail".[82] MetLife announced in January 2015 that it would file a lawsuit against the District of Columbia to overturn the federal regulators' decision,[79] thus becoming the first nonbank to challenge such a decision.[83] Three other nonbank companies have been designated as "systemically important": AIG, General Electric and Prudential.[82][83] MetLife continued to litigate this issue as of mid-2015, with the US Department of Justice asking that their challenge be dismissed.[83]
Fines[edit]
On August 7, 2012, it was announced that MetLife will pay $3.2 million in fines after the Federal Reserve charged it used unsafe and unsound practices in handling its mortgage servicing and foreclosure operations.[84]
In 2014, MetLife paid $23 million to settle multiple lawsuits over junk fax operations used to generate leads for life insurance sales.[85]


"MetLife Bank took advantage of the FHA insurance program by knowingly turning a blind eye to mortgage loans that did not meet basic underwriting requirements, and stuck the FHA and taxpayers with the bill when those mortgages defaulted."

U.S. Attorney John Walsh
In 2015, MetLife Home Loans LLC paid $123.5 million to the United States Department of Justice to resolve allegations it knowingly made mortgages insured by the United States government that didn’t meet federal underwriting requirements.[86]

MetLife Hall of Records, Yonkers, New York.


As of 2010[update], MetLife had a "diverse product mix" which included insurance (home, car and life), variable life annuities and structured settlements, commercial mortgages and securities backed by commercial mortgages, and sovereign debt.[15]
Life insurance[edit]
MetLife’s individual life insurance products and services comprise term life insurance and several types of permanent life insurance, including whole life, universal life, and final expense whole life insurance.[87][88] These services vary in regards to the duration and amount of coverage available and whether a medical exam is required for coverage. The company also offers group life insurance, provided through employers, which consists of term life, permanent life, and accidental death and dismemberment coverage.[89][90] MetLife is the largest life insurer in the United States, based on life insurance in-force.[10][15]
Dental[edit]
MetLife offers group dental benefit plans for individuals, employees, retirees and their families and provides dental plan administration for over 20 million people.[91][92] Plans include MetLife’s Preferred Dentist Program (PPO) and the SafeGuard DHMO (available for both individuals and employees in CA, FL, TX, NJ and NY.). As of May 2010, MetLife’s dental PPO network included over 135,000 participating dentist locations nationwide while the dental HMO network included more than 13,000 participating dentist locations in California, Florida and Texas.[93] MetLife also administers dental continuing education program for dentists and allied health care professionals, which are recognized by the American Dental Association (ADA) and the Academy of General Dentistry (AGD).[94]
Disability[edit]
MetLife provides disability products for individuals as well as employee and association groups who receive them through their employer.[14][95] For individuals, the company’s individual disability income insurance can replace a portion of lost income if an individual is unable to work due to sickness or injury.[96] MetLife offers several individual disability income policies, including MetLife Income Guard, OMNI Advantage, OMNI Essential, Business Overhead Expense, and Buy-Sell.[97] The policy options provided by the company vary in terms of eligibility and the provided coverage. For groups, MetLife offers short term disability insurance and long term disability insurance.[98] Short term disability insurance is structured to replace a portion of an individual’s income during the initial weeks of a disabling illness or accident.[99] Long term disability Insurance serves to replace a portion of an individual’s income during an extended period of a disabling illness or accident.[100][101] The company also maintains an absence management product which allows employers to track and manage both planned and unplanned employee absences. The product, which MetLife calls MetLife Total Absence Management, is structured for businesses with 1,000 or more employees.[102]
Annuities[edit]
MetLife is among the largest providers of annuities in the world, recording $22.4 billion in sales during 2009.[103] MetLife offers annuities which consist of fixed annuities, variable annuities, deferred annuities and immediate annuities.[104] In 1921, MetLife was the first company to issue a group annuity contract.[105] More recently in 2004, it was the first insurer to introduce a longevity insurance product.[106] As of December 31, 2009, MetLife globally managed group annuity assets of $60 billion with $34 billion of transferred pension liabilities and provided benefit payments to over 600,000 annuitants per month.[107]
Auto & Home[edit]
MetLife Auto & Home is the brand name for MetLife’s nine affiliate personal lines insurance companies.[108] Collectively these companies offer personal lines property and casualty insurance policies in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.[109] The flagship company in the MetLife Auto & Home group, Metropolitan Property and Casualty Insurance Company, was founded in 1972.[108] MetLife Auto & Home companies presently have over 2.7 million active policies and service 58 of the Fortune 100 companies.[110][111]
MetLife's home insurance solutions include homeowners insurance, condo insurance, renters insurance, insurance for landlords, and mobile home insurance.[112][113] The available policies for MetLife's home insurance provide coverage for possessions, property damage from natural disaster or theft, and various legal expenses incurred resulting from injuries sustained on an individual's property.[114] The companies also sell RV, ATV, boat, mobile home, collectible vehicle, and motorcycle policies[115] and offers flood insurance policies as a participant in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), which is managed by the federal government.[116][117] MetLife's various types of coverage for auto insurance include liability protection, collision and comprehensive coverage, personal injury protection, rental car coverage, and uninsured and underinsured motorists coverage.[118][119] Through an arrangement with Hyatt Legal Plans, a subsidiary of MetLife, MetLife Auto & Home underwrites group legal plans in many states.[18]
It was the first national insurer in the United States to offer identity-theft resolution services at no extra premium and as of 2012 continues to do so today in most United States states.[120][121] In 2010, MetLife Auto & Home began offering their GrandProtect plan in most states. This GrandProtect policy simplifies complex insurance needs by combining a client's home, valuable items, autos, RVs, and boats into one comprehensive policy package. The ultimate benefits to the consumer are having one bill, only one deductible, comprehensive coverage, and typically lower rates than trying to get each policy individually.[122]
Other products[edit]
MetLife’s products also include critical illness insurance.[123] Financial services include fee-based financial planning, retirement planning, wealth management, 529 Plans, banking, and commercial and residential mortgages.[124] The company also provides retirement plan and other financial services to healthcare, education, and not-for-profit organizations.[125] The MetLife Center for Special Needs Planning is a group of planners which serve families and individuals with special needs.[126] In 2014, MetLife launched MetLife Defender, a digital identity theft protection product.[127]
International presence[edit]
Outside of the United States, MetLife operates in Latin America, Europe, Asia’s Pacific region, and the Middle East, with leading market positions in Mexico, Japan, South Korea and Chile.[9]
On March 8, 2010, MetLife announced its intent to purchase the international leader life-insurance business, American Life Insurance Company (Alico), from American International Group (AIG). MetLife, which completed the deal on November 1, 2010, paid approximately $7.2 billion in cash and $9.0 billion in MetLife equity and other securities.[128][129] The securities portion of the deal consisted of 78.2 million shares of MetLife common stock, 6.9 million shares of contingent convertible preferred stock and 40 million equity units.[130] The values of the common and preferred stock were based on the closing price of MetLife’s common stock on October 29.[130] Upon completion of the purchase, MetLife became a leading competitor in Japan, the world’s second-largest life insurance market, and moved into a top 5 market position in many high growth emerging markets in Central and Eastern Europe, such as Romania, the Middle East and Latin America.[131] The deal added 20 million customers to MetLife’s 70 million and according to Barron's more than doubled the percentage of operating profits that MetLife gets abroad to 40%.[15]
In India MetLife has an affiliate company India Insurance Company Limited (MetLife) which has operated in India since 2001. This company has its headquarters in Bangalore and Gurgaon and was jointly owned by MetLife and a few local Indian financial companies. In 2012 an agreement was made with local Indian bank, the Punjab National Bank to establish a strategic alliance and for it to take a 30% share in MetLife India.[132] The state owned bank would in return sell MetLife insurance products in its branches
As of 2015, Julio Garcia-Villalon leads the Middle East & Africa regional business, which is headquartered in the Dubai International Financial Centre and has operated in the region since the 1950s.[133]
MetLife Foundation[edit]
MetLife Foundation is MetLife's independent charitable and grant-awarding foundation. It was founded in 1976[134] and had provided over $650 million in grants by January 2015.[134] The foundation has partnered with and donated to a variety of organizations, including Habitat for Humanity since 2010[135] and the Martin Luther King, Jr. National Memorial Project Foundation since 2008.[136][137] In 2013, the MetLife Foundation announced a new focus on financial inclusion,[138] including educational programs on basic financial planning for disadvantaged children[139][140] and financial services aimed at low-income communities.[140][141][142]
Relationship with Peanuts[edit]
MetLife's use of comic strip characters, according to chief marketing officer Esther Lee, was intended "to make our company more friendly and approachable during a time when insurance companies were seen as cold and distant."[143]
MetLife licensed Snoopy and other Peanuts characters for promotional purposes from the Iconix Brand Group, which owns the promotional rights to the works of Charles M. Schulz. In 2010, Iconix formed a joint venture with Schulz’s heirs, buying out E. W. Scripps Co. and United Features Syndicate for $175 million. MetLife is reported to pay $12 million per year to Iconix for licensing rights.[144] Prior to the Iconix deal, MetLife had licensed the characters from other rights-holders.
The Peanuts-based campaign was developed by the advertising agency Young & Rubicam. MetLife also has used Foote Cone & Belding to develop Peanuts-related promotions.[145][146]
MetLife announced the end of its 31-year relationship with Peanuts on October 20, 2016. This decision resulted from the company's sale of its life insurance business to concentrate on corporate clients.[143] MetLife's new blue and green logo was criticized for being a knock-off of comparison website Diffen.[147][148]
Blimp and sports sponsorship[edit]




The Metlife 'Snoopy Two' blimp.


The MetLife blimp program began in 1987 with the “Snoopy 1” airship and, in 1994, expanded to include the “Snoopy 2” airship.[149] The program provides aerial coverage to over 80 major sporting events every year and is currently the official aerial coverage provider of the PGA Tour.[150] “Snoopy 1” and “Snoopy 2” also provide overhead television coverage for the NFL, CBS College Football, the LPGA, the NBA Finals, Copa Chile, the Preakness Stakes, and the Kentucky Derby.[150][151][152][153] On August 23, 2011, MetLife agreed to a 25-year sponsorship deal to rename New Meadowlands Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, home of the NFL's New York Giants and New York Jets to MetLife Stadium.[154]
MetLife and the “Ideal weight”[edit]
In 1959, The Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (as it was known at the time) released tables of the best weight for each height for longevity, based on their collected insurance data. These tables showed the “desirable weights”. In 1983, they released tables showing the “ideal” weights for greatest longevity; this information was based on data collected in the Build Study of 1979 collected by the Society of Actuaries. This data followed patients for 18 years (from 1954-1972) and was collected from 25 life insurance companies in Canada and the United States, representing 4.2 million people. These “ideal” weights were higher than the prior “desirable” weights, this was attributed to an increase in muscle mass due to improved fitness levels among the population. This study is still the largest available pool of data for this purpose. It was noticed that the average weights in the population are higher than the ideal weights for survival. The ‘’’Metropolitan Tables’’’ included ‘’small’’, ‘’medium’’ and ‘’large’’ frames, based on elbow-girth measured using calipers, as the elbows do not develop adipose tissue. They presented weight ranges for height, sex and body frame (again associated with the lowest mortality) The mid-point of the ideal weight for the medium frames for each height was selected as the “ideal” weight used for calculations of “excess weight” (initial weight-ideal weight). This led to a formula to calculate the ideal weight used by bariatric surgeons, but it had lost considerable accuracy by 2007, again due to improvements in medical care and in public health.[155]

MetLife, Inc. (MetLife), incorporated on August 10, 1999, is a provider of life insurance, annuities, employee benefits and asset management. The Company's segments include U.S.; Asia; Latin America; Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA); MetLife Holdings; Brighthouse Financial, and Corporate & Other. In the United States, the Company provides a range of insurance and financial services products, including life, dental, disability, property and casualty, guaranteed interest, stable value and annuities to both individuals and groups. Outside the United States, the Company provides life, medical, dental, credit and other accident and health insurance, as well as annuities, endowment and retirement and savings products to both individuals and groups.The Company's businesses in the U.S. segment offer a range of protection products and services aimed at serving the financial needs of its customers throughout their lives. These products are sold to corporations and their respective employees, other institutions and their respective members, as well as individuals. The Company's U.S. segment is organized into three businesses: Group Benefits, Retirement and Income Solutions and Property & Casualty. Group Benefits insurance products and services include life, dental, group short- and long-term disability, individual disability, accidental death and dismemberment (AD&D), critical illness, vision, and accident and health coverages, as well as prepaid legal plans. It also sells administrative services-only (ASO) arrangements to some employers. Under such ASO arrangements, the employer is at risk, as the Company have not issued an insurance policy. The Company pays claims funded by the employer and perform other administrative services on behalf of the employer. The products offered by the Group Benefits business include variable life, universal life, term life, dental and disability. Variable life products provide insurance coverage through a contract that gives the policyholder flexibility in investment choices and, depending on the product, in premium payments and coverage amounts, with certain guarantees. With variable life products, premiums and account balances can be directed by the policyholder into a variety of separate account investment options or directed to the Company's general account. Universal life products provide insurance coverage on the same basis as variable life, except that premiums, and the resulting accumulated balances, are allocated only to the Company's general account. Term life products provide a guaranteed benefit upon the death of the insured for a specified time period in return for the periodic payment of premiums. Dental products provide insurance and ASO arrangements that assist employees, retirees and their families in maintaining oral health. Dental plans include the Preferred Dentist Program and the Dental Health Maintenance Organization. Group and individual disability products provide a benefit in the event of the disability of the insured.The Retirement and Income Solutions business provides funding and financing solutions that help institutional customers mitigate and manage liabilities primarily associated with their qualified, nonqualified and welfare employee benefit programs using a spectrum of life and annuity-based insurance and investment products. The products offered by the Retirement and Income Solutions business include stable value products; pension risk transfers; institutional income annuities; torts and settlements; capital markets investment products, and other products and services.

These annuities are nonparticipating, do not provide for any loan or cash surrender value and, with few exceptions, do not permit future considerations.

MetLife Inc.  said Friday it has agreed to buy Logan Circle Partners LP, Fortress Investment Group's  fixed-income asset management business, for $250 million in cash.

"Rising equity markets and costs associated with repositioning our hedging strategies contributed to the net derivative losses," the company said in a statement. Investment income rose 14% to $5.196 billion from $4.559 billion. Shares rose immediately after the report, before turning flat. They are down 3.3% in 2017, while the S&P 500  has gained 6.7%.

MetLife, Inc. is the holding corporation for the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (MLIC),[4] better known as MetLife, and its affiliates. MetLife is among the largest global providers of insurance, annuities, and employee benefit programs, with 90 million customers in over 60 countries.[3][5] The firm was founded on March 24, 1868.[6]
On January 6, 1915, MetLife completed the mutualization process, changing from a stock life insurance company owned by individuals to a mutual company operating without external shareholders and for the benefit of policyholders.[7] The company went public in 2000.[8] Through its subsidiaries and affiliates, MetLife holds leading market positions in the United States, Japan, Latin America, Asia’s Pacific region, Europe, and the Middle East.[9] MetLife serves 90 of the largest Fortune 500 companies.[10] The company’s principal offices are located at 200 Park Avenue, New York City in Midtown Manhattan, New York City, though it retains some executive offices and its boardroom in the MetLife Building, located at 200 Park Avenue, New York City, which it sold in 2005.[11]
In January 2016, the company announced that it would spin off U.S. Retail business, including individual life insurance and annuities for the retail market, in a separate company called Brighthouse Financial.[12] They will maintain the MetLife name on MetLife Stadium.[13] On March 6, 2017, the separated U.S. Retail business launched Brighthouse Financial – an independent company focused on life insurance and annuities.

In 2015, MetLife hired Hugh Dineen to fill the new role of chief marketing officer within the US Business Unit.[17]
As in many large, public corporations, MetLife has a compensation committee which establishes compensation levels for the company's senior executives; MetLife compensation emphasizes "variable performance-based compensation over fixed or guaranteed pay".[2]

History[edit]
Early years[edit]




Home office of the New England Mutual Life Insurance Co. one of the predecessor companies of MetLife. see [30]


The predecessor company to MetLife began in 1863 when a group of New York City businessmen raised $100,000 to found the National Union Life and Limb Insurance Company. The company insured Civil War sailors and soldiers against disabilities due to wartime wounds, accidents, and sickness. On March 24, 1868, it became known as Metropolitan Life Insurance Company and shifted its focus to the life insurance business.[31][32]




The Metropolitan Life Insurance Company tower, which previously served as company headquarters, was featured in its advertising for many years.


A severe business depression that began with the Panic of 1873 forced the company to contract, until it reached its lowest point in the late 1870s. After observing the insurance industry in Great Britain in 1879, MetLife President Joseph F. Knapp brought “industrial” or “workingmen’s” insurance programs to the United States – insurance issued in small amounts on which premiums were collected weekly or monthly at the policyholder’s home. By 1880, sales had exceeded a quarter million of such policies, resulting in nearly $1 million in revenue from premiums. In 1909, MetLife had become the nation’s largest life insurer in the United States, as measured by life insurance in force (the total value of life insurance policies issued).[31][33]
In 1907, the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company tower was commissioned to serve as MetLife’s 23rd Street headquarters in Lower Manhattan. Completed two years later, the building was the world's tallest until 1913 and remained the company's headquarters until 2005. For many years, an illustration of the building (with light emanating from the tip of its spire and the slogan, "The Light That Never Fails") featured prominently in MetLife’s advertising.[34] By 1930, MetLife insured every fifth man, woman, and child in the United States and Canada.[35] During the 1930s, it also began to diversify its portfolio by reducing the percentage of individual mortgages in favor of public utility bonds, investments in government securities, and loans for commercial real estate.[35] The company financed the construction of the Empire State Building in 1929 as well as provided capital to build Rockefeller Center in 1931. During World War II, MetLife placed more than 51 percent of its total assets in war bonds, and was the largest single private contributor to the Allied cause.[35]
Postwar[edit]

During the postwar era, the company expanded its suburban presence, decentralized operations, and refocused its career agency system to serve all market segments. It also began to market group insurance products to employers and institutions. By 1979, operations were segmented into four primary businesses: group insurance, personal insurance, pensions, and investments.[35] In 1981, MetLife purchased what became known as the MetLife building for $400 million from a group that included Pan American World Airways.[36][37]

De-mutualization and IPO[edit]
In 2000, MetLife converted from a mutual insurance company operated for the benefit of its policyholders to a for-profit public company. The de-mutualization process allowed MetLife to enter unrelated insurance businesses and increase executive compensation.
Policyholders received some stock in the new company in this process.[38] MetLife was accused of breaching federal securities laws by misrepresenting and omitting information in materials given to policyholders during this process, resulting in years of litigation ending with a $50 million settlement in 2009.[39]
Acquisitions, sales, and major deals[edit]

1992 - merged with United Mutual Life Insurance Company, the only African-American life insurer in New York, in 1992.[40]
1992 - [41] acquired Executive Life's single premium deferred annuity business, which was worth approximately $1.2 billion. MetLife also acquired the firm's life insurance business, valued at about $260 million.[42]
1995 - purchased New England Mutual Life Insurance Company.[43]
1997 - acquired Security First Group in 1997 for $377 million.[44][45]
1999 - acquired Lincoln National Corporation's individual disability income unit.[46]
1999 - bought out reinsurance provider GenAmerica Corporation for $1.2 billion, as well as its subsidiaries, Reinsurance Group of America and Conning Corporation.[47][48] That year, the company had grown to serve 7 million policyholders.[49]
2000 - de-mutualization and IPO.[50][51] The initial public offering was valued at $6.5 billion, which was the largest IPO to that date in United States financial history.[50][51] MetLife policyholders were asked to choose a cash or stock stake. This IPO made MetLife the most widely owned stock in the United States, and it raised MetLife's value to over $4 billion.[52][53] By 2000, MetLife's reported number of policyholders had risen to 11 million,[53] and that year it had become the United States' number one life insurer, surpassing Prudential, according to The New York Times.[54]
2000 - $470 million voice and data network management deal with AT&T Solutions.[55]
2001 - acquired Grand Bank of Kingston, New Jersey, which was renamed MetLife Bank.[56][57]
2001 - invested $1 billion in the United States stock market during 2001, immediately after the September 11th terrorist attacks.[58]
2005 - acquired Citigroup’s Travelers Life & Annuity and all of Citigroup’s international insurance businesses for $11.8 billion.[59][60] At the time of the deal, which was completed on July 1, 2005, the Travelers acquisition made MetLife the largest individual life insurer in North America based on sales.[61]
2006 - opened joint-venture insurance company in Shanghai, in May 2006.[62][63]
2006 - sold Peter Cooper Village, or Stuyvesant Town, the largest apartment complexes in New York City at the time, for $5.4 billion.[64][65] MetLife had developed the apartment complexes between 1945 and 1947, to house veterans returning home from serving in World War II.[66]
2010 - bought American Life Insurance Company from AIG for US$15,500,000,000.[59]
2011 - sold MetLife bank to GE Capital, exiting banking business.[67]

Current era[edit]
From 2004 to 2011, MetLife continued to hold its position as the largest life insurer in the United States.[16][68] The company had $2.5 trillion in policies written, $350 billion in assets under management, over 12 million customers in the United States, 8 million customers outside the United States, and a net income in 2003 of $2.2 billion.[68] That year, Barron's reported that 13 million American households owned at least one product from MetLife.[69]
MetLife named Robert H. Benmosche as chairman and CEO in July 1999. Benmosche occupied the position until 2006, when he was replaced by C. Robert Henrikson.[16][70][71]
The company's sales grew 11.5% between 2008 and 2009, despite the national recession.[72] In 2011, CEO Robert Henrikson was replaced by Steven A. Kandarian, who had overseen the company's "US$450,000,000,000 investment portfolio" as chief investment officer.[16] Henrikson remained the company's chairman to the end of 2011, at which point he reached the company's mandatory retirement age.[16]
In 2015, MetLife was ranked as number one on Fortune magazine's list of World's Most Admired Companies in the Insurance: Life and Health category.[73]
In the summer of 2017, MetLife plans to add a third office building of 255,000 square feet at its Cary, North Carolina Global Technology Campus, giving the company a total of 655,000 square feet at a location which has over 1,000 employees in such areas as engineering, software and technology. This plan was the result of North Carolina awarding the company $94 million in incentives in 2013 for creating over 2,600 jobs, half in Cary and half in Charlotte.[74]
"Too big to fail"[edit]
In 2012, MetLife failed the Federal Reserve’s (the Fed's) Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review stress test, intended to predict the potential failure of the company in a recession. The Fed stated that the minimum total risk-based capital ratio should be 8% and it estimated MetLife's ratio at 6%. The company had requested approval for a US$2,000,000,000 share repurchase to prop up the stock price, along with an increased dividend.[75] Because MetLife owned MetLife Bank, it was subject to stricter financial regulation. To escape that level of regulation, MetLife announced the sale of its banking unit to GE Capital.[76][77] On November 2, 2012, MetLife said it was selling its US$70,000,000,000 mortgage servicing business to JPMorgan Chase for an undisclosed amount.[78] Both sales were part of its strategy to focus on the insurance side of its business.
The attempt to escape "too big to fail" regulation was not successful. In September 2014, the United States government observed the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law by proposing the application of an official label to MetLife as "systemically important" to the American economy.[79] If implemented, MetLife would be subject to different sets of rules and regulations, with increased oversight from the Federal Reserve.[79][80] The company appealed this proposal in November 2014.[81] In December 2014, federal regulators decided that MetLife required the special regulations reserved for financial companies and organizations deemed "systemically important," or "too big to fail".[82] MetLife announced in January 2015 that it would file a lawsuit against the District of Columbia to overturn the federal regulators' decision,[79] thus becoming the first nonbank to challenge such a decision.[83] Three other nonbank companies have been designated as "systemically important": AIG, General Electric and Prudential.[82][83] MetLife continued to litigate this issue as of mid-2015, with the US Department of Justice asking that their challenge be dismissed.[83]
Fines[edit]
On August 7, 2012, it was announced that MetLife will pay $3.2 million in fines after the Federal Reserve charged it used unsafe and unsound practices in handling its mortgage servicing and foreclosure operations.[84]
In 2014, MetLife paid $23 million to settle multiple lawsuits over junk fax operations used to generate leads for life insurance sales.[85]


"MetLife Bank took advantage of the FHA insurance program by knowingly turning a blind eye to mortgage loans that did not meet basic underwriting requirements, and stuck the FHA and taxpayers with the bill when those mortgages defaulted."

U.S. Attorney John Walsh
In 2015, MetLife Home Loans LLC paid $123.5 million to the United States Department of Justice to resolve allegations it knowingly made mortgages insured by the United States government that didn’t meet federal underwriting requirements.[86]

MetLife Hall of Records, Yonkers, New York.


As of 2010[update], MetLife had a "diverse product mix" which included insurance (home, car and life), variable life annuities and structured settlements, commercial mortgages and securities backed by commercial mortgages, and sovereign debt.[15]
Life insurance[edit]
MetLife’s individual life insurance products and services comprise term life insurance and several types of permanent life insurance, including whole life, universal life, and final expense whole life insurance.[87][88] These services vary in regards to the duration and amount of coverage available and whether a medical exam is required for coverage. The company also offers group life insurance, provided through employers, which consists of term life, permanent life, and accidental death and dismemberment coverage.[89][90] MetLife is the largest life insurer in the United States, based on life insurance in-force.[10][15]
Dental[edit]
MetLife offers group dental benefit plans for individuals, employees, retirees and their families and provides dental plan administration for over 20 million people.[91][92] Plans include MetLife’s Preferred Dentist Program (PPO) and the SafeGuard DHMO (available for both individuals and employees in CA, FL, TX, NJ and NY.). As of May 2010, MetLife’s dental PPO network included over 135,000 participating dentist locations nationwide while the dental HMO network included more than 13,000 participating dentist locations in California, Florida and Texas.[93] MetLife also administers dental continuing education program for dentists and allied health care professionals, which are recognized by the American Dental Association (ADA) and the Academy of General Dentistry (AGD).[94]
Disability[edit]
MetLife provides disability products for individuals as well as employee and association groups who receive them through their employer.[14][95] For individuals, the company’s individual disability income insurance can replace a portion of lost income if an individual is unable to work due to sickness or injury.[96] MetLife offers several individual disability income policies, including MetLife Income Guard, OMNI Advantage, OMNI Essential, Business Overhead Expense, and Buy-Sell.[97] The policy options provided by the company vary in terms of eligibility and the provided coverage. For groups, MetLife offers short term disability insurance and long term disability insurance.[98] Short term disability insurance is structured to replace a portion of an individual’s income during the initial weeks of a disabling illness or accident.[99] Long term disability Insurance serves to replace a portion of an individual’s income during an extended period of a disabling illness or accident.[100][101] The company also maintains an absence management product which allows employers to track and manage both planned and unplanned employee absences. The product, which MetLife calls MetLife Total Absence Management, is structured for businesses with 1,000 or more employees.[102]
Annuities[edit]
MetLife is among the largest providers of annuities in the world, recording $22.4 billion in sales during 2009.[103] MetLife offers annuities which consist of fixed annuities, variable annuities, deferred annuities and immediate annuities.[104] In 1921, MetLife was the first company to issue a group annuity contract.[105] More recently in 2004, it was the first insurer to introduce a longevity insurance product.[106] As of December 31, 2009, MetLife globally managed group annuity assets of $60 billion with $34 billion of transferred pension liabilities and provided benefit payments to over 600,000 annuitants per month.[107]
Auto & Home[edit]
MetLife Auto & Home is the brand name for MetLife’s nine affiliate personal lines insurance companies.[108] Collectively these companies offer personal lines property and casualty insurance policies in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.[109] The flagship company in the MetLife Auto & Home group, Metropolitan Property and Casualty Insurance Company, was founded in 1972.[108] MetLife Auto & Home companies presently have over 2.7 million active policies and service 58 of the Fortune 100 companies.[110][111]
MetLife's home insurance solutions include homeowners insurance, condo insurance, renters insurance, insurance for landlords, and mobile home insurance.[112][113] The available policies for MetLife's home insurance provide coverage for possessions, property damage from natural disaster or theft, and various legal expenses incurred resulting from injuries sustained on an individual's property.[114] The companies also sell RV, ATV, boat, mobile home, collectible vehicle, and motorcycle policies[115] and offers flood insurance policies as a participant in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), which is managed by the federal government.[116][117] MetLife's various types of coverage for auto insurance include liability protection, collision and comprehensive coverage, personal injury protection, rental car coverage, and uninsured and underinsured motorists coverage.[118][119] Through an arrangement with Hyatt Legal Plans, a subsidiary of MetLife, MetLife Auto & Home underwrites group legal plans in many states.[18]
It was the first national insurer in the United States to offer identity-theft resolution services at no extra premium and as of 2012 continues to do so today in most United States states.[120][121] In 2010, MetLife Auto & Home began offering their GrandProtect plan in most states. This GrandProtect policy simplifies complex insurance needs by combining a client's home, valuable items, autos, RVs, and boats into one comprehensive policy package. The ultimate benefits to the consumer are having one bill, only one deductible, comprehensive coverage, and typically lower rates than trying to get each policy individually.[122]
Other products[edit]
MetLife’s products also include critical illness insurance.[123] Financial services include fee-based financial planning, retirement planning, wealth management, 529 Plans, banking, and commercial and residential mortgages.[124] The company also provides retirement plan and other financial services to healthcare, education, and not-for-profit organizations.[125] The MetLife Center for Special Needs Planning is a group of planners which serve families and individuals with special needs.[126] In 2014, MetLife launched MetLife Defender, a digital identity theft protection product.[127]
International presence[edit]
Outside of the United States, MetLife operates in Latin America, Europe, Asia’s Pacific region, and the Middle East, with leading market positions in Mexico, Japan, South Korea and Chile.[9]
On March 8, 2010, MetLife announced its intent to purchase the international leader life-insurance business, American Life Insurance Company (Alico), from American International Group (AIG). MetLife, which completed the deal on November 1, 2010, paid approximately $7.2 billion in cash and $9.0 billion in MetLife equity and other securities.[128][129] The securities portion of the deal consisted of 78.2 million shares of MetLife common stock, 6.9 million shares of contingent convertible preferred stock and 40 million equity units.[130] The values of the common and preferred stock were based on the closing price of MetLife’s common stock on October 29.[130] Upon completion of the purchase, MetLife became a leading competitor in Japan, the world’s second-largest life insurance market, and moved into a top 5 market position in many high growth emerging markets in Central and Eastern Europe, such as Romania, the Middle East and Latin America.[131] The deal added 20 million customers to MetLife’s 70 million and according to Barron's more than doubled the percentage of operating profits that MetLife gets abroad to 40%.[15]
In India MetLife has an affiliate company India Insurance Company Limited (MetLife) which has operated in India since 2001. This company has its headquarters in Bangalore and Gurgaon and was jointly owned by MetLife and a few local Indian financial companies. In 2012 an agreement was made with local Indian bank, the Punjab National Bank to establish a strategic alliance and for it to take a 30% share in MetLife India.[132] The state owned bank would in return sell MetLife insurance products in its branches
As of 2015, Julio Garcia-Villalon leads the Middle East & Africa regional business, which is headquartered in the Dubai International Financial Centre and has operated in the region since the 1950s.[133]
MetLife Foundation[edit]
MetLife Foundation is MetLife's independent charitable and grant-awarding foundation. It was founded in 1976[134] and had provided over $650 million in grants by January 2015.[134] The foundation has partnered with and donated to a variety of organizations, including Habitat for Humanity since 2010[135] and the Martin Luther King, Jr. National Memorial Project Foundation since 2008.[136][137] In 2013, the MetLife Foundation announced a new focus on financial inclusion,[138] including educational programs on basic financial planning for disadvantaged children[139][140] and financial services aimed at low-income communities.[140][141][142]
Relationship with Peanuts[edit]
MetLife's use of comic strip characters, according to chief marketing officer Esther Lee, was intended "to make our company more friendly and approachable during a time when insurance companies were seen as cold and distant."[143]
MetLife licensed Snoopy and other Peanuts characters for promotional purposes from the Iconix Brand Group, which owns the promotional rights to the works of Charles M. Schulz. In 2010, Iconix formed a joint venture with Schulz’s heirs, buying out E. W. Scripps Co. and United Features Syndicate for $175 million. MetLife is reported to pay $12 million per year to Iconix for licensing rights.[144] Prior to the Iconix deal, MetLife had licensed the characters from other rights-holders.
The Peanuts-based campaign was developed by the advertising agency Young & Rubicam. MetLife also has used Foote Cone & Belding to develop Peanuts-related promotions.[145][146]
MetLife announced the end of its 31-year relationship with Peanuts on October 20, 2016. This decision resulted from the company's sale of its life insurance business to concentrate on corporate clients.[143] MetLife's new blue and green logo was criticized for being a knock-off of comparison website Diffen.[147][148]
Blimp and sports sponsorship[edit]




The Metlife 'Snoopy Two' blimp.


The MetLife blimp program began in 1987 with the “Snoopy 1” airship and, in 1994, expanded to include the “Snoopy 2” airship.[149] The program provides aerial coverage to over 80 major sporting events every year and is currently the official aerial coverage provider of the PGA Tour.[150] “Snoopy 1” and “Snoopy 2” also provide overhead television coverage for the NFL, CBS College Football, the LPGA, the NBA Finals, Copa Chile, the Preakness Stakes, and the Kentucky Derby.[150][151][152][153] On August 23, 2011, MetLife agreed to a 25-year sponsorship deal to rename New Meadowlands Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, home of the NFL's New York Giants and New York Jets to MetLife Stadium.[154]
MetLife and the “Ideal weight”[edit]
In 1959, The Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (as it was known at the time) released tables of the best weight for each height for longevity, based on their collected insurance data. These tables showed the “desirable weights”. In 1983, they released tables showing the “ideal” weights for greatest longevity; this information was based on data collected in the Build Study of 1979 collected by the Society of Actuaries. This data followed patients for 18 years (from 1954-1972) and was collected from 25 life insurance companies in Canada and the United States, representing 4.2 million people. These “ideal” weights were higher than the prior “desirable” weights, this was attributed to an increase in muscle mass due to improved fitness levels among the population. This study is still the largest available pool of data for this purpose. It was noticed that the average weights in the population are higher than the ideal weights for survival. The ‘’’Metropolitan Tables’’’ included ‘’small’’, ‘’medium’’ and ‘’large’’ frames, based on elbow-girth measured using calipers, as the elbows do not develop adipose tissue. They presented weight ranges for height, sex and body frame (again associated with the lowest mortality) The mid-point of the ideal weight for the medium frames for each height was selected as the “ideal” weight used for calculations of “excess weight” (initial weight-ideal weight). This led to a formula to calculate the ideal weight used by bariatric surgeons, but it had lost considerable accuracy by 2007, again due to improvements in medical care and in public health.[155]

MetLife, Inc. is the holding corporation for the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (MLIC),[4] better known as MetLife, and its affiliates. MetLife is among the largest global providers of insurance, annuities, and employee benefit programs, with 90 million customers in over 60 countries.[3][5] The firm was founded on March 24, 1868.[6]
On January 6, 1915, MetLife completed the mutualization process, changing from a stock life insurance company owned by individuals to a mutual company operating without external shareholders and for the benefit of policyholders.[7] The company went public in 2000.[8] Through its subsidiaries and affiliates, MetLife holds leading market positions in the United States, Japan, Latin America, Asia’s Pacific region, Europe, and the Middle East.[9] MetLife serves 90 of the largest Fortune 500 companies.[10] The company’s principal offices are located at 200 Park Avenue, New York City in Midtown Manhattan, New York City, though it retains some executive offices and its boardroom in the MetLife Building, located at 200 Park Avenue, New York City, which it sold in 2005.[11]
In January 2016, the company announced that it would spin off U.S. Retail business, including individual life insurance and annuities for the retail market, in a separate company called Brighthouse Financial.[12] They will maintain the MetLife name on MetLife Stadium.[13] On March 6, 2017, the separated U.S. Retail business launched Brighthouse Financial – an independent company focused on life insurance and annuities.

Corporate structure[edit]





This section needs to be updated. Please update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. (December 2015)


As of 2010[update], the company was "organized into five segments: Insurance Products, Retirement Products," the US Business (including Auto & Home and Corporate Benefit Funding), and International.[14] The Insurance Products division was the largest unit, accounting for 53% of 2009 revenue.[15] By 2015, a division referred to as "Americas" had emerged.[2]
Corporate governance[edit]



This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (December 2015)


As of 2011, MetLife's chief executive officer was Steve Kandarian.[16] Kandarian also served as the company's chairman of the board and president as of 2015.[2]
Hired in 2013, John Hele served as chief financial officer for the company as of 2015.[2]
In 2015, MetLife hired Hugh Dineen to fill the new role of chief marketing officer within the US Business Unit.[17]
As in many large, public corporations, MetLife has a compensation committee which establishes compensation levels for the company's senior executives; MetLife compensation emphasizes "variable performance-based compensation over fixed or guaranteed pay".[2]
Subsidiary and affiliate companies[edit]
MetLife subsidiaries and affiliates have included MetLife Investors, MetLife Bank, MetLife Securities, Metropolitan Property and Casualty Insurance Company and its subsidiaries, General American, Hyatt Legal, MetLife Resources, New England Financial, Walnut Street Securities, Inc., Safeguard Health Enterprises, Inc., and Tower Square Securities, Inc., Cigna.[18][19][20][21][22][23][24][25][26]
The subsidiary MetLife Insurance Company USA, as of 2015 headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina, was formerly known as MetLife Insurance Company of Connecticut, and prior to this as Travelers Insurance Company.[27][28]
MetLife Bank was sold to GE Capital in 2013, and MetLife exited the banking business.[29]
History[edit]
Early years[edit]




Home office of the New England Mutual Life Insurance Co. one of the predecessor companies of MetLife. see [30]


The predecessor company to MetLife began in 1863 when a group of New York City businessmen raised $100,000 to found the National Union Life and Limb Insurance Company. The company insured Civil War sailors and soldiers against disabilities due to wartime wounds, accidents, and sickness. On March 24, 1868, it became known as Metropolitan Life Insurance Company and shifted its focus to the life insurance business.[31][32]




The Metropolitan Life Insurance Company tower, which previously served as company headquarters, was featured in its advertising for many years.


A severe business depression that began with the Panic of 1873 forced the company to contract, until it reached its lowest point in the late 1870s. After observing the insurance industry in Great Britain in 1879, MetLife President Joseph F. Knapp brought “industrial” or “workingmen’s” insurance programs to the United States – insurance issued in small amounts on which premiums were collected weekly or monthly at the policyholder’s home. By 1880, sales had exceeded a quarter million of such policies, resulting in nearly $1 million in revenue from premiums. In 1909, MetLife had become the nation’s largest life insurer in the United States, as measured by life insurance in force (the total value of life insurance policies issued).[31][33]
In 1907, the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company tower was commissioned to serve as MetLife’s 23rd Street headquarters in Lower Manhattan. Completed two years later, the building was the world's tallest until 1913 and remained the company's headquarters until 2005. For many years, an illustration of the building (with light emanating from the tip of its spire and the slogan, "The Light That Never Fails") featured prominently in MetLife’s advertising.[34] By 1930, MetLife insured every fifth man, woman, and child in the United States and Canada.[35] During the 1930s, it also began to diversify its portfolio by reducing the percentage of individual mortgages in favor of public utility bonds, investments in government securities, and loans for commercial real estate.[35] The company financed the construction of the Empire State Building in 1929 as well as provided capital to build Rockefeller Center in 1931. During World War II, MetLife placed more than 51 percent of its total assets in war bonds, and was the largest single private contributor to the Allied cause.[35]
Postwar[edit]

During the postwar era, the company expanded its suburban presence, decentralized operations, and refocused its career agency system to serve all market segments. It also began to market group insurance products to employers and institutions. By 1979, operations were segmented into four primary businesses: group insurance, personal insurance, pensions, and investments.[35] In 1981, MetLife purchased what became known as the MetLife building for $400 million from a group that included Pan American World Airways.[36][37]

De-mutualization and IPO[edit]
In 2000, MetLife converted from a mutual insurance company operated for the benefit of its policyholders to a for-profit public company. The de-mutualization process allowed MetLife to enter unrelated insurance businesses and increase executive compensation.
Policyholders received some stock in the new company in this process.[38] MetLife was accused of breaching federal securities laws by misrepresenting and omitting information in materials given to policyholders during this process, resulting in years of litigation ending with a $50 million settlement in 2009.[39]
Acquisitions, sales, and major deals[edit]

1992 - merged with United Mutual Life Insurance Company, the only African-American life insurer in New York, in 1992.[40]
1992 - [41] acquired Executive Life's single premium deferred annuity business, which was worth approximately $1.2 billion. MetLife also acquired the firm's life insurance business, valued at about $260 million.[42]
1995 - purchased New England Mutual Life Insurance Company.[43]
1997 - acquired Security First Group in 1997 for $377 million.[44][45]
1999 - acquired Lincoln National Corporation's individual disability income unit.[46]
1999 - bought out reinsurance provider GenAmerica Corporation for $1.2 billion, as well as its subsidiaries, Reinsurance Group of America and Conning Corporation.[47][48] That year, the company had grown to serve 7 million policyholders.[49]
2000 - de-mutualization and IPO.[50][51] The initial public offering was valued at $6.5 billion, which was the largest IPO to that date in United States financial history.[50][51] MetLife policyholders were asked to choose a cash or stock stake. This IPO made MetLife the most widely owned stock in the United States, and it raised MetLife's value to over $4 billion.[52][53] By 2000, MetLife's reported number of policyholders had risen to 11 million,[53] and that year it had become the United States' number one life insurer, surpassing Prudential, according to The New York Times.[54]
2000 - $470 million voice and data network management deal with AT&T Solutions.[55]
2001 - acquired Grand Bank of Kingston, New Jersey, which was renamed MetLife Bank.[56][57]
2001 - invested $1 billion in the United States stock market during 2001, immediately after the September 11th terrorist attacks.[58]
2005 - acquired Citigroup’s Travelers Life & Annuity and all of Citigroup’s international insurance businesses for $11.8 billion.[59][60] At the time of the deal, which was completed on July 1, 2005, the Travelers acquisition made MetLife the largest individual life insurer in North America based on sales.[61]
2006 - opened joint-venture insurance company in Shanghai, in May 2006.[62][63]
2006 - sold Peter Cooper Village, or Stuyvesant Town, the largest apartment complexes in New York City at the time, for $5.4 billion.[64][65] MetLife had developed the apartment complexes between 1945 and 1947, to house veterans returning home from serving in World War II.[66]
2010 - bought American Life Insurance Company from AIG for US$15,500,000,000.[59]
2011 - sold MetLife bank to GE Capital, exiting banking business.[67]

Current era[edit]
From 2004 to 2011, MetLife continued to hold its position as the largest life insurer in the United States.[16][68] The company had $2.5 trillion in policies written, $350 billion in assets under management, over 12 million customers in the United States, 8 million customers outside the United States, and a net income in 2003 of $2.2 billion.[68] That year, Barron's reported that 13 million American households owned at least one product from MetLife.[69]
MetLife named Robert H. Benmosche as chairman and CEO in July 1999. Benmosche occupied the position until 2006, when he was replaced by C. Robert Henrikson.[16][70][71]
The company's sales grew 11.5% between 2008 and 2009, despite the national recession.[72] In 2011, CEO Robert Henrikson was replaced by Steven A. Kandarian, who had overseen the company's "US$450,000,000,000 investment portfolio" as chief investment officer.[16] Henrikson remained the company's chairman to the end of 2011, at which point he reached the company's mandatory retirement age.[16]
In 2015, MetLife was ranked as number one on Fortune magazine's list of World's Most Admired Companies in the Insurance: Life and Health category.[73]
In the summer of 2017, MetLife plans to add a third office building of 255,000 square feet at its Cary, North Carolina Global Technology Campus, giving the company a total of 655,000 square feet at a location which has over 1,000 employees in such areas as engineering, software and technology. This plan was the result of North Carolina awarding the company $94 million in incentives in 2013 for creating over 2,600 jobs, half in Cary and half in Charlotte.[74]
"Too big to fail"[edit]
In 2012, MetLife failed the Federal Reserve’s (the Fed's) Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review stress test, intended to predict the potential failure of the company in a recession. The Fed stated that the minimum total risk-based capital ratio should be 8% and it estimated MetLife's ratio at 6%. The company had requested approval for a US$2,000,000,000 share repurchase to prop up the stock price, along with an increased dividend.[75] Because MetLife owned MetLife Bank, it was subject to stricter financial regulation. To escape that level of regulation, MetLife announced the sale of its banking unit to GE Capital.[76][77] On November 2, 2012, MetLife said it was selling its US$70,000,000,000 mortgage servicing business to JPMorgan Chase for an undisclosed amount.[78] Both sales were part of its strategy to focus on the insurance side of its business.
The attempt to escape "too big to fail" regulation was not successful. In September 2014, the United States government observed the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law by proposing the application of an official label to MetLife as "systemically important" to the American economy.[79] If implemented, MetLife would be subject to different sets of rules and regulations, with increased oversight from the Federal Reserve.[79][80] The company appealed this proposal in November 2014.[81] In December 2014, federal regulators decided that MetLife required the special regulations reserved for financial companies and organizations deemed "systemically important," or "too big to fail".[82] MetLife announced in January 2015 that it would file a lawsuit against the District of Columbia to overturn the federal regulators' decision,[79] thus becoming the first nonbank to challenge such a decision.[83] Three other nonbank companies have been designated as "systemically important": AIG, General Electric and Prudential.[82][83] MetLife continued to litigate this issue as of mid-2015, with the US Department of Justice asking that their challenge be dismissed.[83]
Fines[edit]
On August 7, 2012, it was announced that MetLife will pay $3.2 million in fines after the Federal Reserve charged it used unsafe and unsound practices in handling its mortgage servicing and foreclosure operations.[84]
In 2014, MetLife paid $23 million to settle multiple lawsuits over junk fax operations used to generate leads for life insurance sales.[85]

MetLife Hall of Records, Yonkers, New York.


As of 2010[update], MetLife had a "diverse product mix" which included insurance (home, car and life), variable life annuities and structured settlements, commercial mortgages and securities backed by commercial mortgages, and sovereign debt.[15]
Life insurance[edit]
MetLife’s individual life insurance products and services comprise term life insurance and several types of permanent life insurance, including whole life, universal life, and final expense whole life insurance.[87][88] These services vary in regards to the duration and amount of coverage available and whether a medical exam is required for coverage. The company also offers group life insurance, provided through employers, which consists of term life, permanent life, and accidental death and dismemberment coverage.[89][90] MetLife is the largest life insurer in the United States, based on life insurance in-force.[10][15]
Dental[edit]
MetLife offers group dental benefit plans for individuals, employees, retirees and their families and provides dental plan administration for over 20 million people.[91][92] Plans include MetLife’s Preferred Dentist Program (PPO) and the SafeGuard DHMO (available for both individuals and employees in CA, FL, TX, NJ and NY.). As of May 2010, MetLife’s dental PPO network included over 135,000 participating dentist locations nationwide while the dental HMO network included more than 13,000 participating dentist locations in California, Florida and Texas.[93] MetLife also administers dental continuing education program for dentists and allied health care professionals, which are recognized by the American Dental Association (ADA) and the Academy of General Dentistry (AGD).[94]
Disability[edit]
MetLife provides disability products for individuals as well as employee and association groups who receive them through their employer.[14][95] For individuals, the company’s individual disability income insurance can replace a portion of lost income if an individual is unable to work due to sickness or injury.[96] MetLife offers several individual disability income policies, including MetLife Income Guard, OMNI Advantage, OMNI Essential, Business Overhead Expense, and Buy-Sell.[97] The policy options provided by the company vary in terms of eligibility and the provided coverage. For groups, MetLife offers short term disability insurance and long term disability insurance.[98] Short term disability insurance is structured to replace a portion of an individual’s income during the initial weeks of a disabling illness or accident.[99] Long term disability Insurance serves to replace a portion of an individual’s income during an extended period of a disabling illness or accident.[100][101] The company also maintains an absence management product which allows employers to track and manage both planned and unplanned employee absences. The product, which MetLife calls MetLife Total Absence Management, is structured for businesses with 1,000 or more employees.[102]
Annuities[edit]
MetLife is among the largest providers of annuities in the world, recording $22.4 billion in sales during 2009.[103] MetLife offers annuities which consist of fixed annuities, variable annuities, deferred annuities and immediate annuities.[104] In 1921, MetLife was the first company to issue a group annuity contract.[105] More recently in 2004, it was the first insurer to introduce a longevity insurance product.[106] As of December 31, 2009, MetLife globally managed group annuity assets of $60 billion with $34 billion of transferred pension liabilities and provided benefit payments to over 600,000 annuitants per month.[107]
Auto & Home[edit]
MetLife Auto & Home is the brand name for MetLife’s nine affiliate personal lines insurance companies.[108] Collectively these companies offer personal lines property and casualty insurance policies in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.[109] The flagship company in the MetLife Auto & Home group, Metropolitan Property and Casualty Insurance Company, was founded in 1972.[108] MetLife Auto & Home companies presently have over 2.7 million active policies and service 58 of the Fortune 100 companies.[110][111]
MetLife's home insurance solutions include homeowners insurance, condo insurance, renters insurance, insurance for landlords, and mobile home insurance.[112][113] The available policies for MetLife's home insurance provide coverage for possessions, property damage from natural disaster or theft, and various legal expenses incurred resulting from injuries sustained on an individual's property.[114] The companies also sell RV, ATV, boat, mobile home, collectible vehicle, and motorcycle policies[115] and offers flood insurance policies as a participant in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), which is managed by the federal government.[116][117] MetLife's various types of coverage for auto insurance include liability protection, collision and comprehensive coverage, personal injury protection, rental car coverage, and uninsured and underinsured motorists coverage.[118][119] Through an arrangement with Hyatt Legal Plans, a subsidiary of MetLife, MetLife Auto & Home underwrites group legal plans in many states.[18]
It was the first national insurer in the United States to offer identity-theft resolution services at no extra premium and as of 2012 continues to do so today in most United States states.[120][121] In 2010, MetLife Auto & Home began offering their GrandProtect plan in most states. This GrandProtect policy simplifies complex insurance needs by combining a client's home, valuable items, autos, RVs, and boats into one comprehensive policy package. The ultimate benefits to the consumer are having one bill, only one deductible, comprehensive coverage, and typically lower rates than trying to get each policy individually.[122]
Other products[edit]
MetLife’s products also include critical illness insurance.[123] Financial services include fee-based financial planning, retirement planning, wealth management, 529 Plans, banking, and commercial and residential mortgages.[124] The company also provides retirement plan and other financial services to healthcare, education, and not-for-profit organizations.[125] The MetLife Center for Special Needs Planning is a group of planners which serve families and individuals with special needs.[126] In 2014, MetLife launched MetLife Defender, a digital identity theft protection product.[127]
International presence[edit]
Outside of the United States, MetLife operates in Latin America, Europe, Asia’s Pacific region, and the Middle East, with leading market positions in Mexico, Japan, South Korea and Chile.[9]
On March 8, 2010, MetLife announced its intent to purchase the international leader life-insurance business, American Life Insurance Company (Alico), from American International Group (AIG). MetLife, which completed the deal on November 1, 2010, paid approximately $7.2 billion in cash and $9.0 billion in MetLife equity and other securities.[128][129] The securities portion of the deal consisted of 78.2 million shares of MetLife common stock, 6.9 million shares of contingent convertible preferred stock and 40 million equity units.[130] The values of the common and preferred stock were based on the closing price of MetLife’s common stock on October 29.[130] Upon completion of the purchase, MetLife became a leading competitor in Japan, the world’s second-largest life insurance market, and moved into a top 5 market position in many high growth emerging markets in Central and Eastern Europe, such as Romania, the Middle East and Latin America.[131] The deal added 20 million customers to MetLife’s 70 million and according to Barron's more than doubled the percentage of operating profits that MetLife gets abroad to 40%.[15]
In India MetLife has an affiliate company India Insurance Company Limited (MetLife) which has operated in India since 2001. This company has its headquarters in Bangalore and Gurgaon and was jointly owned by MetLife and a few local Indian financial companies. In 2012 an agreement was made with local Indian bank, the Punjab National Bank to establish a strategic alliance and for it to take a 30% share in MetLife India.[132] The state owned bank would in return sell MetLife insurance products in its branches
As of 2015, Julio Garcia-Villalon leads the Middle East & Africa regional business, which is headquartered in the Dubai International Financial Centre and has operated in the region since the 1950s.[133]
MetLife Foundation[edit]
MetLife Foundation is MetLife's independent charitable and grant-awarding foundation. It was founded in 1976[134] and had provided over $650 million in grants by January 2015.[134] The foundation has partnered with and donated to a variety of organizations, including Habitat for Humanity since 2010[135] and the Martin Luther King, Jr. National Memorial Project Foundation since 2008.[136][137] In 2013, the MetLife Foundation announced a new focus on financial inclusion,[138] including educational programs on basic financial planning for disadvantaged children[139][140] and financial services aimed at low-income communities.[140][141][142]
Relationship with Peanuts[edit]
MetLife's use of comic strip characters, according to chief marketing officer Esther Lee, was intended "to make our company more friendly and approachable during a time when insurance companies were seen as cold and distant."[143]
MetLife licensed Snoopy and other Peanuts characters for promotional purposes from the Iconix Brand Group, which owns the promotional rights to the works of Charles M. Schulz. In 2010, Iconix formed a joint venture with Schulz’s heirs, buying out E. W. Scripps Co. and United Features Syndicate for $175 million. MetLife is reported to pay $12 million per year to Iconix for licensing rights.[144] Prior to the Iconix deal, MetLife had licensed the characters from other rights-holders.
The Peanuts-based campaign was developed by the advertising agency Young & Rubicam. MetLife also has used Foote Cone & Belding to develop Peanuts-related promotions.[145][146]
MetLife announced the end of its 31-year relationship with Peanuts on October 20, 2016. This decision resulted from the company's sale of its life insurance business to concentrate on corporate clients.[143] MetLife's new blue and green logo was criticized for being a knock-off of comparison website Diffen.[147][148]
Blimp and sports sponsorship[edit]




The Metlife 'Snoopy Two' blimp.


The MetLife blimp program began in 1987 with the “Snoopy 1” airship and, in 1994, expanded to include the “Snoopy 2” airship.[149] The program provides aerial coverage to over 80 major sporting events every year and is currently the official aerial coverage provider of the PGA Tour.[150] “Snoopy 1” and “Snoopy 2” also provide overhead television coverage for the NFL, CBS College Football, the LPGA, the NBA Finals, Copa Chile, the Preakness Stakes, and the Kentucky Derby.[150][151][152][153] On August 23, 2011, MetLife agreed to a 25-year sponsorship deal to rename New Meadowlands Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, home of the NFL's New York Giants and New York Jets to MetLife Stadium.[154]
MetLife and the “Ideal weight”[edit]
In 1959, The Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (as it was known at the time) released tables of the best weight for each height for longevity, based on their collected insurance data. These tables showed the “desirable weights”. In 1983, they released tables showing the “ideal” weights for greatest longevity; this information was based on data collected in the Build Study of 1979 collected by the Society of Actuaries. This data followed patients for 18 years (from 1954-1972) and was collected from 25 life insurance companies in Canada and the United States, representing 4.2 million people. These “ideal” weights were higher than the prior “desirable” weights, this was attributed to an increase in muscle mass due to improved fitness levels among the population. This study is still the largest available pool of data for this purpose. It was noticed that the average weights in the population are higher than the ideal weights for survival. The ‘’’Metropolitan Tables’’’ included ‘’small’’, ‘’medium’’ and ‘’large’’ frames, based on elbow-girth measured using calipers, as the elbows do not develop adipose tissue. They presented weight ranges for height, sex and body frame (again associated with the lowest mortality) The mid-point of the ideal weight for the medium frames for each height was selected as the “ideal” weight used for calculations of “excess weight” (initial weight-ideal weight). This led to a formula to calculate the ideal weight used by bariatric surgeons, but it had lost considerable accuracy by 2007, again due to improvements in medical care and in public health.[155]

History[edit]
Early years[edit]




Home office of the New England Mutual Life Insurance Co. one of the predecessor companies of MetLife. see [30]


The predecessor company to MetLife began in 1863 when a group of New York City businessmen raised $100,000 to found the National Union Life and Limb Insurance Company. The company insured Civil War sailors and soldiers against disabilities due to wartime wounds, accidents, and sickness. On March 24, 1868, it became known as Metropolitan Life Insurance Company and shifted its focus to the life insurance business.[31][32]




The Metropolitan Life Insurance Company tower, which previously served as company headquarters, was featured in its advertising for many years.


A severe business depression that began with the Panic of 1873 forced the company to contract, until it reached its lowest point in the late 1870s. After observing the insurance industry in Great Britain in 1879, MetLife President Joseph F. Knapp brought “industrial” or “workingmen’s” insurance programs to the United States – insurance issued in small amounts on which premiums were collected weekly or monthly at the policyholder’s home. By 1880, sales had exceeded a quarter million of such policies, resulting in nearly $1 million in revenue from premiums. In 1909, MetLife had become the nation’s largest life insurer in the United States, as measured by life insurance in force (the total value of life insurance policies issued).[31][33]
In 1907, the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company tower was commissioned to serve as MetLife’s 23rd Street headquarters in Lower Manhattan. Completed two years later, the building was the world's tallest until 1913 and remained the company's headquarters until 2005. For many years, an illustration of the building (with light emanating from the tip of its spire and the slogan, "The Light That Never Fails") featured prominently in MetLife’s advertising.[34] By 1930, MetLife insured every fifth man, woman, and child in the United States and Canada.[35] During the 1930s, it also began to diversify its portfolio by reducing the percentage of individual mortgages in favor of public utility bonds, investments in government securities, and loans for commercial real estate.[35] The company financed the construction of the Empire State Building in 1929 as well as provided capital to build Rockefeller Center in 1931. During World War II, MetLife placed more than 51 percent of its total assets in war bonds, and was the largest single private contributor to the Allied cause.[35]
Postwar[edit]

During the postwar era, the company expanded its suburban presence, decentralized operations, and refocused its career agency system to serve all market segments. It also began to market group insurance products to employers and institutions. By 1979, operations were segmented into four primary businesses: group insurance, personal insurance, pensions, and investments.[35] In 1981, MetLife purchased what became known as the MetLife building for $400 million from a group that included Pan American World Airways.[36][37]

De-mutualization and IPO[edit]
In 2000, MetLife converted from a mutual insurance company operated for the benefit of its policyholders to a for-profit public company. The de-mutualization process allowed MetLife to enter unrelated insurance businesses and increase executive compensation.
Policyholders received some stock in the new company in this process.[38] MetLife was accused of breaching federal securities laws by misrepresenting and omitting information in materials given to policyholders during this process, resulting in years of litigation ending with a $50 million settlement in 2009.[39]
Acquisitions, sales, and major deals[edit]

1992 - merged with United Mutual Life Insurance Company, the only African-American life insurer in New York, in 1992.[40]
1992 - [41] acquired Executive Life's single premium deferred annuity business, which was worth approximately $1.2 billion. MetLife also acquired the firm's life insurance business, valued at about $260 million.[42]
1995 - purchased New England Mutual Life Insurance Company.[43]
1997 - acquired Security First Group in 1997 for $377 million.[44][45]
1999 - acquired Lincoln National Corporation's individual disability income unit.[46]
1999 - bought out reinsurance provider GenAmerica Corporation for $1.2 billion, as well as its subsidiaries, Reinsurance Group of America and Conning Corporation.[47][48] That year, the company had grown to serve 7 million policyholders.[49]
2000 - de-mutualization and IPO.[50][51] The initial public offering was valued at $6.5 billion, which was the largest IPO to that date in United States financial history.[50][51] MetLife policyholders were asked to choose a cash or stock stake. This IPO made MetLife the most widely owned stock in the United States, and it raised MetLife's value to over $4 billion.[52][53] By 2000, MetLife's reported number of policyholders had risen to 11 million,[53] and that year it had become the United States' number one life insurer, surpassing Prudential, according to The New York Times.[54]
2000 - $470 million voice and data network management deal with AT&T Solutions.[55]
2001 - acquired Grand Bank of Kingston, New Jersey, which was renamed MetLife Bank.[56][57]
2001 - invested $1 billion in the United States stock market during 2001, immediately after the September 11th terrorist attacks.[58]
2005 - acquired Citigroup’s Travelers Life & Annuity and all of Citigroup’s international insurance businesses for $11.8 billion.[59][60] At the time of the deal, which was completed on July 1, 2005, the Travelers acquisition made MetLife the largest individual life insurer in North America based on sales.[61]
2006 - opened joint-venture insurance company in Shanghai, in May 2006.[62][63]
2006 - sold Peter Cooper Village, or Stuyvesant Town, the largest apartment complexes in New York City at the time, for $5.4 billion.[64][65] MetLife had developed the apartment complexes between 1945 and 1947, to house veterans returning home from serving in World War II.[66]
2010 - bought American Life Insurance Company from AIG for US$15,500,000,000.[59]
2011 - sold MetLife bank to GE Capital, exiting banking business.[67]

Current era[edit]
From 2004 to 2011, MetLife continued to hold its position as the largest life insurer in the United States.[16][68] The company had $2.5 trillion in policies written, $350 billion in assets under management, over 12 million customers in the United States, 8 million customers outside the United States, and a net income in 2003 of $2.2 billion.[68] That year, Barron's reported that 13 million American households owned at least one product from MetLife.[69]
MetLife named Robert H. Benmosche as chairman and CEO in July 1999. Benmosche occupied the position until 2006, when he was replaced by C. Robert Henrikson.[16][70][71]
The company's sales grew 11.5% between 2008 and 2009, despite the national recession.[72] In 2011, CEO Robert Henrikson was replaced by Steven A. Kandarian, who had overseen the company's "US$450,000,000,000 investment portfolio" as chief investment officer.[16] Henrikson remained the company's chairman to the end of 2011, at which point he reached the company's mandatory retirement age.[16]
In 2015, MetLife was ranked as number one on Fortune magazine's list of World's Most Admired Companies in the Insurance: Life and Health category.[73]
In the summer of 2017, MetLife plans to add a third office building of 255,000 square feet at its Cary, North Carolina Global Technology Campus, giving the company a total of 655,000 square feet at a location which has over 1,000 employees in such areas as engineering, software and technology. This plan was the result of North Carolina awarding the company $94 million in incentives in 2013 for creating over 2,600 jobs, half in Cary and half in Charlotte.[74]
"Too big to fail"[edit]
In 2012, MetLife failed the Federal Reserve’s (the Fed's) Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review stress test, intended to predict the potential failure of the company in a recession. The Fed stated that the minimum total risk-based capital ratio should be 8% and it estimated MetLife's ratio at 6%. The company had requested approval for a US$2,000,000,000 share repurchase to prop up the stock price, along with an increased dividend.[75] Because MetLife owned MetLife Bank, it was subject to stricter financial regulation. To escape that level of regulation, MetLife announced the sale of its banking unit to GE Capital.[76][77] On November 2, 2012, MetLife said it was selling its US$70,000,000,000 mortgage servicing business to JPMorgan Chase for an undisclosed amount.[78] Both sales were part of its strategy to focus on the insurance side of its business.
The attempt to escape "too big to fail" regulation was not successful. In September 2014, the United States government observed the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law by proposing the application of an official label to MetLife as "systemically important" to the American economy.[79] If implemented, MetLife would be subject to different sets of rules and regulations, with increased oversight from the Federal Reserve.[79][80] The company appealed this proposal in November 2014.[81] In December 2014, federal regulators decided that MetLife required the special regulations reserved for financial companies and organizations deemed "systemically important," or "too big to fail".[82] MetLife announced in January 2015 that it would file a lawsuit against the District of Columbia to overturn the federal regulators' decision,[79] thus becoming the first nonbank to challenge such a decision.[83] Three other nonbank companies have been designated as "systemically important": AIG, General Electric and Prudential.[82][83] MetLife continued to litigate this issue as of mid-2015, with the US Department of Justice asking that their challenge be dismissed.[83]
Fines[edit]
On August 7, 2012, it was announced that MetLife will pay $3.2 million in fines after the Federal Reserve charged it used unsafe and unsound practices in handling its mortgage servicing and foreclosure operations.[84]
In 2014, MetLife paid $23 million to settle multiple lawsuits over junk fax operations used to generate leads for life insurance sales.[85]


"MetLife Bank took advantage of the FHA insurance program by knowingly turning a blind eye to mortgage loans that did not meet basic underwriting requirements, and stuck the FHA and taxpayers with the bill when those mortgages defaulted."

U.S. Attorney John Walsh
In 2015, MetLife Home Loans LLC paid $123.5 million to the United States Department of Justice to resolve allegations it knowingly made mortgages insured by the United States government that didn’t meet federal underwriting requirements.[86]

MetLife Hall of Records, Yonkers, New York.


As of 2010[update], MetLife had a "diverse product mix" which included insurance (home, car and life), variable life annuities and structured settlements, commercial mortgages and securities backed by commercial mortgages, and sovereign debt.[15]
Life insurance[edit]
MetLife’s individual life insurance products and services comprise term life insurance and several types of permanent life insurance, including whole life, universal life, and final expense whole life insurance.[87][88] These services vary in regards to the duration and amount of coverage available and whether a medical exam is required for coverage. The company also offers group life insurance, provided through employers, which consists of term life, permanent life, and accidental death and dismemberment coverage.[89][90] MetLife is the largest life insurer in the United States, based on life insurance in-force.[10][15]
Dental[edit]
MetLife offers group dental benefit plans for individuals, employees, retirees and their families and provides dental plan administration for over 20 million people.[91][92] Plans include MetLife’s Preferred Dentist Program (PPO) and the SafeGuard DHMO (available for both individuals and employees in CA, FL, TX, NJ and NY.). As of May 2010, MetLife’s dental PPO network included over 135,000 participating dentist locations nationwide while the dental HMO network included more than 13,000 participating dentist locations in California, Florida and Texas.[93] MetLife also administers dental continuing education program for dentists and allied health care professionals, which are recognized by the American Dental Association (ADA) and the Academy of General Dentistry (AGD).[94]
Disability[edit]
MetLife provides disability products for individuals as well as employee and association groups who receive them through their employer.[14][95] For individuals, the company’s individual disability income insurance can replace a portion of lost income if an individual is unable to work due to sickness or injury.[96] MetLife offers several individual disability income policies, including MetLife Income Guard, OMNI Advantage, OMNI Essential, Business Overhead Expense, and Buy-Sell.[97] The policy options provided by the company vary in terms of eligibility and the provided coverage. For groups, MetLife offers short term disability insurance and long term disability insurance.[98] Short term disability insurance is structured to replace a portion of an individual’s income during the initial weeks of a disabling illness or accident.[99] Long term disability Insurance serves to replace a portion of an individual’s income during an extended period of a disabling illness or accident.[100][101] The company also maintains an absence management product which allows employers to track and manage both planned and unplanned employee absences. The product, which MetLife calls MetLife Total Absence Management, is structured for businesses with 1,000 or more employees.[102]
Annuities[edit]
MetLife is among the largest providers of annuities in the world, recording $22.4 billion in sales during 2009.[103] MetLife offers annuities which consist of fixed annuities, variable annuities, deferred annuities and immediate annuities.[104] In 1921, MetLife was the first company to issue a group annuity contract.[105] More recently in 2004, it was the first insurer to introduce a longevity insurance product.[106] As of December 31, 2009, MetLife globally managed group annuity assets of $60 billion with $34 billion of transferred pension liabilities and provided benefit payments to over 600,000 annuitants per month.[107]
Auto & Home[edit]
MetLife Auto & Home is the brand name for MetLife’s nine affiliate personal lines insurance companies.[108] Collectively these companies offer personal lines property and casualty insurance policies in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.[109] The flagship company in the MetLife Auto & Home group, Metropolitan Property and Casualty Insurance Company, was founded in 1972.[108] MetLife Auto & Home companies presently have over 2.7 million active policies and service 58 of the Fortune 100 companies.[110][111]
MetLife's home insurance solutions include homeowners insurance, condo insurance, renters insurance, insurance for landlords, and mobile home insurance.[112][113] The available policies for MetLife's home insurance provide coverage for possessions, property damage from natural disaster or theft, and various legal expenses incurred resulting from injuries sustained on an individual's property.[114] The companies also sell RV, ATV, boat, mobile home, collectible vehicle, and motorcycle policies[115] and offers flood insurance policies as a participant in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), which is managed by the federal government.[116][117] MetLife's various types of coverage for auto insurance include liability protection, collision and comprehensive coverage, personal injury protection, rental car coverage, and uninsured and underinsured motorists coverage.[118][119] Through an arrangement with Hyatt Legal Plans, a subsidiary of MetLife, MetLife Auto & Home underwrites group legal plans in many states.[18]
It was the first national insurer in the United States to offer identity-theft resolution services at no extra premium and as of 2012 continues to do so today in most United States states.[120][121] In 2010, MetLife Auto & Home began offering their GrandProtect plan in most states. This GrandProtect policy simplifies complex insurance needs by combining a client's home, valuable items, autos, RVs, and boats into one comprehensive policy package. The ultimate benefits to the consumer are having one bill, only one deductible, comprehensive coverage, and typically lower rates than trying to get each policy individually.[122]
Other products[edit]
MetLife’s products also include critical illness insurance.[123] Financial services include fee-based financial planning, retirement planning, wealth management, 529 Plans, banking, and commercial and residential mortgages.[124] The company also provides retirement plan and other financial services to healthcare, education, and not-for-profit organizations.[125] The MetLife Center for Special Needs Planning is a group of planners which serve families and individuals with special needs.[126] In 2014, MetLife launched MetLife Defender, a digital identity theft protection product.[127]
International presence[edit]
Outside of the United States, MetLife operates in Latin America, Europe, Asia’s Pacific region, and the Middle East, with leading market positions in Mexico, Japan, South Korea and Chile.[9]
On March 8, 2010, MetLife announced its intent to purchase the international leader life-insurance business, American Life Insurance Company (Alico), from American International Group (AIG). MetLife, which completed the deal on November 1, 2010, paid approximately $7.2 billion in cash and $9.0 billion in MetLife equity and other securities.[128][129] The securities portion of the deal consisted of 78.2 million shares of MetLife common stock, 6.9 million shares of contingent convertible preferred stock and 40 million equity units.[130] The values of the common and preferred stock were based on the closing price of MetLife’s common stock on October 29.[130] Upon completion of the purchase, MetLife became a leading competitor in Japan, the world’s second-largest life insurance market, and moved into a top 5 market position in many high growth emerging markets in Central and Eastern Europe, such as Romania, the Middle East and Latin America.[131] The deal added 20 million customers to MetLife’s 70 million and according to Barron's more than doubled the percentage of operating profits that MetLife gets abroad to 40%.[15]
In India MetLife has an affiliate company India Insurance Company Limited (MetLife) which has operated in India since 2001. This company has its headquarters in Bangalore and Gurgaon and was jointly owned by MetLife and a few local Indian financial companies. In 2012 an agreement was made with local Indian bank, the Punjab National Bank to establish a strategic alliance and for it to take a 30% share in MetLife India.[132] The state owned bank would in return sell MetLife insurance products in its branches
As of 2015, Julio Garcia-Villalon leads the Middle East & Africa regional business, which is headquartered in the Dubai International Financial Centre and has operated in the region since the 1950s.[133]
MetLife Foundation[edit]
MetLife Foundation is MetLife's independent charitable and grant-awarding foundation. It was founded in 1976[134] and had provided over $650 million in grants by January 2015.[134] The foundation has partnered with and donated to a variety of organizations, including Habitat for Humanity since 2010[135] and the Martin Luther King, Jr. National Memorial Project Foundation since 2008.[136][137] In 2013, the MetLife Foundation announced a new focus on financial inclusion,[138] including educational programs on basic financial planning for disadvantaged children[139][140] and financial services aimed at low-income communities.[140][141][142]
Relationship with Peanuts[edit]
MetLife's use of comic strip characters, according to chief marketing officer Esther Lee, was intended "to make our company more friendly and approachable during a time when insurance companies were seen as cold and distant."[143]
MetLife licensed Snoopy and other Peanuts characters for promotional purposes from the Iconix Brand Group, which owns the promotional rights to the works of Charles M. Schulz. In 2010, Iconix formed a joint venture with Schulz’s heirs, buying out E. W. Scripps Co. and United Features Syndicate for $175 million. MetLife is reported to pay $12 million per year to Iconix for licensing rights.[144] Prior to the Iconix deal, MetLife had licensed the characters from other rights-holders.
The Peanuts-based campaign was developed by the advertising agency Young & Rubicam. MetLife also has used Foote Cone & Belding to develop Peanuts-related promotions.[145][146]
MetLife announced the end of its 31-year relationship with Peanuts on October 20, 2016. This decision resulted from the company's sale of its life insurance business to concentrate on corporate clients.[143] MetLife's new blue and green logo was criticized for being a knock-off of comparison website Diffen.[147][148]
Blimp and sports sponsorship[edit]




The Metlife 'Snoopy Two' blimp.


The MetLife blimp program began in 1987 with the “Snoopy 1” airship and, in 1994, expanded to include the “Snoopy 2” airship.[149] The program provides aerial coverage to over 80 major sporting events every year and is currently the official aerial coverage provider of the PGA Tour.[150] “Snoopy 1” and “Snoopy 2” also provide overhead television coverage for the NFL, CBS College Football, the LPGA, the NBA Finals, Copa Chile, the Preakness Stakes, and the Kentucky Derby.[150][151][152][153] On August 23, 2011, MetLife agreed to a 25-year sponsorship deal to rename New Meadowlands Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, home of the NFL's New York Giants and New York Jets to MetLife Stadium.[154]
MetLife and the “Ideal weight”[edit]
In 1959, The Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (as it was known at the time) released tables of the best weight for each height for longevity, based on their collected insurance data. These tables showed the “desirable weights”. In 1983, they released tables showing the “ideal” weights for greatest longevity; this information was based on data collected in the Build Study of 1979 collected by the Society of Actuaries. This data followed patients for 18 years (from 1954-1972) and was collected from 25 life insurance companies in Canada and the United States, representing 4.2 million people. These “ideal” weights were higher than the prior “desirable” weights, this was attributed to an increase in muscle mass due to improved fitness levels among the population. This study is still the largest available pool of data for this purpose. It was noticed that the average weights in the population are higher than the ideal weights for survival. The ‘’’Metropolitan Tables’’’ included ‘’small’’, ‘’medium’’ and ‘’large’’ frames, based on elbow-girth measured using calipers, as the elbows do not develop adipose tissue. They presented weight ranges for height, sex and body frame (again associated with the lowest mortality) The mid-point of the ideal weight for the medium frames for each height was selected as the “ideal” weight used for calculations of “excess weight” (initial weight-ideal weight). This led to a formula to calculate the ideal weight used by bariatric surgeons, but it had lost considerable accuracy by 2007, again due to improvements in medical care and in public health.[155]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
