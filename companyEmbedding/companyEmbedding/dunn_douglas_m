Douglas Dunn is an unlikely Vietnam draft-dodger. He is the most respected Scottish poet of his generation, a protégé of Phillip Larkin, both as librarian and poet, and a long-standing professor of English at St Andrews University. But in late 1965, while working as a librarian in Ohio, Dunn received his call-up papers. He attended the medical, but soon after left the country and was officially designated a deserter by the American military. It was a bizarre and disturbing episode, but the impact of Dunn's exposure to American literature, culture and academic life was in part responsible for the launch of a remarkable literary career. Back in Scotland he was galvanised to write and to study. The primary product of this work has been 10 volumes of poetry, but Dunn has also made his mark as a critic, editor and hugely influential mentor to other poets. Next week sees the publication of his New Selected Poems. The collection opens with work from his groundbreaking 1967 debut collection, Terry Street , in which Dunn chronicled comings and goings in a run-down, working-class neighbourhood in Hull. It closes with poems from his 2000 collection, The Year's Afternoon , shortlisted for the Forward prize. This is Dunn's second Selected Poems . The first was published in 1986 in the aftermath of the success of his 1985 book, Elegies , which was written in response to the death of his first wife, Lesley Balfour Wallace, in 1981. It won the Whitbread prize beating off novels by Peter Ackroyd ( Hawksmoor ) and Jeanette Winterson ( Oranges are not the Only Fruit ) and critics compared the work to Tennyson's "In Memorium", and Hardy's poems in memory of his dead wife. Its impact is still felt. The popularity of the book has in some ways overshadowed much of Dunn's other work. But as the poet and critic Bernard O'Donoghue points out "it was an important turning point. Until then he had been well known and respected by other poets. Its popular success made him a major poetic figure." From the outset Dunn had been admired by peers for his technical achievements. Peter Porter puts him alongside John Fuller as "the most skilful poet writing in this country today, and a master of English prosody". The poet and critic Christopher Wiseman, who in the early 1960s was a pioneer of creative-writing courses at British universities, says Dunn's work provides a wonderful example to students of poetic form. "He has this marvellous ability to write in the human speaking voice while keeping metre and rhyme and form going. It is very difficult, but it allows him to sound chatty, not de-dum-de-dum-de-dum-ish." Dunn has married these technical gifts to a strong sense of social justice. He can deftly incorporate individual narratives within larger social, economic and political trends. Terry Eagleton, writing in 1970, praised Dunn for being able to "transcend the two major pitfalls of poetry concerned with working people - bourgeois voyeurism or sympathetic mythification". In Blake Morrison and Andrew Motion's influential 1982 anthology of contemporary British poets, Dunn was bracketed with Tony Harrison as being "sharply conscious of background and upbringing, which sets them at an angle to the cultural establishment". That is not to say that Dunn is motivated by a chip on his shoulder. Although he has made significant political interventions - he wrote an influential pamphlet criticising the imposition of the poll tax in the late 1980s - the poet Sean O'Brien, a protégé, has written that more accurately there is in his work a "permanent standoff between private life and political engagement, a state of affairs that has become a strategic necessity for his poetry". The poet Douglas Houston, a fellow student of Dunn's in the mid-1960s, explains that Dunn "had a working-class Scots upbringing and then, by means of ability and education, he moved away from that. It is a form of alienation that is also in the work of poets like Heaney and Harrison. A lot of their work is a dialogue between class and cultural conventions and personal background and biography." Dunn was born in Inchinnan, a village on the south bank of the Clyde, in 1942. His father worked for a tyre manufacturer and the family at first lived in a company house before moving to a newly built council estate. Dunn has one younger brother, John, who is now a gardener. Although they were only 10 miles from Glasgow, Dunn says the city was only ever "somewhere you occasionally visited for special shopping trips. I hated Glasgow and still do. I'm not a Glaswegian." Back then Inchinnan was rural, and while on the opposite bank of the Clyde were shipyards and factories - "it was quite exciting to see ships being launched and things like that" - Dunn's school friends were farmers' boys "and there were woods and streams and quarries and other places to explore". Although Dunn describes himself as a bookish child there were few books in the house, apart from those given to him as presents. "But it wasn't entirely unliterary. My grandfather, who was a Co-op baker in Hamilton, was an autodidact. He was the type of man who you still get in Scotland who knew the poetry of Robert Burns, and things like that." At school Dunn was talented at English and history but poor at the school's specialities, maths and science. Murray Neil, who now works abroad for a company that builds oil refineries, was a contemporary. They used to hike together and go to jazz concerts. Neil says, "He was quite a strong personality, but also quiet and self-contained. Reading the poems you can see those characteristics still coming through; keeping going and helping people upstairs to visit his wife, yet inside his heart was breaking because she was dying." 
Dunn's lack of aptitude for maths and science meant that he was unable to get into a Scottish university. Instead, he went to work for the Renfrew library service. He then studied at the Scottish School of Librarianship in Glasgow where he excelled. He became assistant librarian at the Royal College of Science and Technology library where he met Christopher Wiseman, a founder member of the English department at the University of Strathclyde. Wiseman introduced Dunn to the work of American poets like Donald Justice, James Wright and Robert Lowell - "people I'd barely heard of" - as well as offering advice. "The stuff any teacher of poetry usually gets is 90% dross," recalls Wiseman, "but he was clearly special. They weren't the finished article but they showed great promise and he was clearly dedicated. I remember they had a lot of powerful imagery and subject matter, some of which he was not yet ready to really cope with." 
In 1964 Dunn left Scotland for America and a post at the Akron Public Library in Ohio. He was accompanied to America by his new wife, Lesley. They met when he worked at a branch library in Renfrew. She was a civil servant when they married just a few days before leaving Scotland, but in America she became assistant to the in-house library artist. Dunn says that he already had literary ambitions, "but I'd kept them quiet. Where I came from you didn't ponce around saying you wanted to be a poet." While he didn't go deliberately to study American poetry, "I got to review new poetry on a local radio show." He also started to write a novel and sent stories to the New Yorker. "They didn't publish them, but they did send a very encouraging reply." Dunn was forced to pursue any literary ambitions back in the UK when the American trip went sour. First the Dunns were in a car crash in which one of their closest friends, a pregnant woman, was killed. Another friend was killed in Vietnam and then Dunn, because he had a five-year work visa, received his Vietnam draft papers. 
On his return to Scotland, he became librarian at the Joseph Black Chemistry Library in Glasgow. Wiseman recalls Dunn being "shaken by the American experience and was clearly wrestling with whether to stay in librarianship or not". Dunn applied to several universities and was offered a place at the University of Hull to read English. He began his course in October 1966. He and Lesley bought a one-up, one-down terraced house in Terry Street for £250. Dunn took on some part-time cataloguing work under Philip Larkin in the Brynmor Jones Library. The poet Douglas Houston, then a 19-year-old fellow undergraduate, remembers Dunn as "more mature than most of us; he was married, he had been a professional librarian, he had lived in America and he had begun to make some impact as a poet. He was already publishing in the right places." 
The poet Hugo Williams was Dunn's contact at the London Magazine and remembers the editor, Alan Ross, being "very excited" when Dunn submitted the poems that later made up the Terry Street collection. "We had these photos of Terry Street as well," says Williams, "and the fact that he lived there made it all seem so fantastically authentic." 
Dunn's fellow undergraduates and young poets already regarded him as something of a mentor. Tom Paulin, a year behind Dunn on the English course, used to visit the Dunn home and says "he was very good to me, looking at my hope less attempts to write poetry". As to his own poetry, Dunn says, "meeting Larkin was obviously important, although we didn't talk much about poetry. We talked more about jazz." It wasn't until 1968, when Larkin was a member of a committee that gave a Gregory Award to Dunn, that Larkin even knew Dunn wrote poetry. But Larkin then "put in a word" at Faber that Dunn should be included in the first Faber introduction to young poets. "I tend to be a fairly diffident kind of guy," explains Dunn. "My blood runs slow. But getting published by Faber was time for a private hop, skip and jump." 
In 1969, aged 26, he graduated from Hull with a first-class honours degree. That year Terry Street , his debut collection, was published. It received overwhelmingly positive critical response, although Dunn also remembers giving a copy to an uncle who said, "I don't know why you bother, you will never be as great as the immortal Robert Burns". "If you're a poet in Scotland that is the sort of thing you have to put up with," Dunn shrugs. 
Another less than glowing response came in a review from Peter Porter. "At first I didn't really like it," says Porter. "I have a great lack of sympathy for writers like Tony Harrison who jet into Kennedy with a little bag of their mam's sweets in their pocket or something. I don't understand why, if you've been educated in Latin, it makes you unable to speak to your daddy. And I thought Douglas had a bit of that, but when I got to know him I realised that I was wrong about him and about Terry Street , although I think it is still a little simple-minded in comparison with his later work. His poetry is wonderfully complex. I think his most powerful book is St Kilda's Parliament . Dante's Drum Kit is also very good." 
After graduation, Dunn began to work full-time at the library and Lesley enrolled at the art school. Although he was a rising star of the poetry world it was difficult to give readings because Larkin, his boss, wouldn't give him time off. "I did one reading in the two years I was there. It was in Manchester and Larkin eventually allowed me to take two hours off in the afternoon, but I was not allowed to stay overnight and had to work Saturday morning to make the time up." 
Dunn eventually left the library in 1971 to live in the Dordogne for six months, financed by a Somerset Maugham award. He says he spent most of his time playing the clarinet and going for walks. But he also took on a lot of book reviewing and drafted some short stories later published by the New Yorker. When he and Lesley returned to Hull, Dunn was a freelance writer and Lesley got a job in the Ferens Art Gallery, where she was soon promoted to senior keeper. 
Dunn says that while he admired Larkin as a librarian and a poet, "he wasn't the sort of person you would go to if you were struggling with a poem". But not long after Dunn went freelance, Larkin took to calling at his house on the way to work, "just to make sure I was up and at my desk. He wanted to know I wasn't poncing around in a dressing gown with a cigarette in a holder." Although the two men were close, Dunn now concedes that the unflattering portrait of Larkin that emerged after his death from diaries and letters was one he recognised. "But he would never have come out with anything racist in my company," he says. "He knew I'd walk away. It was more something he would share with people like Kingsley Amis." 
As well as his poetry, Dunn was writing short stories and scripts, including the dramas Early Every Morning and Ploughman's Share for television and Scotsman by Moonlight and Wedderburn's Slave for radio. By now he was plugged into literary London and was in the orbit of the charismatic and influential poet, critic and editor Ian Hamilton. As poetry editor of the TLS and editor of The Review and The New Review, Hamilton published Dunn's work. The men became friends: Dunn arranged for Hamilton to work at Hull and later asked him to come to St Andrews. "He sent me a cv, but like his poems it was bloody short," laughs Dunn. "He could have had a contract tailor-made to suit him, but he really couldn't contemplate being outside London." 
Dunn recalls regular trips to London from Hull to have boozy lunches with Hamilton and his circle. "I'd take a holdall full of review copies of books and sell them at Gaston's in Chancery Lane, which paid half price. So I might have £150 in my pocket and could get plastered." Friends say Dunn has a facility for "vigorous bonhomie", but despite the attractions of Grub Street, Dunn says he never wanted to live this life full-time. As he wrote in the poem "Remembering Lunch", "Especially as, in my case, I was not born ever to expect/ To enjoy so long-drawn-out a lunchtime at steep prices/ Among tolerant waiters resigned to our lasting presences". 
But Hugo Williams recalls Dunn fitting in well enough. "He was a drinking type and a little bit like Ian. They had a similar, sardonic northern humour. And Douglas's wasn't copied from Ian in the same way as everyone else's was. It was his own thing." Dunn was certainly enough of a fixture on this scene to be granted a role in Clive James's 1974 book-length comic poem, "Peregrine Prykke's Pilgrimage through the London Literary World", where he became Douglas Dunge, "a moralising bard of wide remark". But as Peter Porter explains, "people were serious about their literature, even though their behaviour might have been drunken or peculiar". 
As a writer, despite the success of Terry Street , Dunn was struggling to find his way. "My first book made things difficult because it got such a large press. It also associated me with Larkin and was a very easily classifiable subject and so in a way it typecast me. I wasn't going to get over that with the second book [ The Happier Life , 1972] and I was disappointed as it was a bit transitional. There are one or two things I like in my third book [ Love or Nothing , 1974] but it was with Barbarians (1979) that I think I started to get a more mature style." (Dunn remembers telling the increasingly deaf Larkin, who was concerned that Dunn hadn't published for some time, about Barbarians . "He looked a bit off at first, but then he laughed and said, 'Oh God, for a moment I thought you said 'librarians'.") 
By now Dunn was shaping the careers of other poets. He recommended Tom Paulin to Faber in the mid-1970s and by the end of that decade was orchestrating a vibrant poetry scene in Hull. Douglas Houston returned to Hull as a postgraduate specifically to "immerse myself in the unique poetic environment up there". 
Houston calls Dunn "a man of great rigour. He has never suffered fools gladly either in person or in their verse. He was a very assiduous mentor to a whole clan of poets in Hull but he couldn't be pleased easily. You really had to ring the bells to get the thumbs up from Douglas. With Sean O'Brien and Peter Didsbury I was part of a group over which Douglas presided - in the most informal of senses. But we recognised his authority." In 1982 Dunn edited an anthology of work by writers associated with Hull, A Rumoured City , and even persuaded the reticent Larkin to contribute a foreword. 
Dunn had emerged as a critic and editor with a selection of Byron's verse. In 1975 he edited the first collection of essays about the new Northern Irish writers. "I always felt closer to the Northern Ireland poets than to English poets. And my generation of Scottish poets is pretty thin on the ground." 
In 1978 Lesley was diagnosed with cancer of the eye. This stanza comes from the poem "Second Opinion" in Elegies : 
They called me in. What moment worse 
Than that young doctor trying to explain? 
"It's large and growing." "What is?" "Malignancy." 
"Why there? She's an artist!" 
Lesley died aged 37 in 1981. Dunn's book of that year, St Kilda's Parliament , won the Hawthornden Prize. Dunn took up a post at Dundee University as writer-in-residence and wrote the poems that became Elegies . "I didn't think of it as a collection at first," he says. "I just wrote a number of poems, although I knew I was writing about the same subject again and again." The huge and ongoing public response to the book surprised him, but despite the obvious mixed emotions he says it was ultimately "gratifying in the sense that I knew my wife wasn't going to be forgotten." 
In 1985, the same year Elegies was pub lished, Dunn married Lesley Bathgate, a wood engraver. They have two children, Robbie who is 16 this month and Lillias who is 12 and has had two poems published in an anthology. Dunn and Lesley separated in 1997 and he now lives alone in the village of Dairsie, about nine miles from St Andrews. 
Dunn published his selected poems in 1986 and then another collection, Northlight in 1988. Although his work has attracted consistent critical acclaim, when he was offered a professorship at St Andrews in 1991 he jumped at the chance. "The fact was that my income, compared to the amount of time it took to earn it, was pitiful." He later became head of school and director of the Scottish Studies Institute. He now heads the creative writing course, where he has assembled a strong cast of writers, including John Burnside, Kathleen Jamie, Don Paterson and A L Kennedy. 
Matt Thorne, a former student, wrote his first novel, Tourist , while at St Andrews and says Dunn "really makes the course. We had this big session where he taught me enough to be going on with in the literary world for the next couple of years. I said that I doubted I could become a writer straight away, so asked for some advice about getting work in the literary industry. He said it was more like the literary indolence and that I should start writing as soon as possible. It was good advice." 
Although claiming that poems don't come to him as readily as they once did, Dunn has managed to produce, while a full-time academic, Dante's Drum Kit in 1993, and in 2000 the long verse novel The Donkey's Ears and the collection The Year's Afternoon . He has also edited anthologies of Scottish literature. 
The range of his work and the variety of approaches he has used within his poetry are widely commended. He is writing another long poem and working on some "long" short stories, although these have been stalled as he can only write prose on an electric typewriter, which has now broken. It has not been possible to get it repaired. He writes poetry in longhand. Looking back over all his poetry in preparing the New Selected Poems he found "fairly chastening". 
"Almost everything I have written has been dictated by something that has happened to me. That is why I don't read my poems too much. I often wish I was another type of artist, like a musician or a painter. A painter sells his work and it goes away and he might never see it again. As a poet, I think I'd prefer it that you wrote something and it was published and you would never see it again. Some poems you wish you had never written and some you would want to revise. Some poets take the opportunity to revise but I resisted that. I've taken the Pontius Pilate line," he finally smiles - "What I have written I have written."
