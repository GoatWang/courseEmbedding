CORPUS CHRISTI, TX, June 3, 2014 /PRNewswire/ - Uranium Energy Corp. (NYSE MKT:
 UEC, the "Company" or "UEC") is pleased to announce the appointment of
 Ganpat Mani to the Company's Board of Directors.


From 2009 to 2013, Mr. Mani was President and Chief Executive Officer of
 ConverDyn, a partnership between affiliates of Honeywell International
 Inc. and General Atomics, which specializes in the nuclear fuel
 conversion trade. During this time he also served as a director of the
 Nuclear Energy Institute and was a member of the U.S. Civil Nuclear
 Trade Advisory Committee. He is a highly experienced negotiator of
 contracts with major private and state-owned corporations in Asia,
 Europe and the U.S.  Notably, Mr. Mani negotiated the agreement for the
 return of uranium feed from the Metropolis conversion facility under
 the Megatons to Megawatts program between the U.S. and Russia. He also
 met with government and industry organizations as part of the U.S.
 Department of Commerce's multiple nuclear trade missions to India.


From 1994 to 2007, Mr. Mani held several senior marketing positions with
 ConverDyn, including having served as Senior Vice President.  At
 ConverDyn, he was responsible for relations with major nuclear
 utilities in Asia, Europe and the U.S. and with enrichment companies in
 Europe and the U.S.  He has prepared position papers and draft

 spanned a variety of functional areas and product lines.


Mr. Mani holds an MBA from Rutgers University and a Bachelor of
 Technology Degree in Metallurgical Engineering from Loughborough
 University, UK.


The Company is appointing Mr. Mani to the Board following the
 resignation of Katharine Armstrong as a director.  Ms. Armstrong served
 on the Company's Board since 2012 after having served as an Advisory

 Committee in addition to his existing appointment as Chairman of the
 Audit Committee.

 and experience in the uranium business, particularly his in-depth
 knowledge of the global nuclear fuel market. The Company is very
 appreciative of Katharine's guidance and expertise throughout her
 five-year tenure as an advisor and director.  We will continue to seek
 her perspective and counsel on an informal basis."

 not statements of historical fact and should be viewed as
 "forward-looking statements". Such forward looking statements involve
 known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may
 cause the actual results, performance or achievements of the Company to
 be materially different from any future results, performance or
 achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.
 Such risks and other factors include, among others, the actual results
 of exploration activities, variations in the underlying assumptions
 associated with the estimation or realization of mineral resources, the

 completion of development or construction activities, title disputes or
 claims limitations on insurance coverage. Although the Company has
 attempted to identify important factors that could cause actual
 actions, events or results to differ materially from those described in
 forward-looking statements, there may be other factors that cause
 actions, events or results not to be as anticipated, estimated or
 intended. There can be no assurance that such statements will prove to
 be accurate as actual results and future events could differ materially
 from those anticipated in such statements. Accordingly, readers should
 not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements contained in
 this news release and in any document referred to in this news release.


Certain matters discussed in this news release and oral statements made
 from time to time by representatives of the Company may constitute
 forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities
 Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and the Federal securities laws. Although

 filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. For

 otherwise. This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or

Published on Jul 6, 20112011 Special Summit on New Nuclear Energy Roundtable:State of the Renaissance• Ricardo (Ric) Perez, Westinghouse Electric Corporation• Jacques Besnainou, Areva North America• Will Marshall, Progressive Policy Institute• Ganpat Mani, ConverDynAbout the Summit:The Special Summit features perspectives from government, industry and the non-governmental community as well as roundtable discussions on the state of the global "Nuclear Renaissance" -- including lessons from the recent earthquake and tsunami-related events at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power station in Japan; insight from the financial community on new nuclear investment; status reports on new nuclear "first movers"; and assessments of the U.S. licensing paradigm. The Special Summit will also focus on new nuclear infrastructure readiness including nuclear technology advancement; supply chain and workforce readiness; and development of a sustainable fuel cycle. The Special Summit is moderated by Llewellyn King, the Executive Producer and Host of White House Chronicle on PBS — a news and public affairs program airing nationwide and on XM Satellite Radio.  He is also a nationally syndicated columnist. The Summit is organized under the auspices of the United States Nuclear Infrastructure Council, the leading national think tank advocate for new nuclear energy.Panelists:Ganpat ManiPresident & CEOConverDynPrior to re-joining ConverDyn in 2009 as President & CEO, Ganpat Mani was with Paladin Energy Ltd, an Australian uranium producer supporting their global strategic initiatives. Other previous positions included Member, Board of Directors of Uranium International Corporation, a junior mining company and Principal of Ganman Consulting LLC, which provided business strategy, market development and outsourcing support for nuclear and non-nuclear companies. Mr. Mani retired from Honeywell International Inc. in June 2007 after a 35-year-career spanning a variety of functional areas and product lines. His last position was Senior Vice President for marketing and sales at ConverDyn.Excerpted Quotes:"So in terms of the renaissance, absolutely there is going to be a renaissance but how much of that will flow back into support for U.S. jobs remains to seen""So I think the jury is still out in terms of how much of the fuel supply the niche industries, Llewellyn you asked about, will translate into U.S. jobs and U.S. export sales."
