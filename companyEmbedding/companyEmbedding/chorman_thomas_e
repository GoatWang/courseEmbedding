Mr. Chorman is no longer affiliated with Foam Partners, and presently has a minority ownership interest in Boomer Capital. From 2001 through 2006, Mr. Chorman was employed by Foamex International, a manufacturer of comfort cushioning for the furnishing and automotive markets, with sales of approximately $1.4 billion.

S. operations in order to facilitate the implementation of restructuring activities. In 2007, Foamex emerged from bankruptcy, paying 100 cents on the dollar to all creditors. From June 2009 through April 2012, Mr. Chorman served on the Board of Directors of Symmetry Medical, a provider of implants, instruments and cases to orthopedic device manufacturers trading on the NYSE. Mr. Chorman was chairman of the Finance and Systems Committee and also served on the Audit Committee of Symmetry.
