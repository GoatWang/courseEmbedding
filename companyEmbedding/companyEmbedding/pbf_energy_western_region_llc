PBF Energy (“PBF”) is one of the largest independent petroleum refiners and suppliers of unbranded transportation fuels, heating oil, petrochemical feedstocks, lubricants and other petroleum products in the United States. PBF currently owns and operates five domestic oil refineries and related assets with a combined processing capacity, known as throughput, of approximately 900,000 bpd, and a weighted average Nelson Complexity Index of 12.2.
PBF Energy’s refineries are located in California, Delaware, Louisiana, New Jersey and Ohio. Our newest refinery is located in Torrance, California processes a blend of primarily heavy and medium crudes to produce a high-value product slate.  The Torrance refinery has a nameplate crude capacity of 155,000 barrels per day and is PBF’s most complex refinery with a Nelson Complexity index of 14.9.  The Chalmette refinery was acquired by PBF Energy in 2015 and is located just outside of New Orleans, Louisiana. Chalmette is a 189,000 barrel per day, dual-train coking refinery with a Nelson Complexity of 12.7 and is capable of processing both light and heavy crude oil. The facility is strategically positioned on the Gulf Coast with strong logistics connectivity that offers flexible raw material sourcing and product distribution opportunities, including the potential to export products.  Our East Coast refineries, at Delaware City and Paulsboro, have a combined refining capacity of 370,000 bpd and Nelson Complexity Indices of 11.3 and 13.2, respectively. These high-conversion refineries process primarily medium and heavy, sour crudes and have historically received the bulk of their feedstock via ships and barges on the Delaware River but have the capability to receive crude shipments via rail into crude rail unloading facilities at our Delaware City refinery.  Our Midcontinent refinery, at Toledo, processes light, sweet crude, has a throughput capacity of 170,000 bpd and a Nelson Complexity Index of 9.2. The majority of Toledo’s WTI-based crude is delivered via pipelines that originate in both Canada and the United States. Since our acquisition of Toledo in 2011, we have added additional truck and rail crude unloading capabilities that provide feedstock sourcing flexibility for the refinery and enables Toledo to run a more cost-advantaged crude slate.
PBF Energy also owns 49.5% of PBF Logistics LP (NYSE: PBFX). PBF Logistics LP, headquartered in Parsippany, New Jersey, is a fee-based, growth-oriented master limited partnership formed by PBF Energy to own or lease, operate, develop and acquire crude oil and refined petroleum products, terminals, pipelines, storage facilities and similar logistics assets.

The buyer of ExxonMobil’s Torrance refinery is a little-known company that has existed only seven years but will become the nation’s fifth largest independent refiner once the deal is consummated next year.The Torrance refinery will be PBF Energy’s fifth nationwide and first on the West Coast.It’s the company’s second acquisition of a former ExxonMobil refinery; PBF announced earlier this year it was buying a refinery in Chalmette, La., that is a joint venture between ExxonMobil and the Venezuelan national oil company.



That purchase is expected to be completed in November.“The Torrance refinery acquisition is another significant step in the continued growth of PBF Energy,” CEO Tom Nimbley said. “Coupled with the previously announced Chalmette acquisition, we will have increased our refining capacity by over 60 percent and added meaningful Gulf and West Coast assets to our refining system.“We are excited to be adding a refinery with Torrance’s complexity and we look forward to entering the West Coast market,” he added.



PBF was formed in 2008 as a private equity investment backed by hedge fund Blackstone, said co-founder Jeffrey Dill, who will become president of newly formed subsidiary PBF Energy Western Region LLC, which will hold and manage the company’s new Torrance assets.The company made its first acquisition in 2010, acquiring an abandoned Delaware refinery from Valero. It began operating in 2011 and employs 600 workers, Dill said.The company also bought two other refineries in New Jersey and Toledo, Ohio.



Today it has about 1,800 employees.In 2012, the company completed an initial public offering; its shares and that of an affiliated public company, PBF Logistics, are traded on the New York Stock Exchange.“We are a Fortune 200 company,” Dill said. “Once we complete the Torrance acquisition, we will have about the same refining capacity as Tesoro. It’s almost 900,000 barrels a day.”

PBF Energy

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

PBF Energy (NYSE: PBF) is a petroleum refiner and supplier of unbranded transportation fuels, heating oils, lubricants, petrochemical feedstocks, and other petroleum products founded in 2008 with headquarters in Parsippany, New Jersey. The company's refineries include facilities in Chalmette, Louisiana, Toledo, Ohio, Port of Paulsboro in Gibbstown, New Jersey, the Delaware City Refinery in Delaware City, and the former ExxonMobil refinery in Torrance, California. PBF produces a range of products including gasoline, ultra-low-sulfur diesel (ULSD), heating oil, jet fuel, lubricants, petrochemicals and asphalt.[1][2][3]
PBF was formed in 2008 as a joint venture by Petroplus Holdings and the private equity companies Blackstone Group and First Reserve, each committing $667 million in equity.[4] In September 2010 Petroplus announced plans to sell its 32.62 percent stake to its partners for $91 million as PBF acquired the Paulsboro refinery from Valero Energy.[5][6] PBF then acquired the Toledo refinery from Sunoco in December 2010 for approximately $400 million.[7] PBF went public in December 2012 with a $533 million initial public offering.[8]
In 2015 PBF acquired the 189,000 BPD Chalmette, Louisiana refinery from ExxonMobil and its partner, the state-owned Petroleos de Venezuela, for $322 million, in a deal that included interests in chemical facilities, pipelines and other assets at the site located just ten minutes from downtown New Orleans.[9]
In July 2016, PBF acquired the 155,000 BPD ExxonMobil refinery in Torrance, California for $537.5M. The acquisition included ownership interests in several crude gathering and transportation pipelines, product pipelines, products terminals and crude and products storage facilities, and increased PBF's total throughput capacity to approximately 900,000 barrels per day, making it the fourth largest independent refiner in North America.[10]
PBF's refineries in Paulsboro (NJ) and Delaware City (DE) have been cited by environmentalists for processing crude oil from the Amazon River Basin in South America. In 2015, the Delaware City refinery was processing more than 3,300 barrels per day of crude originating in the Amazon.[11] Medical acronyms 1. PBF= Peripheral blood film
