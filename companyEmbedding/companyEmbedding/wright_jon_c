(ChurchMilitant.com) -Bishop Thomas Paprocki, head of the diocese of Springfield, Illinois, is calling out the gay lobby in the Church.In a decree dated June 12, 2017, and titled, “Decree Regarding Same-sex ‘Marriage’ and Related Pastoral Issues,” Paprocki declared that clergy or representatives of the diocese cannot bless so-called same-sex unions or provide church facilities or objects for events connected to gay weddings. He further asserted that people in same-sex sexual relationships cannot present themselves for Holy Communion, serve any ministerial role in a parish, and if they die unrepentant, they cannot have Catholic funerals.…In his July 9 letter, Paprocki noted, “The fact that there would be such an outcry against this decree is quite astounding and shows how strong the LGBT lobby is both in the secular world, as well as within the church.” … He finishes his letter by affirming, “The truths of the Faith revealed by Our Lord in Scripture and Tradition are not always easy to accept, especially in a world that seeks to make all truth subjective. The fact is that some truths are objective and unalterable.” Read the remainder of this entry » Be the first to comment  Filed in Only Posting a Link         Leftist SJWs Suppress Women Posted July 24, 2017 By John C WrightLauren Southern was banned from Patreon.I regret that I am using a service that has been corrupted by political correctness.

Be the first to comment  Filed in Announcement         More from Publius: On Tories Posted July 24, 2017 By John C WrightAnother short column from Publius:We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.  These words are the birth cry, the first breath, of America. Everything before this was rendered null and void by the Revolution. Everything after rests on this concept.America is the only country in history that is defined by ideals instead of by race or tribe. This nation is under attack. It needs our devotion and support.If you reject the idea of all men being created equal before God and wish to support an English country, you are not an American.You are a Tory.This might be the time for you to return across the Atlantic and support your homeland of England. Looks like they may need your help.Just ask George Clooney.

If no spiritual truth exists, then only secular truth is true, and only science can settle it. Unfortunately, real science by definition is neutral and silent on social and philosophical issues, so the Devil’s Advocate can only advocate Junk Science, which is deadly.The third (here) is that science has settled all issues, and no more debate is allowed, no curiosity, no thought.A final deception follows from the first three:For the Left, all thought is thought-crime. Thought must be abolished.

The passage is from his book Out of Ashes:The colleges are thus committed to a moral inversion. High and noble virtues, especially those that require moral courage, are mocked: gallantry in wartime, sexual purity, scrupulous honesty and plain dealing, piety, and the willingness to subject your thoughts, experiences, and most treasured beliefs to the searching scrutiny of reason. What is valued then? Debauchery, perversion, contempt for your supposedly benighted ancestors, lazy agnosticism, easy and costless pacifism, political maneuvering, and an enforcement of a new orthodoxy that in denying rational analysis seeks to render itself immune to criticism. You sink yourself in debt to discover that your sons and daughters have been severed from their faith, their morals, and their reason. Whorehouses and mental wards would be much cheaper. They might well be healthier, too. Read the remainder of this entry » Be the first to comment  Filed in Only Posting a Link         Nowhither Now Here! As an ASTOUNDING FRONTIER!

Any Christians or Jews in the audience, or anyone who knows a Christian or a Jews, is invited to answer.Some Christians or Jews think that the passage in Genesis where God gives Noah permission to eat meat implies that those who lived before the flood were or should have been vegetarians.Others think that those who lived before the flood were not forbidden to eat meat, and also not forbidden to eat animal living or drank their blood, but that the practice of eating live animals or of drinking blood was explicitly forbidden after Noah, and the eating of meat explicitly allowed.For the purposes of this poll, I am lumping those who think antediluvians could not eat meat (were biologically incapable of it) and those who think antediluvians could eat meat but were forbidden by God to do so, as one and the same.My question is this: how many Christians do you know who believe that the antediluvians were or should have been vegetarians? All? Most? Few? None?Is this a majority, mainstream, widespread Christian belief, or is it an minority, rare, not-widespread Christian belief?Let me emphasize that I am not asking you to argue for or against either proposition. This is a poll, not a theology quiz. Please, please do not tell me your opinion on which interpretation of Genesis you think is correct. I do not care about that.I am trying to find out whether either interpretation is widespread or not widespread among Christians and Jews. I am NOT trying to find out whether the belief that antediluvian men were or were not vegetarians is or is not the correct interpretation of Genesis.
