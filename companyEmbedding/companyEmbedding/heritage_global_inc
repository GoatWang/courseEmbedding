Determining Value






  





Our valuations are developed using a wide variety of data points including an extensive proprietary database of historical sales and valuations, first-hand knowledge of the market, and relationships with original equipment manufacturers and dealers of industrial assets. As part of the appraisal process, HGP personnel analyze the economic and competitive environment, including the industry in which the Company operates, to assess current and anticipated trends for the equipment and/or inventory.  Furthermore, HGP Valuation utilizes a team approach so that the asset disposition experience of all HGP personnel is utilized to determine asset values based on recent liquidations of similar asset classes. As a result, our clients are assured an accurate and reliable appraisal.  Reliable appraisals enable our customers to make timely strategic decisions.










Depending on the intended use of the appraisal report, HGP’s valuations are generally performed utilizing the following value definitions:
• Replacement Cost – New or Used
• Fair Market Value – Installed or Removed
• Gross and Net Orderly Liquidation Value – Installed or Removed
• Gross and Net Forced Liquidation (Auction) Value






  








  





Customer First Policy
Our valuation staff will collaborate with you to determine which report is best suited for your requirements, whether it be a full detailed appraisal or a desktop appraisal. Fees for valuations are quoted based on the scope of each assignment. Factors include the type of asset, number of locations to inspect/appraise size of the facilities, and information systems (if an inventory appraisal required).   HGP is dedicated to fair pricing and accurate and timely delivery of all of its appraisals. We strive to understand our clients’ specific needs and create a product tailored to those needs. Customer support is provided throughout the appraisal processes as communication is critical to each assignment before, during and after our findings are issued. The Customer Always Come First at HGP Valuations.










Professional Affiliations
Our staff members are active within the American Society of Appraisers (ASA), Association of Machinery & Equipment Appraisers (AMEA), Commercial Finance Association (CFA), Turnaround Management Association (TMA), Association for Corporate Growth (ACG), and Machinery Dealers National Association (MDNA).
