Dear Reader,
 
I founded Avondale in 2011 because I couldn’t find the right home to pursue my passion for investing. I loved the craft of investing and wanted to dedicate my professional life to learning how to be the best investor I possibly could, but I knew that this type of thinking has little place in the investment industry as it stands today.
At Avondale, we think long term, care about our clients and are driven by a basic desire to never stop learning. These couldn’t be further from the values of Wall Street. On Wall Street greed, hubris and reckless self-interest reign supreme. And so I knew that if I wanted a home to pursue my passion in the right way, I would have to build it, which is why I created Avondale.
Our mission is to be the investment industry’s answer to the organic food movement. Financial markets are like grocery stores and the shelves have been stocked by Wall Street. Wall Street’s products are sugary, fatty and bad for your long term financial health.
We’re not the first to realize that Wall Street is producing junk food. Over the last decade many individuals have adopted index funds as a low cost way to avoid many of Wall Street’s tricks. But we think that this is the equivalent of saying “rather than try to figure out what’s healthy, I’m just going to buy the whole store.” That’s not a great approach when the store is filled with junk.
At Avondale, we take a different approach. We have trained ourselves to identify only the best organic ingredients and prepare a farm-to-table investment meal that is not only good for you but tastes good too.
We embrace the fact that doing this in the right way takes hard work. It takes developing a truly unique supply chain, interviewing farmers and learning about how they produce their crops. It takes building processes and relationships that are completely off the beaten path. It takes being open minded about new methods and embracing old ones. Above all, it takes a relentless commitment to doing what’s best for the customer.
We view investing as a fundamentally human pursuit. We’re not about algorithms, derivatives or Sharpe ratios. We are about building long term relationships. We want to fundamentally change the way that the investment industry conducts business, and we are always looking for partners who share our mission. Whether you are an individual, advisor or professional investor, if this letter makes sense to you then we are interested in hearing from you. Welcome home.
 
Sincerely,
Scott Krisiloff, CFA
CEO

Wealth & Asset Management / Avondale Advisors


Welcome to Avondale Advisors
 
Independent / Credible
Avondale Advisors, LLC., an Investment Counsel firm, offers financial advisory and portfolio management services to individuals seeking capital preservation and long-term growth in quality investments. Originally founded in 1985 as The Steine & Gooch and acquired by Nashville-based Avondale Group in 2016, the company is a registered investment advisor with the state of Tennessee. Based in Nashville, Tennessee, the fee-only investment advisory firm serves as financial advisor primarily to clients who reside in Middle Tennessee. However, the firm also serves as money manager to clients in 15 other states.
Strategic / Personal
The firm takes an individualized and personalized approach to each client based on the client’s own needs and desires. So, each client’s portfolio is unique rather than a boiler plate copy of a fund designed to meet a theoretical investment objective. The firm provides individually tailored investment advisory services to achieve success in an investment climate marked by increasing variety, complexity and flexibility. This environment makes independent, unbiased advice more important–and more productive–than ever before.
David Gooch and David Steine, Jr., Managing Directors of Avondale Advisors, work closely with each client to understand his or her needs and objectives for employing an effective strategy to meet those objectives over time.
Our Services
 
Straightforward / Responsible
Portfolio management by Avondale Advisors is aimed specifically at individuals seeking responsive, personal attention regarding their investments. In consultation with the client, the principals of the firm set guidelines by which to manage and monitor the client’s funds. The firm maintains a regular schedule of communication with the client in order to meet the specified objectives. The fee for the portfolio management services is based on the market value of the managed assets.
When managing a client’s portfolio, Avondale Advisors instructs an unaffiliated brokerage firm to buy and sell securities for the account. A third-party custodian, usually a brokerage firm or bank trust department, holds the assets for the client. As an independent advisor, Avondale Advisors uses its established relationships with brokers and banks to negotiate discounted commissions and administrative support on its clients’ behalf.
For every trade, the client receives confirmation from both the broker and Avondale Advisors. Monthly statements are sent from the custodian, supplemented by a quarterly review of the account’s performance from Avondale. This performance is compared to appropriate benchmarks and presented in graph form for quick and easy reference. Additionally, the company’s Managing Directors meet with each client routinely for account review, and at tax time, provide the necessary account information to the tax preparer.
Aligned to Prosper / Value Driven
A fee-only investment advisor, Avondale Advisors sells no financial products and receives no commissions. The market value of the assets under management determines the fee, which is charged as a percentage of the client’s total fund value. Consequently, the company’s well being is linked to the success of the client’s portfolio. Moreover, the client benefits because the fee percentage decreases as the fund value grows.
The company’s Managing Directors, David Steine, Jr. and David Gooch, work closely with each client to establish investment goals based on personal needs and objectives, in balance with risk preferences and tax consequences. Assets are then allocated among stocks, bonds and mutual funds. Unlike the approach of managers who distribute client funds among pre-selected securities, Avondale Advisors seeks specific securities and funds appropriate to the individual client’s objectives.

The principals’ broad knowledge of financial strategy and extensive contacts can be tapped for other financial needs such as mortgage loan and personal credit line negotiation and placement.

Our Horsepower







Niche Markets. Untapped Opportunities.


Who We Are
What happens when a real estate investment firm decides to step out of Canada's hotter urban markets in favor of buying assets in smaller urban centres and towns scattered around the prairies? 
A new way of investing in real estate is born.
Avondale Real Estate Capital Income Trust is a different kind of real estate investment company. We are small, we are agile, we are well-schooled in finance and real estate analytics, and we jump on opportunities that bigger firms often simply do not see. 
Our big claim to fame is small municipalities. We seek out multi-family and commercial investment properties in markets across the prairies - assets that are typically underperforming and often in need of improvement, but hold incredible potential in terms of the income they could generate under the right business model. 
The business model that we employ is time tested and proven successful. Developed in part over 10-years time by our sister company, Avenue Living, an integral part of the Avondale approach to real estate is built on the same model that made Avenue one of the fastest growing and highly profitable real estate investment and management companies in the country. 

 



Our Proven Investment Strategy



We acquire underperforming and undervalued multifamily properties in areas where we have an established property management infrastructure in place. This allows us to quickly revitalize these assets into upgraded, well managed properties that drive capital gains for investors.




We balance our portfolio by also investing in well managed commercial, retail, or industrial assets, which provide predictable cash flows.


Our strength lies in this balance between capital growth opportunities and stable cash flow.






We believe in the future of the Prairie Provinces



We believe in investments based on sound math & analytics



We believe in making smart decisions that yield proven results







All successful investment strategies come down to one thing: the math just works



theory in practice
Avondale capitalizes on the proven business model of Avenue Living - a company founded on mathematical principles that led it to acquire and successfully manage an $800 million portfolio of over 6,000 rental units in markets across Western Canada. 
Avondale offers the unique opportunity to invest in a fund that pursues the kind of assets that are proven to produce strong yields within a short period of time, in markets that are typically difficult for investors to reach. The infrastructure to invest in these markets is already in place, courtesy of Avenue Living, which also provides a decade of experience and knowledge in real estate management.
Through extensive market research and analysis, Avondale selects assets that allow investors to diversify their portfolios in niche areas at value prices, and generate higher returns on investment compared to similar assets in large, more competitive, and more expensive markets.
Learn more about investing with Avondale

 



The Avondale Difference
Avondale maximizes returns and diversification by targeting markets that most investors don't. Within these markets, we capitalize on underperforming properties by buying the right asset at the right price.
Avondale's principals utilize decades of experience, industry relationships, and a sizeable financial base to source acquisition opportunities and the optimal capital structures to support them.
Through our association with Avenue Living, Avondale has access to a full-time property management team of more than 220 people. These local managers oversee operations for each asset across all our markets, thus providing a built-in infrastructure advantage to ensure our entire portfolio is properly maintained and managed.
Avondale is a stable and growing firm that holds approximately $60 million in asset acquisitions under contract, including 328 multi-residential units and 335,000 square feet of commercial real estate. We hold strong lease agreements with corporations such as Alberta Health Services, Sportchek, Scotiabank and Loblaws.

Wealth & Asset Management / Retirement Plans


When it comes to managing corporate retirement plans, it’s about more than just products. Our goal is to deliver successful plan experiences. We assume the role of co-fiduciary, joining our clients at the table and offering independent, unbiased advice in the best interest of participants, trustees and the plan sponsor.
Due to a dizzying array of new regulations, the defined contribution market is more challenging than ever, and our experts can help you make sense of these complexities. Often, simple changes can be most effective in helping your employees get the most from your plan structure. This not only delivers a valuable financial benefit, but it also serves as a way to attract and retain top talent to your organization.
Defined Contribution Plans — Avondale offers tools to meet the needs of both fiduciaries and their plan participants. Our core consulting services include:


Plan design optimization and compliance
Plan vendor search and RFP management
Investment policy statement design
Investment manager / fund search and evaluation
Investment menu design
QDIA evaluation and selection
Performance monitoring and reporting
Plan design, fee and participant success benchmarking
Plan cost analysis and fee disclosure
Communication and education for plan participants and sponsors
Conversion and transition management


Defined Benefit Plans — We begin with a thorough analysis of all aspects of the current plan — investment policy statement, asset allocation, investment managers, fees, etc. Then we recommend and implement options for ongoing plan evaluation and monitoring, which may include:


Asset allocation study
Review of current investment managers
Replacing/recruiting investment managers
Ongoing monitoring of investment managers
Liability directed investment studies
Plan termination options
Vendor search and selection RFP’s


Learn more about Avondale’s approach to serving clients in the retirement plan market in this video interview or read about it here.

                            The ABC Fundraising® Candle Fundraiser offers Up To an amazing 70% Profit with No Money Up Front! 


                            If you are thinking about doing a Candle Fundraiser, you've come to the right place.

                            A candle fundraiser can be a great way to raise money fast and easy. Most people like the warmth and personal style that candles add to their homes. People often go out and buy candles to add scent, color or decoration to their homes so why not offer them the opportunity to buy something they already want and support your group? A candle fundraiser can also be an excellent opportunity for your supporters to stock up on gifts for their friends and family. Candles make outstanding gifts to have on hand as prizes for baby showers, bridal showers, for secret santa gifts, or when you just want to give a little something to brighten someone's day. Remind your supporters of their gift giving needs both during the holiday season and throughout the year. ABC Fundraising® offers beautiful and superior candles with extra long burn times for your candle fundraiser. They are made in the U.S.A. which is something you can be proud of. ABC Fundraising's candles have 100% lead-free wicks and are made of 100% food grade wax. There is also a nice variety of size, color, scent, shape and price point so that your friends and family have a lot of options when they support your Candle Fundraiser.

 Discount Card Fundraiser: The ABC Fundraising® Discount Card!
          The Discount Card Fundraiser from ABC Fundraising®, offers up to 93% Profit! 

Groups are in more need of fundraising than ever before. Easy fundraising ideas for your group are so important for raising the necessary money for uniforms, travel, supplies and more. With everyone watching their spending, choosing the right fundraiser for your group is crucial. What are the best fundraisers for these economic times? What are some easy fundraising ideas that will raise the most money for your group with the least amount of work?

          One of the best and easiest fundraising ideas we've come across, is the discount card fundraiser. Discount Card Fundraising is a great way for your group to offer a very valuable product to your friends, family and supporters. The Discount Card allows them to save money over and over for 1 full year at local shops in your area.  Rather than purchasing products that they may not need, your friends, family and neighbors can help your group raise a lot of money by purchasing a discount card that can be used at local merchants in your area. Discount card fundraisers are excellent ways for merchants, restaurants and stores in your community to support your group and in turn for the community members to support those businesses that support YOU.

Here's How it Works: 

          Each member of your group sells the discount cards to their neighbors, friends and family for a nominal fee. ABC Fundraising® has discount cards that sell for $10, $15, or $20 and with our Profit Booster Program you can earn up to 90% Profit. 

          You can sell your discount cards at local events, at supermarkets or farmer's markets. Your group makes money and the buyers of the discount card fundraiser SAVE money. The more discount fundraising cards your members sell, the more profit your group makes.

Discount card fundraising is definitely the best fundraiser for groups with 30 members or more. You must sell a minimum of 300 discount cards so with 30 member that comes to 10 discount fundraising cards each. If your fundraising group only has 10-20 members you should definitely consider if dicount card fundraising is the best choice for you. It may be better to try The Scratch and Help fundraiser or perhaps our cookie dough fundraiser. 

A discount card fundraiser is now easier than ever for your group. One great way to take the challenge out of the discount card fundraiser for your group is to order from a company that does the work for you. Abc Fundraising® has created a way to make the discount card fundraiser absolutely turnkey for your group. Instead of you calling the local businesses and visiting restaurants to try to obtain sponsors for your discount fundraising card, Abc Fundraising® will obtain the sponsors for you.

          All you need to do is fill out our Local Merchant Wish List that contains local businesses that you would like to see on your discount card and then wait for your personalized and localized discount fundraising cards to arrive.

Discount cards are such an easy sell - who doesn't want to save money on food, dry cleaning, coffee, working out, home goods and more? The possibilities with discount card fundraisers are truly endless.

          A great way to get your group motivated for your discount card fundraiser is to have group members be involved in brainstorming potential merchants to use for the discount fundraising cards. By being involved in the selection of the merchants, you can ensure that your group members will be more excited about the deals that are offered on your discount fundraising card. If they are excited, their supporters will be excited and your group will sell more cards and raise more money!

          It's important to note that when doing a discount card fundraiser, you want to get started as soon as possible as you have to anticipate a lead time of 4-6 weeks for your group to get personalized discount cards. 
          
          For more information and to get started right away with your discount card fundraiser simply Download The Flyer and fill out the Merchant Wish List. Next simply fax it back to Abc Fundraising®  and you will be well on your way to the most profitable Discount Card Fundraiser ever!

About the ABC Fundraising® Scratch & Help® Scratch Card Fundraiser:

  The ABC Fundraising® scratch card fundraiser is a unique new way to raise money for your group.  In fact, it's is as easy as A, B C! 
Simply order 1 scratch card per member of your group. Each scratch card has 50 scratch off circles with hidden donation amounts ranging from $0.50 to $3.00 Simply ask your donor to scratch 2 or more
circles and donate the uncovered amount. In return for this small donation you will hand out a sheet of coupons provided in the scratch card as a "thank you" for their small donation. The scratch card coupons are worth an average of $100.
Next you take your scratch card to another person (it's good to make a list of people to approach) and ask him or her to scratch off 2 circles and donate the uncovered amount. Repeat this process untill all the scratch off circles have been uncovered.
Once your scratch card has been completed it will raise $100. You keep $80 per scratch card. As a bonus ABC Fundraising® will throw in an extra 10% FREE cards bringing your potential profit to 90%!
Tips For A Successful Scratch Card Fundraiser

Groups that have been successful with scratch card fundraisers include, high school sports teams, high school band and choir programs, church youth groups, cheerleaders, youth football leagues like POP Warner Football and many other non-profit youth organizations. The success of
your scratch card fundraiser will depend on several factors including the age of your members and group leadership and motivation that is provided. Parent involvement can also be an important step to a successful scratch card fundraiser. If possible
it is a good idea to give the parents of the participants a few days to bring their scratch card to work with them. We have found that some parents can easily help their child complete a scratch card when they bring it to workdfor a say or 2. If parent invlovement
is not an option than it will be very important to have each member of your group write down 50 names of people they plan to approach with their scratch card. If they can get just half of these people to scratch & donate, then you will have a very successful scratch card fundraiser!

Check out what recent Fund Raisers are saying about our Fund Raising Ideas 


"The easiest scratch card fundraiser we've ever done! With 40
  kids fund raising, our school raised $3,200 in just 2 weeks. The fund raiser was easier than selling candy or
  chocolate bars and people love the coupons. I'll be ordering more scratch cards
  next year. Thanks ABC FundRaising. You guys have the best fundraisers!"
Tim Lenderman -HEAD COACH HOLLYWOOD HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL

"Thank you for helping our baseball team. With the Scratch & Help 
  scratch card FundRaiser Program, our group of 40 kids raised $3,500 in less than 2 weeks. Amazing! I recommend
  any group that is considering school fundraisers to use Scratch & Help. With
  coupons like Pizza Hut, Church's Chicken, Subway, and Sonic Burger, just
  to name a few, people were more than happy to donate a few dollars to our school fund raising efforts!"
Eric Landry -WEST VALLEY YOUTH BASEBALL

"With your Church fund raisers, our Summer Youth Program raised over $2,000
  with 25 kids and we were able to build a new basketball court on our
  property. We looked into many Church Fund Raising Ideas and found that year after year your 
  fund raising programs have worked the best. Thanks ABC Fund raising.!"
    Jim Morgan - Youth Minister - FREMONT BAPTIST CHURCH

"Our high school band has over 200 members, and
  in past school fundraisers we've sold christmas trees, candy, magazine subscriptions,
  etc. With The Scratch & Help Fund Raiser, our kids were able to raise over $15,000 in
  less than 2 weeks. Not only did the kids tell me that it was easier than
  our past fundraisers, but we raised as much as all the others combined. We
  raised over $2,000 in free fund raising booklets alone. Thanks ABC Fundraising! We'll be using your school fundraisers again next year!."
Jason Barnes -KENNEDY HIGH SCHOOL BAND DIRECTOR

"I contacted ABC Fundraising in the hopes of
  raising money for new uniforms for our team. Not only did we raise enough
  for the shirts, but we were also able to replace our net and throw a huge
  party for the kids. A fund raiser consultant suggested that we customize our coupons in order
  to have a more successful fund raiser. We took your advice and our local car wash,
  sporting goods store, and donut shop were pleased to participate in the soccer fund raiser in return
  for the free advertisement from the fundraiser."
Greg Davis -OAKRIDGE YOUTH SOCCER ASSOC.

 
"We would like to thank ABC Fundraising for our most profitable Church Fundraising 
  endeavor to date. We used The Scratch & Help scratch card Fundraiser to raise over $4000 this year. We plan
  on using the money for some renovations to our stage. I would also like to personally thank Robin, 
  our Fundraising coordinator, for her help with our Church Fund Raiser. We plan on getting in touch with you
  again next year for our Spring Fundraising Project."
Yolanda Simmons - Fulton-Hempstead Church Choir.

" This years fund raiser was better than our previous 2 years combined. We tried a magazine
  fund raiser last year and a candy fund raiser the year before. The Scratch & Help Fund Raising program was much easier
  to run. Since we had over 100 fundraisers this year the inventory control would have been crazy with a candy fund raiser.
  We raised $7500, with the Scratch and Help Fund Raiser. It really is an easy fund raiser. I am recommending this fund raiser
  to my son's soccer coach for their soccer fund raiser this fall."
Joe Arnelli- MADISON ELEMENTARY SCHOOL


*The testimonials above represent fundraisers that went extremely well. Your results may differ. ABC Fundraisaing� makes no guarantee that you will have the success that the groups above had. Many factors go into having a successful fundraiser including experience, sales abilty, group leadership, demographics and the amount of time you have to run your fundraiser. We suggest starting with only 1 Scratch & Help� card per group member

Tips for a successful cookie dough fundraiser



Planning your cookie dough fundraiser carefully is very important to a profitable and stress free cookie dough fundraising event. One of the first things to remember is that you will need a place to store your cookie dough when it arrives. Why not utilize this space to make your cookie dough fundraiser have extra streams of income. Read more to find out how!



One great option is to find a large kitchen, either a church, at a school, or a local business that donates the use of their kitchen and have a cookie-making event! This way when your cookie dough arrives everyone will be excited to bake cookies. All of the members will have fun baking together and have pride of ownership in the scrumptious cookies they produce.  Another great idea to make even more money from your cookie dough fundraiser is to have a bake sale or set up several bake sales at local events such as basketball games, a church bazaar, parties or even a corporate event in your community. 





Another option is to have each member of your group or team bake cookies at home and then the group can sell the different treats in a bake sale. Try setting up at a store or other well trafficked area to sell your cookies. Consider selling the cookies on creative trays or baskets to local businesses or corporations who want to extend the good cheer of the holiday season. Cookie fundraisers can be a great way to have fun, make money and to be creative. 



 With these extra tips you are sure to have a successful and profitable cookie dough fundraiser. 
To get started fundraising with cookie dough simply call ABC Fundraising� at 1-888-212-1344 to order your FREE Cookie Dough Order-Taking forms.
