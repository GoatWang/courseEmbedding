				Morningstar rated the Total Return Fund among 
N/A,
N/A,
N/A
and 
N/A
Intermediate-Term Bond
funds for the overall rating and the 3-, 5-, and 10-year periods (as applicable) 
ending 06/30/2017, respectively.


The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance 
figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The 
weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year 
rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating 
for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most 
weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is 
included in all three rating periods.
			

Performance Comparison
as of 
					
						06/30/2017
					
				







							This chart shows the value of a hypothetical $10,000 investment in the fund over the past 10 years or since its inception (for funds lacking 10-year records). The result is compared with benchmarks, which may include a broad-based market index and a peer group average or index. Market indexes do not include expenses, which are deducted from fund returns as well as mutual fund averages and indexes.
						
Benchmark Definitions



1 The Morningstar Rating for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, 
variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at 
least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for 
comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation 
in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent 
performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 
35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating 
for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, 
and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of 
total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% 
five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating 
formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest 
impact because it is included in all three rating periods.

Share price, principal value, yield and return will vary and you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.   
			



2 The 30-day dividend yield represents the average daily dividends for the 
30-day period, annualized and divided by the net asset values per share 
at the end of the period; it is available the first quarter after the 
fund's inception.  The SEC standardized yield is computed under an SEC 
standardized formula and reflects an estimated yield to maturity 
(assuming all portfolio securities are held to maturity); it is 
available the first month after the fund's inception.  
			

3
					
					Average annual total return figures include changes in principal value, reinvested dividends, and capital gain distributions. 
For funds less than one year old, the Since Inception return figure is not annualized and represents an aggregate total return.
				

^ The gross expense ratio reflects the fund expenses as stated in the fee table of the fund's 
prospectus prior to the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement. 
The net expense ratio reflects fund expenses after the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement.
If a fund has an active contractual expense ratio limitation, the expiration date is shown below the gross and net
expense ratio values above.  Expense ratios are as of the most recent prospectus.

Many of our mutual funds earn Morningstar’s highest ratings
Morningstar 4- and 5-Star Rated Funds







Because of our disciplined approach to investing, Morningstar, a leader in independent investment research, recognizes many of our mutual funds with its highest ratings in the funds' respective categories.

Over 70 of our funds have earned 4- or 5-star Overall Morningstar Ratings as of 6/30/17.*

Morningstar uses a 5-star system to rate mutual funds based on their risk-adjusted returns. Five stars is the highest while one star is the lowest rating. Only the top 32.5% of all funds (of the 32.5%, 10% get 5 stars and 22.5% get 4 stars) are awarded Morningstar's 4- or 5-star rating. By comparison, as of 6/30/17, 72 of 108 of our rated funds (Investor Class only) received an overall rating of 5 or 4 stars.​ Past performance cannot guarantee future results.

All mutual funds are subject to market risk, including possible loss of principal.
*Morningstar gives its best ratings of 5 or 4 stars to the top 32.5% of all funds (of the 32.5%, 10% get 5 stars and 22.5% get 4 stars) based on their risk-adjusted returns. The Overall Morningstar Rating™ is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with a fund's 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating™ metrics. As of 6/30/17, 72 of 108 of our rated funds (Investor class only) received an overall rating of 5 or 4 stars.
The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star.

**This chart displays relative risk of each U.S. mutual fund listed using standard deviation of returns. Those values are provided in the bars at the top of the chart.
Methodology: We evaluate the standard deviation and its resulting placement within a specific risk/return category on an annual basis. A fund is generally placed in a risk/return category based on the 10-year standard deviation of its performance. If a fund is less than 10 years old, the actual fund performance history is supplemented with the primary prospectus benchmark history to obtain a full 10-year history, or longest time period available up to 10 years. For an Asset Allocation fund with less than 10 years of performance history, sub-strategy returns are used. When a sub-strategy is less than 10 years old, the actual sub-strategy performance history is supplemented with benchmark history to obtain a full 10-year history, or longest time period available up to 10 years.
Risk return categories overlap; a fund with a standard deviation in the overlap between two categories, denoted by a plus (+), is placed so that its risk categorization is better aligned with anticipated return characteristics an investor may experience going forward at the discretion of T Rowe Price.
When a fund has a cash-like benchmark, denoted by a double plus (++), its standard deviation is estimated using only available fund returns. If the fund is less than 10 years old, benchmark returns are not used to obtain a full 10-year history because they would artificially suppress the volatility estimate.
All investments are subject to market risk, including the possible loss of principal. Standard deviation of returns, a measure of price volatility, is one measure of risk. Please consult the funds’ prospectuses for a more complete discussion of the funds’ risks.

*157 of our 332 mutual funds had a 10-year track record as of 6/30/17 (includes all share classes and excludes funds used in insurance products). 134 of these 157 (85%) funds beat their Lipper averages for the 10-year period. 215 of 317 (68%), 183 of 225 (81%), 149 of 180 (83%), of T.

36 of our 39 Retirement Funds had a 10-year track record as of 6/30/17 (includes all share classes). 34 of these 36 funds beat their Lipper averages for the 10-year period. 38 of 39, 38 of 39, and 35 of 36 of the Retirement Funds outperformed their Lipper average for the 1-, 3-, and 5-year periods ended 6/30/17, respectively. Calculations are based on cumulative total return. Not all funds outperformed for all periods. (Source for data: Lipper Inc.)
Source: Lipper Inc. 162 of 213 funds (excluding institutional and bank institutional funds as defined by Lipper) more than 6 months old had expense ratios below their Lipper averages based on fiscal year-end data available as of 6/30/17.
The principal value of the Retirement Funds is not guaranteed at any time, including at or after the target date, which is the approximate year an investor plans to retire (assumed to be age 65) and likely stop making new investments in the fund. If an investor plans to retire significantly earlier or later than age 65, the funds may not be an appropriate investment even if the investor is retiring on or near the target date. The funds’ allocations among a broad range of underlying T. Rowe Price stock and bond funds will change over time. The funds emphasize potential capital appreciation during the early phases of retirement asset accumulation, balance the need for appreciation with the need for income as retirement approaches, and focus on supporting an income stream over a long-term postretirement withdrawal horizon. The funds are not designed for a lump-sum redemption at the target date and do not guarantee a particular level of income. The funds maintain a substantial allocation to equities both prior to and after the target date, which can result in greater volatility over shorter time horizons.

Strategy & Benefits

Principal Investment Strategy
The investment strategy of the Direxion Indexed Commodity Strategy Fund includes:

A quantitative, strategic index-based approach to commodity investing
Exposure to 12 commodities that can individually be long or flat (if a short signal is triggered the position is moved to cash)
The ability to make position changes intra-month based on trends
Monthly rebalance based on risk reduction where the allocation of individual components is reduced if volatility exceeds certain predetermined risk levels
A “smart” contract roll approach1

1 Smart Contract Roll Approach – A futures contract roll approach designed to select cost effective futures contracts to roll into upon expiration of current contract.
Why Invest in the Fund?

The long/flat approach provides exposure to commodities that can individually be positioned long or flat (in cash) based upon price trends
Seeks to mitigate the downside risk and maximum declines relative to notable long-only commodity indices
Has the flexibility to make individual commodity position changes intra-month
Risk management controls designed to adjust exposure levels if volatility gets too high
Low- or non-correlation to stocks and bonds
Disciplined, quantitative, rules-based approach to commodity investing




Why Commodities?

Not just commodities – Long/Flat commodities.
Most traditional commodity funds provide long only exposure to commodities. This limits their potential to contribute to a portfolio’s long-term performance because they only benefit if commodity prices rise.
The Direxion Indexed Commodity Strategy Fund seeks to match the performance of the Auspice Broad Commodity ER Index (ABCERI), which provides exposure to 12 commodities that can individually be positioned long or flat (in cash) based upon price trends.
This long/flat index is potentially more adaptive to volatile commodity markets because it seeks to take advantage of individual commodities by going long when prices rise, and mitigate risk by going flat (to cash) when prices fall.
Why consider long/flat commodities?
Most traditional commodity funds can only benefit if commodity prices rise. However, these long-only commodity strategies have shown to be inconsistent over time because:

Commodity returns are typically cyclical and sporadic
Individual commodity sub-sectors tend to perform dissimilarly in different market environments
Significant draw-downs can be damaging to the long-term performance of a portfolio

Within the inherently volatile commodity markets, a long/flat approach is potentially more adaptive to whip-sawing market conditions.

Target Index

The Auspice Broad Commodity ER Index aims to capture upward trends in the commodity markets while minimizing risk during downward trends. The index uses a quantitative methodology to track either long or flat positions in a diversified portfolio of 12 commodity futures covering energy, metals, and agriculture. The index incorporates dynamic risk management and contract rolling methods.

The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. For the most recent month-end performance please visit the funds website at direxioninvestments.com.
Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus.

  Addressing The Top Misconceptions About Alternative Investments    


Alternative strategies have the potential to be a viable way for investors, whether institutional or retail, to reduce risk in their investment portfolios.


  Alternatives? Too Many, or Not Enough?    


The key to risk-adjusted returns and diversification is not the number of securities – it’s their correlation – or, really, non-correlation – to each other, that’s paramount.


  A Correlation Misconception    


Some clients confuse negative correlation with low (or non-) correlation. They mistakenly believe that returns for investments with low correlation move in opposite directions from each other.

					Objective
The Fund's investment objective is to  generate attractive total returns. The Fund seeks to outperform its benchmark, the Morningstar® Long/Short Commodity Index SM.
    





					Investment Strategy

The Fund invests directly in a diverse portfolio of exchange-traded commodity futures contracts that are among the most actively traded futures contracts in global commodity markets.  The Fund’s actively managed positions will be either long or short (or flat, in the case of futures within the energy sector).  The Fund is not leveraged, and the notional amount of its combined long, short and flat futures positions will not exceed 100% of the Fund’s net assets.
The Fund also employs a commodity option writing strategy, in which it sells exchange-traded calls or puts on commodity contracts.  The Fund sells these options on approximately 15% (and may not exceed 25%) of the notional value of each of its commodity futures contracts, seeking to enhance the Fund’s risk-adjusted return over time.






					Highlights
The Fund may be appropriate for investors seeking:

Attractive total return potential with reduced volatility relative to equity and commodity market benchmarks;
Regular monthly distributions; and
Opportunities to profit whether commodity markets move up or down.







						Fund Structure

						The Nuveen Long/Short Commodity Total Return Fund is an actively-managed, exchange-traded commodity pool. The Fund's shares represent units of fractional undivided beneficial interest in and ownership of the Fund. The Fund is not a mutual fund, a closed-end fund, or any other type of "investment company" within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, and is not subject to regulation thereunder.

Fund shares are not guaranteed or endorsed by any bank or other insured depository institution, and are not federally insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Shares of the Fund are subject to investment risks, including the possible loss of principal invested. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.


Risk Considerations
Shares of the Fund are subject to investment risks, including the possible loss of principal invested. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. The Fund invests primarily in commodity futures contracts and options on commodity futures contracts, which have a high degree of price variability and are subject to rapid and substantial price changes. The Fund could incur significant losses on its commodity investments. The Fund is not a mutual fund, closed-end fund, or any other type of “investment company” within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, and is not subject to regulation thereunder. There can be no assurance that the Fund’s options strategy will be successful. The Fund uses options on commodity futures contracts to enhance its risk-adjusted total returns. The Fund’s use of options, however, may not provide any, or only partial, protection for modest market declines. The return performance of the Fund’s commodity futures contracts may not parallel the performance of the commodities or indices that serve as the basis for the options it buys or sells; this basis risk may reduce the Fund’s overall returns. The Fund does not presently offer any new shares for sale; existing shares trade on the NYSE MKT. For a more complete description of risks, see the Fund’s webpage at: www.nuveen.com/CommodityInvestments

Reactive Event Driven InvestorsEvent-drivenNuveen Long/Short Commodity Total Return Fund Should Be RestructuredOverview:
This is the first article in a series about securities that trade at wide discounts to their intrinsic value, and where grassroots shareholder activism has the potential to rectify the situation and eliminate the discount.
The Nuveen Long/Short Commodity Total Return Fund (NYSEMKT:CTF) is a textbook example of an investment product that exists mainly to provide revenue to the investment manager while offering little or no benefit to the investor. The financial market clearly recognizes a dichotomy: CTF trades at the largest discount to its net asset value of any institutional-quality, publicly traded fund in the U.S. Nuveen's own website ranks CTF at number 574 out of a total of 576 funds in terms of discounts to...

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  This information should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes to financial statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this Quarterly Report (the "Report"). The discussion and analysis includes forward-looking statements that generally relate to future events or future performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as "may," "will," "should," "expect," "plan," "anticipate," "believe," "estimate," "predict," "potential" or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. These forward-looking statements are based on information currently available to Nuveen Commodities Asset Management, LLC ("NCAM" or the "Manager"), Gresham Investment Management LLC and its Near Term Active division (such division referred to herein as "Gresham" or the "Commodity Sub-adviser") and Nuveen Asset Management, LLC ("Nuveen Asset Management" or the "Collateral Sub-adviser") and are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors, both known and unknown, that could cause the actual results, performance, prospects or opportunities of the Nuveen Long/Short Commodity Total Return Fund (the "Fund") to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, these forward-looking statements.  You should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. Except as expressly required by the federal securities laws or otherwise, the Fund and the Manager undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements or the risks, uncertainties or other factors described in this Report, as a result of new information, future events or changed circumstances or for any other reason after the date of this Report.  Introduction  The Fund is a commodity pool which was organized as a Delaware statutory trust on May 25, 2011 and commenced operations on October 25, 2012, with its initial public offering. The shares of the Fund trade on the NYSE MKT under the ticker symbol "CTF". Prior to the initial public offering, the Fund was inactive except for matters relating to its organization and registration. The Fund's investment objective is to generate attractive total returns. The Fund is actively managed and seeks to outperform its benchmark, the Morningstar(R) Long/Short Commodity IndexSM (the "Index"). The Index tracks the historical total return performance of a diverse portfolio of commodity futures, which may be invested long, short or flat. The Index uses a momentum rule to determine if each commodity futures position is long, short or flat. In pursuing its investment objective, the Fund invests directly in a diverse portfolio of exchange-traded commodity futures contracts that represent the main commodity sectors and are among the most actively traded futures contracts in the global commodity markets, and also invests in commodity options contracts (the futures and options are sometimes referred to as the "commodity portfolio"). Individual commodity futures positions may be either long, short, or flat, depending upon market conditions. The Fund's options strategy seeks to produce option premiums for the purpose of enhancing the Fund's risk-adjusted total return over time. The Fund is unleveraged, and the Fund's commodity contract positions are fully collateralized with cash equivalents, and short-term, high grade debt securities.  Results of Operations  The Quarter Ended June 30, 2014 - Fund Share Price  The Fund's shares traded on the NYSE MKT at a price of $16.16 on the close of business on June 30, 2014. This represents a decrease of 2.30% in share price (not including an assumed reinvestment of distributions) from the $16.54 price at which the shares of the Fund traded on the close of business on March 31, 2014. The high and low intra-day share prices for the quarter were $16.72 (April 25, 2014) and $15.95 (June 13, 2014), respectively. During the quarter, the Fund declared distributions totaling $0.425 per share to shareholders, of which $0.135 was paid on July 1, 2014. The remainder was paid during the quarter. The Fund's cumulative total return on market value for the quarter, which assumes reinvestment of such distributions, was 0.27%. At June 30, 2014, shares of the Fund traded at a 14.95% discount to the Fund's net asset value of $19.00 per share. During the quarter the Fund repurchased 55,000 shares, refer to "Part II-Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds" in this Report for further details on the repurchase activity.  Table of Contents  The Quarter Ended June 30, 2013 - Fund Share Price  The Fund's shares traded on the NYSE MKT at a price of $19.87 on the close of business on June 28, 2013 (the last trading day of the quarter). This represents a decrease of 1.78% in share price (not including an assumed reinvestment of distributions) from the $20.23 price at which the shares of the Fund traded on the close of business on March 28, 2013 (the last trading day of the previous quarter). The high and low intra-day share prices for the quarter were $20.81 (April 3, 2013) and $17.75 (June 25, 2013), respectively. During the quarter, the Fund declared distributions totaling $0.465 per share to shareholders, of which $0.155 was paid on July 1, 2013. The remainder was paid during the quarter. The Fund's cumulative total return on market value for the quarter, which assumes reinvestment of such distributions, was 0.57%. At June 28, 2013 (the last trading day of the quarter), shares of the Fund traded at a 5.87% discount to the Fund's net asset value of $21.11 per share. During the quarter the Fund repurchased 9,450 shares.  The Quarter Ended June 30, 2014 - Net Assets of the Fund  The Fund's net assets decreased from $345.1 million at March 31, 2014, to $336.3 million at June 30, 2014, a decrease of $8.8 million. The decrease in the Fund's net assets was due to a net loss of $0.4 million, $7.5 million of distributions to shareholders, and $0.9 million of share repurchases.  The Fund generated a net loss of $0.4 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2014, resulting from interest income of $0.1 million and net realized gains of $4.9 million, offset by total expenses of $1.5 million and net unrealized depreciation of $3.9 million.  During the quarter ended June 30, 2014, the Fund's collateral investments generated interest income of $73,502, which represents 0.02% of average net assets for the quarter ended June 30, 2014.  The net asset value per share on June 30, 2014, was $19.00. This represents a decrease of 2.26% in net asset value (not including an assumed reinvestment of distributions) from the $19.44 net asset value as of March 31, 2014. The Fund declared distributions totaling $0.425 per share to shareholders during the quarter. When an assumed reinvestment of these distributions is taken into account, the cumulative total return for the Fund on net asset value was -0.07% for the quarter ended June 30, 2014.  The Quarter Ended June 30, 2014 - Overall Commodity Market Commentary  In the quarter ended June 30, 2014, the commodity markets contended with rising geopolitical risks as violence increased with attacks by the militant groups ISIS (Islamic State of Iraq and Syria) in Iraq and Boko Haram in Nigeria, moderating global weather conditions, and well-received efforts by the Chinese government to stimulate its economy through fiscal policy and market reforms.  The broad commodity market traded flat in the quarter ended June 30, 2014, returning 0.1%, as measured by the Dow Jones UBS Commodity Index ("DJ-UBSCI") (effective July 1, 2014, the name of the index changed to the Bloomberg Commodity Index). The Index (the Morningstar(R) Long/Short Commodity IndexSM and the Fund's benchmark), was up 1.4% for the quarter, led by livestock and energy. Metals and agriculture were the weakest-performing groups in the Index, posting losses for the quarter.  Livestock advanced 8.9% in the Index, and is the smallest group, comprising 6.4% of the Index at the end of the quarter. Supply concerns for live cattle led to strong price appreciation in the broad market during the quarter. The bad winter weather hampered breeding, weight gain, and slaughter rates. Lean hogs prices, in contrast, were volatile. A highly contagious pig virus continued to spread in the U.S., Canada, and Asia, fueling supply worries.  The Index's energy group rose 3.8% during the quarter. Energy commodities represented 53.9% of the Index at the end of the quarter, and were its most significant commodity group by weight. In the broader market, all energy commodities gained during the quarter, led by gains in unleaded gas. Increasing violence in the Middle East and Africa raised the risk of future supply disruptions, boosting crude oil prices.  Table of Contents  The metals group posted the weakest performance, falling 3.5% in the Index during the quarter. The Index includes three metals: gold, silver and copper, which made up a combined 14.5% of the overall Index at the end of the quarter. In the broader market, gold and silver prices ended the quarter higher following a rally late in June prompted by inflation worries, while copper rebounded from its weakness in the first quarter on China's efforts to strengthen its economy.  The Index's agriculture group lost 2.3% during the quarter. All of the agriculture commodities in the group ended the quarter down in the broad market. Reports of accelerated plantings, abundant supply, and favorable weather weighed on prices for corn, wheat, and soybeans, as did concerns about weakening Chinese demand for a corn ethanol by-product and soybeans. Agricultural commodities made up 25.2% of the Index at the end of the quarter.  The Quarter Ended June 30, 2014 - Fund Commodity Portfolio Commentary  The Fund's commodity portfolio returned 0.2% for the three-month period (before considering the expenses of the Fund or the performance of the collateral portfolio). The Fund outperformed the DJ-UBSCI, which returned 0.1%, but underperformed the Index, which returned 1.4%. The Fund's total return on net asset value for the quarter, which includes the effect of the Fund's expenses and the performance of the collateral portfolio and assumes the reinvestment of the Fund's distribution, was -0.07%.  The Fund may write - that is, sell - put and call options on up to 25% of the value of each of the Fund's commodity futures contracts. During the quarter, Gresham generally wrote options on approximately 15% of each commodity futures contract seeking to limit return volatility and to provide cash flow to support the Fund's distributions. The Fund receives cash premiums in return for writing options. If the Fund holds a long position in a specific commodity, it will sell covered calls on those contracts; if a short position is held, it will sell covered puts on contracts in that commodity. Typically, the options sold are at or in the money, and the Fund receives cash for the related premiums. Though the majority of the Fund's option positions expire in the money, which can limit the Fund's full participation in gains related to that commodity position, they are an important tool for reducing the Fund's return volatility. For the quarter, the Fund had lower volatility than the Index, as measured by standard deviation of NAV return.  The Fund has the flexibility to sell both puts and calls on a single commodity, should such commodity "flip" positions (i.e., go from a long position to a short position) during the life of a particular option. In this case, the Fund can collect additional premiums. During the quarter, the Fund was able to sell calls on silver, and both puts and calls on sugar, corn, wheat, cotton, and gold, which contributed positively to Fund performance.  A key driver of the Index's long (and short) positions is the upward (or downward) momentum in the prices of its constituents relative to the moving averages of commodity prices. The Fund's commodity portfolio long and short/flat positions share the same drivers as the Index, but are established more actively and with greater frequency (intra-month versus the Index's once per month methodology). This dependence on momentum puts the Index and the Fund's commodity portfolio at risk to price patterns that seem to demonstrate upward momentum (causing a shift from short/flat to long) but then shift to an equally compelling semblance of downward momentum (causing a shift from long to short/flat). This phenomenon is customarily described as a "whipsaw," and the Fund's greater potential for trading activity exposes it to greater whipsaw risk than the more passive Index in certain periods.  In terms of commodity groups, during the quarter the Fund experienced absolute gains in agriculture and absolute losses in energy, metals, and livestock. Relative to the Index, the Portfolio outperformed in agriculture, but underperformed in energy, metals, and livestock.  The Fund's agriculture position fell 1.9% during the quarter, compared to a 2.3% drop in the Index's. Corn contributed positively, as the Fund gained from favorable long/short positioning versus the Index during the May-June price decline. In addition, the Fund benefited from collecting additional premiums from selling both put and call options on corn, wheat, and sugar. However, sugar prices were volatile during the quarter, which led to flipping activity that detracted from relative performance.  Table of Contents  The Fund's energy position, up 2.7% for the quarter, underperformed the Index's, up 3.8%, primarily because of the choppy markets in heating/gas oil, which created excess flipping activity throughout the quarter. The Fund's WTI/Brent exposure also contributed towards underperformance due to options overlay.  In the metals group, the Fund's 5.7% decline for the quarter underperformed the Index's 3.5% loss. The Fund's gold position suffered due to disadvantageous positioning throughout the quarter relative to the Index. Silver and copper positions, however, added slightly to relative performance.  The Fund's lean hogs position drove the Fund's underperformance in livestock during the quarter, where the Fund lagged the Index on an absolute basis by 4.7% and underperformed by 0.3% on a weighted basis. The Fund has been long lean hogs since the second quarter of 2013. A choppy trading environment, which resulted in mixed prices during the quarter, detracted from the Fund's relative returns.  The Quarter Ended June 30, 2013 - Net Assets of the Fund and Commodity Market and Portfolio Commentary  The Fund's net assets decreased from $406.7 million at March 31, 2013, to $396.6 million at June 30, 2013, a decrease of $10.1 million. The decrease in the Fund's net assets was due to $9.8 million in net realized losses and $10.2 million in net unrealized appreciation on the Fund's portfolio during the quarter, a net investment loss of $1.6 million, $8.7 million of distributions to shareholders, and $0.2 million of share repurchases.  Commodity markets continued to struggle in the second quarter of 2013 and were heavily influenced by supply and demand fundamentals of individual markets. The broad commodity market fell consecutively in April, May, and June as most commodities posted declines, as measured by the DJ-UBSCI, which fell 9.5% for the second quarter of 2013; the Manager believes the DJ-UBSCI is representative of the overall commodities market. This was a more favorable environment for strategies with the ability to short commodities. The Index (the Morningstar(R) Long/Short Commodity IndexSM and the Fund's benchmark) experienced a slightly positive result of 0.03% for the quarter, with three of its four commodities groups, agriculture, energy and livestock, experiencing losses for the quarter, while metals posted a strong gain just offsetting those losses.  Energy commodities represented 46.2% of the Index at the end of the period, and are its most significant commodity group by weight. Energy commodities within the long-only DJ-UBSCI fell 8.5% in the quarter as weakening global demand put downward pressure on prices. The Index suffered a smaller loss of approximately 7.0% as the ability to hold flat positions helped limit losses.  Agricultural commodities made up 28.2% of the Index at the end of the period. Most agricultural commodities declined in the quarter as the DJ-UBSCI group lost 4.5% due to expectations of generous supplies for many markets, including coffee, corn and wheat. Notably, soybeans and soybean meal gained over the quarter. The Index's agriculture positions fell approximately 2.8% in the quarter, outperforming the DJ-UBSCI.  Metals, of which there are three in the Index (gold, silver and copper), made up a combined 21.0% of the Index at the end of the quarter. The quarter saw all three commodities fall significantly, as measured by the DJ-UBSCI, with silver, gold and copper falling 31.6%, 23.4% and 11.1%, respectively, in the quarter. Slowing GDP growth in China, pointing to lower demand in global manufacturing and domestic construction, contributed to some of the largest quarterly declines in the metals arena in many years. The Index benefitted from these declines as it held short positions and gained approximately 27.9% in this group, offsetting the losses experienced in the other three groups.  Livestock, the smallest group in the Index at the end of the period at 4.6%, gained in long-only terms per the DJUBSCI by approximately 2.2%. Seasonal strength in U.S. demand for summer grilling, as well as April and May reports of a virus affecting piglets that could impair breeding of the U.S. herd later in 2013, provided strength in lean hogs. The Index experienced a small loss of approximately 0.9% in this environment.  Table of Contents  In this mostly negative market environment for commodity prices, the Fund's long/short commodity and options portfolio benefited from the flexibility to hold both long and short positions along with the retention of option premium. The Fund's commodity portfolio outperformed its benchmark Index and posted a positive 0.07% gain during the second quarter of 2013 (before considering the expenses of the Fund or the performance of the collateral portfolio) with moderately less volatility, well outpacing the broad market as measured by the DJUBSCI, which lost 9.5% for the quarter. The Fund's total return on net asset value for the quarter, which includes the effect of the Fund's expenses and the performance of the collateral portfolio and assumes the reinvestment of the Fund's distribution, was a loss of 0.23%. Relative to the Index, the primary driver of the Fund's commodity portfolio outperformance came from agriculture positions, followed by relative outperformance in livestock. Underperformance in metals and energy did not outweigh the benefits in agriculture. As many commodities began to display price momentum, either positive or negative, the negative effects of "whipsaw" abated which contributed to the positive relative performance. See more on whipsaw later in this discussion.  In agriculture commodities, the Index held short positions in most of its contracts for much of the period. The Fund's commodity portfolio positions in agriculture rose approximately 0.3% versus the Index's loss of approximately 2.8%. The Fund's portfolio, when compared to the Index, benefited from switches from short to long, or vice-versa, ahead of the Index in corn, soybeans, and soybean meal, which allowed the Fund to generate positive returns in this group and drove overall results. Position switching during the quarter also generated additional option premium in those commodities for the Fund as it collected both call and put premiums, in line with its options strategy.  The Fund gained approximately 2.0% in livestock, outperforming the Index by approximately 2.9%, in part due to a switch to a long position in lean hogs in late May in advance of the Index, which remained short. The switch of position in lean hogs also generated additional option premium for the Fund. Gains in livestock, while positive to performance, had a modest overall impact given the relatively small weight of the group in both the Fund's portfolio, 4.7%, and in the Index, 4.6%, as measured at the end of the period.  As noted above, the Index's metals group returned approximately 27.9% for the quarter, driven by short positions in all three (silver, gold and copper) metals markets, as each fell during the entire quarter. The Fund's commodities portfolio also held short positions for the quarter and returned approximately 23.1% on its metals positions. Underperformance versus the Index was a result of switching between long and short positions during the quarter, and of options written being exercised, which meant some of the upside of holding short metals positions was offset by the Fund's put options being exercised.  Energy holdings, despite their relatively large weight in both the Fund's portfolio, 45.4%, and within the Index, 46.2%, both measured at the end of the period, had little impact on relative performance. The Fund's energy positions lost approximately 8.4% vs. the Index's nearly 7.0% loss. The Fund's slight underweight positions and retention of options premium helped mitigate the impact of the absolute underperformance, resulting in only a small impact on relative results.  The Fund employs a strategy of writing covered options on commodity futures positions in the portfolio, with the goals of limiting the volatility of the Fund's returns and providing cash flow for the Fund's distributions. Gresham utilizes a strategy in which exchange-traded commodity put and/or call options are sold on up to 25% of the value of each of its commodity futures contracts that are deemed to have sufficient trading volume and liquidity. During the quarter, the Fund sold options on approximately 15% of the value of each commodity position. If the Fund holds a long position in a specific commodity, it will sell covered calls on those contracts; if a short position is held, it will sell covered puts on contracts in that commodity. Typically, the options sold are at or in the money, which results in the collecting of premiums. Though the majority of the Fund's option positions expire in the money, which can limit the returns of the portfolio, they are an important tool for reducing the Fund's volatility. For the quarter, the Fund had lower volatility than the Index, as measured by standard deviation of return.  Table of Contents  The Fund has the flexibility to sell both puts and calls on a single commodity, should such commodity "flip" positions (i.e. go from a long position to a short position) during the life of a particular option. In such a case, the Fund can collect additional premiums. During the quarter, the Fund was able to sell both puts and calls on several commodities, including corn, soybean meal, soybeans, and lean hogs, which benefitted the Fund.  It is important to remember that a key driver of the Index's long (and short) positions is the upward (or downward) momentum in the prices of its constituents relative to the moving averages of commodity prices. The Fund's commodity portfolio long and short/flat positions share the same drivers as the Index, but are established more actively and with greater frequency (intra-month versus the Index's once per month methodology). This dependence on momentum puts the Index and the Fund's commodity portfolio at risk to price patterns that seem to demonstrate upward momentum (causing a shift from short/flat to long) but then shift to an equally compelling semblance of downward momentum (causing a shift from long to short/flat). This phenomenon is customarily described as a "whipsaw," and the Fund's greater potential for trading activity exposes it to greater whipsaw risk than the more passive Index in certain periods.  During the quarter ended June 30, 2013, the Fund's collateral investments generated interest income of $120,496, which represents 0.03% of average net assets for the quarter ended June 30, 2013. The net asset value per share on June 30, 2013, was $21.11. This represents a decrease of 2.40% in net asset value (not including an assumed reinvestment of distributions) from the $21.63 net asset value as of March 31, 2013. The Fund declared distributions totaling $0.465 per share to shareholders during the quarter. When an assumed reinvestment of these distributions is taken into account, the cumulative total return for the Fund on net asset value was -0.23% for the quarter ended June 30, 2013.  The Fund generated a net loss of $1.1 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2013, resulting from interest income of $0.1 million, net expenses of $1.6 million, net realized losses of $9.8 million, and net unrealized appreciation of $10.2 million.  The Six Months Ended June 30, 2014 - Fund Share Price  The Fund's shares traded on the NYSE MKT at a price of $16.16 on the close of business on June 30, 2014. This represents a decrease of 6.16% in share price (not including an assumed reinvestment of distributions) from the $17.22 price at which the shares of the Fund traded on the close of business on December 31, 2013. The high and low intra-day share prices for the six month period were $17.60 (January 22, 2014) and $15.95 (June 13, 2014), respectively. During the six month period, the Fund declared distributions totaling $0.890 per share to shareholders, of which $0.135 was paid on July 1, 2014. The remainder was paid during the period. The Fund's cumulative total return on market value for the six month period, which assumes reinvestment of such distributions, was -1.00%. At June 30, 2014, shares of the Fund traded at a 14.95% discount to the Fund's net assets value of $19.00 per share. During the six month period the Fund repurchased 55,000 shares, refer to "Part II-Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds" in this Report for further details on the repurchase activity.  The Six Months Ended June 30, 2013 - Fund Share Price  The Fund's shares traded on the NYSE MKT at a price of $19.87 on the close of business on June 28, 2013 (the last trading day of the period). This represents a decrease of 6.36% in share price (not including an assumed reinvestment of distributions) from the $21.22 price at which the shares of the Fund traded on the close of business on December 31, 2012. The high and low intra-day share prices for the six month period were $23.93 (January 28, 2013) and $17.75 (June 25, 2013), respectively. During the six month period, the Fund declared distributions totaling $0.930 per share to shareholders, of which $0.155 was paid on July 1, 2013. The Fund's cumulative total return on market value for the six month period, which assumes reinvestment of such distributions, was -2.03%. At June 28, 2013 (the last trading day of the period), shares of the Fund traded at a 5.87% discount to the Fund's net asset value of $21.11 per share.  Table of Contents  The Six Months Ended June 30, 2014 - Net Assets of the Fund  The Fund's net assets decreased from $364.4 million at December 31, 2013, to $336.3 million at June 30, 2014, a decrease of $28.1 million. The decrease in the Fund's net assets was due to a net loss of $11.4 million, $15.8 million of distributions to shareholders, and $0.9 million in share repurchases.  The Fund generated a net loss of $11.4 million for the six month period ended June 30, 2014, resulting from interest income of $0.2 million, offset by total . . .

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  This information should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes to financial statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this Quarterly Report (the "Report"). The discussion and analysis includes forward-looking statements that generally relate to future events or future performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as "may," "will," "should," "expect," "plan," "anticipate," "believe," "estimate," "predict," "potential" or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. These forward-looking statements are based on information currently available to Nuveen Commodities Asset Management, LLC ("NCAM" or the "Manager"), Gresham Investment Management LLC and its Near Term Active division (such division referred to herein as "Gresham" or the "Commodity Sub-adviser") and Nuveen Asset Management, LLC ("Nuveen Asset Management" or the "Collateral Sub-adviser") and are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors, both known and unknown, that could cause the actual results, performance, prospects or opportunities of the Nuveen Long/Short Commodity Total Return Fund (the "Fund") to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, these forward-looking statements.  You should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. Except as expressly required by the federal securities laws or otherwise, the Fund and the Manager undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements or the risks, uncertainties or other factors described in this Report, as a result of new information, future events or changed circumstances or for any other reason after the date of this Report.  Introduction  The Fund is a commodity pool which was organized as a Delaware statutory trust on May 25, 2011 and commenced operations on October 25, 2012, with its public offering. The Fund's shares trade on the NYSE MKT under the ticker symbol "CTF". The Fund's investment objective is to generate attractive total returns. The Fund is actively managed and seeks to outperform its benchmark, the Morningstar(R) Long/Short Commodity IndexSM (the "Index"). The Index tracks the historical total return performance of a diverse portfolio of commodity futures, which may be invested long, short or flat. The Index uses a momentum rule to determine if each commodity futures position is long, short or flat. In pursuing its investment objective, the Fund invests directly in a diverse portfolio of exchange-traded commodity futures contracts that represent the main commodity sectors and are among the most actively traded futures contracts in the global commodity markets, and also invests in commodity options contracts (the futures and options are sometimes referred to as the "commodity portfolio"). Individual commodity futures positions may be either long or short (or flat in the case of energy futures) depending upon market conditions. The Fund's options strategy seeks to produce option premiums for the purpose of enhancing the Fund's risk-adjusted total return over time. The Fund is unleveraged, and the Fund's commodity contract positions are fully collateralized with cash equivalents, U.S. government securities and other short-term, high-grade debt securities.  Proposed Conversion to ETF Structure  On December 19, 2014, the Fund issued a press release announcing that the Manager had approved a plan to convert the Fund (the "Conversion") into an open-ended ETF. On May 15, 2015, shareholders of the Fund approved amendments to the Fund's Declaration of Trust that are necessary to complete the Conversion. To facilitate the Conversion, on July 9, 2015, the Fund filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") to register common shares that may be issued from time to time after the Conversion. The Conversion requires regulatory clearance, including SEC approval of a new exchange rule pursuant to which the Fund's shares will trade following the Conversion. On June 8, 2016, the Fund announced that the SEC had issued notice of the proposed new exchange rule, which was subsequently published in the Federal Register on June 13, 2016, and subject to a 45-day SEC review period. On July 28, 2016, the Fund announced that the SEC had extended the review period for the rule through September 9, 2016. If the SEC approves the proposed rule at the conclusion of this review period, the Fund intends to complete the Conversion as soon as practicable thereafter. There can be no assurance that SEC approval will be obtained, or if obtained, that the Conversion will be completed in the anticipated time frame. As of June 30, 2016, the Conversion remains subject to the receipt of regulatory approvals.  Table of Contents  In connection with the Conversion, the Manager intends to implement a number of additional changes to the Fund that the Manager believes will better align a number of the Fund's features with its newly-adopted ETF structure, including a reduction of the management fee, and changes to the Fund's investment strategy, name and distribution policy. None of these expected changes have been finalized, and they remain subject to further revision by the Manager. In addition, following the Conversion, the Manager will continue to have the ability, without shareholder approval, to make subsequent changes to the operation of the Fund.  The Fund is not currently, and after the Conversion will not be, a mutual fund or any other type of investment company within the meaning of the 1940 Act. Until the Conversion occurs, the Fund will continue to operate as currently structured.  Results of Operations  The Quarter Ended June 30, 2016 - Fund Share Price  The Fund's shares traded on the NYSE MKT at a price of $14.84 on the close of business on June 30, 2016.

During the quarter, the Fund declared distributions totaling $0.357 per share to shareholders, of which $0.119 was paid on July 1, 2015. The remainder was paid during the quarter. The Fund's cumulative total return on market value for the quarter, which assumes reinvestment of such distributions, was 0.67%. At June 30, 2015, shares of the Fund traded at a 3.47% discount to the Fund's net asset value of $17.02 per share.  The Quarter Ended June 30, 2016 - Net Assets of the Fund  The Fund's net assets decreased from $259.2 million at March 31, 2016, to $249.2 million at June 30, 2016, a decrease of $10.0 million. The decrease in the Fund's net assets was due to $4.4 million of distributions to shareholders and a net loss of $5.6 million.  The Fund generated a net loss of $5.6 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2016, resulting from expenses of $1.2 million and net realized losses of approximately $9.8 million, offset by interest income of $0.3 million and an increase in net unrealized appreciation of $5.1 million.  During the quarter ended June 30, 2016, the Fund's collateral investments generated interest income of $253,880, which represents 0.10% of average net assets for the quarter ended June 30, 2016.  The net asset value per share on June 30, 2016, was $15.25. This represents a decrease of 3.85% in net asset value (not including an assumed reinvestment of distributions) from the $15.86 net asset value as of March 31, 2016. During the quarter, the Fund declared distributions totaling $0.270 per share to shareholders, of which $0.090 was paid on July 1, 2016. When an assumed reinvestment of these distributions is taken into account, the cumulative total return for the Fund on net asset value was -2.17% for the quarter ended June 30, 2016.  Table of Contents  The Quarter Ended June 30, 2015 - Net Assets of the Fund  The Fund's net assets decreased from $289.7 million at March 31, 2015, to $278.2 million at June 30, 2015, a decrease of $11.5 million. The decrease in the Fund's net assets was due to a net loss of $5.6 million, in addition to approximately $5.9 million of distributions to shareholders.  The Fund generated a net loss of $5.6 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2015, resulting from interest income of $0.1 million offset by net realized losses of $1.2 million, change in net unrealized depreciation of approximately $3.0 million and total expenses of $1.5 million.  During the quarter ended June 30, 2015, the Fund's collateral investments generated interest income of $123,629, which represents 0.04% of average net assets for the quarter ended June 30, 2015.  The net asset value per share on June 30, 2015, was $17.02. This represents a decrease of 3.95% in net asset value (not including an assumed reinvestment of distributions) from the $17.72 net asset value as of March 31, 2015. During the quarter, the Fund declared distributions totaling $0.357 per share to shareholders, of which $0.119 was paid on July 1, 2015. When an assumed reinvestment of these distributions is taken into account, the cumulative total return for the Fund on net asset value was -1.96% for the quarter ended June 30, 2015.  The Quarter Ended June 30, 2016 - Overall Commodity Market Commentary  The broad commodity market performed strongly in the second quarter of 2016, as measured by the Bloomberg Commodity Index ("BCOM"), supported by a favorable macro backdrop, improving fundamentals and bullish weather events. Currency fluctuations were a distinct theme in the second quarter. For most of the quarter, the U.S. Federal Reserve (the "Fed") was expected to raise its target interest rate in June, providing support to the U.S. dollar. However, a disappointing jobs report in May and unease about the British vote to leave the European Union (commonly referred to as Brexit) took the potential June increase off the table, and the dollar retreated. All of the commodities traded in the Fund and BCOM are denominated in U.S. dollars, but the dollar weakening especially helped precious metals commodities to rally. The most dramatic currency swing was the British pound, which fell to a 31-year low versus the U.S. dollar after the British public voted on June 23 to leave the European Union. The yen, euro, Chinese yuan and other emerging market currencies were also volatile over the quarter.  As expected, the Fed left its benchmark interest rate unchanged at its June meeting. Although the June jobs report (released after the close of the quarter) significantly exceeded expectations and alleviated concerns that May was the start of a deceleration trend, the Brexit vote introduced a host of economic and political uncertainties. Central bank assurances helped soothe global markets, with many assets recovering most, if not all, of their post-Brexit trading losses by the end of the quarter. Looking at longer-term rates, Treasury yields fell to new lows in the Brexit aftershock, as risk aversion sent investors rushing into safe-haven assets such as government bonds and precious metals. Furthermore, with Japan adopting negative interest rates in early 2016 and low to negative rates across Europe, commodities and other non-yielding assets have benefited from investors seeking preservation of value.  Although the El Ni�o weather pattern officially ended in May, several grain and soft commodities saw price increases during the quarter driven by expectations for smaller harvests due to lower rainfalls in Southeast Asia and India, dry weather in Brazil and flooding in Argentina. Commodity producers and investors also continued to monitor conditions for a potential La Ni�a phenomenon, which could begin in the coming months and potentially disrupt growing seasons and transport.  The energy and industrial metals complexes also saw tightening supply conditions. Evidence that production cuts have started to balance some of the more-oversupplied markets triggered rallies across crude oil, natural gas and zinc. The energy sector was further boosted by a number of supply disruptions around the world, including forest fires in Canada, pipeline attacks in Nigeria, and worker strikes in France and Kuwait. However, the supply tightening trend could slow if the recent price rally encourages producers to reintroduce capacity.  Table of Contents  The long-only BCOM rose 12.8% in the second quarter, while the Fund's benchmark index, the Morningstar(R) Long/Short Commodity IndexSM (the "Index"), was down 0.5% for the quarter. Within the Index, the metals and livestock groups delivered gains, while the agriculture group declined modestly and the energy group was flat.  The Quarter Ended June 30, 2015 - Overall Commodity Market Commentary  The BCOM gained 4.7% for the quarter, while the Index fell 2.1%. Within the Index, the metals and livestock groups posted modest gains, while agriculture declined and energy was flat.  The largest group by weight, energy commodities represented 50.6% of the Index at the end of the quarter. In the broad market, all energy commodities had positive returns for the quarter. Unleaded gas delivered the strongest price performance in the group, rallying on refinery outages, seasonal demand for driving and news that the Environmental Protection Agency was proposing to ease ethanol blend regulations. Crude oil also performed well in the broad market, as both Brent and West Texas Intermediate (WTI) prices rallied off their March lows on declining U.S. rig counts and lower U.S. production estimates from the Energy Information Administration. The Index maintained flat positions across all energy commodities for the period.  Agricultural commodities made up 27.6% of the Index at the end of the quarter. In the broad market, the prices of all agriculture commodities except coffee appreciated during the quarter. Heavy rainfall across key growing regions in the U.S. propelled grain prices, as fields flooded resulting in potentially reduced plantings. Additionally, a June 30th U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) crop report revealed potentially tighter-than-expected supplies of corn and soybeans. Dry conditions across a number of wheat-exporting countries, including Canada, Russia, Ukraine, France and Australia, further supported price appreciation for wheat, as did Russia's implementation of an export tax to stem high bread prices and inflation. Cocoa prices were buoyed by a number of supply-related concerns, including concerns that Ghana may not have enough crops to fulfill its 2014-2015 contracts and the potential for an El Ni�o weather pattern to disrupt cocoa crops in Ecuador, Indonesia and West Africa. Cotton prices rallied late in the quarter, as heavy rains delayed plantings in several U.S. states, including Texas, a top producer of high-quality fiber. The Index's agriculture group declined 8.5% for the quarter.  The metals group, at 15.0% of the Index at the end of the quarter, includes gold, silver and copper. U.S. dollar movements, reduced demand, and anticipation of rising U.S. interest rates weighed on gold and silver prices in the broad market. Copper also suffered losses in the broad market as worries about China's slowing economy continued to dampen prices. The group gained 2.1% in the Index for the quarter.  The livestock group, at 6.7% of the Index at the end of the quarter, is the smallest group. Both live cattle and lean hogs contracts declined in the broad market over the quarter. Cattle prices were choppy during the quarter amid cattle herd rebuilding after last year and rain and flooding across the U.S. Midwest creating logistical problems for cattle producers. Higher supply levels and a slowdown in export demand drove lean hogs prices slightly down for the quarter. Concerns about the avian flu epidemic also pressured cattle and lean hogs prices. U.S. poultry export restrictions enacted because of the avian flu led to an increase in domestic chicken and turkey supplies, creating price competition for beef and pork heading into the summer months, when demand is usually higher. The Index's livestock group was up 1.8% for the quarter.  The Quarter Ended June 30, 2016 - Fund Commodity Portfolio Commentary  The Fund's commodity portfolio declined 2.0% for the quarter (before considering the expenses of the Fund or the performance of its collateral portfolio). The Fund underperformed both the BCOM, which rose 12.8%, and the Index, which fell 0.5%. The Fund's total return on net asset value for the quarter, which includes the effect of the Fund's expenses and the performance of the collateral portfolio and assumes the reinvestment of the Fund's distribution, was -2.17%.  The Fund may write - that is, sell - put and call options on up to 25% of the value of each of the Fund's commodity futures contracts. During the period, Gresham generally wrote options on approximately 15% of each  Table of Contents  commodity futures contract seeking to limit return volatility and to provide cash flow to support the Fund's distributions. The Fund receives cash premiums in return for writing options. If the Fund holds a long position in a specific commodity, it will sell covered calls on those contracts; if a short position is held, it will sell covered puts on contracts in that commodity. Typically, the options sold are at or in the money, and the Fund receives cash for the related premiums. Though the majority of the Fund's option positions expire in the money, which can limit the Fund's full participation in gains related to that commodity position, they are an important tool for reducing the Fund's return volatility. For the period, the Fund had higher volatility than the Index, as measured by standard deviation of NAV return. The volatility in the commodity markets, in particular for energy commodities, caused excess trading in the Fund and exposed it to whipsaw (as explained below). This resulted in higher volatility for the Fund's commodity portfolio relative to the Index, which remained flat for most energy commodities during the period.  The Fund has the flexibility to sell both puts and calls on a single commodity, should such commodity "flip" positions (i.e., go from a long position to a short position) during the life of a particular option. In this case, the Fund can collect additional premiums. During the period, the Fund did so for soybeans, soybean meal, silver and lean hogs, which contributed positively to performance. It is important to remember that a key driver of the Index's long (and short) positions is the upward (or downward) momentum in the prices of its constituents relative to the moving averages of commodity prices. The Fund's commodity portfolio long and short/flat positions share the same drivers as the Index, but are established more actively and with greater frequency (intra-month versus the Index's once per month methodology). This dependence on momentum puts the Index and the Fund's commodity portfolio at risk to price patterns that seem to demonstrate upward momentum (causing a shift from short/flat to long) but then shift to an equally compelling semblance of downward momentum (causing a shift from long to short/flat). This phenomenon is customarily described as a "whipsaw," and the Fund's greater potential for trading activity exposes it to greater whipsaw risk than the more passive Index in certain periods.  On an absolute performance basis, the Fund outperformed the Index in the agriculture group but lagged in the energy, metals and livestock groups during the quarter.  The bulk of the Fund's relative underperformance was in the energy group. The Fund entered the second quarter with flat positions across all energy commodities and began trading in the petroleum products intra-quarter (but maintained a flat position in natural gas for the entire quarter). In May, for the first time since the summer of 2014, the Fund traded Brent crude contracts. Although energy commodities rallied during the quarter, pricing was volatile as fundamental tailwinds clashed with macroeconomic headwinds. The volatility caused the Fund to experience losses on its energy positions. By contrast, the Index flipped from a flat to a long position in Brent crude in late June, significantly reducing its exposure to the crude market's price volatility when compared to the Fund.  In the metals group, the Fund's silver position was the main relative laggard. Silver prices rallied strongly during the quarter on expectations of decreasing mine output and increasing industrial and jewelry demand, as well as its appeal as a risk hedge and store of value. The Fund began the quarter with a short position, which was detrimental as prices rose, but flipped to long in April, whereas the Index held a long position for the entire quarter. However, the Fund sold additional call options on silver during the position change and collected extra premiums that were beneficial to overall performance and helped offset some of the underperformance against the Index.  The Fund's livestock position trailed the Index's position during the quarter. The Fund continued to hold a short position in live cattle, which gained as prices were pressured lower due to rising supply levels and sluggish demand. Conversely, lean hogs futures rallied on expectations for increased demand in China, but pricing was volatile intra-quarter. This choppy trading environment caused the Fund to suffer whipsaw effect in its lean hogs position, which dampened performance, whereas the Index experienced less-frequent position changes. The Fund sold additional options during the position flips and collected premiums which offset some of the underperformance against the Index.  Table of Contents  The Fund strongly outperformed the Index in the agriculture group during the quarter. Soybean meal posted the most outsized relative gains as the Fund benefited from more favorable timing in its position flip to long, capturing more of the upside in soybean meal's price rally. The Fund also collected additional premiums when it sold call options on soybean meal when it switched to a long position. Corn was another standout performer for the Fund relative to the Index. Although both the Fund and Index posted losses in corn for the quarter overall, the Fund's more advantageous timing on two different intra-quarter trades helped the Fund lose less value. Corn prices rallied for most of the quarter as dry weather in Brazil weighed on crop yield expectations, and the Fund established a long position a month earlier than the Index. However, a bearish crop report in June signaling more abundant supplies than expected caused prices to tumble. The Fund exited the position, mitigating its downside exposure, while the Index remained long at quarter-end.  The Quarter Ended June 30, 2015 - Fund Commodity Portfolio Commentary  The Fund's commodity portfolio was down 1.5% for the three-month period, before considering the expenses of the Fund or the performance of the collateral portfolio. The Fund underperformed the BCOM, which rose 4.7%, but outperformed the Index, which declined 2.1%. The Fund's total return on net asset value for the same period, which includes the effect of the Fund's expenses and the performance of the collateral portfolio and assumes the reinvestment of the Fund's distribution, was -1.96%.  The Fund may write - that is, sell - put and call options on up to 25% of the value of each of the Fund's commodity futures contracts. During the period, Gresham generally wrote options on approximately 15% of each commodity futures contract seeking to limit return volatility and to provide cash flow to support the Fund's distributions. The Fund receives cash premiums in return for writing options.

It is important to remember that a key driver of the Index's long (and short) positions is the upward (or downward) momentum in the prices of its constituents relative to the moving averages of commodity prices.

This phenomenon is customarily described as a "whipsaw," and the Fund's greater potential for trading activity exposes it to greater whipsaw risk than the more passive Index in certain periods.  The Fund's agriculture position was the main driver of outperformance relative to the Index, the energy positions had a neutral impact, and the livestock and metals positions detracted from relative results for the quarter.  The Fund's agriculture position fell 5.1% during the quarter, compared to an 8.5% drop for the Index. The Fund began the quarter with short positions in all grains, which was unfavorable in a rising price environment. However, an advantageous flip to long in corn, soybeans, wheat and soybean meal helped the Fund capture some of the price appreciation, reversing the earlier losses and contributing to relative outperformance for the quarter  Table of Contents  overall. The Fund also benefited from more advantageous timing in flipping its . . .  Aug 04, 2016  (c) 1995-2016 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc. All Rights Reserved

				Morningstar rated the Total Return Fund among 
N/A,
N/A,
N/A
and 
N/A
Intermediate-Term Bond
funds for the overall rating and the 3-, 5-, and 10-year periods (as applicable) 
ending 06/30/2017, respectively.


The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance 
figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The 
weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year 
rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating 
for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most 
weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is 
included in all three rating periods.
			

Performance Comparison
as of 
					
						06/30/2017
					
				







							This chart shows the value of a hypothetical $10,000 investment in the fund over the past 10 years or since its inception (for funds lacking 10-year records). The result is compared with benchmarks, which may include a broad-based market index and a peer group average or index. Market indexes do not include expenses, which are deducted from fund returns as well as mutual fund averages and indexes.
						
Benchmark Definitions



1 The Morningstar Rating for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, 
variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at 
least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for 
comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation 
in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent 
performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 
35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating 
for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, 
and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of 
total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% 
five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating 
formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest 
impact because it is included in all three rating periods.

2 The 30-day dividend yield represents the average daily dividends for the 
30-day period, annualized and divided by the net asset values per share 
at the end of the period; it is available the first quarter after the 
fund's inception.  The SEC standardized yield is computed under an SEC 
standardized formula and reflects an estimated yield to maturity 
(assuming all portfolio securities are held to maturity); it is 
available the first month after the fund's inception.  
			

3
					
					Average annual total return figures include changes in principal value, reinvested dividends, and capital gain distributions. 
For funds less than one year old, the Since Inception return figure is not annualized and represents an aggregate total return.
				

^ The gross expense ratio reflects the fund expenses as stated in the fee table of the fund's 
prospectus prior to the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement. 
The net expense ratio reflects fund expenses after the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement.
If a fund has an active contractual expense ratio limitation, the expiration date is shown below the gross and net
expense ratio values above.  Expense ratios are as of the most recent prospectus.

All mutual funds are subject to market risk, including possible loss of principal.
*Morningstar gives its best ratings of 5 or 4 stars to the top 32.5% of all funds (of the 32.5%, 10% get 5 stars and 22.5% get 4 stars) based on their risk-adjusted returns. The Overall Morningstar Rating™ is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with a fund's 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating™ metrics. As of 6/30/17, 72 of 108 of our rated funds (Investor class only) received an overall rating of 5 or 4 stars.
The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star.

**This chart displays relative risk of each U.S. mutual fund listed using standard deviation of returns. Those values are provided in the bars at the top of the chart.
Methodology: We evaluate the standard deviation and its resulting placement within a specific risk/return category on an annual basis. A fund is generally placed in a risk/return category based on the 10-year standard deviation of its performance. If a fund is less than 10 years old, the actual fund performance history is supplemented with the primary prospectus benchmark history to obtain a full 10-year history, or longest time period available up to 10 years. For an Asset Allocation fund with less than 10 years of performance history, sub-strategy returns are used. When a sub-strategy is less than 10 years old, the actual sub-strategy performance history is supplemented with benchmark history to obtain a full 10-year history, or longest time period available up to 10 years.
Risk return categories overlap; a fund with a standard deviation in the overlap between two categories, denoted by a plus (+), is placed so that its risk categorization is better aligned with anticipated return characteristics an investor may experience going forward at the discretion of T Rowe Price.
When a fund has a cash-like benchmark, denoted by a double plus (++), its standard deviation is estimated using only available fund returns. If the fund is less than 10 years old, benchmark returns are not used to obtain a full 10-year history because they would artificially suppress the volatility estimate.
All investments are subject to market risk, including the possible loss of principal. Standard deviation of returns, a measure of price volatility, is one measure of risk. Please consult the funds’ prospectuses for a more complete discussion of the funds’ risks.

*157 of our 332 mutual funds had a 10-year track record as of 6/30/17 (includes all share classes and excludes funds used in insurance products). 134 of these 157 (85%) funds beat their Lipper averages for the 10-year period. 215 of 317 (68%), 183 of 225 (81%), 149 of 180 (83%), of T.

Not all funds outperformed for all periods. (Source for data: Lipper Inc.)
36 of our 39 Retirement Funds had a 10-year track record as of 6/30/17 (includes all share classes). 34 of these 36 funds beat their Lipper averages for the 10-year period. 38 of 39, 38 of 39, and 35 of 36 of the Retirement Funds outperformed their Lipper average for the 1-, 3-, and 5-year periods ended 6/30/17, respectively. Calculations are based on cumulative total return. Not all funds outperformed for all periods. (Source for data: Lipper Inc.)
Source: Lipper Inc. 162 of 213 funds (excluding institutional and bank institutional funds as defined by Lipper) more than 6 months old had expense ratios below their Lipper averages based on fiscal year-end data available as of 6/30/17.
The principal value of the Retirement Funds is not guaranteed at any time, including at or after the target date, which is the approximate year an investor plans to retire (assumed to be age 65) and likely stop making new investments in the fund. If an investor plans to retire significantly earlier or later than age 65, the funds may not be an appropriate investment even if the investor is retiring on or near the target date. The funds’ allocations among a broad range of underlying T. Rowe Price stock and bond funds will change over time. The funds emphasize potential capital appreciation during the early phases of retirement asset accumulation, balance the need for appreciation with the need for income as retirement approaches, and focus on supporting an income stream over a long-term postretirement withdrawal horizon. The funds are not designed for a lump-sum redemption at the target date and do not guarantee a particular level of income. The funds maintain a substantial allocation to equities both prior to and after the target date, which can result in greater volatility over shorter time horizons.

Strategy & Benefits

Principal Investment Strategy
The investment strategy of the Direxion Indexed Commodity Strategy Fund includes:

A quantitative, strategic index-based approach to commodity investing
Exposure to 12 commodities that can individually be long or flat (if a short signal is triggered the position is moved to cash)
The ability to make position changes intra-month based on trends
Monthly rebalance based on risk reduction where the allocation of individual components is reduced if volatility exceeds certain predetermined risk levels
A “smart” contract roll approach1

1 Smart Contract Roll Approach – A futures contract roll approach designed to select cost effective futures contracts to roll into upon expiration of current contract.
Why Invest in the Fund?

The long/flat approach provides exposure to commodities that can individually be positioned long or flat (in cash) based upon price trends
Seeks to mitigate the downside risk and maximum declines relative to notable long-only commodity indices
Has the flexibility to make individual commodity position changes intra-month
Risk management controls designed to adjust exposure levels if volatility gets too high
Low- or non-correlation to stocks and bonds
Disciplined, quantitative, rules-based approach to commodity investing




Why Commodities?

Not just commodities – Long/Flat commodities.
Most traditional commodity funds provide long only exposure to commodities. This limits their potential to contribute to a portfolio’s long-term performance because they only benefit if commodity prices rise.
The Direxion Indexed Commodity Strategy Fund seeks to match the performance of the Auspice Broad Commodity ER Index (ABCERI), which provides exposure to 12 commodities that can individually be positioned long or flat (in cash) based upon price trends.
This long/flat index is potentially more adaptive to volatile commodity markets because it seeks to take advantage of individual commodities by going long when prices rise, and mitigate risk by going flat (to cash) when prices fall.
Why consider long/flat commodities?
Most traditional commodity funds can only benefit if commodity prices rise. However, these long-only commodity strategies have shown to be inconsistent over time because:

Commodity returns are typically cyclical and sporadic
Individual commodity sub-sectors tend to perform dissimilarly in different market environments
Significant draw-downs can be damaging to the long-term performance of a portfolio

Within the inherently volatile commodity markets, a long/flat approach is potentially more adaptive to whip-sawing market conditions.

Target Index

The Auspice Broad Commodity ER Index aims to capture upward trends in the commodity markets while minimizing risk during downward trends. The index uses a quantitative methodology to track either long or flat positions in a diversified portfolio of 12 commodity futures covering energy, metals, and agriculture. The index incorporates dynamic risk management and contract rolling methods.

Source: Bloomberg. Data from 10/1/2010 – 6/30/2017. October 1, 2010 is the inception of the Auspice Broad Commodity ER Index. Index returns and correlations are historical and are not representative of any fund performance. Total returns of the index include reinvested dividends. Past performance does not guarantee future results.  One cannot invest directly in an index. The indexes are composite indexes of commodity sector returns representing unmanaged, unleveraged, long-only investment in commodity futures that are broadly diversified across the spectrum of commodities. 

S&P Goldman Sachs Commodity Index (S&P GSCI), a composite index of commodity sector returns representing an unleveraged, long-only investment in commodity futures that is broadly diversified across the spectrum of commodities;
Bloomberg Commodity Total Return Index (BCOM TR), a broadly diversified index that allows investors to track 19 commodity futures through a single, simple measure
Deutsche Banc Liquid Commodity Optimum Yield Index (DBC CI), an index composed of futures contracts on 14 of the most heavily-traded and important physical commodities in the world.

Standard Deviation is a measure of the dispersion of a set of data from its mean.
Correlation is a statistical measure of how two securities move in relation to each other.
Maximum Drawdown is the greatest percent decline from a previous high.

* The Net Expense Ratio includes management fees, other operating expenses and Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses. If Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses were excluded, the Net Expense Ratio would be 1.26% for DXCTX, 2.01% for DXSCX, and 1.01% for DXCIX.  The Fund’s Adviser, Rafferty Asset Management, LLC (“Rafferty”) has entered into an Operating Services Agreement with each Fund. Under this Operating Service Agreement, Rafferty has contractually agreed to pay all expenses of each Fund through September 1, 2018 other than the following: management fees, Rule 12b-1distribution and/or service fees, any front-end or contingent deferred sales loads, acquired fund fees and expenses, taxes, swap financing and related costs, dividends or interest on short positions, other interest expenses, brokerage commissions and extraordinary expenses such as litigation or other expenses outside the typical day-to-day operations of the Fund. If these expenses were included, the net expense ratio would be higher.
The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. For the most recent month-end performance please visit the funds website at direxioninvestments.com.
Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus.

Alternative strategies have the potential to be a viable way for investors, whether institutional or retail, to reduce risk in their investment portfolios.


  Alternatives? Too Many, or Not Enough?    


The key to risk-adjusted returns and diversification is not the number of securities – it’s their correlation – or, really, non-correlation – to each other, that’s paramount.


  A Correlation Misconception    


Some clients confuse negative correlation with low (or non-) correlation. They mistakenly believe that returns for investments with low correlation move in opposite directions from each other.

                                        There are risks associated with investing, including possible loss of principal. The Fund invests in derivatives, including as a substitute to gain short exposure to equity securities. Derivative investments can be volatile, and these investments may be less liquid than other securities, and more sensitive to the effects of varied economic conditions. Derivatives used by the Fund to offset its exposure to market volatility may not perform as intended. The Fund may engage in “short sale” transactions and will lose value if the security or instrument that is the subject of a short sale increases in value. A Fund that has exposure to one or more sectors may increase the Fund’s vulnerability to any single economic or regulatory development. This may result in greater share price volatility. The composition of the respective Index underlying each Fund is heavily dependent on quantitative models and data from one or more third parties and the Index may not perform as intended. The Fund invests in the securities included in, or representative of, its Index regardless of their investment merit and the Fund does not attempt to outperform its Index or take defensive positions in declining markets.  Please read the Fund’s prospectus for specific details regarding the Fund’s risk profile.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
