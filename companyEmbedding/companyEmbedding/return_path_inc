Employee Programs









Having passion, humor, drive, intelligence, and a strong work ethic are some of the qualities we look for when assessing potential hires and are qualities we want to nurture in existing employees. Return Path offers programs you can’t find anywhere else. Learn more about these programs below.









Path Forward
Return to the workplace after a career break with some of the leading tech companies in the nation, while expanding your existing skill set and developing your personal brand. Return Path is looking to help reintroduce women and men back into the workforce.
Path Forward is a 22-week paid program designed to increase diversity in technology, while also giving individuals who want to return to work after a hiatus an opportunity to expand their experience and network.
Learn More
















Dream Fund
Our employees’ passion and creativity is intensified when their efforts are focused on making a difference in their communities.
Established in 2011, DreamFund is an employee-directed grant program to support local charities and outreach programs. Each quarter, Return Path provides financial contributions and program assistance to support employees in making a positive impact globally and locally through grassroots initiatives. Return Path employees have completed projects across the globe, from helping Tennyson Center for Children in the US, to Beanstalk in the United Kingdom.
















Employee Referral Program
We want rock stars who live our values and represent a diverse cross-section of society. Cultural fit is paramount and who knows our culture better than current employees?
When a current employee makes a referral, there are a few perks. Starting with candidates who apply after 1/1​/17, ​we will pay $2500 for Engineering referrals and $500 for all other referrals. We also offer $75 toward a meal for you & your referral plus a $250 donation to the charity of your choice. It’s another way we say thanks and give back to your community.
