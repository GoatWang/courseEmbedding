Interview Part I: How the Gold-Banking Strategy Rewards Investors

Written by Nick HodgePosted June 6, 2017 at 7:23PM


Publisher's Note: While attending the International Metal Writers Conference in Vancouver last week, I had the opportunity to sit down and talk with Amir Adnani. Amir Adnani is one of the best executives in the mining space. He took the now-NYSE-listed Uranium Energy Corp. from concept to production in five years. Fortune magazine distinguished Mr. Adnani on its ‘40 Under 40, Ones to Watch’ list of North American executives. He was selected as one of “Mining’s Future Leaders” by Mining Journal, a UK-based global industry publication. As the chairman and founder of GoldMining Inc., Amir is now busy building what has already become one of the largest gold resource portfolios in the junior mining space. 
Enjoy, 
Nick HodgeFounder, Outsider Club

Nick Hodge: Hi I'm Nick Hodge. I'm sitting here in the Coal Harbour Room of the Pan Pacific in Vancouver with Amir Adnani, the Chairman of GoldMining Inc. (TSX-V: GOLD)(OTC: GLDLF). Amir you know it's funny, we met a couple of years ago just down the street at another hotel here and your company wasn't even called GoldMining then, it was called Brazil Resources Inc.
Amir Adnani: I remember that meeting.
Nick Hodge: Quite a lot has changed since then, so you've expanded beyond Brazil both northward and southward as you continue to execute on your strategy of accumulating ounces of gold and other minerals in the ground and I thought it was time for an update, to sit down and then see how the strategy's been going because it's been paying off quite well. So can you tell me more about how you're executing this land-banking strategy?
Amir Adnani: It's one where you have to be disciplined and you have to also sometimes be able to educate and explain to investors how this type of strategy creates value, creates value for shareholders. I was recently traveling and I almost had to remind an audience, that room full of investors that I was presenting to about the company, that sometimes they are the reason for the demise of some of the companies that we're buying at the bottom of the cycle, because investors in the junior resource sector have become so accustomed to believing that the only way to create value is to punch holes in the ground. Well when we have a bear market and you take a dollar off of your balance sheet and put it into the ground, whether you get results or not, even if you get stellar results, if the market is not in the right mood because sentiment is weak, you're not going to get the right reward felt in your share price. You're not going to be able to raise money at progressively higher levels.
You're diluting and you can really destroy value and destroy great deposits by doing this in bear markets. What we wanted to do was take advantage of this dynamic in the resource market, going back over six years ago, or almost seven years now with GoldMining, where when you see this predictable downturn, the markets are so predictably cyclical when it comes to commodities, right? Over 20 years we see the bull markets, bear markets, bull market, bear market. So the bottom of the cycle, when you're at bear market territory, mathematically you can acquire drilling that has been done for a fraction of what it costs to go drill a new hole. You can buy a resource in the ground for a fraction of what the same resource would be worth if the market was in bull market territory.
So in a way this is really not a new concept, many people before us have implemented this model successfully. You look at companies like Silver Standard, even Randgold was founded on the back of buying assets at the bottom of the cycle and then building those assets out. Silver Standard did the same thing, alumina copper. Some of the biggest names in the resource sector have recognized the benefit to taking advantage of the cycles is to create shareholder value. To get back to your point, the Brazil focus for us was initially important because you also just can't go out there and buy things randomly. There has to be a focus on specific jurisdictions and after seven years we've managed to now have established ourselves in northern Brazil, in Para State, the central Cauca belt in Colombia and in southcentral Alaska.
In every area we've created large district-scale opportunities. It doesn't happen overnight but you need one thing to go in your favor to make this kind of model a reality: a prolonged bear market. We've had a prolonged bear market since 2012, when the TSX ventures started to break down and the gold prices started to break out. Since 2012, in the last seven years we've had probably, what six good months last year? Between the Brexit event and Trump's victory. Six good months in a context of seven years. That's the ideal environment that we needed to have at GoldMining to execute the kind of strategy that we're talking about.
Nick Hodge: Well so many people are fearful during times like that, you know they're frozen, they're deer in headlights, they don't want to act. You've been contrary to them in that respect and you've done really well in executing these acquisitions at a time when no one is looking, right? Investors are fearful, the idea is to buy low and sell high but often human psychology just makes us do the opposite of that. How have you been able to gut check yourself or how have you been able to say, you know, now is the time to buy, we can do this with minimal dilution, we can head in here while asset prices are cheap. How do you gut check yourself for that?
Amir Adnani: Well first of all I've seen this strategy play out in the uranium sector. As you know with Uranium Energy Corp where I've spent the last 12 years developing. We've had even a longer, harder bear market in uranium and in 2010 for example right before the run up in uranium prices we managed to acquire at the bottom of the cycle in uranium prices assets from Uranium One, a big player back then. That helped transform us into a producer and we were able to buy again for cents on the dollar, assets that allowed us to join the exclusive club of uranium producers. So I've seen firsthand what it can do in terms of value creation in the resource market, when you do buy at the bottom of the cycle. In the resource business, I feel, more than any other business depending on what you pay for an asset you can either destroy a lot of value or create a lot of value.

So part of the gut check has really been having seen and lived through another commodity with another company, and executing that. By the way, we're still executing that with UEC, because as you know we've had a real prolonged bear market in the nuclear side. Maybe to some extent is also about aligning yourself, so a part of the gut check isn't just your own team and your own board, and having likeminded people as the team but having likeminded people in terms of the stakeholders. So you look at some of the long-term backers that we've had at GoldMining, people like Rick Rule and Sprott Asset Management. People like Marin Katusa and Doug Casey, other large institutional investors throughout the world that over the years we have laid out our vision and our strategy to them but then we've gone and executed.
We've managed to demonstrate through the combination of vision and execution, vision and execution and this snowball effect of building a larger critical mass and today having one of the largest resource spaces throughout the Americas for any pre-production company. It's that alignment with likeminded stakeholders who get you to a point where I think you have the right platform to be able to carry on and that to us has been a very important part of this whole strategy. As the shareholder base, the asset base and then sort of having that commitment, and that vision to just be very disciplined. To keep taking advantage of the last thing, being the cycle. If you have that sort of long-term cycle, as I've talked about, then all the stars align and you can really take advantage of this concept.
Nick Hodge: So you talk about creating value for shareholders by buying at the bottom of the cycle or the bottom of the market. Clearly the strategy has paid off if you look at your stock performance over time, compared to some of its peers or to some of its benchmarks, like the GDXJ ETF. You've clearly outperformed, can you speak to that?
Amir Adnani: Well after having been a public company now for six years it really does become an interesting case study almost, to put our share price performance next to some of the indices that you've talked about and just say, well look Amir keeps talking about this acquisition model, well how does it work out? How does it translate to share price performance? Today if you look at our share price performance from our IPO in the middle of 2011 to now, we have outperformed the TSX venture, which is a very good barometer of how we function as a junior resource company. The GDXJ as a junior gold ETF, even the SMP500, and that's a remarkable concept to think about, after such an extended period of time. But more importantly between 2012 and 2015, when the TSX venture lost almost 90% of its value, our shares were practically flat during that time.
Nick Hodge: That's great.
Amir Adnani: Last year, as you know very well, when the market did take off, we outperformed. We were the second-best performing stock, or mining stock on the TSX venture and made the TSX50 List. So we've demonstrated that we have quite a bit of downside protection when things are bad and we're making accretive acquisitions as opposed to dilutive ones and when the market turns around there's so much leverage with the size of resource that we've accumulated now that you see that immediate outperformance on the way up. So look it's an exciting concept. We have a lot of money as insiders tied up in this company ourselves. Insiders in GoldMining today still own close to 25% of the company, which is again very meaningful. So we feel very passionate about the vision and model, we've been at it for seven years. We have a lot of our own capital tied up and it's an exciting time. It's exciting to have that window still be open, to continue to grow the business.

Amir Adnani 	Casey subscribers are very familiar with Amir Adnani, who earned a spot in our 10-Bagger Club in 2009. In 2005, Amir had an idea for a uranium company. He had already tasted success in strategic marketing and financial communications, and was ready to dive into the resource sector. We first visited his projects in 2007, and in 2008 we advised subscribers of the Casey Energy Report to buy UEC at under US$0.25. Within ten months, the stock had reached US$3.75 per share, before it went to over US$7. That success is what landed Amir a spot in Casey's 10-Bagger Club, which is exclusive to resource entrepreneurs who have rewarded subscribers with realized gains of 1,000% or more.
 	The uranium sector has suffered since the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear crisis in Japan caused a major drop in uranium prices and equities. In this very difficult uranium market, Amir has led UEC to become one of the lowest-cost uranium producers in the world and has set up the company to produce up to 2 million pounds of uranium within the next few years. When UEC brought the Palangana in-situ recovery (ISR) uranium project in South Texas into production, it was the first ISR uranium mine to come online in the United States in five years. Amir has positioned Goliad, his second mine, to start production during the 2014 calendar year.
 	Both mines will feed the Hobson processing plant, which has a capacity of 2 million pounds. Amir has proven that he is the 1 in 3,000 able to bring exploration projects into commercial production, especially during the volatile markets we've seen over the last few years caused by the global financial crisis and the Fukushima disaster.
 	Amir's newest venture is Brazil Resources (BRI.V), which he co-founded in August 2010 and for which he currently serves as chairman of the board. Brazil Resources' strategy is to buy advanced-stage gold projects at today's low prices, focusing on identifying projects that are economic at today's gold prices. Due to Amir's shrewd management, BRI know sits on four projects with 4 million ounces of 43-101-compliant gold resources and recently closed an oversubscribed financing in which industry leaders such as Rick Rule and Doug Casey invested their own money.
 	With a great management and technical team and a strategic partnership with the Brasilinvest Group, one of Brazil's largest private merchant banks, BRI is cashed up and ready to acquire more proven gold projects and to take their projects to the next level.
 	Through serendipity, Brazil Resources has a large section of land just west of Paterson Lake in the western portion of the Athabasca Basin. The Rea project has a joint venture with Areva, a major global producer of uranium. Currently, there are only four management teams with uranium production experience in the Athabasca, and Brazil Resources is one of those.Amir is a determined, smart investor who has poured millions of dollars into his own ventures, and his interests are directly aligned with the investors'. We think Amir will achieve the status of the likes of Robert Friedland in the decades to come.

Amir Adnani Interview Part 1 | How the Gold-Banking Strategy Rewards Investors
Nick Hodge interviews the GoldMining (TSX-V: GOLD)(OTC: GLDLF) chairman about the landbanking strategy in gold.












Nick Hodge: Hi I'm Nick Hodge. I'm sitting here in the Coal Harbour Room of the Pan Pacific in Vancouver with Amir Adnani, the Chairman of GoldMining Inc. (TSX-V: GOLD)(OTC: GLDLF). Amir you know it's funny, we met a couple of years ago just down the street at another hotel here and your company wasn't even called GoldMining then, it was called Brazil Resources Inc.
Amir Adnani: I remember that meeting.
Nick Hodge: Quite a lot has changed since then, so you've expanded beyond Brazil both northward and southward as you continue to execute on your strategy of accumulating ounces of gold and other minerals in the ground and I thought it was time for an update, to sit down and then see how the strategy's been going because it's been paying off quite well. So can you tell me more about how you're executing this land-banking strategy?
Amir Adnani: It's one where you have to be disciplined and you have to also sometimes be able to educate and explain to investors how this type of strategy creates value, creates value for shareholders. I was recently traveling and I almost had to remind an audience, that room full of investors that I was presenting to about the company, that sometimes they are the reason for the demise of some of the companies that we're buying at the bottom of the cycle, because investors in the junior resource sector have become so accustomed to believing that the only way to create value is to punch holes in the ground. Well when we have a bear market and you take a dollar off of your balance sheet and put it into the ground, whether you get results or not, even if you get stellar results, if the market is not in the right mood because sentiment is weak, you're not going to get the right reward felt in your share price. You're not going to be able to raise money at progressively higher levels.
You're diluting and you can really destroy value and destroy great deposits by doing this in bear markets. What we wanted to do was take advantage of this dynamic in the resource market, going back over six years ago, or almost seven years now with GoldMining, where when you see this predictable downturn, the markets are so predictably cyclical when it comes to commodities, right? Over 20 years we see the bull markets, bear markets, bull market, bear market. So the bottom of the cycle, when you're at bear market territory, mathematically you can acquire drilling that has been done for a fraction of what it costs to go drill a new hole. You can buy a resource in the ground for a fraction of what the same resource would be worth if the market was in bull market territory.
So in a way this is really not a new concept, many people before us have implemented this model successfully. You look at companies like Silver Standard, even Randgold was founded on the back of buying assets at the bottom of the cycle and then building those assets out. Silver Standard did the same thing, alumina copper. Some of the biggest names in the resource sector have recognized the benefit to taking advantage of the cycles is to create shareholder value. To get back to your point, the Brazil focus for us was initially important because you also just can't go out there and buy things randomly. There has to be a focus on specific jurisdictions and after seven years we've managed to now have established ourselves in northern Brazil, in Para State, the central Cauca belt in Colombia and in southcentral Alaska.
In every area we've created large district-scale opportunities. It doesn't happen overnight but you need one thing to go in your favor to make this kind of model a reality: a prolonged bear market. We've had a prolonged bear market since 2012, when the TSX ventures started to break down and the gold prices started to break out. Since 2012, in the last seven years we've had probably, what six good months last year? Between the Brexit event and Trump's victory. Six good months in a context of seven years. That's the ideal environment that we needed to have at GoldMining to execute the kind of strategy that we're talking about.
Nick Hodge: Well so many people are fearful during times like that, you know they're frozen, they're deer in headlights, they don't want to act. You've been contrary to them in that respect and you've done really well in executing these acquisitions at a time when no one is looking, right? Investors are fearful, the idea is to buy low and sell high but often human psychology just makes us do the opposite of that. How have you been able to gut check yourself or how have you been able to say, you know, now is the time to buy, we can do this with minimal dilution, we can head in here while asset prices are cheap. How do you gut check yourself for that?
Amir Adnani: Well first of all I've seen this strategy play out in the uranium sector. As you know with Uranium Energy Corp where I've spent the last 12 years developing. We've had even a longer, harder bear market in uranium and in 2010 for example right before the run up in uranium prices we managed to acquire at the bottom of the cycle in uranium prices assets from Uranium One, a big player back then. That helped transform us into a producer and we were able to buy again for cents on the dollar, assets that allowed us to join the exclusive club of uranium producers. So I've seen firsthand what it can do in terms of value creation in the resource market, when you do buy at the bottom of the cycle. In the resource business, I feel, more than any other business depending on what you pay for an asset you can either destroy a lot of value or create a lot of value.
So part of the gut check has really been having seen and lived through another commodity with another company, and executing that. By the way, we're still executing that with UEC, because as you know we've had a real prolonged bear market in the nuclear side. Maybe to some extent is also about aligning yourself, so a part of the gut check isn't just your own team and your own board, and having likeminded people as the team but having likeminded people in terms of the stakeholders. So you look at some of the long-term backers that we've had at GoldMining, people like Rick Rule and Sprott Asset Management. People like Marin Katusa and Doug Casey, other large institutional investors throughout the world that over the years we have laid out our vision and our strategy to them but then we've gone and executed.
We've managed to demonstrate through the combination of vision and execution, vision and execution and this snowball effect of building a larger critical mass and today having one of the largest resource spaces throughout the Americas for any pre-production company. It's that alignment with likeminded stakeholders who get you to a point where I think you have the right platform to be able to carry on and that to us has been a very important part of this whole strategy. As the shareholder base, the asset base and then sort of having that commitment, and that vision to just be very disciplined. To keep taking advantage of the last thing, being the cycle. If you have that sort of long-term cycle, as I've talked about, then all the stars align and you can really take advantage of this concept.
Nick Hodge: So you talk about creating value for shareholders by buying at the bottom of the cycle or the bottom of the market. Clearly the strategy has paid off if you look at your stock performance over time, compared to some of its peers or to some of its benchmarks, like the GDXJ ETF. You've clearly outperformed, can you speak to that?
Amir Adnani: Well after having been a public company now for six years it really does become an interesting case study almost, to put our share price performance next to some of the indices that you've talked about and just say, well look Amir keeps talking about this acquisition model, well how does it work out? How does it translate to share price performance? Today if you look at our share price performance from our IPO in the middle of 2011 to now, we have outperformed the TSX venture, which is a very good barometer of how we function as a junior resource company. The GDXJ as a junior gold ETF, even the SMP500, and that's a remarkable concept to think about, after such an extended period of time. But more importantly between 2012 and 2015, when the TSX venture lost almost 90% of its value, our shares were practically flat during that time.
Nick Hodge: That's great.
Amir Adnani: Last year, as you know very well, when the market did take off, we outperformed. We were the second-best performing stock, or mining stock on the TSX venture and made the TSX50 List. So we've demonstrated that we have quite a bit of downside protection when things are bad and we're making accretive acquisitions as opposed to dilutive ones and when the market turns around there's so much leverage with the size of resource that we've accumulated now that you see that immediate outperformance on the way up. So look it's an exciting concept. We have a lot of money as insiders tied up in this company ourselves. Insiders in GoldMining today still own close to 25% of the company, which is again very meaningful. So we feel very passionate about the vision and model, we've been at it for seven years. We have a lot of our own capital tied up and it's an exciting time. It's exciting to have that window still be open, to continue to grow the business.

Amir Adnani
CEO, president and director, Uranium Energy Age: 33

|
              Dec. 16, 2012, 11 p.m.
            




















Amir Adnani saw potential in an ever-growing need for energy and a scarce supply of uranium.
"When I studied and understood what was going on in the uranium market because of the broader development in nuclear industry and the nuclear renaissance, I felt like this was a very compelling situation to get involved with," he said.
The entrepreneur has grown Uranium Energy Corp. from exploration to production in just five years. The company's growth has been fuelled by acquiring other companies and gaining their exploration rights and results.
The uncluttered field is one of the things that appealed to Adnani.
"There's only six or seven companies in the world that mine uranium … . If you set up to become a producer of any other key metal, you're one of many," he said. "In uranium, you're part of a very exclusive club."
The company now has several wells using the in-situ recovery method, which involves pumping water and oxygen into the ground and dissolving and recovering uranium in chemical solutions.
The practice, said Adnani, is more cost effective and causes less environmental harm than traditional open pit or underground mining methods. ISR is now used in one-third of global uranium mining.
Looking into the future, Adnani has ambitious goals for his company.
"Our objective over the next two to five years is to expand and increase our uranium production in the U.S. to become the largest uranium producer in the U.S.," he said. •

Mr. Adnani is a founder of the Company and has served as the President, Chief Executive Officer and a director since January 2005. Under his leadership, the Company moved from concept to initial production in the U.S. in five years, and has developed a pipeline of low-cost, near-term extraction projects. Mr. Adnani has been invited to speak at prominent industry conferences organized by the International Atomic Energy Agency, World Nuclear Fuel Market and the Milken Institute. He is a frequent contributor to the business media, including The Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg, CNBC and Fox Business News. Fortune magazine distinguishes Mr. Adnani on their “40 Under 40, Ones to Watch” list of North American executives. He is selected as one of “Mining’s Future Leaders” by Mining Journal, a UK-based global industry publication. He is recognized by Casey Research, a leading investment advisory publisher, as a top-ten leading mining industry entrepreneur and executive. He is a nominee for Ernst & Young’s “Entrepreneur of the Year” distinction. Mr. Adnani is the founder and Chairman of Brazil Resources Inc., a publicly-listed gold property acquisition and development company that has grown to control a sizeable portfolio of projects across the Americas.

Mr. Adnani holds a Bachelor of Science degree from the University of British Columbia and is a director on the university’s Alumni Association Board. The Board of Directors has concluded that Mr. Adnani should serve as a director given his involvement with the Company since its inception and his experience in the uranium industry.

Rick Rule & Amir Adnani - Part 2 - How To Play The Next Uranium Bull Market - Sprott Global Resource Investments Ltd.































Sprott's Thoughts
Monday, July 18, 2016
Sprott US Media
Rick Rule & Amir Adnani - Part 2 - How To Play The Next Uranium Bull Market 
We are pleased to present the second portion of the interview with Amir Adnani, founder of both Brazil Resources Inc. and Uranium Energy Corp. You can read Part I, which focuses on gold and Brazil Resources, here. In Part II, we look at Amir’s second public company, Uranium Energy Corp (UEC).  Amir has founded and managed two publicly traded resources companies, which gives him a unique view on the broader resource space.  Sprott’s Thoughts, with its exclusive interview with Amir conducted my Rick Rule, took the opportunity to understand Amir’s view of the market, and where he sees opportunities.
Amir notes that uranium is an entirely different commodity cycle, particularly as compared to gold. The uranium price is currently at a 10 year low. There is exceptional investor fatigue in the space, even loathing. “That means it’s the ultimate contrarian play, because anything I look at in terms of the long term fundamentals is absolutely positive.”
That’s why, in spite of years of a falling uranium spot price, Amir remains highly optimistic on uranium. He believes the coming bull market in uranium will be far more profound than what we experienced in 2006 and 2007. Fundamentally, the infrastructure to consume uranium is several orders of magnitude larger than what it was 10 years ago. Additionally, the U.S. – Russia HEU agreement has come and gone, which completely removed 15% of the supply from the uranium market. Amir sees a vast structural discrepancy between demand for electricity and what the current base load power the world is able to supply.
Finally, as an operator, UEC and other producers have a unique benefit: price elasticity. For the owner of the nuclear power plant, the price of uranium has an incredibly muted impact on his or her bottom line. They are, to a certain degree, price takers. Unlike other commodities, there is no viable substitute, and that is a fundamentally key factor to remember when considering uranium.
That being said, not all uranium companies are poised for success. There are only two ways to be competitive in uranium. “You’re either on the low end of the capital intensity curve and that in the uranium business means developing in situ recovery projects, or you’re on the high end of grade and that means you’re basically in the area that is the Persian Gulf of the uranium business, the Athabasca Basin.” Then, Amir notes, you have to look for advantages in permitting and infrastructure.
Amir also answers questions on the broader resource markets. With regard to junior resource markets in general, Amir warns we are few years away from the huge bull market we saw in the 2000s. This year’s rally has been a selective one, fueling good companies with good projects. “Investors are being very cautious in terms of how they’re coming back into the sector now,” Amir noted.
Finally, what would Amir suggest investors look for in a resource company? Alignment of interests between the management team and the investors is key. According to Amir, for both UEC and BRI, there’s an active interest by the management teams in acquiring more stock. In the case of BRI, a third of the company is owned by insiders. UEC is also largely owned by management.

About the 2016 Sprott Natural Resource Symposium in Vancouver:

How can you maximize your profits from the long awaited precious metals and natural resources bull market? One time tested way is by listening to respected experts in the industry at the 2016 Sprott Natural Resource Symposium in Vancouver, Canada, July 26-29. Our clients have consistently rated this conference as the finest investment conference they attend.
Join experts including Jim Rickards, John Embry, Doug Casey and Steve Sjuggerud. Join the “living legends” of mining, men who built billion dollar businesses, and are doing it again:  Ross Beaty (who took Lumina Copper from $.50 to $140 in seven years); Robert Quartermain (who took Silver Standard from $.72 to $45in ten years); Rob McEwen; and Robert Friedland.
Meet and listen to fifteen of the most influential precious metals and natural resource oriented newsletter editors in the world. Meet over 50 public company exhibitors, who are allowed to exhibit because they are owned in Sprott managed accounts.
In the early stages of a resource bull market, can you afford not to go to the finest junior resource investing conference in the world?

This information is for information purposes only and is not intended to be an offer or solicitation for the sale of any financial product or service or a recommendation or determination by Sprott Global Resource Investments Ltd. that any investment strategy is suitable for a specific investor. Investors should seek financial advice regarding the suitability of any investment strategy based on the objectives of the investor, financial situation, investment horizon, and their particular needs. This information is not intended to provide financial, tax, legal, accounting or other professional advice since such advice always requires consideration of individual circumstances. The products discussed herein are not insured by the FDIC or any other governmental agency, are subject to risks, including a possible loss of the principal amount invested.
Generally, natural resources investments are more volatile on a daily basis and have higher headline risk than other sectors as they tend to be more sensitive to economic data, political and regulatory events as well as underlying commodity prices. Natural resource investments are influenced by the price of underlying commodities like oil, gas, metals, coal, etc.; several of which trade on various exchanges and have price fluctuations based on short-term dynamics partly driven by demand/supply and nowadays also by investment flows. Natural resource investments tend to react more sensitively to global events and economic data than other sectors, whether it is a natural disaster like an earthquake, political upheaval in the Middle East or release of employment data in the U.S. Low priced securities can be very risky and may result in the loss of part or all of your investment.  Because of significant volatility,  large dealer spreads and very limited market liquidity, typically you will  not be able to sell a low priced security immediately back to the dealer at the same price it sold the stock to you. In some cases, the stock may fall quickly in value. Investing in foreign markets may entail greater risks than those normally  associated with  domestic markets, such as political,  currency, economic and market risks. You should carefully consider whether trading in low priced and international securities is suitable for you in light of your circumstances and financial resources. Past performance is no guarantee of future returns. Sprott Global, entities that it controls, family, friends, employees, associates, and others may hold positions in the securities it recommends to clients, and may sell the same at any time.
