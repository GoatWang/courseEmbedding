ATHENS, Greece, June 30, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- TOP Ships Inc. (Nasdaq:TOPS), an international ship-owning company (the “Company”), announced today it has received written notification from The Nasdaq Stock Market (“Nasdaq”) dated June 27, 2017, indicating that because the closing bid price of the Company's common stock for the last 30 consecutive business days was below $1.00 per share, the Company no longer meets the minimum bid price requirement for the Nasdaq Capital Market, set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5450(a)(1). Pursuant to the Nasdaq Listing Rules, the applicable grace period to regain compliance is 180 days, or until December 26, 2017.






The Company intends to monitor the closing bid price of its common stock between now and December 26, 2017 and is considering its options, including a reverse stock split, in order to regain compliance with the Nasdaq Capital Market minimum bid price requirement. The Company can cure this deficiency if the closing bid price of its common stock is $1.00 per share or higher for at least ten consecutive business days during the grace period.
The Company intends to cure the deficiency within the prescribed grace period. During this time, the Company's common stock will continue to be listed and trade on the Nasdaq Capital Market.
The Company's business operations are not affected by the receipt of the notification.

(TOPS), an international ship-owning company (the “Company”), announced today that it has entered into an agreement with a related party to purchase for $6.5 million, an additional 41% interest in Eco Seven Inc., a Marshall Islands company that owns M/T Stenaweco Elegance, a 50,188 dwt Medium Range (“MR”) product tanker, which is operating under a three year time charter at a rate of $16,500 per day expiring in March 2020.Since February 2017, the Company has made the following acquisitions:90% ownership interest in M/T Stenaweco Elegance, which includes the investment described above;49% ownership interest in M/T ECO Holmby Hills, a 50,000 dwt newbuilding product/chemical tanker scheduled for delivery from Hyundai Mipo Dockyard Co. Ltd. (“Hyundai”) in January 2018;49% ownership interest in M/T ECO Palm Springs, a 50,000 dwt newbuilding product/chemical tanker scheduled for delivery from Hyundai in April 2018;100% ownership interest in M/T ECO Palm Desert, a 50,000 dwt newbuilding product/chemical tanker scheduled for delivery from Hyundai in July 2018.The Company has invested $28.2 million for the acquisitions described above, which was raised through common stock and preferred stock offerings of the Company.Evangelos Pistiolis, President and CEO of the Company, stated: “In 2014 we focused the Company on a newbuilding program of high specification eco-friendly MR product tankers at Hyundai. Since then we have taken delivery of 7 of these vessels and employed them under 3-5 year fixed rate contracts. With the acquisition of the sister ship M/T Stenaweco Elegance, our operating fleet’s average age was reduced to 1.5 years making it one of the youngest MR Product Tanker fleets in the world and our charter backlog currently stands at about $100 million, providing cashflow visibility reaching into 2021. In July 2018 after the delivery of our last newbuilding vessel the Company will have a 10 vessel operating fleet with an average age of 1.7 years. As a result of this strategy, the Company remains cashflow positive after meeting all of its operating and senior debt obligations. Furthermore on current vessel valuations our fleet is leveraged less than 60%. Our business strategy continues to be focused on further expanding our fleet as we take delivery of our 3 remaining newbuildings next year and employ them under medium term fixed rate contracts.”Infographics accompanying this announcement are available at:http://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/c775b0c5-bee7-4a96-8d8d-20760a254616http://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/e55b4f69-a0ad-4ba1-acee-09e939719380About TOP Ships Inc.TOP Ships Inc. is an international ship-owning company.For more information about TOP Ships Inc., visit its website: www.topships.org.Forward-Looking Statements Matters discussed in this press release may constitute forward-looking statements.
