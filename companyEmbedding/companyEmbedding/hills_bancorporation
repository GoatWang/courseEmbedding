(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  The following is management's discussion and analysis of the financial condition of Hills Bancorporation ("Hills Bancorporation" or "the Company") and its banking subsidiary Hills Bank and Trust Company ("the Bank") for the dates and periods indicated. The discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying footnotes.  Special Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements  This report contains, and future oral and written statements of the Company and its management may contain, forward-looking statements within the meaning of such term in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 with respect to the financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance and business of the Company. Actual results may differ materially from those included in the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements, which may be based upon beliefs, expectations and assumptions of the Company's management and on information currently available to management, are generally identifiable by the use of words such as "believe," "expect," "anticipate," "plan," "intend," "estimate," "may," "will," "would," "could," "should" or other similar expressions. Additionally, all statements in this document, including forward-looking statements, speak only as of the date they are made, and the Company undertakes no obligation to update any statement in light of new information or future events.  The Company's ability to predict results or the actual effect of future plans or strategies is inherently uncertain. Factors which could have a material adverse effect on the operations and future prospects of the Company include, but are not limited to, the following:   The strength of the United States economy in general and the strength of the local economies in which the Company conducts its operations which may be less favorable than expected and may result in, among other things, a deterioration in the credit quality and value of the Company's assets.   The effects of recent financial market disruptions, and monetary and other governmental actions designed to address such disruptions.   The financial strength of the counterparties with which the Company or the Company's customers do business and as to which the Company has investment or financial exposure.  Page 37 Index  HILLS BANCORPORATION   The credit quality and credit agency ratings of the securities in the Company's investment securities portfolio, a deterioration or downgrade of which could lead to other-than-temporary impairment of the affected securities and the recognition of an impairment loss.   The effects of, and changes in, laws, regulations and policies affecting banking, securities, insurance and monetary and financial matters as well as any laws otherwise affecting the Company.   The effects of changes in interest rates (including the effects of changes in the rate of prepayments of the Company's assets) and the policies of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.   The ability of the Company to compete with other financial institutions as effectively as the Company currently intends due to increases in competitive pressures in the financial services sector.   The ability of the Company to obtain new customers and to retain existing customers.   The timely development and acceptance of products and services, including products and services offered through alternative electronic delivery channels.   Technological changes implemented by the Company and by other parties, including third party vendors, which may be more difficult or more expensive than anticipated or which may have unforeseen consequences to the Company and its customers.   The ability of the Company to develop and maintain secure and reliable electronic systems.   The ability of the Company to retain key executives and employees and the difficulty that the Company may experience in replacing key executives and employees in an effective manner.   Consumer spending and saving habits which may change in a manner that affects the Company's business adversely.   The economic impact of natural disasters, terrorist attacks and military actions.   Business combinations and the integration of acquired businesses and assets which may be more difficult or expensive than expected.   The costs, effects and outcomes of existing or future litigation.   Changes in accounting policies and practices that may be adopted by state and federal regulatory agencies and the Financial Accounting Standards Board.   The ability of the Company to manage the risks associated with the foregoing as well as anticipated.  These risks and uncertainties should be considered in evaluating forward-looking statements, and undue reliance should not be placed on such statements. Additional information concerning the Company and its business, including other factors that could materially affect the Company's financial results, is included in the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Page 38 Index  HILLS BANCORPORATION  Critical Accounting Policies  The Company's consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The financial information contained within these financial statements is, to a significant extent, financial information that is based on approximate measures of the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred. Based on its consideration of accounting policies that involve the most complex and subjective decisions and assessments, management has identified its most critical accounting policies to be those which are related to the allowance for loan losses. The Company's allowance for loan losses methodology incorporates a variety of risk considerations, both quantitative and qualitative in establishing an allowance for loan losses that management believes is appropriate at each reporting date. Quantitative factors include the Company's historical loss experience, delinquency and charge-off trends, collateral values, changes in impaired loans, and other factors. Quantitative factors also incorporate known information about individual loans, including borrowers' sensitivity to interest rate movements. Qualitative factors include the general economic environment in the Company's markets, including economic conditions throughout the Midwest and the state of certain industries. Determinations relating to the possible level of future loan losses are based in part on subjective judgments by management. Future loan losses in excess of current estimates, could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial position. Size and complexity of individual credits in relation to loan structure, existing loan policies and pace of portfolio growth are other qualitative factors that are considered in the methodology. As the Company adds new products and increases the complexity of its loan portfolio, it will enhance its methodology accordingly. This discussion of the Company's critical accounting policies should be read in conjunction with the Company's consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes presented elsewhere herein, as well as other relevant portions of Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Although management believes the levels of the allowance as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 were adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio, a decline in local economic conditions, or other factors, could result in increasing losses that cannot be reasonably predicted at this time.  Overview  This overview highlights selected information and may not contain all of the information that is important to you in understanding our performance during the period. For a more complete understanding of trends, events, commitments, uncertainties, liquidity, capital resources, and critical accounting estimates, you should carefully read this entire report.  The Company is a holding company engaged in the business of commercial banking. The Company's subsidiary is Hills Bank and Trust Company, Hills, Iowa (the "Bank"), which is wholly-owned. The Bank was formed in Hills, Iowa in 1904. The Bank is a full-service commercial bank extending its services to individuals, businesses, governmental units and institutional customers primarily in the communities of Hills, Iowa City, Coralville, North Liberty, Lisbon, Mount Vernon, Kalona, Wellman, Cedar Rapids, Marion, and Washington, Iowa. At September 30, 2016, the Bank has eighteen full-service locations.  Net income for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 was $24.84 million compared to $22.54 million for the same nine months of 2015, an increase of 10.24%. The $2.31 million increase in net income was caused by a number of factors. The principal factors in the increase in net income for the first nine months of 2016 are an increase in net interest income of $2.97 million and a decrease in provision for loan losses of $2.36 million. These changes were offset by an increase in income tax expense of $1.40 million, a decrease in noninterest income of $0.66 million, and an increase in noninterest expenses of $0.97 million.  The Company achieved a return on average assets of 1.23% and a return on average equity of 11.59% for the twelve months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the twelve months ended September 30, 2015, which were 1.19% and 10.73%, respectively. Dividends of $0.65 per share were paid in January 2016 to 2,334 shareholders. The 2015 dividend was $0.625 per share.  The Company's net interest income is the largest component of revenue and it is primarily a function of the average earning assets and the net interest margin percentage. The Company achieved a net interest margin on a tax-equivalent basis of 3.42% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 3.53% for the same nine months of 2015. Average earning assets were $2.435 billion year to date in 2016 and $2.260 billion in 2015.  Page 39 Index  HILLS BANCORPORATION  Highlights noted on the balance sheet as of September 30, 2016 for the Company included the following:   Total assets were $2.596 billion, an increase of $102.00 million since December 31, 2015.   Cash and cash equivalents were $49.03 million, an increase of $13.60 million since December 31, 2015.   Net loans were $2.210 billion, an increase of $105.37 million since December 31, 2015. Loans held for sale increased $2.94 million since December 31, 2015.   Deposits increased $105.71 million since December 31, 2015. Deposit growth included approximately $77.60 million in temporary tax deposits.   Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings decreased $15.00 million since December 31, 2015.  Reference is made to Note 6 for a discussion of fair value measurements which relate to methods used by the Company in recording assets and liabilities on its financial statements.  Financial Condition  Loan demand has been increasing and is expected to remain steady throughout the year ending December 31, 2016 and into 2017. As indicated in the table below, growth in the construction, mortgage 1 to 4 family first and junior liens, and multi-family real estate loans have been primarily responsible for the increase in total loans.  The following table sets forth the composition of the loan portfolio as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:   September 30, 2016 December 31, 2015 Amount Percent Amount Percent (Amounts In Thousands) (Amounts In Thousands) Agricultural $ 88,104 3.96 % $ 101,588 4.78 % Commercial and financial 188,365 8.46 184,199 8.67 Real estate: Construction, 1 to 4 family residential 59,273 2.66 51,346 2.42 Construction, land development and commercial 119,547 5.37 83,121 3.91 Mortgage, farmland 193,819 8.70 187,856 8.84 Mortgage, 1 to 4 family first liens 761,105 34.18 727,160 34.22 Mortgage, 1 to 4 family junior liens 122,588 5.50 117,873 5.55 Mortgage, multi-family 292,190 13.12 271,974 12.80 Mortgage, commercial 327,024 14.68 323,409 15.22 Loans to individuals 24,355 1.09 24,019 1.13 Obligations of state and political subdivisions 50,562 2.27 52,371 2.46 $ 2,226,932 100.00 % $ 2,124,916 100.00 % Net unamortized fees and costs 816 768 $ 2,227,748 $ 2,125,684 Less allowance for loan losses 26,140 26,510 $ 2,201,608 $ 2,099,174  Page 40 Index  HILLS BANCORPORATION  The Bank has an established formal loan origination policy. In general, the loan origination policy attempts to reduce the risk of credit loss to the Bank by requiring, among other things, maintenance of minimum loan to value ratios, evidence of appropriate levels of insurance carried by borrowers and documentation of appropriate types and amounts of collateral and sources of expected payment. The collateral relied upon in the loan origination policy is generally the property being financed by the Bank. The source of expected payment is generally the income produced from the property being financed. Personal guarantees are required of individuals owning or controlling at least 20% of the ownership of an entity. Limited or proportional guarantees may be accepted in circumstances if approved by the Company's Board of Directors. Financial information provided by the borrower is verified as considered necessary by reference to tax returns, or audited, reviewed or compiled financial statements. The Bank does not originate subprime loans. In order to modify, restructure or otherwise change the terms of a loan, the Bank's policy is to evaluate each borrower situation individually. Modifications, restructures, extensions and other changes are done to improve the Bank's position and to protect the Bank's capital. If a borrower is not current with its payments, any additional loans to such borrowers are evaluated on an individual borrower basis.  The Company has not experienced any significant time lapses in recognizing the required provisions for collateral dependent loans, nor has the Company delayed appropriate charge offs. When an updated appraisal value has been obtained, the Company has used the appraisal amount in determining the appropriate charge off or required reserve. The Company also evaluates any changes in the financial condition of the borrower and guarantors (if applicable), economic conditions, and the Company's loss experience with the type of property in question. Any information utilized in addition to the appraisal is intended to identify additional charge offs or provisions, not to override the appraised value.  In accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 102, Selected Loan Loss Allowance Methodology and Documentation Issues, the Company determines and assigns ratings to loans using factors that include the following: an assessment of the financial condition of the borrower; a realistic determination of the value and adequacy of underlying collateral; the condition of the local economy and the condition of the specific industry of the borrower; an analysis of the levels and trends of loan categories; and a review of delinquent and classified loans.  Through the credit risk rating process, loans are reviewed to determine if they are performing in accordance with the original contractual terms. If the borrower has failed to comply with the original contractual terms, further action may be required by the Company, including a downgrade in the credit risk rating, movement to non-accrual status, a charge-off or the establishment of a specific impairment reserve. In the event a collateral shortfall is identified during the credit review process, the Company will work with the borrower for a principal reduction and/or a pledge of additional collateral and/or additional guarantees. In the event that these options are not available, the loan may be subject to a downgrade of the credit risk rating. If the Company determines a loan amount or portion thereof, is uncollectible, the loan's credit risk rating may be downgraded and the uncollectible amount charged-off or recorded as a specific allowance for losses. The Bank's credit and legal departments undertake a thorough and ongoing analysis to determine if additional impairment and/or charge-offs are appropriate and to begin a workout plan for the loan to minimize actual losses.  Page 41 Index   HILLS BANCORPORATION The following table presents the allowance for loan losses on loans by loan category, the percentage of the allowance for each category to the total allowance, and the percentage of all loans in each category to total loans as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015: September 30, 2016 December 31, 2015 % of Total % of Loans to % of Total % of Loans to Amount Allowance Total Loans Amount Allowance Total Loans (In Thousands) (In Thousands) Agricultural $ 2,777 10.62 % 3.96 % $ 3,082 11.63 % 4.78 % Commercial and financial 4,010 15.34 8.46 4,517 17.04 8.67 Real estate: Construction, 1 to 4 family residential 993 3.80 2.66 866 3.27 2.42 Construction, land development and commercial 2,016 7.71 5.37 1,414 5.33 3.91 Mortgage, farmland 3,618 13.84 8.70 3,342 12.61 8.84 Mortgage, 1 to 4 family first liens 6,778 25.93 34.18 6,931 26.14 34.22 Mortgage, 1 to 4 family junior liens 1,123 4.30 5.50 1,241 4.68 5.55 Mortgage, multi-family 1,647 6.30 13.12 1,713 6.46 12.80 Mortgage, commercial 2,323 8.89 14.68 2,510 9.47 15.22 Loans to individuals 501 1.92 1.09 501 1.89 1.13 Obligations of state and political subdivisions 354 1.35 2.27 393 1.48 2.46 $ 26,140 100.00 % 100.00 % $ 26,510 100.00 % 100.00 %  The allowance for loan losses totaled $26.14 million at September 30, 2016 compared to $26.51 million at December 31, 2015. The percentage of the allowance to outstanding loans was 1.17% and 1.25% at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The allowance was based on management's consideration of a number of factors, including composition of the loan portfolio, loans with higher credit risks and the overall amount of loans outstanding. The decrease in the allowance in 2016 is the result of an increase in net loans and a change in the composition and allocation of loans within credit quality ratings partially offset by net recoveries.  The adequacy of the allowance is reviewed quarterly and adjusted as appropriate after consideration has been given to the impact of economic conditions on the borrowers' ability to repay, loan collateral values, past collection experience, the risk characteristics of the loan portfolio and such other factors that deserve current recognition. The growth of the loan portfolio and the trends in problem and watch loans are significant elements in the determination of the provision for loan losses. Quantitative factors include the Company's historical loss experience, which is then adjusted for levels and trends in past due, levels and trends in charged-off and recovered loans, trends in volume growth, trends in problem and watch loans, trends in restructured loans, local economic trends and conditions, industry and other conditions, and effects of changing interest rates.  Management has determined that the allowance for loan losses was appropriate at September 30, 2016, and that the loan portfolio is diversified and secured, without undue concentration in any specific risk area. This process involves a high degree of management judgment; however, the allowance for loan losses is based on a comprehensive, well documented, and consistently applied analysis of the Company's loan portfolio. This analysis takes into consideration all available information existing as of the financial statement date, including environmental factors such as economic, industry, geographical and political factors. The relative level of allowance for loan losses is reviewed and compared to industry data. This review encompasses levels of total impaired loans, portfolio mix, portfolio concentrations, current geographic risks and overall levels of net charge-offs.  Page 42 Index  HILLS BANCORPORATION  Residential real estate loan products that include features such as loan-to-values in excess of 100% or interest only payments, which expose a borrower to payment increases in excess of changes in the market interest rate, increase the credit risk of a loan. The Bank has not offered and does not intend to offer this type of loan product.  Investment securities available for sale held by the Company decreased by $13.62 million from December 31, 2015 to September 30, 2016. The fair value of securities available for sale was $3.35 million more than the amortized cost of such securities as of September 30, 2016. At December 31, 2015, the fair value of the securities available for sale was $2.24 million more than the amortized cost of such securities.  Deposits increased $105.71 million in the first nine months of 2016. Deposit growth included approximately $77.60 million in temporary tax deposits. Repurchase agreements decreased $4.15 million and Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings decreased $15.00 million since December 31, 2015. In the opinion of the Company's management, the Company continues to have sufficient liquidity resources available to fund expected additional loan growth.  Brokered deposits are included in total deposits and totaled $80.10 million as of September 30, 2016 with an average rate of 0.54%. Brokered deposits were $62.74 million as of December 31, 2015 with an average interest rate of 0.42%. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, brokered deposits were 4.01% and 3.32% of total deposits, respectively.  Dividends and Equity  In January 2016, Hills Bancorporation paid a dividend of $6.06 million or $0.65 per share. The dividend was $0.625 per share in January 2015. After payment of the dividend and the adjustment for accumulated other comprehensive income, stockholders' equity as of September 30, 2016 totaled $286.06 million. On January 1, 2015, the final rules of the Federal Reserve Board went into effect implementing in the United States the Basel III regulatory capital reforms from the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. The final rule also adopted changes to the agencies' regulatory capital requirements that meet the requirements of section 171 and section 939A of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.  Under the BASEL III rules, the minimum capital ratios are 4% for Tier 1 Leverage Capital Ratio, 4.5% for the Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio, 6% for the Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio and 8% for the Total Risk-Based Capital Ratio. A new capital conservation buffer is being phased in beginning January 1, 2016, at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and increased each subsequent year by an additional 0.625% until reaching 2.5% on January 1, 2019. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had regulatory capital in excess of the Federal Reserve's minimum and well-capitalized definition requirements.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  The following is management's discussion and analysis of the financial condition of Hills Bancorporation ("Hills Bancorporation" or "the Company") and its banking subsidiary Hills Bank and Trust Company ("the Bank") for the dates and periods indicated. The discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying footnotes.  Special Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements  This report contains, and future oral and written statements of the Company and its management may contain, forward-looking statements within the meaning of such term in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 with respect to the financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance and business of the Company. Actual results may differ materially from those included in the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements, which may be based upon beliefs, expectations and assumptions of the Company's management and on information currently available to management, are generally identifiable by the use of words such as "believe," "expect," "anticipate," "plan," "intend," "estimate," "may," "will," "would," "could," "should" or other similar expressions. Additionally, all statements in this document, including forward-looking statements, speak only as of the date they are made, and the Company undertakes no obligation to update any statement in light of new information or future events.  The Company's ability to predict results or the actual effect of future plans or strategies is inherently uncertain. Factors which could have a material adverse effect on the operations and future prospects of the Company include, but are not limited to, the following:   The strength of the United States economy in general and the strength of the local economies in which the Company conducts its operations which may be less favorable than expected and may result in, among other things, a deterioration in the credit quality and value of the Company's assets.   The effects of recent financial market disruptions, and monetary and other governmental actions designed to address such disruptions.   The financial strength of the counterparties with which the Company or the Company's customers do business and as to which the Company has investment or financial exposure.  Page 37 Index  HILLS BANCORPORATION   The credit quality and credit agency ratings of the securities in the Company's investment securities portfolio, a deterioration or downgrade of which could lead to other-than-temporary impairment of the affected securities and the recognition of an impairment loss.   The effects of, and changes in, laws, regulations and policies affecting banking, securities, insurance and monetary and financial matters as well as any laws otherwise affecting the Company.   The effects of changes in interest rates (including the effects of changes in the rate of prepayments of the Company's assets) and the policies of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.   The ability of the Company to compete with other financial institutions as effectively as the Company currently intends due to increases in competitive pressures in the financial services sector.   The ability of the Company to obtain new customers and to retain existing customers.   The timely development and acceptance of products and services, including products and services offered through alternative electronic delivery channels.   Technological changes implemented by the Company and by other parties, including third party vendors, which may be more difficult or more expensive than anticipated or which may have unforeseen consequences to the Company and its customers.   The ability of the Company to develop and maintain secure and reliable electronic systems.   The ability of the Company to retain key executives and employees and the difficulty that the Company may experience in replacing key executives and employees in an effective manner.   Consumer spending and saving habits which may change in a manner that affects the Company's business adversely.   The economic impact of natural disasters, terrorist attacks and military actions.   Business combinations and the integration of acquired businesses and assets which may be more difficult or expensive than expected.   The costs, effects and outcomes of existing or future litigation.   Changes in accounting policies and practices that may be adopted by state and federal regulatory agencies and the Financial Accounting Standards Board.   The ability of the Company to manage the risks associated with the foregoing as well as anticipated.  These risks and uncertainties should be considered in evaluating forward-looking statements, and undue reliance should not be placed on such statements. Additional information concerning the Company and its business, including other factors that could materially affect the Company's financial results, is included in the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Page 38 Index  HILLS BANCORPORATION  Critical Accounting Policies  The Company's consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The financial information contained within these financial statements is, to a significant extent, financial information that is based on approximate measures of the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred. Based on its consideration of accounting policies that involve the most complex and subjective decisions and assessments, management has identified its most critical accounting policies to be those which are related to the allowance for loan losses. The Company's allowance for loan losses methodology incorporates a variety of risk considerations, both quantitative and qualitative in establishing an allowance for loan losses that management believes is appropriate at each reporting date. Quantitative factors include the Company's historical loss experience, delinquency and charge-off trends, collateral values, changes in impaired loans, and other factors. Quantitative factors also incorporate known information about individual loans, including borrowers' sensitivity to interest rate movements. Qualitative factors include the general economic environment in the Company's markets, including economic conditions throughout the Midwest and the state of certain industries. Determinations relating to the possible level of future loan losses are based in part on subjective judgments by management. Future loan losses in excess of current estimates, could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial position. Size and complexity of individual credits in relation to loan structure, existing loan policies and pace of portfolio growth are other qualitative factors that are considered in the methodology. As the Company adds new products and increases the complexity of its loan portfolio, it will enhance its methodology accordingly. This discussion of the Company's critical accounting policies should be read in conjunction with the Company's consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes presented elsewhere herein, as well as other relevant portions of Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Although management believes the levels of the allowance as of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 were adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio, a decline in local economic conditions, or other factors, could result in increasing losses that cannot be reasonably predicted at this time.  Overview  This overview highlights selected information and may not contain all of the information that is important to you in understanding our performance during the period. For a more complete understanding of trends, events, commitments, uncertainties, liquidity, capital resources, and critical accounting estimates, you should carefully read this entire report.  The Company is a holding company engaged in the business of commercial banking. The Company's subsidiary is Hills Bank and Trust Company, Hills, Iowa (the "Bank"), which is wholly-owned. The Bank was formed in Hills, Iowa in 1904. The Bank is a full-service commercial bank extending its services to individuals, businesses, governmental units and institutional customers primarily in the communities of Hills, Iowa City, Coralville, North Liberty, Lisbon, Mount Vernon, Kalona, Wellman, Cedar Rapids, Marion, and Washington, Iowa. At March 31, 2016, the Bank has eighteen full-service locations.  Net income for the three month period ended March 31, 2016 was $7.70 million compared to $7.38 million for the same three months of 2015, an increase of 4.34%. The $0.32 million increase in net income was caused by a number of factors. The principal factors in the increase in net income for the first three months of 2016 are an increase in net interest income of $1.09 million and a decrease in noninterest expenses of $0.15 million. These changes were offset by an increase in income tax expense of $0.19 million, a decrease in noninterest income of $0.12 million, and an increase in the provision for loan losses of $0.61 million.  The Company achieved a return on average assets of 1.19% and a return on average equity of 11.19% for the twelve months ended March 31, 2016, compared to the twelve months ended March 31, 2015, which were 1.22% and 11.02%, respectively. Dividends of $0.65 per share were paid in January 2016 to 2,334 shareholders. The 2015 dividend was $0.625 per share.  The Company's net interest income is the largest component of revenue and it is primarily a function of the average earning assets and the net interest margin percentage. The Company achieved a net interest margin on a tax-equivalent basis of 3.40% for the three months ended March 31, 2016 compared to 3.50% for the same three months of 2015. Average earning assets were $2.406 billion year to date in 2016 and $2.234 billion in 2015.  Page 39 Index  HILLS BANCORPORATION  Highlights noted on the balance sheet as of March 31, 2016 for the Company included the following:   Total assets were $2.599 billion, an increase of $105.88 million since December 31, 2015.   Cash and cash equivalents were $133.67 million, an increase of $98.25 million since December 31, 2015. Cash and cash equivalents growth included approximately $80.00 million of temporary public funds.   Net loans were $2.116 billion, an increase of $10.92 million since December 31, 2015. Loans held for sale decreased $0.98 million since December 31, 2015.   Deposits increased $88.88 million since December 31, 2015. Deposit growth included approximately $80.00 million of temporary public funds.   Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings increased $15.00 million since December 31, 2015.  Reference is made to Note 6 for a discussion of fair value measurements which relate to methods used by the Company in recording assets and liabilities on its financial statements.  Financial Condition The following table sets forth the composition of the loan portfolio as of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015: March 31, 2016 December 31, 2015 Amount Percent Amount Percent (Amounts In Thousands) (Amounts In Thousands) Agricultural $ 90,620 4.24 % $ 101,588 4.78 % Commercial and financial 173,736 8.13 184,199 8.67 Real estate: Construction, 1 to 4 family residential 58,293 2.73 51,346 2.42 Construction, land development and commercial 105,607 4.94 83,121 3.91 Mortgage, farmland 189,882 8.88 187,856 8.84 Mortgage, 1 to 4 family first liens 725,924 33.96 727,160 34.22 Mortgage, 1 to 4 family junior liens 118,115 5.53 117,873 5.55 Mortgage, multi-family 284,715 13.32 271,974 12.80 Mortgage, commercial 315,965 14.78 323,409 15.22 Loans to individuals 22,959 1.07 24,019 1.13 Obligations of state and political subdivisions 51,623 2.42 52,371 2.46 $ 2,137,439 100.00 % $ 2,124,916 100.00 % Net unamortized fees and costs 766 768 $ 2,138,205 $ 2,125,684 Less allowance for loan losses 27,130 26,510 $ 2,111,075 $ 2,099,174  Page 40 Index  HILLS BANCORPORATION  Loan demand has been increasing and is expected to increase throughout the year ending December 31, 2016 and into 2017. As indicated in the table above, growth in the construction and multi-family real estate loans have been primarily responsible for the increase in total loans.  The Bank has an established formal loan origination policy. In general, the loan origination policy attempts to reduce the risk of credit loss to the Bank by requiring, among other things, maintenance of minimum loan to value ratios, evidence of appropriate levels of insurance carried by borrowers and documentation of appropriate types and amounts of collateral and sources of expected payment. The collateral relied upon in the loan origination policy is generally the property being financed by the Bank. The source of expected payment is generally the income produced from the property being financed. Personal guarantees are required of individuals owning or controlling at least 20% of the ownership of an entity. Limited or proportional guarantees may be accepted in circumstances if approved by the Company's Board of Directors. Financial information provided by the borrower is verified as considered necessary by reference to tax returns, or audited, reviewed or compiled financial statements. The Bank does not originate subprime loans. In order to modify, restructure or otherwise change the terms of a loan, the Bank's policy is to evaluate each borrower situation individually. Modifications, restructures, extensions and other changes are done to improve the Bank's position and to protect the Bank's capital. If a borrower is not current with its payments, any additional loans to such borrowers are evaluated on an individual borrower basis.  The Company has not experienced any significant time lapses in recognizing the required provisions for collateral dependent loans, nor has the Company delayed appropriate charge offs. When an updated appraisal value has been obtained, the Company has used the appraisal amount in determining the appropriate charge off or required reserve. The Company also evaluates any changes in the financial condition of the borrower and guarantors (if applicable), economic conditions, and the Company's loss experience with the type of property in question. Any information utilized in addition to the appraisal is intended to identify additional charge offs or provisions, not to override the appraised value.  In accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 102, Selected Loan Loss Allowance Methodology and Documentation Issues, the Company determines and assigns ratings to loans using factors that include the following: an assessment of the financial condition of the borrower; a realistic determination of the value and adequacy of underlying collateral; the condition of the local economy and the condition of the specific industry of the borrower; an analysis of the levels and trends of loan categories; and a review of delinquent and classified loans.  Through the credit risk rating process, loans are reviewed to determine if they are performing in accordance with the original contractual terms. If the borrower has failed to comply with the original contractual terms, further action may be required by the Company, including a downgrade in the credit risk rating, movement to non-accrual status, a charge-off or the establishment of a specific impairment reserve. In the event a collateral shortfall is identified during the credit review process, the Company will work with the borrower for a principal reduction and/or a pledge of additional collateral and/or additional guarantees. In the event that these options are not available, the loan may be subject to a downgrade of the credit risk rating. If the Company determines a loan amount or portion thereof, is uncollectible, the loan's credit risk rating may be downgraded and the uncollectible amount charged-off or recorded as a specific allowance for losses. The Bank's credit and legal departments undertake a thorough and ongoing analysis to determine if additional impairment and/or charge-offs are appropriate and to begin a workout plan for the loan to minimize actual losses.  Page 41 Index   HILLS BANCORPORATION The following table presents the allowance for loan losses on loans by loan category, the percentage of the allowance for each category to the total allowance, and the percentage of all loans in each category to total loans as of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015: March 31, 2016 December 31, 2015 % of Total % of Loans to % of Total % of Loans to Amount Allowance Total Loans Amount Allowance Total Loans (In Thousands) (In Thousands) Agricultural $ 2,954 10.89 % 4.24 % $ 3,082 11.63 % 4.78 % Commercial and financial 4,311 15.89 8.13 4,517 17.04 8.67 Real estate: Construction, 1 to 4 family residential 991 3.65 2.73 866 3.27 2.42 Construction, land development and commercial 1,768 6.52 4.94 1,414 5.33 3.91 Mortgage, farmland 3,944 14.54 8.88 3,342 12.61 8.84 Mortgage, 1 to 4 family first liens 6,805 25.08 33.96 6,931 26.14 34.22 Mortgage, 1 to 4 family junior liens 1,231 4.54 5.53 1,241 4.68 5.55 Mortgage, multi-family 1,758 6.48 13.32 1,713 6.46 12.80 Mortgage, commercial 2,432 8.96 14.78 2,510 9.47 15.22 Loans to individuals 549 2.02 1.07 501 1.89 1.13 Obligations of state and political subdivisions 387 1.43 2.42 393 1.48 2.46 $ 27,130 100.00 % 100.00 % $ 26,510 100.00 % 100.00 %  The allowance for loan losses totaled $27.13 million at March 31, 2016 compared to $26.51 million at December 31, 2015. The percentage of the allowance to outstanding loans was 1.27% and 1.25% at March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The allowance was based on management's consideration of a number of factors, including composition of the loan portfolio, loans with higher credit risks and the overall amount of loans outstanding. The increase in the allowance in 2016 is the result of an increase in net loans and a change in the composition and allocation of loans within credit quality ratings.  The adequacy of the allowance is reviewed quarterly and adjusted as appropriate after consideration has been given to the impact of economic conditions on the borrowers' ability to repay, loan collateral values, past collection experience, the risk characteristics of the loan portfolio and such other factors that deserve current recognition. The growth of the loan portfolio and the trends in problem and watch loans are significant elements in the determination of the provision for loan losses. Quantitative factors include the Company's historical loss experience, which is then adjusted for levels and trends in past due, levels and trends in charged-off and recovered loans, trends in volume growth, trends in problem and watch loans, trends in restructured loans, local economic trends and conditions, industry and other conditions, and effects of changing interest rates.  Management has determined that the allowance for loan losses was appropriate at March 31, 2016, and that the loan portfolio is diversified and secured, without undue concentration in any specific risk area. This process involves a high degree of management judgment; however, the allowance for loan losses is based on a comprehensive, well documented, and consistently applied analysis of the Company's loan portfolio. This analysis takes into consideration all available information existing as of the financial statement date, including environmental factors such as economic, industry, geographical and political factors. The relative level of allowance for loan losses is reviewed and compared to industry data. This review encompasses levels of total impaired loans, portfolio mix, portfolio concentrations, current geographic risks and overall levels of net charge-offs.  Residential real estate loan products that include features such as loan-to-values in excess of 100% or interest only payments, which expose a borrower to payment increases in excess of changes in the market interest rate, increase the credit risk of a loan. The Bank has not offered and does not intend to offer this type of loan product.  Page 42 Index  HILLS BANCORPORATION  Investment securities available for sale held by the Company decreased by $0.32 million from December 31, 2015 to March 31, 2016. The fair value of securities available for sale was $3.26 million more than the amortized cost of such securities as of March 31, 2016. At December 31, 2015, the fair value of the securities available for sale was $2.24 million more than the amortized cost of such securities.  Deposits increased $88.88 million in the first three months of 2016. Deposit growth included approximately $80.00 million of temporary public funds. Repurchase agreements increased $1.33 million and Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings increased $15.00 million since December 31, 2015. In the opinion of the Company's management, the Company continues to have sufficient liquidity resources available to fund expected additional loan growth.  Brokered deposits are included in total deposits and totaled $67.01 million as of March 31, 2016 with an average rate of 0.53%. Brokered deposits were $62.74 million as of December 31, 2015 with an average interest rate of 0.42%. As of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, brokered deposits were 3.38% and 3.32% of total deposits, respectively.  Dividends and Equity  In January 2016, Hills Bancorporation paid a dividend of $6.06 million or $0.65 per share. The dividend was $0.625 per share in January 2015. After payment of the dividend and the adjustment for accumulated other comprehensive income, stockholders' equity as of March 31, 2016 totaled $271.55 million. On January 1, 2015, the final rules of the Federal Reserve Board went into effect implementing in the United States the Basel III regulatory capital reforms from the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. The final rule also adopted changes to the agencies' regulatory capital requirements that meet the requirements of section 171 and section 939A of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.  Under the BASEL III rules, the minimum capital ratios are 4% for Tier 1 Leverage Capital Ratio, 4.5% for the Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio, 6% for the Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio and 8% for the Total Risk-Based Capital Ratio. As of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had regulatory capital in excess of the Federal Reserve's minimum and well-capitalized definition requirements.
