      Fitch Rates Ford Credit Auto Lease Trust 2014-A
    





March 26, 2014 03:26 PM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings assigns the following ratings to the Ford Credit Auto 
      Lease Trust 2014-A notes:
    

      --$230,000,000 class A-1 'F1+sf';--$132,000,000 class A-2A 
      'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$393,000,000 class A-2B 'AAAsf'; Outlook 
      Stable;--$375,000,000 class A-3 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$120,000,000 
      class A-4 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$70,290,000 class B 'AAsf'; 
      Outlook Stable;--$65,550,000 class C 'Asf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      Key Rating DriversStrong Credit Quality: Credit quality for the 
      pool is consistent with that of recent pools. The weighted average (WA) 
      Fair Isaac Corp. score is 745 and WA original term is 33.2 months; 
      81.44% of the pool consists of leases with terms of 36 months or less. 
      The pool is geographically diverse with approximately nine months 
      seasoning, and comprises 100% new vehicles.
    

      Adequate Credit Enhancement Structure: 2014-A is a sequential-pay 
      structure. Initial hard credit enhancement for the class A, B, and C 
      notes totals 20.40%, 15.90%, and 11.70%, respectively, consistent with 
      2013-B.
    

      Consistent Lease Maturities: 2014-A consists of 73.45% undiscounted base 
      residual value (RV), in line with prior pools. The residual lease 
      maturities are well distributed, with a highest single-month period in 
      December 2015 accounting for 6.28% and 54.01% of the pool maturing 
      within two years from the transaction's close.
    

      Evolving Wholesale Market: The U.S. wholesale vehicle market has 
      remained strong in recent years. However, increasing off-lease vehicle 
      supply and pressure from increased production levels could lead to 
      decreased residual realizations during the life of the transaction.
    

      Stable Corporate Health: Fitch currently rates Ford's (the parent of 
      Ford Credit) and Ford Credit's long-term IDR 'BBB-' with a Stable 
      Outlook.
    

      Consistent Origination/Underwriting/Servicing: Ford Credit demonstrates 
      good capabilities as originator, underwriter, and servicer. This is 
      evidenced by historical delinquency, credit, and residual value loss 
      performance of its managed portfolio and securitizations. Fitch deems 
      Ford Credit capable of adequately servicing 2014-A.
    

      Rating Sensitivity:
    

      Unanticipated decreases in the value of returned vehicles and/or 
      increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity on defaulted 
      receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base case and 
      could result in potential rating actions on the notes. Fitch's analysis 
      found that the transaction displays some sensitivity to increased 
      defaults and credit losses, showing downgrades of one notch under 
      Fitch's 1.5x base case loss scenario, while experiencing downgrades of 
      at least one rating category under Fitch's severe (2.5x base case loss) 
      scenario. The transaction shows significantly more sensitivity to 
      residual loss volatility; under Fitch's severe residual loss scenario, 
      all classes of notes would be expected to be downgraded by three or more 
      rating categories.
    

      Key Rating Drivers and Rating Sensitivities are further described in the 
      presale report dated March 17, 2014. Fitch's analysis of the 
      Representations and Warranties (R&W) of this transaction can be found in 
      'Ford Credit Auto Lease Trust 2014-A - Appendix'. This R&W is compared 
      to those of typical R&W for the asset class as detailed in the special 
      report 'Representations, Warranties, and Enforcement Mechanisms in 
      Global Structured Finance Transactions' dated April 17, 2012.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

Fitch to Rate Ford Credit Auto Lease Trust 2014-A; Issues PresaleHomeMailFlickrTumblrNewsSportsFinanceCelebrityAnswersGroupsMobileMoreTry Yahoo Finance on Firefox »YahooSearchSearchSign inU.S. Markets closedS&P 5002,472.10-3.32 (-0.13%)Dow 3021,830.31+33.76 (+0.15%)Nasdaq6,374.68-7.51 (-0.12%)Fitch to Rate Ford Credit Auto Lease Trust 2014-A; Issues PresaleReutersMarch 17, 2014ReblogShareTweetShareMarch 17 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)Fitch Ratings expects to assign the following ratings and Rating Outlooks to the Ford Credit Auto Lease Trust 2014-A notes:--$230,000,000 class A-1 'F1+sf';--$132,000,000 class A-2A 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$393,000,000 class A-2B 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$375,000,000 class A-3 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$120,000,000 class A-4 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$70,290,000 class B 'AAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$65,550,000 class C 'Asf'; Outlook Stable.KEY RATING DRIVERSStrong Credit Quality: Credit quality for the pool is consistent with that of recent pools. The weighted average (WA) Fair Isaac Corp. (FICO) score is 745 and WA original term is 33.2 months; 81.44% of the pool consists of leases with terms of 36 months or less. The pool is geographically diverse with approximately nine months seasoning, and comprises 100% new vehicles.Adequate Credit Enhancement Structure: 2014-A is a sequential-pay structure. Initial hard credit enhancement for the class A, B, and C notes totals 20.40%, 15.90%, and 11.70%, respectively, consistent with 2013-B.Consistent Lease Maturities: 2014-A consists of 73.45% undiscounted base residual value (RV), in line with prior pools. The residual lease maturities are well distributed, with a highest single-month period in December 2015 accounting for 6.28% and 54.01% of the pool maturing within two years from the transaction's close.Evolving Wholesale Market: The U.S. wholesale vehicle market has remained strong in recent years. However, increasing off-lease vehicle supply and pressure from increased production levels could lead to decreased residual realizations during the life of the transaction.Stable Corporate Health: Fitch currently rates Ford's (the parent of Ford Credit) and Ford Credit's long-term IDR 'BBB-' with a Stable Outlook. Consistent Origination/Underwriting/Servicing: Ford Credit demonstrates good capabilities as originator, underwriter, and servicer. This is evidenced by historical delinquency, credit, and residual value loss performance of its managed portfolio and securitizations. Fitch deems Ford Credit capable of adequately servicing 2014-A.RATING SENSITIVITIESUnanticipated decreases in the value of returned vehicles and/or increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity on defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base case. This in turn could result in negative rating actions on the notes. Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to Ford Credit Auto Lease Trust 2014-A to increased credit and residual losses over the life of the transaction.Fitch's analysis found that the transaction displays some sensitivity to increased defaults and credit losses, showing downgrades of one rating category under Fitch's 1.5x base case loss scenario. Additionally, downgrades of one or two rating categories were seen under Fitch's severe (2.5x base case loss) scenario. The transaction shows significantly more sensitivity to residual loss volatility. As such, under its severe residual loss scenario, Fitch would expect to downgrade the class of notes by two or more rating categories.The presale report is available at 'www.fitchratings.com' or by clicking on the below link.Link to Fitch Ratings' Report: Ford Credit Auto Lease Trust 2014-A (US ABS)ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextSpanish Economy Expands at Fastest Pace in Almost Two YearsBloombergEngineer Finds Pattern; Makes Millions in StocksMoney MorningSponsoredThe 'two pizza rule' is a secret to productive meetings that helped Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos become one of the world's richest menBusiness InsiderThe real reason overseas manufacturing is coming to AmericaYahoo FinanceTax cuts just got more likelyYahoo FinanceZuckerberg Wife's Ambitious Secret Finally ExposedUNewz.MeSponsoredAll the companies in Jeff Bezos’s empire, in one (large) chartMarketWatchChevron and Exxon Mobil have a tough path ahead: NYSE traderYahoo Finance VideoStocks mixed after heavy earnings weekYahoo FinanceDiscover it: 4.8 out of 5 avg. by 24K+ customersDiscover CardSponsoredAPNewsBreak: Yellowstone to punish workers for misconductAssociated PressNorth Korea 2nd ICBM test puts much of US in range: expertsAssociated PressSean Hannity responds to claim he ran up a $42,000 tab at Trump's hotel after flying in a 70-year-old lobster from MaineBusiness InsiderWhat's the Problem with Joel Osteen?ChurchLeaders.comSponsoredVietnam says others should respect its right to drill for South China Sea oilReutersMy bullish view on stocks hasn't changed one iota: NYSE traderYahoo Finance VideoMcCain’s ‘no’ vote on GOP health bill elicits gasps in Senate chamberButch: We will never have a decent national healthcare plan unless Congress is willing to include themselves.
