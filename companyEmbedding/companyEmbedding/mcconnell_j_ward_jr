J. Ward McConnell Jr.: From Dealer to Manufacturer and Back Again

By Lynn Marcinkowski Woolf

The vice chairman of Art’s Way Mfg. recently opened a dealership in Marietta, Ohio, carrying the Branson tractor line and Big Tex trailers.
J. Ward McConnell Jr., former chairman of Art’s Way Mfg., recently celebrated the opening of his new Branson tractor dealership, Crescent-McConnell Tractors & Equipment, in Marietta, Ohio. McConnell says he’s been a dealer since 1956. He just happened to take a 56-year break to pursue a series of farm equipment manufacturing investments, including selling a tractor line to AGCO in 1995 and another company to Art’s Way Manufacturing in 1996.
He assumed the role of chairman of Art’s Way in 2002 and during his 13-year tenure as chair, he quadrupled the size of the company and earned recognition from Forbes magazine as being one of the best small companies in America. He retired from the chairman position in 2015 and continues to serve as a director on the board and vice chairman. His son, Marc McConnell, now serves as chairman.
Why, at 86 years old, is McConnell starting on a new venture? Lots of reasons and as McConnell shared the background regarding his new dealership, I was impressed by the life and business lessons he shared.
First, look for opportunities. McConnell says that after so many years in the business, he is regularly approached by those with a business to sell and, often, those businesses are in a distressed state. That’s how he came to own a plumbing and electrical supply company in Marietta. “If there’s a remaining business, I can generally turn it around and be profitable,” McConnell says.
After looking for opportunities, look for more opportunities. For instance, when McConnell surveyed the site of the plumbing and electrical business, he saw a new possibility. “There are three buildings on the property and I looked at one of the buildings that sat mostly empty and said, ‘That looks pretty good for a tractor dealership,’” he says.        
The building is about 60 feet by 80 feet, has a large showroom window and faces a busy highway. He knew the timing was right to enter the rural equipment market. “The rural lifestyle market is very appealing. It’s the best market now,” he says.
Then, turn to people and products you trust. That’s how McConnell chose the Branson line. He learned about the line a few years ago from E.W. "Swede" Muehlhausen, who, at the time, was assisting Branson’s Korean management team in North America and who had also served as president of Art’s Way. “I had heard quite a bit about Branson and their reputation is outstanding. Branson requires much less commitment to get started as a dealer than other lines. Everything seemed to fit together so well,” McConnell says.
Crescent-McConnell is also carrying Big Tex trailers, a line that was recommended by Rob Graham, who handles sales for the dealership. Graham brings experience from working at a John Deere dealership as well as Tractor Supply Co.. Graham runs the day-to-day operations as McConnell is based in North Carolina. The two talk daily and the administration is handled from the North Carolina office.
Dive in, but don’t overcommit. The initial order was for 7 tractors and several rotary cutters. “It’s going to take a couple of years to get on our feet. It’s a new tractor brand, a new territory, a new everything for us.  We’re going to run a low profile for starters and grow from there,” McConnell says.
They stocked parts based on Branson’s recommendations and plan to add a service department.
Be smart. McConnell has seen a lot of dealers come and go throughout his career and he offers this advice, “A lot of dealers have gone under because they start handling a lot of money and start spending the money personally. More people seem to go broke because of personal spending,” he says.
Finally, a love of the business doesn’t hurt. “I enjoy being in business and I enjoy coming to work every day. I’ve been doing it so long now that I don’t know how not to do it.”
Incorporating any one of these lessons could bring about good changes at your dealership.

Sales: Consolidated sales increased 5.7%, from $34,227,000 in fiscal year 2013 to $36,170,000 in fiscal year 2014. This increase was largely due to the revenues from our acquisition of Ohio Metal Tools in September 2013. The added sales of our Tools segment were somewhat offset by decreased sales at our Vessels and Modular Buildings segments.
Income: Total operating income decreased from $1,817,000 in fiscal year 2013 to $1,665,000 in fiscal year 2014, while net income for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2014 decreased from $1,551,000 to $935,000, a decrease of 39.7%. This decrease is largely attributable to the gain on sale of land in fiscal 2013 of $630,000.
Earnings per Share: Earnings per basic and diluted share for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2014 were $0.23, a decrease of $0.15 from the fiscal year 2013 earnings per basic and diluted share.
Chairman of the Art’s Way Board of Directors, J. Ward McConnell Jr., reports,
“Our core agricultural product lines are poised for growth in 2015. We are excited about our new agricultural product launches scheduled in 2015 that will satisfy a wider range of customer needs. We also believe the strength in the current livestock markets will drive sales growth in our various product lines that serve the industry. We have increased distribution points throughout the continental United States, and we are excited about the opportunities to increase our agricultural export sales in fiscal 2015.”

Net Sales: 
 
Our consolidated corporate sales for the three- and nine-month periods ended August 31, 2014 were $11,585,000 and $27,291,000, respectively, compared to $9,350,000 and $27,016,000 during the same respective periods in 2013, a $2,234,000 or 23.9%, increase for the quarter and a $275,000 or 1.0% increase year-to-date. The increase in revenue for the three month period ended August 31, 2014 was primarily due to increases in revenue at Manufacturing and revenues generated from our new tools segment, formed following the acquisition of Ohio Metals in the fourth quarter of 2013. For the nine-month period ended August 31, 2014, Manufacturing, Vessels and Scientific each experienced a decline in revenue, which was offset by the addition of revenue generated from Metals. Consolidated gross profit margin for the three- and nine-month periods ending August 31, 2014 was 23.3% and 23.3% compared to 18.5% and 24.7% during the same periods of 2013.
 
 
 
Manufacturing: 
 
Our third quarter sales at Manufacturing were $9,362,000, compared to $8,005,000 during the same period of 2013, an increase of $1,357,000, or 17.0%. The nine-month sales for 2014 at Manufacturing were $21,366,000, compared to $22,727,000 for the same period in 2013, a 6.0% decrease. The decrease in revenue year to date is primarily due to decreased demand for the Universal Harvester reels and reduced sugar beet harvester sales in fiscal 2014 as compared to 2013, but was offset somewhat by sales from our acquisition of certain Canadian assets from Agro Trend and increased demand for our grinder mixers. Manufacturing’s gross margin for the quarter ended August 31, 2014 was 25.0%, compared to 19.4% for the same period in 2013. For the year to date period ending August 31, 2014 gross margin was 24.8% as compared to 24.3% in the same period for 2013.
 
 
 
Vessels: 
 
Our three- and nine-months sales at Vessels were $606,000 and $1,504,000, respectively, compared to $635,000 and $1,671,000 for the same periods in 2013, a decrease of $29,000, or 4.5% and $166,000, or 9.9%. Gross margin for the quarter ended August 31, 2014 was 6.8% compared to 16.4% for the same period in 2013. Gross margin for the nine-months ended August 31, 2014 was 6.4% as compared to 10.0% for the first nine-months of fiscal 2013.
 
 
Scientific: 
 
Our third fiscal quarter and year-to-date sales at Scientific were $820,000 and $1,818,000, respectively, compared to $710,000 and $2,618,000 for the same periods in fiscal 2013, an increase of $111,000, or 15.6% and a decrease of $800,000, or 30.5%, respectively. The year to date decrease was primarily attributable to the 2013 first quarter finalization of an approximately $7 million fabrication and delivery contract executed in January 2012 and an approximately $1.7 million installation contract executed in April 2012. Scientific was hired to design, fabricate, and install twenty-four modular units over the course of approximately one year for one of the world’s leading research and teaching institutions. Scientific uses the percentage of completion accounting method to calculate revenue and gross margins for all contracts. Gross margin for the quarter ended August 31, 2014 was 20.2% compared to 10.1% for the same period in 2013, while gross margin for the nine-month period ended August 31, 2014 was 15.5% as compared to 37.3% for the same period in 2013. The margins reported in first two quarters of 2013 were a result of the finalization of costs as compared to estimates on the major projects described above and did not reflect normal operating margin for the business. The lower margin year to date for 2014 is primarily attributable to the lower revenue relative to steady overhead costs.
 
 
Metals: 
 
Metals had sales of $797,000 and $2,603,000 for the three- and nine-months ended August 31, 2014, respectively. Gross margin at Metals was 19.8% for the third fiscal quarter, and 26.9% for the nine months ended August 31, 2014.
 
 
Income: Consolidated net income was $558,000 for the three-month period ended August 31, 2014, compared to a net income of $26,000 for the same respective period in 2013. This increase is due to increased operating income of $889,000 at our Manufacturing segment, but was offset by operating losses at our Vessels and Metals divisions. Our consolidated net income for the nine-month period ended August 31, 2014 was $553,000 as compared to $1,360,000 for the same period in 2013. The sale of land described previously and the 2014 year-to-date decrease in revenue at Scientific and Vessels account for the majority of this reduction, but were partially offset by incremental revenues at our new Metals entity.
 
 
Earnings per Share: 
 
Earnings per basic and diluted share during the third fiscal quarter ended August 31, 2014 were $0.14 compared to $0.01for the same period during 2013. Earnings per basic and diluted share during the nine months ended August 31, 2014 were $0.14 compared to $0.34 for the same period in 2013. These changes were attributable to the changes in net income discussed above.
 
Chairman of the Art’s Way Board of Directors, J. Ward McConnell Jr., reports, “After a challenging first two quarters in fiscal 2014, we are pleased to show an increase in revenues on both a quarterly and year to date basis over the prior year. Our agricultural sales are strong, and we’ve seen an increase in backlog over last year in every segment. Our products serving the livestock and dairy sectors have been very strong and are providing the counter-cyclical strength and stability we seek during times of weak row-crop commodity prices.”
