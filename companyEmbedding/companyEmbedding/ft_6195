It fits right in the truck. I got the mat and bed cover to make my truck more useful to my wife who has the kids all day. She can now put the stroller, groceries and anything else in the bed of the truck with out having them slide all over the place. It also reduces the road noise of items bouncing in the bed. I love my bed mat.Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: new | Sold by: ecustomhitch(0)(0)by karinchadelphiaJun 29, 2017Bed matCame very quick it was heavy as hell great mat thanks againVerified purchase: Yes | Condition: new | Sold by: got-chrome(0)(0)by lucyjack14Jul 25, 2017Good purchaseItem is of good quality fits my 2016 RamVerified purchase: Yes | Condition: new | Sold by: burkartautomotive(0)(0)by mikmaxJul 01, 2016Rubber Bed MatThis is an incredibly durable and heavy duty mat.

Power bulge of 10 percent
Greater tractor productivity
Responsive power reducing the need to downshift the transmission

Details
To match the engine power characteristics and improve the operation economy of the machine, the rated engine speed is 2100 rpm.Series turbochargers
Overview
The PowerTech PSS 4.5L and 6.8L engines utilize two turbochargers – a VGT and a fixed geometry turbocharger. This provides the torque rise and engine response needed to meet varying load conditions.
Fresh air is first drawn into the low-pressure fixed geometry turbocharger and compressed to a higher pressure. The compressed, higher pressure air is then drawn into the high-pressure VGT where the air is further compressed. By splitting the work between two turbochargers, both can operate at peak efficiency and at slower rotating speeds.



PowerTech PSS engine series turbochargers





Benefits

Deliver high-power density
More low-speed torque and responsiveness to meet varying load conditions

VGT
OverviewThe VGT is electronically controlled and actuates the turbo vanes as required to maintain peak engine performance. PowerTech PVS 6.8L engines only have a VGT turbocharger.The turbocharger’s vanes are in the exhaust flow. The opening or closing of the vanes changes the outlet volume and airflow speed against the turbocharger turbine. When exhaust flow is low, the vanes are partially closed. This partial closure increases the pressure against the turbine blades to make the turbocharger spin faster and generate more boost pressure.The ability to keep the airflow at optimum levels provides more consistent engine boost pressure and the ability to respond to load quickly across the entire engine rpm range. This system is without the turbo lag that can be found on some engines.



PowerTech VGT





Benefits

Increased low rpm torque 
Quicker response to load
Increased peak torque
Improved fluid economy
Improved performance at high altitudes

Air-to-air after cooling
OverviewAir-to-air after cooling lowers the intake manifold air temperature and provides more efficient cooling while reducing cylinder firing pressure and temperatures for greater engine reliability. Since lower temperature air is denser, a higher volume of air flows into cylinders so the engine is capable of meeting the increasing horsepower demands. Lowering the intake manifold and cylinder temperatures also aids in lowering the combustion temperature, which lowers the NOx produced as a result.
Benefits

Higher horsepower
Less NOx production

HPCR fuel injection system
OverviewEvery PowerTech PSS 4.5L and 6.8L engine utilizes a HPCR fuel system to efficiently supply fuel to injectors. The high-pressure fuel pump instantly responds to requirements for more or less fuel flow or pressure. This electronically controlled, high-pressure pump delivers pressure on demand according to the application requirements. Pressure on demand ensures an efficient injection system resulting in high-injection pressure independent of engine speed.



High-pressure common rail





Benefits

Instantly respond to load changes reducing the need to change gears
Improved fluid economy

Engine control unit (ECU)OverviewThe ECU uses signal inputs from sensors and pre-programmed performance modeling to control critical engine functions such as fuel quantity, injection timing, air-to-fuel ratio, multiple fuel injections, amount of cooled exhaust gas recirculation (EGR), and a host of other control parameters.



ECU





Benefits

Optimized fluid economy
Maximum engine performance

DetailsEach injector is controlled individually by the ECU. The ECU turns the injector on and off during each firing cycle to control the fuel delivery into each cylinder.
Load and speed sensing allows each cylinder’s fuel delivery rate to be adjusted independently at the individual injector. With each injection cycle, the ECU can make the following adjustments on the go:

Number of injections
Fuel pressure in the common rail
Start of injection
Duration of injection

This management system is connected to the transmission, allowing the engine and transmission to respond simultaneously.
Cold weather and high-altitude compensation are also precisely controlled for quality starts regardless of weather and maximum performance at high elevations. The ECU also features improved diagnostic capabilities. It is faster, has more working memory, and is responsible for monitoring and executing all aspects of the integrated emission control system.

Benefits


This unique solution achieves higher payloads without increasing tractor weight, thus increasing productivity.
The engine is separated from the full-frame design using rubber bushings. This method reduces the noise and vibration from the engine, ultimately improving tractor uptime and operator comfort.
Full frame carries the load while the powertrain transmits engine power to the final drive. This reduces stress on mechanical components thus improving uptime and reducing costs of operation. 
Higher power density is delivered by separating the load carrying components from the power transmitting components, allowing optimized designs and operator performance.
Loader brackets mounted directly to the full frame, therefore loader forces are not transmitted to the engine or transmission.






Improved serviceability

Frame mounting allows easier component accessibility without disturbing other systems.
Complete modular component replacement, such as transmission and engine is achieved without splitting the tractor in half.

Field Office



Field Office shown in 6030 Premium Series Tractor



Field Office shown in 6030 Premium Series Tractor



The Field Office for ComfortGardTM cab tractors is designed to store a laptop computer, cellular phone, papers, calculators, writing utensils, and many other small items. By providing a complete office away from the home, this unit improves efficiency in managing farm operations.
 
The lid is a flat surface, and it provides an ideal place for writing. The entire Field Office is removable, so it can go with operators wherever they desire. The Field Office base is equipped with a three-pin electrical power source, unless ordered with the optional refrigerator (6030 Premium Series only).
The handle locks the case in position, and an optional cup holder is incorporated into the Field Office base.
For 6030 Series Premium Cab Tractors, the Field Office can be ordered with an optional refrigerator, both as a field-installed attachment and as a factory-installed option.



NOTE: Field Office with cup holder is not compatible with the instructional seat. Due to the special configuration of low-clearance cab tractors, this attachment will not be factory-installed.

Power strip installed


The power strip provides six additional electrical outlets that give either permanent or ignition-key-controlled power for such items as:



          Computers
         


          Portable telephone chargers
         


          Implement monitor
         


          Implement supply
         


          12-V and up to 30-amp total current can be taken from these outlets
         

 
The power strip is not a surge suppressor. Electrical equipment with program memory or capacity for data storage requires protection from the damage of electrical surges and spikes that could occur in systems without transient voltage protection.
