GET STARTED FOR AS LITTLE AS $0 DOWN




BrightSave Monthly:

Start saving with $0 down today.



Sunrun's BrightSave™ Monthly makes going solar and saving on your electric bill about as easy as it gets. You can get started for little to $0 down and you just pay a low, locked-in rate for the solar power the system produces over your 20-year agreement. With BrightSave Monthly, you only pay for the solar power, not the solar panels, which helps you save 20% on your electricity bill.* Not only that, Sunrun takes complete care of the system. We guarantee solar system performance and if the system doesn’t produce the electricity we promised—for any reason you’ll receive a refund for the difference.**








ENJOY TOTAL PEACE OF MIND AND MAXIMIZE SAVINGS




BrightSave Prepaid

Electricity costs keep rising, but with Sunrun's BrightSave™ Prepaid, you purchase all your solar power upfront, locking in 20 years of electricity at today’s prices. You buy the power not the panels, so because Sunrun owns your system, we take care of all the tax filing and paperwork. Even better, the upfront payment with BrightSave™ Prepaid can be less than owning your system outright. You get the benefit of owning your power without the hassle of maintenance or repairs. Sunrun takes complete care of the system. We guarantee solar system performance and if the system doesn’t produce the electricity we promised, you’ll receive a refund for the difference.**








PURCHASE A CUSTOMIZED SYSTEM FROM SUNRUN TODAY




BrightBuy

With Sunrun’s BrightBuy™, you purchase the entire solar system upfront, so you own your system and your savings. You just pay a one time upfront cost to Sunrun for the hardware and installation then you gain complete ownership of the system. That means no monthly payments or having to worry about rising energy costs, hidden fees, and surprise hikes on your electric bill. So whenever your power company raises their rates on your neighbors, you can pat yourself on the back for making the smart choice to go solar with Sunrun.








FINANCE YOUR SYSTEM AND START SAVING ON DAY 1




BrightAdvantage

Own your system with Sunrun’s hassle-free financing with BrightAdvantage™. This means fast approvals, low fixed interest rates, no upfront payment and no penalties associated with traditional solar loans—all while taking advantage of available solar tax credits and rebates. Loan options facilitated by Sunrun are unsecured (does not require you to use your house as collateral), free of any penalties or hidden provisions, and provide multiple term options at very competitive borrowing costs, giving you the freedom to go solar on your terms.

California home solar panels are what you need to stack up on savings
Get a Free Quote



 









Sunrun has saved Californians over $128,413,791* on their electric bills to date
Find out how easy it is to go solar with Sunrun and save on your electric bill.
From cable cars and Victorian homes, to the Sunset Strip and warm, sandy beaches—who doesn’t love California? But the cost of living in paradise… that’s a whole other story. If you take Alaska and Hawaii out of the mix, we pay more than any other state for our electricity!
But that’s all starting to change. You see, Californians are going solar in droves. In fact, there is enough solar energy installed in the state to power 4,272,836 homes1.
And with all the great incentives and rebates when you go solar, even more people are making the switch. California isn’t called the Golden State just because of its history.
With home solar panels from Sunrun, you can say goodbye to costly and unpredictable California energy rates. Sunlight is clean, renewable, and efficient. And when you use your solar system to produce power for your home, you can lock in a low rate for the lifetime of your solar system. That’s 20 years of savings with clean, affordable energy.
That sounds like a whole new sense of financial security and independence from the grid to us. What do you think?
We’re making going solar in California affordable


California has lots of things going on, and solar energy is one of them. That’s why Sunrun has set up shop here. We’re really committed to helping residents of this great state save money on their power bill — today, tomorrow, and in the future. And we have the experience and resources to do it. As the largest dedicated home solar company in the country, we’ve developed a personalized and simple process that allows you to enjoy the benefits of solar energy quickly and easily.
With just a simple phone call, you’ll be well on your way to getting a customized solar design for your home. This design is implemented by one of our extensive network of local partners.
By working with them, you can enjoy quick and professional solar installations from certified folks who live near you. They’re verified by Sunrun, so you can trust that you’re in good hands.
And, with our 24/7 monitoring of your solar system, you’ll have a lot less to worry about in the long-run. That’s because whether it’s an equipment failure or a simple checkup, Sunrun will be on it faster than you can say “solar savings”!
The best part is, all of our services are provided under flexible financing, including solar leases and PPA agreements, allowing you to benefit from solar on your own terms and within your budget.
So what’re you waiting for? Check out our service areas and see if we can help you make the switch in California today!

California residential electric rates have increased 441% over the last 35 years†

California home solar panels are what you need to stack up on savings
Get a Free Quote



 









Sunrun has saved Californians over $128,413,791* on their electric bills to date
Find out how easy it is to go solar with Sunrun and save on your electric bill.
From cable cars and Victorian homes, to the Sunset Strip and warm, sandy beaches—who doesn’t love California? But the cost of living in paradise… that’s a whole other story. If you take Alaska and Hawaii out of the mix, we pay more than any other state for our electricity!
But that’s all starting to change. You see, Californians are going solar in droves. In fact, there is enough solar energy installed in the state to power 4,272,836 homes1.
And with all the great incentives and rebates when you go solar, even more people are making the switch. California isn’t called the Golden State just because of its history.
With home solar panels from Sunrun, you can say goodbye to costly and unpredictable California energy rates. Sunlight is clean, renewable, and efficient. And when you use your solar system to produce power for your home, you can lock in a low rate for the lifetime of your solar system. That’s 20 years of savings with clean, affordable energy.
That sounds like a whole new sense of financial security and independence from the grid to us. What do you think?
We’re making going solar in California affordable


California has lots of things going on, and solar energy is one of them. That’s why Sunrun has set up shop here. We’re really committed to helping residents of this great state save money on their power bill — today, tomorrow, and in the future. And we have the experience and resources to do it. As the largest dedicated home solar company in the country, we’ve developed a personalized and simple process that allows you to enjoy the benefits of solar energy quickly and easily.
With just a simple phone call, you’ll be well on your way to getting a customized solar design for your home. This design is implemented by one of our extensive network of local partners.
By working with them, you can enjoy quick and professional solar installations from certified folks who live near you. They’re verified by Sunrun, so you can trust that you’re in good hands.
And, with our 24/7 monitoring of your solar system, you’ll have a lot less to worry about in the long-run. That’s because whether it’s an equipment failure or a simple checkup, Sunrun will be on it faster than you can say “solar savings”!
The best part is, all of our services are provided under flexible financing, including solar leases and PPA agreements, allowing you to benefit from solar on your own terms and within your budget.
So what’re you waiting for? Check out our service areas and see if we can help you make the switch in California today!
Electricity has been getting more expensive in California.
California residential electric rates have increased 441% over the last 35 years†

Tom & Glorianne's San Jose, CA Solar Story
Tom and Glorianne wanted to reduce their energy costs and fight global warming by getting . After considering proposals from several traditional PV installation companies which required them to purchase panels and perform their own maintenance, they heard about Sunrun.
Tom and Glorianne chose Sunrun because it gave them the lowest overall cost, in addition to the peace of mind that comes with Sunrun's maintenance and repair, and monitoring services.
Like many people, they were used to writing big monthly checks to their power company in San Jose. With their electricity rate rising steadily every year, it is no wonder they wanted to get a home solar system.
Because Sunrun offers a low fixed rate for home solar electricity that's less than their utility rate, Tom and Glorianne were able to reduce their monthly energy costs and easily budget for electricity over the long term.
Tom and Glorianne got proposals from several other companies for home solar in San Jose. Sunrun was able to save them over 50% of the upfront cost to make their San Jose home solar, and offer unbeatable long-term savings as well. For Tom and Gloriane, the long-term economic benefits of Sunrun's power purchase agreement (PPA) was undeniable. It was easy to see that Sunrun was the best deal available for solar in San Jose.
Since Sunrun guarantees the electricity generation from their system, Sunrun is on the hook to monitor and maintain the system at no additional cost. Because Sunrun only gets paid for performance, Tom and Glorianne are confident knowing that Sunrun will be watching their San Jose solar system like a hawk to make sure it delivers all the electricity Sunrun promises. Or they'll get money back.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

Tom & Glorianne's San Jose, CA Solar Story
Tom and Glorianne wanted to reduce their energy costs and fight global warming by getting . After considering proposals from several traditional PV installation companies which required them to purchase panels and perform their own maintenance, they heard about Sunrun.
Tom and Glorianne chose Sunrun because it gave them the lowest overall cost, in addition to the peace of mind that comes with Sunrun's maintenance and repair, and monitoring services.
Like many people, they were used to writing big monthly checks to their power company in San Jose. With their electricity rate rising steadily every year, it is no wonder they wanted to get a home solar system.
Because Sunrun offers a low fixed rate for home solar electricity that's less than their utility rate, Tom and Glorianne were able to reduce their monthly energy costs and easily budget for electricity over the long term.
Tom and Glorianne got proposals from several other companies for home solar in San Jose. Sunrun was able to save them over 50% of the upfront cost to make their San Jose home solar, and offer unbeatable long-term savings as well. For Tom and Gloriane, the long-term economic benefits of Sunrun's power purchase agreement (PPA) was undeniable. It was easy to see that Sunrun was the best deal available for solar in San Jose.
Since Sunrun guarantees the electricity generation from their system, Sunrun is on the hook to monitor and maintain the system at no additional cost. Because Sunrun only gets paid for performance, Tom and Glorianne are confident knowing that Sunrun will be watching their San Jose solar system like a hawk to make sure it delivers all the electricity Sunrun promises. Or they'll get money back.
