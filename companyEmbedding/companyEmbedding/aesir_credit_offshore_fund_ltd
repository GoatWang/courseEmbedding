May 22, 2012 James Heinsman 
Company Spotlight


	Next month Aesir Capital Management will launch a new fund, the Aesir Credit Master Fund Ltd. The chief executive and chief investment officer will be Mark Fishman, and it is going to be a fixed income hedge fund. Investments within the fund will focus on liquid and actively traded credit markets which may include investment-grade and high-yield bonds. Also included will be emerging markets credits.

	The exact size of the fund has not yet been announced, but one potential investor estimated the final fund size to be in the vicinity of $500 million.

	Mark Fishman was a star bond trader at the giant hedge fund SAC Capital.
