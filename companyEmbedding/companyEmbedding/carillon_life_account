This prospectus describes an individual flexible premium variable               
universal life insurance policy (the policy) offered by The Union               
Central Life Insurance Company ("Union Central," "we," "us" or                  
"our").  The policy is designed to provide insurance protection                 
on the insured named in the policy, and at the same time provide                
the owner ("you" or "your") with the flexibility to vary the                    
amount and timing of premium payments and to change the amount of               
death benefits payable under the policy.  This flexibility allows               
you to provide for your changing insurance needs under a single                 
insurance policy.                                                               

You also have the opportunity to allocate net premiums to one or                
more subdivisions of the variable account or to the guaranteed                  
account or to both.  This prospectus generally describes only                   
that portion of the account value allocated to the variable                     
account, through which account value is invested in subaccounts                 
of Carillon Life Account (the "separate account").  For a brief                 
summary of the guaranteed account, see "The Guaranteed Account,"                
page   .  The assets of each subaccount are invested in a                       
corresponding portfolio of Carillon Fund, Inc., Scudder Variable                
Life Investment Fund, American Century Variable Portfolios, Inc.                
(formerly known as TCI Portfolios, Inc.),or Templeton Variable                  
Products Series Fund.  The accompanying prospectuses provide                    
additional information regarding the portfolios.                                

You can select from two death benefit options available under the               
policy:  a level death benefit ("Option A") and a death benefit                 
that includes the account value ("Option B").  Union Central                    
guarantees that the death benefit will never be less than the                   
specified amount of insurance (less any outstanding policy debt                 
and past due charges) so long as sufficient premiums are paid to                
keep the policy in force.                                                       

The policy provides for a cash surrender value that can be                      
obtained by surrendering the policy.  Because this value is based               
on the performance of the portfolios to the extent that net                     
premiums are allocated to the variable account, there is no                     
guaranteed minimum cash surrender value.                                        

If the cash surrender value is insufficient to cover the charges                
due under the policy, the policy will lapse without value.                      
However, Union Central guarantees to keep the policy in force                   
during the minimum guaranteed period, so long as the minimum                    
monthly premium requirement and other conditions have been met.                 
The policy also permits loans and partial cash surrenders, within               
limits.                                                                         

It may not be advantageous to replace existing insurance with the               
policy.  Within certain limits, you may return the policy, or                   
convert it to a policy that provides benefits that do not vary                  
with the investment results of a separate account by exercising                 
the Conversion Right.                                                           

AN INVESTMENT IN THE POLICY IS NOT A DEPOSIT OR OBLIGATION OF, OR               
GUARANTEED OR ENDORSED BY, ANY BANK, NOR IS THE POLICY FEDERALLY                
INSURED BY THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION OR ANY OTHER               
GOVERNMENT AGENCY.  AN INVESTMENT IN THE POLICY INVOLVES CERTAIN                
RISKS, INCLUDING THE LOSS OF PREMIUM PAYMENTS (PRINCIPAL).                      
THESE SECURITIES HAVE NOT BEEN APPROVED OR DISAPPROVED BY THE

STATE SECURITIES COMMISSION PASSED UPON THE ACCURACY OR ADEQUACY                
OF THIS PROSPECTUS.  ANY REPRESENTATION TO THE CONTRARY IS A                    
CRIMINAL OFFENSE.

SUMMARY AND DIAGRAM OF THE POLICY                                               

The following summary of Prospectus information and diagram of                  
the policy should be read in conjunction with the detailed                      
information appearing elsewhere in this Prospectus.  Unless                     
otherwise indicated, the description of the policy in this                      
Prospectus assumes that the policy is in force and there is no                  
outstanding policy debt.                                                        

The policy is similar in many ways to fixed-benefit life                        
insurance.  As with fixed-benefit life insurance, the owner of a                
policy pays premium payments for insurance coverage on the person               
insured.  Also like fixed-benefit life insurance, the policy                    
provides for accumulation of net premiums and a cash surrender                  
value which is payable if the policy is surrendered during the                  
insured's lifetime.  As with fixed-benefit life insurance, the                  
cash surrender value during the early policy years is likely to                 
be substantially lower than the premium payments paid.                          

However, the policy differs from fixed-benefit life insurance in                
several important respects.  Unlike fixed-benefit life insurance,               
the death benefit may and the account value will increase or                    
decrease to reflect the investment performance of the                           
subdivisions to which the account value is allocated.  Also,                    
there is no guaranteed minimum cash surrender value.                            
Nonetheless, Union Central guarantees to keep the policy in force               
during the first three policy years so long as the minimum                      
monthly premium requirement has been met.  See "Minimum
Guaranteed Period," page   .  Otherwise, if the cash surrender                  
value is insufficient to pay charges due, the policy will lapse                 
without value after a grace period.  See "Premiums to Prevent                   
Lapse," page   .  If a policy lapses while loans are outstanding,               
adverse tax consequences may result.  See "Tax Considerations,"                 
page   .                                                                        

The most important features of the policy, such as charges, cash                
benefits, death benefits, and calculation of policy values, are                 
summarized in the diagram on the following pages.                               

Purpose of the Policy.  The policy is designed to be a long-term                
investment providing insurance benefits.  The policy should be                  
evaluated in conjunction with other insurance policies owned by                 
you, as well as your need for insurance and the policy's long-                  
term investment potential.  It may not be advantageous to replace               
existing insurance coverage with the policy.  In particular,                    
replacement should be carefully considered if the decision to                   
replace existing coverage is based primarily on a comparison of                 
policy illustrations (see below).                                               

Illustrations.  Illustrations in this prospectus or used in                     
connection with the purchase of a policy are based on                           
hypothetical rates of return.  These rates are not guaranteed.                  
They are illustrative only and should not be deemed a                           
representation of past or future performance.  Actual rates of                  
return may be higher or lower than those reflected in any                       
illustrations, and therefore, actual values will be different                   
from these illustrated.                                                         

Tax Considerations.  Union Central intends for the policy to                    
satisfy the definition of a life insurance contract under Section               
7702 of the Internal Revenue Code.  Certain policy transactions,                
including the payment of premiums, may cause a policy to be a                   
modified endowment contract under the Internal Revenue Code.  For               
further discussion of the tax status of a policy and the tax                    
consequences of being treated as a life insurance contract or a                 
modified endowment contract, see page   .                                       

Free Look Right to Cancel and Conversion Right.  For a limited                  
time after the policy is issued, you have the right to cancel                   
your policy and receive a refund.  See "Free Look Right to Cancel
Policy," page   .  Until the end of this "free look" period,                    
Union Central will allocate net premiums to the subaccount                      
investing in the Money Market Portfolio of the Scudder Variable                 
Life Investment Fund.  (See "Net Premium Allocations," page   .)                

At any time within the first 24 months after the issue date, you                
may transfer all or a portion of the variable account to the                    
guaranteed account without payment of any transfer fee.  This                   
transfer effectively "converts" the policy into a contract that                 
provides fixed (non-variable) benefits.  See "Conversion Right,"                
page   .                                                                        

Owner Inquiries.  If you have any questions, you may write or                   
call Union Central's home office at 1876 Waycross Road, P.O. Box

(the next two items are encased in one block)                                   

DEDUCTIONS FROM ACCOUNT VALUE               

*   Monthly deduction for cost of insurance, administrative                     
charge, and charges for any supplemental and/or rider benefits.                 
The administrative charge is currently $25.00 per month for the                 
first policy year and $5.00 per month thereafter.                               

DEDUCTIONS FROM ASSETS                      

*  Daily charge at a guaranteed annual rate of 0.75% during the                 
first ten policy years, and 0.25% thereafter, from the                    
subaccounts for mortality and expense risks.  See page   .                
This charge is not deducted from the guaranteed account.                  

*  Investment advisory fees and fund operating expenses are                     
deducted from the assets of each portfolio.  See page   .                 

(a down arrow is centered here between blocks)                                  

ACCOUNT VALUE                                     

*   Is the amount credited to your policy.  It is equal to net                  
premiums, as adjusted each valuation date to reflect                    
subdivision  investment experience, interest credited                   
on the guaranteed account, charges deducted and other                   
policy transactions (such as transfers and partial cash                 
surrenders).  See page   .                                              

*    Varies from day to day.  There is no minimum guaranteed                    
account value.  The policy may lapse if the cash surrender            
value is insufficient to cover a monthly deduction due.  See          
page   .                                                            

*    Can be transferred among the subdivisions and the guaranteed               
account.  Currently, a transfer fee of $10 applies to each            
transfer in excess of the first 12 transfers in a policy              
year.  See page    for rules and limits.  Policy loans                
reduce the amount available for allocations and transfers.            

*    Is the starting point for calculating certain values under a               
policy, such as the cash value, cash surrender value, and             
the death benefit used to determine death benefit proceeds.

one of the next two items which are blocked side by side)                       

CASH BENEFITS                                         

*    Loans may be taken for amounts up to 90% of the variable                   
account, plus 100% of the guaranteed account, less loan               
interest due on the next annual date and any surrender                
charges.  See page    for rules and limits.                           

*    Partial cash surrenders generally can be made provided there               
is sufficient remaining cash surrender value.  See page               
for rules and limits.                                                 

*    The policy may be surrendered in full at any time for its                  
cash surrender value.  A surrender charge will apply during           
the first fifteen policy years after issue and after any              
increase in specified amount. See page   .                            

*    Payment options are available.  See page   .                               

*    Loans, partial cash surrenders, and surrenders in full may                 
have adverse tax consequences.  See page   .                          

DEATH BENEFITS                                  

*    Income tax free to beneficiary.                                            

*    Available as lump sum or under a variety of payment options.               

*    For all policies, a minimum initial specified amount of                    
$50,000.                                                              

*    Two death benefit options available:                                       
Option A, equal to the specified amount, and Option B, equal          
to the specified amount plus account value.  See page   .             

*    Flexibility to change the death benefit option and specified               
amount.  See page    for rules and limits.                            

*    Supplemental and/or rider benefits may be available.  See

GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT UNION CENTRAL,                      
THE SEPARATE ACCOUNT AND THE PORTFOLIOS                       

The Union Central Life Insurance Company                                        

The policies are issued by The Union Central Life Insurance                     
Company, which is a mutual  life insurance company organized                    
under the laws of the State of Ohio in 1867.  Union Central is                  
primarily engaged in the sale of life and disability insurance                  
and annuities and is currently licensed to transact life                        
insurance business in all states and the District of Columbia.                  

Union Central is subject to regulation by the Department of                     
Insurance of the State of Ohio as well as by the insurance                      
departments of all other states and jurisdictions in which it                   
does business.  We submit annual statements on our operations and               
finances to insurance officials in such states and jurisdictions.               
The forms for the policy described in this Prospectus are filed                 
with and (where required) approved by insurance officials in each               
state and jurisdiction in which policies are sold.                              

Carillon Life Account                                                           

Carillon Life Account was established as a separate investment                  
account under Ohio law on July 10, 1995.  It is used to support                 
the policies and may be used to support other variable life                     
insurance policies, and for other purposes permitted by law.  The               
separate account is registered with the Securities and Exchange                 
Commission ("SEC") as a unit investment trust under the                         
Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "1940 Act") and is a                        
"separate account" within the meaning of the federal securities                 
laws.  Union Central has established other separate investment                  
accounts that may also be registered with the SEC.                              

The assets in the separate account are owned by Union Central.                  
The separate account is divided into subaccounts which correspond               
to subdivisions of the variable account.  Subaccounts of the                    
separate account invest in shares of the portfolios.  The                       
separate account may include other subaccounts that are not                     
available through the policies and are not otherwise discussed in               
this Prospectus.                                                                

Income, gains and losses, realized or unrealized, of a subaccount               
are credited to or charged against the subaccount without regard                
to any other income, gains or losses of Union Central.                          
Applicable insurance law provides that assets equal to the                      
reserves and other contract liabilities of the separate account                 
shall not be chargeable with liabilities arising out of any other               
business of Union Central.  Union Central is obligated to pay all               
benefits provided under the policies.                                           

The Portfolios                                                                  

Subaccounts of the separate account currently invest in twelve                  
designated portfolios of five series-type mutual funds:  Carillon               
Fund, Inc. ("Carillon Fund"); Scudder Variable Life Investment                  
Fund ("Scudder Fund"); American Century Variable Portfolios, Inc.               
("American Century Fund"); MFS Variable Insurance Trust ("MFS                   
Fund"); and Templeton Variable Products Series Fund ("Templeton                 
Fund").  The investment experience of each subaccount of the                    
separate account depends on the investment performance of its                   
corresponding portfolio.  Each of these portfolios is registered                
with the SEC under the 1940 Act as a series of an open-end                      
diversified investment company.  The SEC does not, however,                     
supervise the management or the investment practices and policies               
of the portfolios.  The investment adviser to Carillon Fund is                  
Carillon Advisers, Inc. (a wholly-owned subsidiary of Union                     
Central).  Scudder, Stevens & Clark, Inc. is the investment                     
adviser to the Scudder Fund.  The investment adviser to the                     
American Century Fund is American Century Investment Management,                
Inc., the adviser to the American Century Investments group.  The               
investment adviser to the MFS Fund is Massachusetts Financial                   
Services Company.  The investment adviser to the Templeton Fund                 
is Templeton Investment Counsel, Inc.                                           

The separate account invests in four portfolios of Carillon Fund:               
the Equity Portfolio, the Bond Portfolio, the Capital Portfolio,                
and the S&P 500 Index Portfolio. The separate account invests in                
three portfolios of the Scudder Fund:  the Capital Growth                       
Portfolio Class A, the International Portfolio Class A, and the                 
Money Market Portfolio.  (The Scudder Fund has four additional                  
portfolios that are not available through the policy.)  The                     
separate account invests in one portfolio of the American Century               
Fund: American Century VP Capital Appreciation Portfolio. (The                  
American Century Fund has four additional portfolios that are not               
available through the policy.) The separate account invests in                  
three portfolios of the MFS Fund: MFS Growth With Income Series,                
MFS High Income Series and MFS Emerging Growth Series.  (The MFS                
Fund has nine additional portfolios that are not available                      
through the policy.) The separate account invests in one                        
Portfolio of the Templeton Fund: Templeton International Fund                   
Class 2.  (The Templeton Fund has five additional Portfolios that               
are not available through the policy.)  The assets of each                      
portfolio are separate from assets of the others, and each                      
portfolio has different investment objectives and policies.  As a               
result, each portfolio operates as a separate investment fund and               
the investment performance of one portfolio has no effect on the                
investment performance of any other portfolio. The investment                   
objective of each portfolio is set forth below.                                 

The Carillon Equity Portfolio seeks primarily long-term                         
appreciation of capital by investing primarily in common stocks                 
and other equity securities.                                                    

The Carillon Bond Portfolio seeks as high a level of current                    
income as is consistent with reasonable investment risk by                      
investing primarily in investment-grade corporate bonds.                        

The Carillon Capital Portfolio seeks the highest total return                   
through a combination of income and capital appreciation                        
consistent with the reasonable risk associated with an investment               
portfolio of above-average quality by investing in equity                       
securities, debt instruments and money market instruments.                      

The Carillon S&P 500 Index Portfolio seeks investment results                   
that correspond to the total return performance of U.S. common                  
stocks, as represented by the Standard & Poor's 500 Composite                   
Stock Index (the "S&P 500" *).  The S&P 500 is a well-known stock               
market index that includes common stocks of companies                           
representing approximately 70% of the market value of all common                
stocks publicly traded in the United States.  The investment                    
adviser of the portfolio believes that the performance of the S&P               
500 is representative of the performance of publicly traded                     
common stocks in general.                                                       

* The S&P 500 is an unmanaged index of common stocks comprised of               
500 industrial, financial, utility and transportation companies.

of investing in securities generally or in the Portfolio                        
particularly or the ability of the S&P 500 Index to track general               
stock market performance. S&P's only relationship to Carillon

The Scudder International Portfolio Class A seeks long-term               
growth of capital principally from a diversified portfolio of                   
foreign equity securities.                                                      

The Scudder Money Market Portfolio  seeks stability and                   
current income from a portfolio of money market instruments.                    
Money market funds are neither insured nor guaranteed by the U.S.               
Government, and there can be no assurance that this portfolio                   
will maintain a stable net asset value per share.                               

The American Century VP Capital Appreciation Portfolio seeks              
capital growth by investing primarily in common stocks that are                 
considered by management to have better-than-average prospects                  
for appreciation.                                                               

The MFS Growth With Income Series seeks to provide reasonable             
current income and long-term growth of capital and income.                      

The MFS High Income Series seeks high current income by                   
investing primarily in a professionally managed diversified                     
portfolio of fixed income securities, some of which may involve                 
equity features.  The MFS High Income Portfolio may invest up to                
100% of its assets in lower-rated bonds commonly known as junk                  
bonds.  BEFORE ALLOCATING ANY PORTION OF NET PREMIUMS TO THE                    
SUBDIVISION CORRESPONDING TO THIS PORTFOLIO, OWNERS SHOULD READ                 
THE RISK DISCLOSURE IN THE ACCOMPANYING PROSPECTUS FOR THE MFS                  
HIGH INCOME SERIES.                                                             

The MFS Emerging Growth Series seeks to provide long-term growth                
of capital. Dividend and interest income from portfolio                         
securities, if any, is incidental to the Series' investment                     
objective of long-term growth of capital.                                       

The Templeton International Fund Class 2 seeks long-term capital                
growth through a flexible policy of investing in stocks and debt                
obligations of companies and governments outside the United                     
States.                                                                         

THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT ANY OF THE PORTFOLIOS WILL ACHIEVE                   
THEIR RESPECTIVE STATED OBJECTIVES.  Additional information                     
concerning the investment objectives and policies of the                        
portfolios, as well as risks, can be found in the current                       
portfolio prospectuses that accompany this Prospectus.  The                     
prospectuses for the portfolios should be read carefully before                 
any decision is made concerning the allocation of net premiums to               
a particular subdivision.  Certain subdivisions invest in                       
portfolios that have similar investment objectives and/or                       
policies.  Therefore, you should carefully read the individual                  
prospectuses for the portfolios along with this Prospectus.                     

Please note that all of the portfolios described in the                         
Prospectuses for the portfolios may not be available under the                  
policy.  Moreover, Union Central cannot guarantee that each fund                
will always be available for its variable life contracts, but in                
the unlikely event that a Fund is not available, Union Central                  
will take reasonable steps to secure the availability of a                      
comparable fund.  Shares of each portfolio are purchased and                    
redeemed at net asset value, without a sales charge.                            

The portfolios presently serve as the investment media for the                  
policies.  In addition, the portfolios may sell shares to                       
separate accounts of other insurance companies to fund variable                 
annuity contracts and/or variable life insurance policies, and/or               
to certain retirement plans qualifying under Section 401 of the                 
Code.  Union Central currently does not foresee any disadvantages               
to owners that would arise from the possible sale of shares to                  
support the variable contracts of other insurance companies, or                 
from the possible sale of shares to such retirement plans.                      
However, the board of directors of each fund will monitor events                
in order to identify any material irreconcilable conflicts that                 
might possibly arise if the shares of that fund were also offered               
to support variable contracts other than the policies or to                     
support retirement plans.  In event of such a conflict, the board               
of directors of that fund would determine what action, if any,                  
should be taken in response to the conflict.  In addition, if                   
Union Central believes that the fund's response to any such                     
conflicts insufficiently protects owners, it will take                          
appropriate action on its own, which may include withdrawing the                
separate account's investment in that fund.  (See the                           
prospectuses for the portfolios for more detail.)                               

American Century Investment Management, Inc., the investment                    
adviser to the American Century Fund, and Massachusetts Financial               
Services Company, the  investment adviser to the MFS Fund, have                 
agreed to compensate Union Central for the performance of certain               
administrative and other services.  This compensation is based on               
the assets of the American Century Fund and the MFS Fund,                       
respectively, that are attributable to the policies.                            

Addition, Deletion or Substitution of Investments                               

Union Central reserves the right, subject to applicable law, to                 
make additions to, deletions from, or substitutions for the                     
shares that are held in the separate account or that the separate               
account may purchase.  If the shares of a portfolio are no longer               
available for investment or if in Union Central's judgment                      
further investment in any portfolio should become inappropriate                 
in view of the purposes of the separate account, Union Central                  
may redeem the shares, if any, of that portfolio and substitute                 
shares of another registered open-end management company or unit                
investment trust.  Union Central will not substitute any shares                 
attributable to a policy's interest in the separate account                     
without notice and prior approval of the SEC and state insurance                
authorities, to the extent required by the 1940 Act or other                    
applicable law.                                                                 

Union Central also reserves the right to establish additional                   
subaccounts of the separate account, each of which would invest                 
in shares corresponding to a new portfolio or in shares of                      
another investment company having a specific investment                         
objective.  Subject to applicable law and any required SEC                      
approval, Union Central may in its sole discretion establish new                
subaccounts or eliminate one or more subaccounts if marketing                   
needs, tax considerations or investment conditions warrant.  Any                
new subaccount may be made available to existing owner(s) on a                  
basis to be determined by Union Central.                                        

If any of these substitutions or changes are made, Union Central                
may by appropriate endorsement change the policy to reflect the                 
substitution or other change.  If Union Central deems it to be in               
the best interests of owner(s), and subject to any approvals that               
may be required under applicable law, the separate account may be               
operated as a management company under the 1940 Act, it may be                  
deregistered under that Act if registration is no longer                        
required, or it may be combined with other Union Central separate               
accounts.  Union Central reserves the right to make any changes                 
to the separate account required by the 1940 Act or other                       
applicable law or regulation.                                                   

Voting Rights                                                                   

Union Central is the legal owner of shares held by the                          
subaccounts and as such has the right to vote on all matters                    
submitted to shareholders of the portfolios.  However, as                       
required by law, Union Central will vote shares held in the                     
subaccounts at regular and special meetings of shareholders of                  
the portfolios in accordance with instructions received from                    
owners with account value in the subdivisions.  Should the                      
applicable federal securities laws, regulations or                              
interpretations thereof change, Union Central may be permitted to               
vote shares of the portfolios in its own right, and if so, Union                
Central may elect to do so.                                                     

To obtain voting instructions from owners, before a meeting                     
owners will be sent voting instruction material, a voting                       
instruction form and any other related material.  The number of                 
shares held by each subaccount for which an owner may give voting               
instructions is currently determined by dividing the portion of                 
the owner's account value in the subdivision corresponding to the               
subaccount by the net asset value of one share of the applicable                
portfolio.  Fractional votes will be counted.  The number of                    
votes for which an owner may give instructions will be determined               
as of the date coincident with the date established by the fund                 
for determining shareholders eligible to vote at the relevant                   
meeting of the fund.  Shares held by a subaccount for which no                  
timely instructions are received will be voted by Union Central                 
in the same proportion as those shares for which voting                         
instructions are received.                                                      

Union Central may, if required by state insurance officials,                    
disregard owner voting instructions if such instructions would                  
require shares to be voted so as to cause a change in                           
sub-classification or investment objectives of one or more of the               
portfolios, or to approve or disapprove an investment advisory                  
agreement.  In addition, Union Central may under certain                        
circumstances disregard voting instructions that would require                  
changes in the investment advisory agreement or investment                      
adviser of one or more of the portfolios, provided that Union                   
Central reasonably disapproves of such changes in accordance with               
applicable federal regulations.  If Union Central ever disregards               
voting instructions, owners will be advised of that action and of               
the reasons for such action in the next semiannual report.                      
Finally, Union Central reserves the right to modify the manner in               
which the weight to be given to pass-through voting instructions                
is calculated when such a change is necessary to comply with                    
current federal regulations or the current interpretation                       
thereof.                                                                        

PREMIUM PAYMENTS AND ALLOCATIONS                                                

Applying for a Policy                                                           

To purchase a policy, you must complete an application and submit               
it through an authorized Union Central agent.  There is no                      
minimum initial premium payment.  Your policy coverage will                     
become effective on the policy date.  If an initial premium                     
payment is submitted with the application, then the policy date                 
is generally the date of approval of your application.  If the                  
application is not accompanied by an initial premium payment,                   
then the policy date will generally be two weeks after the date                 
that your application is approved.                                              

As provided for under state insurance law, the owner, to preserve               
insurance age, may be permitted to backdate the policy.  In no                  
case may the policy date be more than six months prior to the                   
date the application was completed.  Charges for the monthly                    
deduction for the backdated period are deducted on the issue                    
date.  Temporary life insurance coverage may be provided prior to               
the policy date under the terms of a temporary insurance                        
agreement.  In accordance with Union Central's underwriting                     
rules, temporary life insurance coverage may not exceed $500,000                
and will not remain in effect for more than sixty (60) days.                    

Union Central requires satisfactory evidence of the insured's                   
insurability, which may include a medical examination of the                    
insured.  The available issue ages are 0 through 75.  Age is                    
determined on the insured's age as of the birthday nearest the                  
policy date.  The minimum specified amount is $50,000.                          
Acceptance of an application depends on Union Central's                         
underwriting rules, and Union Central reserves the right to                     
reject an application for any reason.                                           

As the owner of the policy, you exercise all rights provided                    
under the policy.  The insured is the owner, unless a different                 
owner is named in the application.  The owner may by notice name                
a contingent owner or a new owner while the insured is living.                  
If more than one person is named as owner, they are joint owners.               
Any transaction under the policy except for telephone transfers                 
of account value will require the authorization of all owners.                  
Unless provided otherwise, in the event of a joint owner's death,               
ownership passes to the surviving joint owner.  Unless a                        
contingent owner has been named, on the death of the last                       
surviving owner, ownership of the policy passes to the estate of                
the last surviving owner, who will become the owner if the                      
owner(s) die.  The owner may also be changed prior to the                       
insured's death by notice satisfactory to us.  A change in owner                
may have tax consequences.  See "Tax Considerations," page   .                  

Purchase of the Policy for Specialized Purposes                                 

The policy provides a death benefit and an accumulation of                      
account value. It can be used for various individual and business               
planning purposes.  Purchasing the policy for such purposes                     
entails certain risks.  For example, if the investment                          
performance of the subaccounts to which account value is                        
allocated is poorer than anticipated, or if sufficient premiums                 
are not paid or account value maintained, the policy may lapse or               
may not accumulate sufficient account value to fund the purpose                 
for which the policy was purchased.  Loans and partial cash                     
surrenders may significantly affect current and future account                  
value, cash surrender value, and death benefit proceeds.                        
Depending upon subaccount investment performance and the amount                 
of loans and partial cash surrenders, the policy may lapse.                     
Because the policy is designed to provide benefits on a long-term               
basis, before purchasing a policy for a specialized purpose, a                  
purchaser should consider whether the long-term nature of the                   
policy and the impact of loans and partial cash surrenders is                   
consistent with the purpose for which it is being considered.                   
Using a policy for a specialized purpose may have tax                           
consequences.  (See "Tax Considerations.")                                      

Free Look Right to Cancel the Policy                                            

You may cancel your policy for a refund during your "free-look"                 
period.  This period expires 20 days after you receive your                     
policy, 45 days after your application is signed, or 10 days                    
after Union Central mails or delivers a cancellation notice,                    
whichever is latest.  (A longer period may apply to policies                    
issued in certain states.)  If you decide to cancel the policy,                 
you must return it by mail or delivery to the home office or to                 
the authorized Union Central agent who sold it.  Immediately                    
after mailing or delivery, the policy will be deemed void from                  
the beginning.  Within seven calendar days after Union Central                  
receives the returned policy, Union Central will refund the                     
greater of any premiums paid, less any partial cash surrenders,                 
or account value.                                                               

Premiums                                                                        

Planned Periodic Premiums.  When applying for a policy, you                     
select a plan for paying level premium payments at specified                    
intervals, e.g., quarterly, semi-annually or annually, until the                
maturity date.  If you elect, Union Central will also arrange for               
payment of planned period premiums on a monthly basis under a                   
pre-authorized payment arrangement.  You are not required to pay                
premium payments in accordance with these plans; rather, you can                
pay more or less than planned or skip a planned periodic premium                
entirely.  (See, however, "Premium Payments to Prevent Lapse,"                  
page   .)  Currently, there is no minimum amount for each                       
premium.  Union Central may establish a minimum amount 90 days                  
after we send the owner a written notice of such increase.                      
Subject to the limits described below, you can change the amount                
and frequency of planned periodic premiums whenever you want by                 
sending notice to the home office.  However, Union Central                      
reserves the right to limit the amount of a premium payment or                  
the total premium payments paid.                                                

Unless otherwise requested, you will be sent reminder notices for               
planned periodic premiums.  Reminder notices will not be sent if                
you have arranged to pay planned periodic premiums by                           
pre-authorized payment arrangement.                                             

Additional Unscheduled Premiums.  Additional unscheduled premium                
payments can be made at any time while the policy is in force.                  
Union Central has the right to limit the number and amount of                   
such premium payments.                                                          

Limitations on Premium Payments.  Total premium payments paid in                
a policy year may not exceed guideline premium payment                          
limitations for life insurance set forth in the Internal Revenue                
Code.  Union Central will promptly refund any portion of any                    
premium payment that is determined to be in excess of the premium               
payment limit established by law to qualify a policy as a                       
contract for life insurance.                                                    

The payment of premiums may cause a policy to be a modified                     
endowment contract under the Internal Revenue Code.  We have                    
established procedures for monitoring premium payments and making               
efforts to notify you on a timely basis if your policy is in                    
jeopardy of becoming a modified endowment contract as a result of               
premium payments.  See "Tax Considerations," page   .                           

Union Central reserves the right to reject any requested increase               
in planned periodic premiums, or any unscheduled premium.  We                   
also reserve the right to require satisfactory evidence of                      
insurability prior to accepting any premium which increases the                 
risk amount of the policy.  See "Net Premium Allocations," page                 
.                                                                             

No premium payment will be accepted after the maturity date.                    

Premium payments must be made by check payable to The Union                     
Central Insurance Company or by any other method that Union                     
Central deems acceptable.  The owner may specify that a specific                
unscheduled premium payment is to be applied as a repayment of                  
policy debt, if any.                                                            

Premium payments after the initial premium payment must be made                 
to the home office.                                                             

Minimum Guaranteed Period.  Union Central guarantees that a                     
policy will remain in force during the minimum guaranteed period,               
regardless of the sufficiency of the cash surrender value, if the               
sum of the premiums paid to date, less any partial cash                         
surrenders and policy debt equals or exceeds the minimum monthly                
premium (shown in the policy) multiplied by the number of                       
complete policy months since the policy date, including the                     
current policy month.  The minimum guaranteed period is three                   
years following the policy date.                                                

The minimum monthly premium is calculated for each policy based                 
on the age, sex and rate class of the insured, the requested                    
specified amount and any supplemental and/or rider benefits.  The               
minimum monthly premium may change due to changes made during a                 
minimum guaranteed period to the specified amount, the death                    
benefit option, ratings, and supplemental and/or rider benefits.                
Union Central will notify you of any increase in the minimum                    
monthly premium.                                                                

An extended minimum guaranteed period may be available under a                  
Guaranteed Death Benefit Rider.  See "Supplemental Benefits                     
and/or Riders," page   .                                                        

Premium Payments Upon Increase in Specified Amount.  Depending on               
the account value at the time of an increase in the specified                   
amount and the amount of the increase requested, an additional                  
premium payment may be necessary or a change in the amount of                   
planned periodic premiums may be advisable.  See "Changes in
Specified Amount," page   .  In the event that you increase the                 
specified amount, you should contact your Union Central agent to                
assist you in determining if additional premium payments are                    
necessary or appropriate.                                                       

Premium Payments to Prevent Lapse.  Failure to pay planned                      
periodic premiums will not necessarily cause a policy to lapse.                 
Conversely, paying all planned periodic premiums will not                       
necessarily guarantee that a policy will not lapse (except when                 
the minimum guaranteed period is in effect).  Rather, whether a                 
policy lapses depends on whether its cash surrender value is                    
sufficient to cover the monthly deduction (see page   ) when due.               

If the cash surrender value on a monthly date is less than the                  
amount of the monthly deduction to be deducted on that date and                 
the minimum guaranteed period is not in effect, the policy will                 
be in default and a grace period will begin.  This could happen                 
if investment experience has been sufficiently unfavorable that                 
it has resulted in a decrease in cash surrender value or the cash               
surrender value has decreased because you have not paid                         
sufficient premium payments to offset the monthly deduction.                    

Grace Period.  If your policy goes into default, you will be                    
allowed a 61-day grace period to pay a premium payment sufficient               
to cover the monthly deductions due during the grace period.                    
Union Central will send notice of the amount required to be paid                
during the grace period ("grace period premium payment") to your                
last known address and the address of any assignee of record.                   
The grace period will begin when the notice is sent.  Your policy               
will remain in effect during the grace period.  If the insured                  
should die during the grace period and before the grace period                  
premium payment is paid, the death benefit proceeds will still be               
payable to the beneficiary, although the amount paid will reflect               
a reduction for the monthly deductions due on or before the date                
of the insured's death (and for any policy debt).  See "Amount of               
Death Benefit," page   .  If the grace period premium payment has               
not been paid before the grace period ends, your policy will                    
lapse.  It will have no value and no benefits will be payable.                  
See "Reinstatement," page   .                                                   

A grace period also may begin if policy debt becomes excessive.                 
See "Loan Repayment; Effect if not Repaid," page   .                            

Net Premium Allocations                                                         

In the application, you specify the percentage of a net premium                 
to be allocated to each subdivision and to the guaranteed                       
account.  This allocation must comply with the allocation rules                 
described below.  Net premiums will generally be allocated to the               
subdivisions and to the guaranteed account on the valuation date                
that Union Central receives them in accordance with the                         
allocations specified in the application or subsequent notice.                  
Union Central will allocate all net premiums received before the                
end of the "free look" period (including the initial net premium)               
to the subdivision invested in the Scudder Money Market                         
Portfolio.  After the end of the "free look" period, the account                
value will be allocated to the subdivisions and to the guaranteed               
account based on the premium payment allocation percentages in                  
the application.  See "Determining the Account Value," page .                   
For this purpose, the end of the "free look" period is deemed to                
be 25 days after the date the policy is issued and mailed to your               
agent for delivery.                                                             

The net premium allocation percentages specified in the                         
application will apply to subsequent premium payments until you                 
change the percentages.  You can change the allocation                          
percentages at any time, subject to the rules below, by sending                 
notice to the home office.  The change will apply to all premium                
payments received with or after receipt of your notice.                         

Allocation Rules.  The minimum allocation percentage you may                    
specify for a subdivision or the guaranteed account is 5%, and                  
your allocation percentages must be whole numbers.  The sum of                  
your allocations must equal 100%.  Union Central reserves the                   
right to limit the number of subdivisions to which account value                
may be allocated.                                                               

Crediting Net Premiums                                                          

The initial net premium will be credited to the policy on the                   
policy date, or, if later, the date we receive the initial                      
premium payment.  For backdated policies, the initial net premium               
will be credited on the issue date.  Planned periodic premiums                  
and unscheduled premiums that are not underwritten will be                      
credited to the policy and the net premiums will be invested as                 
requested on the valuation date they are received by the home                   
office.  However, any premium payment that is underwritten will                 
be allocated to the subdivision corresponding to the Scudder                    
Money Market Portfolio until underwriting has been completed and                
the premium payment has been accepted.  When accepted, the                      
account value allocated to the subdivision corresponding to the                 
Scudder Money Market Portfolio and attributable to the resulting                
net premium will be credited to the policy and allocated in                     
accordance with your instructions.  If an additional premium                    
payment is rejected, Union Central will return the premium                      
payment promptly, without any adjustment for investment                         
experience.                                                                     

Transfer Privilege                                                              

After the free-look period and prior to the maturity date, you                  
may transfer all or part of your account value from subdivisions                
investing in one portfolio to other subdivision(s) or to the                    
guaranteed account, or transfer a part of an amount in the                      
guaranteed account to the subdivision(s), subject to the                        
following restrictions.  The minimum transfer amount is the                     
lesser of $100 or the entire amount in that subdivision or the                  
guaranteed account.  A transfer request that would reduce the                   
amount in a subdivision or the guaranteed account below $25 will                
be treated as a transfer request for the entire amount in that                  
subdivision or the guaranteed account.  With the exception of the               
Conversion Right described below, we reserve the right to limit                 
the number or frequency of transfers permitted in the future.                   

We will make the transfer as of the end of the valuation period                 
during which we receive notice requesting such transfer.                        
Currently, there is no limit on the number of transfers that can                
be made between subdivisions or to the guaranteed account.                      
However, transfers from the guaranteed account during any policy                
year are limited to an amount equal to 20% of the account value                 
in the guaranteed account on the annual date at the beginning of                
such policy year.  (See "Transfers from Guaranteed Account," page               
, for restrictions).  Currently, we assess a transfer charge                  
equal to $10 for each transfer during a policy year in excess of                
the first twelve transfers.  (We reserve the right to decrease or               
eliminate the number of free transfers; in addition, the transfer               
charge may be increased, but is guaranteed not to exceed $15 per                
transfer.)  The transfer charge will be deducted from the                       
subdivisions or the guaranteed account from which the requested                 
transfer is being made, on a pro-rata basis.                                    

Telephone Transfers.  Telephone transfers will be based upon                    
instructions given by telephone, provided the appropriate                       
election has been made at the time of application or proper                     
authorization has been provided to us.  We reserve the right to                 
suspend telephone transfer privileges at any time, for any                      
reason, if we deem such suspension to be in the best interests of               
owners.                                                                         

We will employ reasonable procedures to confirm that instructions               
communicated by telephone are genuine, and if we follow those                   
procedures we will not be liable for any losses due to                          
unauthorized or fraudulent instructions.  We may be liable for                  
such losses if we do not follow those reasonable procedures.  The               
procedures we will follow for telephone transfers include                       
requiring some form of personal identification prior to acting on               
instructions received by telephone, providing written                           
confirmation of the transaction, and making a tape recording of                 
the instructions given by telephone.                                            

Conversion Right.  During the first twenty-four policy months                   
following the issue date, and within sixty days of the later of                 
notification of a change in the investment policy of the separate               
account or the effective date of such change, the owner may                     
exercise a one-time Conversion Right by requesting that all or a                
portion of the variable account be transferred to the guaranteed                
account.  Exercise of the Conversion Right is not subject to the                
transfer charge.  Following the exercise of the Conversion Right,               
net premiums may not be allocated to the subdivisions of the                    
variable account, and transfers of account value to the                         
subdivisions will not be permitted.  The other terms and                        
conditions of the policy will continue to apply.                                

Dollar Cost Averaging Plan                                                      

The Dollar Cost Averaging Plan, if elected, enables you to                      
transfer systematically and automatically, on a monthly,                        
quarterly, semi-annual, or annual basis, specified dollar amounts               
from a subdivision you specify to other subdivisions or to the                  
guaranteed account.  (Dollar Cost Averaging Plan transfers may                  
not be made from the guaranteed account.)  By allocating on a                   
regularly scheduled basis, as opposed to allocating the total                   
amount at one particular time, you may be less susceptible to the               
impact of market fluctuations.  However, we make no guarantee                   
that the Dollar Cost Averaging Plan will result in a profit.                    

You specify the amount to be transferred automatically; you can                 
specify either a fixed dollar amount, or a percentage of the                    
account value in the subdivision from which transfers will be                   
made.  At the time that you elect the Dollar Cost Averaging Plan,               
the account value in the subdivision from which transfers will be               
made must be at least $2,000.  The required amounts may be                      
allocated to the subdivision through initial or subsequent net                  
premiums or by transferring amounts into the subdivision from the               
other subdivisions or from the guaranteed account (which may be                 
subject to certain restrictions).                                               

You may elect this plan at the time of application by completing                
the authorization on the application or at any time after the                   
policy is issued by properly completing the election form and                   
returning it to us.  Dollar Cost Averaging Plan transfers may not               
commence until the end of the free-look period.                                 

Once elected, transfers from the subdivision will be processed                  
until the number of designated transfers have been completed, or                
the value of the subdivision is completely depleted, or you send                
us notice instructing us to cancel the transfers.                               

Currently, transfers made under the Dollar Cost Averaging Plan                  
will not be subject to any transfer charge and will not count                   
against the number of free transfers permitted in a policy year.                
We reserve the right to impose a $15 transfer charge for each                   
transfer effected under a Dollar Cost Averaging Plan.  We also                  
reserve the right to alter the terms or suspend or eliminate the                
availability of the Dollar Cost Averaging Plan at any time.                     

Portfolio Rebalancing Plan                                                      

You may elect to have the accumulated balance of each subdivision               
periodically redistributed (or "rebalanced") to equal the                       
allocation percentages you have specified in the election form.                 
This rebalancing may be done on a quarterly, semi-annual, or                    
annual basis.                                                                   

You may elect the Portfolio Rebalancing Plan at the time of                     
application by completing the authorization on the application or               
at any time after the policy is issued by properly completing the               
election form and returning it to us.  Portfolio Rebalancing Plan               
transfers may not commence until the end of the free-look period.               
Transfers pursuant to the Portfolio Rebalancing Plan will                       
continue until you send us notice terminating the plan, or the                  
policy terminates.  The Portfolio Rebalancing Plan cannot be                    
elected if either a Dollar Cost Averaging Plan or an Earnings                   
Sweep Plan is in effect.                                                        

Currently, transfers made under the Portfolio Rebalancing Plan                  
will not be subject to any transfer charge and will not count                   
against the number of free transfers permitted in a policy year.                
We reserve the right to impose a $15 transfer charge for each                   
transfer effected under the plan.  We also reserve the right to                 
alter the terms or suspend or eliminate the availability of the                 
Portfolio Rebalancing Plan at any time.                                         

Earnings Sweep                                                                  

You may elect to have the accumulated earnings of one or more                   
specified subdivisions or the interest credited to the guaranteed               
account periodically transferred (or "swept") into specified                    
subdivisions or the guaranteed account.   The sweep may be done                 
on a quarterly, semi-annual, or annual basis.                                   

You may elect the Earnings Sweep Plan at the time of application                
by completing the authorization on the application or at any time               
after the policy is issued by properly completing the election                  
form and returning it to us.  Earnings Sweep Plan transfers may                 
not commence until the end of the free-look period.  Transfers                  
pursuant to the Earnings Sweep Plan will continue until you send                
us notice terminating the plan, or the policy terminates.                       

Currently, transfers made under the Earnings Sweep Plan will not                
be subject to any transfer charge and will not count against the                
number of free transfers permitted in a policy year.  We reserve                
the right to impose a $15 transfer charge for each transfer                     
effected under the plan.  We also reserve the right to alter the                
terms or suspend or eliminate the availability of the Earnings                  
Sweep Plan at any time.                                                         

GUARANTEED ACCOUNT 
BECAUSE OF EXEMPTIVE AND EXCLUSIONARY PROVISIONS, INTERESTS IN                  
THE GUARANTEED ACCOUNT HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE                       
SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 NOR HAS THE GUARANTEED ACCOUNT BEEN                      
REGISTERED AS AN INVESTMENT COMPANY UNDER THE INVESTMENT COMPANY                
ACT OF 1940.  ACCORDINGLY, NEITHER THE GUARANTEED ACCOUNT NOR ANY               
INTERESTS THEREIN ARE SUBJECT TO THE PROVISIONS OF THESE ACTS                   
AND, AS A RESULT, THE STAFF OF THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE                      
COMMISSION HAS NOT REVIEWED THE DISCLOSURE IN THIS PROSPECTUS                   
RELATING TO THE GUARANTEED ACCOUNT.  THE DISCLOSURE REGARDING THE               
GUARANTEED ACCOUNT MAY, HOWEVER, BE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN GENERALLY                
APPLICABLE PROVISIONS OF THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS RELATING TO                
THE ACCURACY AND COMPLETENESS OF STATEMENTS MADE IN PROSPECTUSES.               

You may allocate some or all of your net premiums and transfer                  
some or all of the variable account to the guaranteed account,                  
which is part of our general account and pays interest at                       
declared rates (subject to a minimum interest rate we guarantee                 
to be at least 4%).  The principal, after deductions, is also                   
guaranteed.  Our general account assets support our insurance and               
annuity obligations.                                                            

The portion of the account value allocated to the guaranteed                    
account will be credited with interest, as described below.                     
Since the guaranteed account is part of our general account, we                 
assume the risk of investment gain or loss on this amount.  All                 
assets in the general account are subject to our general                        
liabilities from business operations.                                           

Minimum Guaranteed and Current Interest Rates                                   

The guaranteed account is guaranteed to accumulate at a minimum                 
effective annual interest rate of 4%.  We may credit the                        
guaranteed account with current rates in excess of the minimum                  
guarantee, but we are not obligated to do so.  These current                    
interest rates are influenced by, but do not necessarily                        
correspond to, prevailing general market interest rates.  Since                 
we, in our sole discretion, anticipate changing the current                     
interest rate from time to time, different allocations to and                   
from the guaranteed account will be credited with different                     
current interest rates, based upon the date amounts are allocated               
into the guaranteed account.  We may change the interest rate                   
credited to new deposits at any time.  Any interest credited on                 
the amounts in the guaranteed account in excess of the minimum                  
guaranteed rate of 4% per year will be determined in our sole                   
discretion.  You assume the risk that interest credited may not                 
exceed the guaranteed rate.                                                     

Amounts deducted from the guaranteed account for the monthly                    
deduction, partial cash surrenders, transfers to the                            
subdivisions, or charges are currently, for the purpose of                      
crediting interest, accounted for on a last-in, first-out                       
("LIFO") method.  We reserve the right to change the method of                  
crediting from time to time, provided that such changes do not                  
have the effect of reducing the guaranteed rate of interest below               
4% per annum.                                                                   

Calculation of Guaranteed Account Value                                         

The guaranteed account at any time is equal to net premiums                     
allocated or account value transferred to it, plus interest                     
credited to it, minus amounts deducted, transferred, or                         
surrendered from it.                                                            

Transfers from the Guaranteed Account                                           

The amount transferred from the guaranteed account may not exceed               
20% of the guaranteed account on the annual date immediately                    
preceding the date of the transfer, unless the balance after the                
transfer is less than $25, in which case we will transfer the                   
entire amount.                                                                  

Payment Deferral                                                                

We reserve the right to defer payment of any partial cash                       
surrender, full surrender, or transfer from the guaranteed                      
account for up to six months from the date of receipt of the                    
notice for the partial or full surrender or transfer.  However,                 
we will not defer payment of any amounts needed to pay premiums                 
on other policies in force with us.                                             

CHARGES AND DEDUCTIONS                                                          

Premium Expense Charge                                                          

A sales charge is deducted from each premium payment.  This                     
charge is equal to 4% of premiums paid through policy year 10;                  
and 2% thereafter.  It is guaranteed not to increase for the life               
of the policy.  The sales charge is intended to partially                       
reimburse Union Central for some of the expenses incurred in the                
distribution of the policies. See "Daily Mortality and Expense
Risk Charge," page   , and "Cost of Insurance Charge," page   .                 

A 2.50% charge for state and local premium taxes and expenses is                
also deducted from each premium payment.  The state and local                   
premium tax charge reimburses Union Central for premium taxes                   
associated with the policies and related administrative costs.                  
The stated premium tax rates in the jurisdictions in which Union                
Central does business range from 0.75% to 4.00%, and the                        
jurisdiction in which a policy is issued may impose no premium                  
tax, or a premium tax higher or lower than the charge deducted                  
under the policies.                                                             

Monthly Deduction                                                               

On each monthly date, Union Central will deduct from the account                
value the monthly deductions due, commencing as of the policy                   
date.  Your policy date is the date used to determine your                      
monthly date.  The monthly deduction consists of (1) cost of                    
insurance charges ("cost of insurance charge"), (2) the monthly                 
administrative charge (the "administrative charge"), and (3) any                
charges for supplemental and/or rider benefits ("supplemental
and/or rider benefit charges"), as described below.  The monthly                
deduction is deducted from the subdivisions and from the                        
guaranteed account pro rata on the basis of the portion of                      
account value in each.                                                          

Cost of Insurance Charge.  This charge compensates Union Central                
for the expense of providing insurance coverage.  The charge                    
depends on a number of variables and therefore will vary from                   
policy to policy and from monthly date to monthly date.  For any                
policy, the cost of insurance on a monthly date is calculated by                
multiplying the current cost of insurance rate for the insured by               
the risk amount under the policy for that monthly date.                         

The risk amount for a monthly date is the difference between the                
death benefit (see page  ) for a policy (as adjusted to take into               
account assumed monthly earnings at an annual rate of 4%) and the               
account value, as calculated on that monthly date less any                      
monthly deduction due on that date (except the cost of                          
insurance).                                                                     

The current cost of insurance rate for a policy is based on the                 
age at issue, sex and rate class of the insured and on the policy               
year, and therefore varies from time to time.  Different current                
cost of insurance rates apply to policies with a specified amount               
under $250,000 than to policies with a specified amount of                      
$250,000 or more and, in general, policies with a specified                     
amount of $250,000 or more may have lower current cost of                       
insurance rates.  Union Central currently places insureds in the                
following rate classes, based on underwriting:  Standard Tobacco                
(ages 0-75), Standard Nontobacco (ages 20-75), or Preferred (ages               
20-70).  The Preferred rate class is only available under                       
policies with specified amounts of $100,000 or more.  We also may               
place an insured in a substandard rate class, which involves a                  
higher mortality risk than the standard tobacco or standard                     
nontobacco classes.                                                             

Union Central will determine a cost of insurance rate for                       
increases in coverage based on the age of the insured at the time               
of the increase.  The following rules will apply for purposes of                
determining the risk amount for each rate.                                      

Union Central places the insured in a rate class when the policy              
is issued, based on Union Central's underwriting of the                         
application.  This original rate class applies to the initial                   
specified amount.  When an increase in specified amount is                      
requested, Union Central conducts underwriting before approving                 
the increase (except as noted below) to determine whether a                     
different rate class will apply to the increase.  If the rate                   
class for the increase has lower cost of insurance rates than the               
original rate class, then the rate class for the increase will                  
also be applied to the initial specified amount.  If the rate                   
class for the increase has higher cost of insurance rates than                  
the original rate class, the rate class for the increase will                   
apply only to the increase in specified amount, and the original                
rate class will continue to apply to the initial specified                      
amount.                                                                         

Union Central does not conduct underwriting for an increase in                  
specified amount if the increase is requested by exercising an                  
option to increase the specified amount automatically, without                  
underwriting.  See "Supplemental and/or Rider Benefits," page   .               
In such case, the insured's rate class for an increase will be                  
the class in effect when the guaranteed option rider was issued.                

For purposes of determining the risk amount associated with a                   
specified amount, we will attribute the account value solely to                 
the initial specified amount unless the account value exceeds the               
initial specified amount.  If the account value exceeds the                     
initial specified amount, the excess will be considered                         
attributable to the increases in specified amount in the order of               
the increases.  If there is a decrease in specified amount after                
an increase, a decrease is applied first to decrease any prior                  
increases in specified amount, starting with the most recent                    
increase and then each prior increase.                                          

Union Central guarantees that the cost of insurance rates used to               
calculate the monthly cost of insurance charge will not exceed                  
the maximum cost of insurance rates set forth in the policies.                  
The guaranteed rates for standard classes are based on the 1980                 
Commissioners' Standard Ordinary Mortality Tables, Male or                      
Female, Smoker or Nonsmoker Mortality Rates ("1980 CSO Tables").                
The guaranteed rates for substandard classes are based on                       
multiples of or additives to the 1980 CSO Tables.                               

Union Central's current cost of insurance rates may be less than                
the guaranteed rates that are set forth in the policy.  Current                 
cost of insurance rates will be determined based on Union                       
Central's expectations as to future mortality, investment                       
earnings, expenses, taxes, and persistency experience.  These                   
rates may change from time to time.                                             

Cost of insurance rates (whether guaranteed or current) for an                  
insured in a standard nontobacco class are equal to or lower than               
guaranteed rates for an insured of the same age and sex in a                    
standard tobacco class.  Cost of insurance rates (whether                       
guaranteed or current) for an insured in a standard nontobacco or               
tobacco class are generally lower than guaranteed rates for an                  
insured of the same age and sex and tobacco status in a                         
substandard class.                                                              

Legal Considerations Relating to Sex-Distinct Premium                 
Payments and Benefits.  Mortality tables for the policies             
generally distinguish between males and females.  Thus,               
premium payments and benefits under policies covering males           
and females of the same age will generally differ.                    

Union Central does, however, also offer policies based on             
unisex mortality tables if required by state law.  Employers          
and employee organizations considering purchase of a policy           
should consult with their legal advisors to determine                 
whether purchase of a policy based on sex-distinct actuarial          
tables is consistent with Title VII of the Civil Rights Act           
of 1964 or other applicable law.  Upon request, Union                 
Central may offer policies with unisex mortality tables to            
such prospective purchasers.                                          

Monthly Administrative Charge.  Union Central deducts a monthly                 
administrative charge from the account value on each monthly                    
date.  The administrative charge is currently equal to $25 per                  
month during the first policy year, and $5 per month thereafter.                
We reserve the right to increase the administrative charge after                
the first policy year up to $10 per month.  The administrative                  
charge is guaranteed not to increase during the first policy                    
year, and is guaranteed not to exceed $10 per month thereafter.                 

The monthly administrative charge reimburses Union Central for                  
expenses incurred in the administration of the policies and the                 
separate account.  Such expenses include but are not limited to:                
confirmations, annual reports and account statements, maintenance               
of policy records, maintenance of separate account records,                     
administrative personnel costs, mailing costs, data processing                  
costs, legal fees, accounting fees, filing fees, the costs of                   
other services necessary for owner servicing and accounting,                    
valuation, regulatory and updating requirements.                                

Should the guaranteed charges prove to be insufficient, we will                 
not increase the charges above such guaranteed levels.                          

Supplemental and/or Rider Benefit Charges.  See "Supplemental
and/or Rider Benefits," page   .                                                

Daily Mortality and Expense Risk Charge                                         

Union Central deducts a daily charge from assets in the separate                
account attributable to the policies.  This charge does not apply               
to guaranteed account assets attributable to the policies.                      
During the first ten policy years, the charge is equal on an                    
annual basis to 0.75% of assets.  Thereafter, the charge is equal               
on an annual basis to 0.25% of assets.  These rates are                         
guaranteed not to increase for the duration of a policy.  Union                 
Central may realize a profit from this charge.  Although Union                  
Central does not believe that it is possible to allocate this                   
charge to different risks, Union Central feels that a reasonable                
estimate is that during the first ten policy years, 0.30% of this               
charge is allocable to mortality risk, and 0.45% to expense risk;               
and thereafter, 0.10% of this charge is allocable to mortality                  
risk, and 0.15% to expense risk.                                                

The mortality risk Union Central assumes is that the insureds on                
the policies may die sooner than anticipated and therefore Union                
Central will pay an aggregate amount of death benefits greater                  
than anticipated.  The expense risk Union Central assumes is that               
expenses incurred in issuing and administering the policies and                 
the separate account will exceed the amounts realized from the                  
administrative charges assessed against the policies.                           

Transfer Charge                                                                 

We currently assess a transfer charge of $10 for each transfer                  
made during a policy year after the first twelve transfers.  We                 
reserve the right to decrease or eliminate the number of free                   
transfers; in addition the transfer charge may be increased, but                
is guaranteed not to exceed $15 per transfer.  We will deduct the               
transfer charge from the remaining account value in the                         
subdivisions or the guaranteed account from which the transfer is               
being made on a pro rata basis.  We do not expect a profit from                 
this charge.                                                                    

Surrender Charge                                                                

If a policy is completely surrendered or lapses, Union Central                  
may deduct a surrender charge from the account value.  The                      
surrender charge includes a sales surrender charge and an                       
administrative surrender charge.  The maximum surrender charge is               
set forth in your policy.  There is no additional sales surrender               
charge applicable to increases in specified amount.  However, if                
the policy is completely surrendered following an increase in                   
specified amount, an additional administrative surrender charge                 
may apply, as described below.                                                  

Any surrender charge deducted upon lapse is credited back to the                
policy's account value upon reinstatement.  The surrender charge                
on the date of reinstatement will be the same as it was on the                  
date of lapse.  For purposes of determining the surrender charge                
on any date after reinstatement, the period the policy was lapsed               
will not count.                                                                 

Sales Surrender Charge.  A sales surrender charge is deducted if                
the policy is surrendered or lapses during the first fifteen                    
policy years following the policy date.  The maximum sales                      
surrender charge is 26% of the premiums paid up to a sales                      
surrender premium shown in the policy.  The maximum amount shown                
in the policy is based on the age at issue, sex, specified                      
amount, death benefit option, and rate class applicable to the                  
insured.  Increases in the policy's specified amount will not                   
affect the amount of the sales surrender premium, or the amount                 
of the maximum sales surrender charge.  Decreases in the policy's               
specified amount may reduce the sales surrender premium if the                  
decrease is effective prior to the payment of cumulative premiums               
in an amount equal to the initial sales surrender premium shown                 
in the policy.  We will notify you of any reduction in the sales                
surrender premium, and the amount of the maximum sales surrender                
charge, at the time of any decrease in specified amount that                    
causes such reductions.                                                         

The greatest sales surrender charge applicable to a portion of                  
account value is paid if you lapse or surrender in policy years                 
one through five.  The maximum sales surrender charge in these                  
years equals 26% of actual premiums paid up to the sales                        
surrender premium shown in the policy.  After the fifth policy                  
year, the maximum sales surrender charge percentage declines on a               
monthly basis in level increments until it reaches 0% at the end                
of the fifteenth policy year, as shown in the table below:

The purpose of the sales surrender charge is to reimburse Union                 
Central for some of the expenses incurred in the distribution of                
the policies.  The sales surrender charge may be insufficient to                
recover distribution expenses related to the sale of the                        
policies.  See "Daily Mortality and Expense Risk Charge," page                  
, and "Cost of Insurance Charge," page  .                                       

Administrative Surrender Charge.  An administrative surrender                   
charge is deducted if the policy is surrendered or lapses during                
the first fifteen policy years following the policy date or any                 
increase in specified amount (see "Surrender Charge" above).  The               
administrative surrender charge is equal to an amount per $1000                 
of specified amount, and depends upon the age of the insured at                 
the time that the specified amount to which it applies was                      
issued, and the policy year in which the charge is imposed.  For                
issue ages 30 to 39, the amount per $1000 is $3.50 during policy                
years 1 through 5; for issue ages 40 to 49, the amount per $1000                
is $4.50 during policy years 1 through 5; for issue ages 50 to                  
59, the amount per $1000 is $5.50 during policy years 1 through                 
5; and for issue ages 60 to 69, the amount per $1000 is $6.50                   
during policy years 1 through 5.  The charge declines monthly                   
after the end of the fifth policy year to zero at the end of                    
policy year fifteen.  Applicable administrative surrender charge                
rates, which increase with issue age, are set forth in full in                  
the policy.                                                                     

If the specified amount is increased, the increase is subject to                
a new administrative surrender charge.  This charge is imposed if               
the policy is surrendered or lapses within fifteen policy years                 
from the effective date of the increase, and is in addition to                  
any sales surrender charge or administrative surrender charge                   
that may be applicable if the policy is surrendered or lapses                   
within fifteen policy years after the policy date.                              

The administrative surrender charge partially covers the                        
administrative costs of processing surrenders, lapses, and                      
increases and reductions in specified amount, as well as legal,                 
actuarial, systems, mailing, and other overhead costs connected                 
with Union Central's variable life insurance operations.                        

Fund Expenses                                                                   

The value of the net assets of each subaccount reflects the                     
investment advisory fees and other expenses incurred by the                     
corresponding portfolio in which the subaccount invests.  See the               
prospectuses for the portfolios.

+ Because the Templeton International Fund Class 2 shares were                  
not offered until May 1, 1997, the figures for "Management Fees"                
and "Other Expenses" are based on the historical expenses of the                
Templeton International Fund Class 1 shares for the year ended                  
December 31, 1996. Class 1 management fees and total operating                  
expenses have been restated to reflect the management fee                       
schedule approved by shareholders and effective May 1, 1997.                    
Class 1 actual management fees and total fund operating expenses                
before May 1, 1997 were lower. For each other Portfolio they are                
based on the actual expenses incurred by the Portfolio for the                  
year ended December 31, 1996. Total Annual Expenses in excess of                
.60% for the S&P 500 Index Portfolio are paid by the investment               
adviser.                                                                        

++  All expenses except brokerage, taxes, interest and fees and                 
expenses of non-interested person directors are paid by the                     
investment adviser.                                                             

(1)   Each Series has an expense offset arrangement which reduces               
the Series' custodian fee based upon the amount of cash                         
maintained by the Series with its custodian and dividend                        
disbursing agent, and may enter into other such arrangements and                
directed brokerage arrangements (which would also have the effect               
of reducing the Series' expenses). Any such fee reductions are                  
not reflected under "Other Expenses."                                           

(2)   The Adviser has agreed to bear expenses for each Series,                  
subject to reimbursement by each Series, such that each Series'                 
"Other Expenses" shall not exceed 0.25% of the average daily net                
assets of the Series during the current fiscal year. See                        
"Information Concerning Shares of Each Series - Expenses (in the                
Series' Prospectus). Otherwise, "Other Expenses" for the Emerging               
Growth Series, the Growth With Income Series and the High Income                
Series would be 0.41%, 1.32% and 0.87%, respectively, and "Total                
Operating Expenses" would be 1.16%, 2.07% and 1.62%,                            
respectively, for these Series.                                                 

Cost of Additional Benefits Provided by Riders                                  

The cost of additional benefits provided by riders is part of the               
monthly deduction and is charged to the account value on the                    
monthly date.                                                                   

Income Tax Charge                                                               

Union Central does not currently assess any charge for income                   
taxes incurred as a result of the operations of the subaccounts                 
of the separate account.  We reserve the right, however, to                     
assess a charge for such taxes against the subaccounts if we                    
determine that such taxes will be incurred.                                     

Special Arrangements                                                            

Where permitted by state regulation, Union Central may reduce or                
waive the sales charge component of the premium expense charge;                 
the monthly administrative charge; and/or the surrender charge,                 
under policies purchased by (i) directors, officers, current or                 
retired employees ("employees"), or agents of Union Central, or                 
affiliates thereof, or their spouses or dependents; (ii)                        
directors, officers, employees, or agents of broker-dealers that                
have entered into selling agreements with Carillon Investments,                 
Inc. relating to the policies, or their spouses or dependents; or               
(iii) directors, officers, employees, or affiliates of the                      
portfolios or investment advisers or sub-advisers or distributors               
thereof, or their spouses or dependents.  In addition, in the                   
future, Union Central may reduce or waive the sales charge                      
component of the premium expense charge; and/or the surrender                   
charge if a policy is purchased by the owner of another policy                  
issued by Union Central, and/or through transfer or exchange from               
a life insurance policy issued by Union Central, each in                        
accordance with rules established by Union Central and applied on               
a uniform basis.  Reductions or waivers of the sales charge                     
component of the premium expense charge, the monthly                            
administrative charge, and the surrender charge reflect the                     
reduced sales and administrative effort associated with policies                
sold to the owners specified.  The home office can provide advice               
regarding the availability of reduced or waived charges to such                 
owners.                                                                         

The Policies may be issued to group or sponsored arrangements, as               
well as on an individual basis.  A "group arrangement" includes a               
program under which a trustee, employer or similar entity                       
purchases policies covering a group of individuals.  An example                 
of such an arrangement is a non-qualified deferred compensation                 
plan.  A "sponsored arrangement" includes a program under which                 
an employer permits group solicitation of its employees or an                   
association permits group solicitation of its members for the                   
purchase of policies on an individual basis.  The policies may                  
not be available in connection with group or sponsored                          
arrangements in all states.                                                     

For policies issued in connection with group or sponsored                       
arrangements, Union Central may reduce or waive one or more of                  
the following charges: the sales charge component of the premium                
expense charge; the surrender charge; the monthly charge for the                
cost of insurance; rider charges; monthly administrative charges;               
daily mortality and expense risk charges; and/or the transfer                   
charge.  In addition, the interest rate credited on amounts taken               
from the subdivisions as a result of a loan may be increased for                
these policies.  Union Central will waive or reduce these charges               
as described below and according to its rules in effect when the                
policy application is approved.                                                 

To qualify for a waiver or reduction, a group or sponsored                      
arrangement must satisfy certain criteria, for example, size of                 
the group, or number of years in existence.  Generally, the sales               
contacts and effort, administrative costs, and insurance cost and               
mortality expense risk per policy may vary based on such factors                
as the size of the group or sponsored arrangement, its stability,               
the purposes for which the policies are purchased, and certain                  
characteristics of its members (including underwriting-related                  
factors that are determined by Union Central to result in lower                 
anticipated expenses of providing insurance coverage, and/or                    
lower mortality expense risk, under policies sold to members of                 
the group or through the sponsored arrangement).  The amount of                 
any reduction and the criteria for qualification will reflect the               
reduced sales and administrative effort resulting from sales to                 
qualifying group or sponsored arrangements, and/or the reduced                  
anticipated cost of insurance or mortality expense risk under                   
such policies.  Union Central may modify from time to time the                  
amount or availability of any charge reduction or waiver, or the                
criteria for qualification.                                                     

Charge reductions or waivers will not be unfairly discriminatory                
against any person, including the affected owners and all other                 
owners of policies funded by the separate account.                              

HOW YOUR ACCOUNT VALUES VARY                                                    

There is no minimum guaranteed account value or cash surrender                  
value.  These values will vary with the investment experience of                
the subaccounts and/or the daily crediting of interest in the                   
guaranteed account, and will depend on the allocation of account                
value.  If the cash surrender value on a monthly date is less                   
than the amount of the monthly deduction to be deducted on that                 
date (see page   ) and the minimum guaranteed period is not then                
in effect, the policy will be in default and a grace period will                
begin.  See "Minimum Guaranteed Period," page   , and "Grace
Period," page   .                                                               

Determining the Account Value                                                   

On the policy date, the account value is equal to the initial net               
premium credited, less the monthly deduction made as of the                     
policy date.  On each valuation date thereafter, the account                    
value is the sum of the variable account, the guaranteed account,               
and the loan account.  The account value will vary to reflect the               
performance of the subdivisions to which amounts have been                      
allocated, interest credited on amounts allocated to the                        
guaranteed account, interest credited on amounts in the loan                    
account, charges, transfers, partial cash surrenders, loans and                 
loan repayments.                                                                

Subaccount Values.  When you allocate an amount to a subdivision,               
either by net premium allocation or transfer, your policy is                    
credited with accumulation units in the subaccount corresponding                
to that subdivision.  The number of accumulation units is                       
determined by dividing the amount allocated to the subdivision by               
the subaccount's accumulation unit value for the valuation date                 
when the allocation is effected.                                                

The number of accumulation units credited to your policy will                   
increase when net premiums are allocated to the subdivision,                    
amounts are transferred to the subdivision, and loan repayments                 
are credited to the subdivision.  The number of accumulation                    
units credited to a policy will decrease when the allocated                     
portion of the monthly deduction is taken from the subdivision, a               
loan is made, an amount is transferred from the subdivision, or a               
partial surrender is taken from the subdivision.                                

Determination of Unit Value.  The unit value for each subaccount                
was arbitrarily set at $10 when the subaccount began operations.                
Thereafter, the unit value at the end of every valuation date is                
the unit value at the end of the previous valuation date times                  
the net investment factor, as described below.  The variable                    
account for a policy is determined on any day by multiplying the                
number of units attributable to each subaccount corresponding to                
subdivisions in which account value is invested by the unit value               
for that subaccount on that day, and aggregating the resulting                  
subaccount values.                                                              

Net Investment Factor.  The net investment factor is an index                   
applied to measure the investment performance of a subaccount                   
from one valuation period to the next.  Each subaccount has a net               
investment factor for each valuation period which may be greater                
or less than one.  Therefore, the value of a unit may increase or               
decrease.  The net investment factor for any subaccount for any                 
valuation period is determined by dividing (1) by (2) and                       
subtracting (3) from the result, where:                                         

(1) is the net result of:                                                       

a. the net asset value per share of the portfolio held in                 
the subaccount, determined at the end of the current                
valuation period; plus                                              

b. the per share amount of any dividend or capital gain                   
distributions made by the portfolio to the subaccount,              
if the "ex-dividend" date occurs during the current                 
valuation period; plus or minus                                     

c. a per share charge or credit for any taxes incurred by                 
or reserved for in the subaccount, which is determined              
by us to have resulted from the operations of the                   
subaccount.                                                         

(2) is the net result of:                                                       

a. the net asset value per share of the portfolio held in                 
the subaccount, determined at the end of the last prior             
valuation period (adjusted for an "ex-dividend"); plus              
or minus                                                            

b. the per share charge or credit for any taxes reserved                  
for the immediately preceding valuation period.                     

(3) is a daily factor representing the mortality and expense                    
risk charge deducted from the subaccount for the policy                 
adjusted for the number of days in the valuation period.                

Guaranteed Account.  On any valuation date, the guaranteed                      
account of a policy is the total of all net premiums allocated to               
the guaranteed account, plus any amounts transferred to the                     
guaranteed account, plus interest credited on such net premiums                 
and amounts, less the amount of any transfers, including transfer               
charges, taken from the guaranteed account, less the amount of                  
any partial cash surrenders taken from the guaranteed account,                  
less any amounts transferred from the guaranteed account in                     
connection with loans, and less the pro-rata portion of the                     
monthly deduction deducted from the guaranteed account.                         

Loan Account.  On any valuation date, if there have been any                    
loans, the loan account is equal to amounts transferred to the                  
loan account from the subaccounts and from the guaranteed account               
as collateral for loans and for due and unpaid loan interest,                   
amounts transferred from the loan account to the subaccounts and                
the guaranteed account as policy debt is repaid, and interest                   
credited on the loan account.                                                   

Cash Value                                                                      

The cash value on a valuation date is the account value less the                
surrender charge that would be applicable on that valuation date.               

Cash Surrender Value                                                            

The cash surrender value on a valuation date is the cash value                  
reduced by any policy debt.  Cash surrender value is used to                    
determine whether a partial cash surrender may be taken, and                    
whether policy debt is excessive (see page   ).  It is also the                 
amount that is available upon full surrender of the policy (see                 
page   ).                                                                       

DEATH BENEFIT AND CHANGES IN SPECIFIED AMOUNT                                   

As long as the policy remains in force, Union Central will pay                  
the death benefit proceeds upon receipt at the home office of                   
proof of the insured's death that Union Central deems                           
satisfactory.  Union Central may require return of the policy.                  
The death benefit proceeds will be paid in a lump sum generally                 
within seven calendar days of receipt of satisfactory proof (see                
"When Proceeds Are Paid," page   ) or, if elected, under a                      
payment option (see "Payment Options," page   ).  The death                     
benefit will be paid to the beneficiary.  See "Selecting and
Changing the Beneficiary," page   .                                             

Amount of Death Benefit Proceeds                                                

The death benefit proceeds are equal to the sum of the death                    
benefit under the death benefit option selected calculated on the               
date of the insured's death, plus any supplemental and/or rider                 
benefits, minus any policy debt on that date.  If the date of                   
death occurred during a grace period, the death benefit proceeds                
are the death benefit immediately prior to the start of the grace               
period, minus policy debt and minus any past due monthly                        
deductions.  Under certain circumstances, the amount of the death               
benefit may be further adjusted.  See "Limits on Rights to
Contest the Policy" and "Misstatement of Age or Sex," page   .                  

If part or all of the death benefit is paid in one sum, Union                   
Central will pay interest on this sum as required by applicable                 
state law from the date of receipt of due proof of the insured's                
death to the date of payment.                                                   

Death Benefit Options                                                           

The owner may choose one of two death benefit options, which will               
be used to determine the death benefit.  Under Option A, the                    
death benefit is the greater of the specified amount or the                     
Applicable Percentage of account value on the date of the                       
insured's death.  Under Option B, the death benefit is the                      
greater of the specified amount plus the account value on the                   
date of death, or the Applicable Percentage of the account value                
on the date of the insured's death.                                             

If investment performance is favorable, the amount of the death                 
benefit may increase.  However, under Option A, the death benefit               
ordinarily will not change for several years to reflect any                     
favorable investment performance and may not change at all.                     
Under Option B, the death benefit will vary directly with account               
value, which reflects the investment performance of the                         
subaccounts as well as interest credited to the guaranteed                      
account.  For an illustration of the impact that investment                     
performance may have on the death benefit, see the illustrations                
beginning on page   .                                                           

The "Applicable Percentage" is 250% when the insured has attained               
age 40 or less, and decreases each year thereafter to 100% when                 
the insured has attained age 95. A table showing the Applicable                 
Percentages for Attained Ages 0 to 95 is included in Appendix A.                
Initial Specified Amount and Death Benefit Option                               

The initial specified amount is set at the time the policy is                   
issued.  You may change the specified amount from time to time,                 
as discussed below.  You select the death benefit option when you               
apply for the policy.  You also may change the death benefit                    
option, as discussed below.                                                     

Changes in Death Benefit Option                                                 

You may change the death benefit option on your policy, by notice               
to us, subject to the following rules.  After any change, the                   
specified amount must be at least $50,000.  The effective date of               
the change will be the monthly date next following the day that                 
Union Central receives and accepts notice of the request for                    
change.  Union Central may require satisfactory evidence of                     
insurability.                                                                   

When a change from Option A to Option B is made, the specified                  
amount after the change is effected will be equal to the                        
specified amount before the change less the account value on the                
effective date of the change.  When a change from Option B to                   
Option A is made, unless requested by notice to us, the specified               
amount after the change will be equal to the specified amount                   
before the change is effected and the death benefit will be                     
reduced by the account value on the effective date of the change.               

Changes in Specified Amount                                                     

You may request a change in the specified amount, by notice to                  
us, subject to the following rules.  If a change in the specified               
amount would result in total premiums paid exceeding the premium                
limitations prescribed under current tax law to qualify your                    
policy as a life insurance contract, Union Central will refund                  
promptly to the owner the amount of such excess above the premium               
limitations.                                                                    

The minimum amount of any decrease in specified amount is $5,000,               
and any decrease in specified amount will become effective on the               
monthly date next following the date that notice requesting the                 
decrease is received and approved by us.  Union Central reserves                
the right to decline a requested decrease in the specified amount               
if compliance with the guideline premium limitations under                      
current tax law resulting from this decrease would result in                    
immediate termination of the policy, or if to effect the                        
requested decrease, payments to the owner would have to be made                 
from the accumulated value for compliance with the guideline                    
premium limitations, and the amount of such payments would exceed               
the cash surrender value under the policy.                                      

Decreasing the specified amount of the policy may have the effect               
of decreasing monthly cost of insurance charges.                                

Any increase in the specified amount must be at least $5,000                    
(unless the increase is effected pursuant to a rider providing                  
for automatic increases in specified amount), and an application                
must be submitted.  Any increase that is not guaranteed by rider                
will require satisfactory evidence of insurability and must meet                
Union Central's underwriting rules.  A change in planned periodic               
premiums may be advisable.  See "Premium Payments Upon Increase
in Specified Amount," page   .  The increase in specified amount                
will become effective on the monthly date next following the date               
the request for the increase is received and approved, and the                  
account value will be adjusted to the extent necessary to reflect               
a monthly deduction as of the effective date based on the                       
increase in specified amount.                                                   

A new administrative surrender charge period will apply to each                 
portion of the policy resulting from an increase in specified                   
amount, starting with the effective date of the increase.  (See                 
"Surrender Charge," page   ).                                                   

Selecting and Changing the Beneficiary                                          

You select one or more beneficiary(ies) in your application.  You               
may later change the beneficiary(ies) in accordance with the                    
terms of the policy.  The primary beneficiary, or, if the primary               
beneficiary is not living, the contingent beneficiary, is the                   
person entitled to receive the death benefit proceeds under the                 
policy.  If the insured dies and there is no surviving                          
beneficiary, the owner or the estate of the owner will be the                   
beneficiary.  If a beneficiary is designated as irrevocable, then               
the beneficiary's consent must be obtained to change the                        
beneficiary.                                                                    

CASH BENEFITS                                                                   

Loans                                                                           

After the first policy year and while the insured is living, and                
provided the policy is not in the grace period, you may borrow                  
against your policy at any time by submitting notice to the home                
office.  (In certain states, loans may also be available during                 
the first policy year.)  The minimum amount of any loan request                 
is $500 (subject to state regulation).  The maximum loan amount                 
is equal to the sum of 90% of the variable account, plus 100% of                
the guaranteed account, less any surrender charges that would be                
applicable on the effective date of the loan, less loan interest                
to the annual date.  Outstanding loans reduce the amount                        
available for new loans.  Loans will be processed as of the date                
your notice is received and approved.  Loan proceeds generally                  
will be sent to you within seven calendar days.  See "When
Proceeds Are Paid," page   , and "Payments from the Guaranteed                  
Account," page   .                                                              

Interest.  Each year Union Central will set the annual loan                     
interest rate.  The rate will never be more than the maximum                    
permitted by law, and will not be changed more frequently than                  
once per year.  The rate for a policy year may not exceed the                   
greater of (i) the Published Monthly Average for the calendar                   
month ending two months before the annual date at the beginning                 
of the policy year; or (ii) the guaranteed minimum interest rate                
applicable to the guaranteed account, plus 1.0%.  The Published                 
Monthly Average means Moody's Corporate Bond Yield Average -                    
Monthly Average Corporates, as published by Moody's Investor                    
Service, Inc., or any successor to that service; or if the                      
average is no longer published, a substantially similar average,                
established by regulation issued by the insurance supervisory                   
official of the state in which the policy is delivered.                         

If the maximum annual loan interest rate for a policy year is at                
least 0.5% higher than the rate set for the previous policy year,               
we may increase the rate to no more than that limit.  If the                    
maximum limit for a policy year is at least 0.5% lower than the                 
rate set for the previous policy year, we will reduce the rate to               
at least that limit.                                                            

Union Central will notify owners of the initial rate of interest                
when a loan is made.  We will notify the owner at least thirty                  
days in advance of any increase in the annual loan interest rate                
applicable to any outstanding loan.                                             

Interest is due and payable at the end of each policy year while                
a loan is outstanding.  If interest is not paid when due, the                   
amount of the interest is added to the loan and becomes part of                 
the outstanding loan.                                                           

Policy Debt.  Outstanding loans (including unpaid interest added                
to the loan) plus accrued interest not yet due equals the policy                
debt.                                                                           

Loan Collateral.  When a policy loan is made, an amount                         
sufficient to secure the loan is transferred out of the variable                
account and the guaranteed account and into the policy's loan                   
account.  Thus, a loan will have no immediate effect on the                     
account value, but other policy values, such as the cash                        
surrender value and the death benefit proceeds, will be reduced                 
immediately by the amount transferred to the loan account.  This                
transfer is made against the account value in each subdivision                  
and the guaranteed account in proportion to the account value in                
each on the effective date of the loan, unless the owner                        
specifies that transfers be made from specific subdivisions.  An                
amount of account value equal to any due and unpaid loan interest               
which exceeds interest credited to the loan account will also be                
transferred to the loan account on each annual date.  Such                      
interest will be transferred from each subdivision and the                      
guaranteed account in the same proportion that account value in                 
each subdivision and the guaranteed account bears to the total                  
unloaned account value.                                                         

The loan account will be credited with interest at an effective                 
annual rate of not less than the annual loan interest rate, less                
1.25% during the first ten policy years, and 0.50% thereafter.                  
Thus, the maximum net cost of a loan per year is 1.25% during the               
first ten policy years, and 0.50% thereafter (the net cost of a                 
loan is the difference between the rate of interest charged on                  
policy loans and the amount credited on the equivalent amount                   
held in the loan account).  Union Central will determine the rate               
of interest to be credited to the loan account in its sole                      
discretion, and the rate may change from time to time.                          

Loan Repayment; Effect if Not Repaid.  You may repay all or part                
of your policy debt at any time while the insured is living and                 
the policy is in force.  Loan repayments must be sent to the home               
office and will be credited as of the date received.  The owner                 
may give us notice that a specific unscheduled premium made while               
a loan is outstanding is to be applied as a loan repayment.                     
(Loan repayments, unlike unscheduled premiums, are not subject to               
premium expense charges.)  We will apply any planned periodic                   
premiums, and any unscheduled  premiums without notice, as                      
premium payments.  When a loan repayment is made, account value                 
in the loan account in an amount equivalent to the repayment is                 
transferred from the loan account to the subdivisions and the                   
guaranteed account.  Thus, a loan repayment will have no                        
immediate effect on the account value, but other policy values,                 
such as the cash surrender value, will be increased immediately                 
by the amount of the loan repayment.  Amounts will be transferred               
to the subdivisions and the guaranteed account in accordance with               
the owner's current net premium allocation instructions.                        

If the death benefit becomes payable while a loan is outstanding,               
the policy debt will be deducted in calculating the death benefit               
proceeds.                                                                       

If on a monthly date the cash value less any policy debt (the                   
cash surrender value) exceeds the amount of the monthly deduction               
due for the following policy month, the policy will be in                       
default.  You, and any assignee of record, will be sent notice of               
the default.  You will have a 61-day grace period to submit a                   
sufficient payment to avoid termination of coverage under the                   
policy.  The notice will specify the amount that must be repaid                 
to prevent termination.                                                         

Effect of Policy Loan.  A loan, whether or not repaid, will have                
a permanent effect on the death benefit and policy values because               
the investment results of the subaccounts of the separate account               
and current interest rates credited on account value in the                     
guaranteed account will apply only to the non-loaned portion of                 
the account value.  The longer the loan is outstanding, the                     
greater the effect is likely to be.  Depending on the investment                
results of the subaccounts or credited interest rates for the                   
guaranteed account while the loan is outstanding, the effect                    
could be favorable or unfavorable.  Loans may increase the                      
potential for lapse if investment results of the subaccounts are                
less than anticipated.  Also, loans could, particularly if not                  
repaid, make it more likely than otherwise for a policy to                      
terminate.  See "Tax Considerations," page   , for a discussion                 
of the tax treatment of policy loans, and the adverse tax                       
consequences if a policy lapses with loans outstanding.  In                     
addition, if your policy is a modified endowment contract, loans                
may be currently taxable and subject to a 10% penalty tax.                      

Surrendering the Policy for Cash Surrender Value                                

You may surrender your policy at any time for its cash surrender                
value by submitting notice to the home office.  Union Central may               
require return of the policy.  A surrender charge may apply.  See               
"Surrender Charges," page   .  A surrender request will be                      
processed as of the date your notice and all required documents                 
are received.  Payment will generally be made within seven                      
calendar days.  See "When Proceeds are Paid," page   , and                      
"Payments from the Guaranteed Account," page   .  The cash                      
surrender value may be taken in one lump sum or it may be applied               
to a payment option acceptable to you and to us.  See "Payment
Options," page   .  Your policy will terminate and cease to be in               
force if it is surrendered.  It cannot later be reinstated.  A                  
surrender may result in adverse tax consequences, and if your                   
policy is a modified endowment contract, may also trigger a 10%                 
penalty tax.  See "Tax Considerations," page   .                                

Partial Cash Surrenders                                                         

You may make partial cash surrenders under your policy at any                   
time subject to the conditions below.  You must submit notice to                
the home office.  Each partial cash surrender must be at least                  
$500.  The partial surrender amount may not exceed the cash                     
surrender value.  There is no fee or charge imposed on a partial                
cash surrender.  As of the date Union Central receives notice of                
a partial cash surrender request, the cash value will be reduced                
by the partial cash surrender amount.                                           

Unless the owner requests that a partial cash surrender be                      
deducted from specified subdivisions, the partial cash surrender                
amount will be deducted from your account value in the                          
subdivisions and in the guaranteed account pro-rata in proportion               
to the account value in each.                                                   

If death benefit Option A is in effect, Union Central will reduce               
the specified amount by the partial cash surrender amount.  Union               
Central may reject a partial cash surrender request if the                      
partial cash surrender would reduce the specified amount below                  
$50,000, or if the partial cash surrender would cause the policy                
to fail to qualify as a life insurance contract under applicable                
tax laws, as interpreted by Union Central.                                      

Partial cash surrender requests will be processed as of the date                
notice is received by us, and generally will be paid within seven               
calendar days.  See "When Proceeds Are Paid," page   , and                      
"Payments from the Guaranteed Account," page   .                                

A partial cash surrender may result in adverse tax consequences,                
and if your policy is a modified endowment contract, may also                   
trigger a 10% penalty tax.  See "Tax Considerations," page   .                  

Maturity Benefit                                                                

The maturity date is generally the insured's age 100.  If the                   
policy is still in force on the maturity date, the maturity                     
benefit will be paid to you.  The maturity benefit is equal to                  
the cash surrender value on the maturity date.                                  

Payment Options                                                                 

Surrender proceeds and death benefit proceeds under the policy                  
are generally payable in a lump sum.  We may offer alternative                  
payment options.  Owners or beneficiaries should contact Union                  
Central or their Union Central agent for information regarding                  
payment options that may be available at the time of payment.                   

ILLUSTRATIONS OF ACCOUNT VALUES, CASH SURRENDER VALUES, DEATH                   
BENEFITS AND ACCUMULATED PREMIUM PAYMENTS                                       

The following tables have been prepared to illustrate                           
hypothetically how certain values under a policy may change with                
investment performance over an extended period of time.  The                    
tables illustrate how account values, cash surrender values and                 
death benefits under a policy covering an insured of a given age                
on the issue date, would vary over time if periodic planned                     
premiums were paid annually and the return on the assets in the                 
each of the portfolios were an assumed uniform gross annual rate                
of 0%, 6% and 12%.  The values would be different from those                    
shown if the returns averaged 0%, 6% or 12% but fluctuated over                 
and under those averages throughout the years shown.  The tables                
also show planned periodic premiums accumulated at 5% interest                  
compounded annually.  THE HYPOTHETICAL INVESTMENT RATES OF RETURN               
ARE ILLUSTRATIVE ONLY AND SHOULD NOT BE DEEMED A REPRESENTATION                 
OF PAST OR FUTURE INVESTMENT RATES OF RETURN.  Actual rates of                  
return for a particular policy may be more or less than the                     
hypothetical investment rates of return and will depend on a                    
number of factors, including the investment allocations made by                 
an owner and prevailing rates.  These illustrations assume that                 
net premiums are allocated equally among the subdivisions                       
available under the policy, and that no amounts are allocated to                
the guaranteed account.                                                         

The illustrations reflect the fact that the net investment return               
on the assets held in the subaccounts is lower than the gross                   
after tax return of the selected portfolios.  The tables assume                 
an average annual expense ratio of 0.816% of the average daily                  
net assets of the portfolios available under the policies.  This                
average annual expense ratio is based on (i) the expense ratios                 
of each of the portfolios, except the Templeton International                   
Fund Class 2, for the last fiscal year, adjusted, as appropriate,               
for any material changes in expenses effective for the current                  
fiscal year of a portfolio.; and (ii) for the Templeton                         
International Fund Class 2, which commenced operations on May 1,
1997, the historical expenses of the Templeton International Fund               
Class 1 shares for the period ended December 31, 1996, and the                  
Rule 12b-1 fees applicable to the Class 2 shares. For information               
on the portfolios' expenses, see the prospectuses for the                       
portfolios accompanying this Prospectus.                                        

In addition, the illustrations reflect the daily charge to the                  
separate account for assuming mortality and expense risks, which                
is equal on an annual basis to 0.75% during the first ten policy                
years, and 0.25% thereafter.  After deduction of portfolio                      
expenses and the mortality and expense risk charge, the                         
illustrated gross annual investment rates of return of 0%, 6% and               
12% would correspond to approximate net annual rates of -1.554%,                
4.353% and 10.260%, respectively, during the first ten policy                   
years, and -1.060%, 4.876%, and 10.812%, respectively,                          
thereafter.                                                                     

The illustrations also reflect the deduction of the applicable                  
premium expense charge, and the monthly deduction, including the                
monthly cost of insurance charge for the hypothetical insured.                  
Union Central's current cost of insurance charges, and the higher               
guaranteed maximum cost of insurance charges that Union Central                 
has the contractual right to charge, are reflected in separate                  
illustrations on each of the following pages.  All the                          
illustrations reflect the fact that no charges for federal or                   
state income taxes are currently made against the separate                      
account and assume no policy debt or charges for supplemental                   
and/or rider benefits.                                                          

The illustrations are based on Union Central's sex distinct                     
preferred rates.  Upon request, owner(s) will be furnished with a               
comparable illustration based upon the proposed insured's                       
individual circumstances.  Such illustrations may assume                        
different hypothetical rates of return than those illustrated in                
the following tables.

(1)  Assumes that no policy loans have been made.                               

(2)  Current values reflect applicable Premium Expense Charges,                 
current cost of insurance rates, a monthly administrative charge                
of $25.00 per month in year 1 and $5.00 per month thereafter,                   
and a mortality and expense risk charge of 0.75% of assets                      
during the first ten policy years, and 0.25% thereafter.

(5)  The illustrated gross annual investment rates of return of                 
0%, 6%, and 12% would correspond to approximate net annual rates

(1)  Assumes that no policy loans have been made.                               

(2)  Guaranteed values reflect applicable Premium Expense                       
Charges, guaranteed cost of insurance rates, a monthly                          
administrative charge of $25.00 per month in year 1 and $10.00                  
per month thereafter, and a mortality and expense risk charge of                
0.75% of assets during the first ten policy years, and 0.25%                    
thereafter.                                                                     

(3)  Net investment returns are calculated as the hypothetical                  
gross investment returns less all charges and deductions shown                  
in the prospectus.                                                              

(4)  Assumes that the planned periodic premium is paid at the                   
beginning of each policy year.  Values would be different if the                
premiums are paid with a different frequency or in different                    
amounts.                                                                        

(5)  The illustrated gross annual investment rates of return of                 
0%, 6%, and 12% would correspond to approximate net annual rates                
of -1.554%, 4.353%, and 10.260% respectively, during the first                  
ten policy years, and -1.060%, 4.876%, and 10.812%.                             

THE HYPOTHETICAL INVESTMENT RATES OF RETURN SHOWN ABOVE AND                     
ELSEWHERE IN THIS PROSPECTUS ARE ILLUSTRATIVE ONLY AND                          
SHOULD NOT BE DEEMED A REPRESENTATION OF PAST OR FUTURE                         
INVESTMENT RATES OF RETURN.  ACTUAL RATES OF RETURN MAY BE                      
MORE OR LESS THAN THOSE SHOWN SHOWN AND WILL DEPEND ON A NUMBER                 
OF FACTORS INCLUDING THE INVESTMENT ALLOCATIONS MADE BY                         
AN OWNER AND PREVAILING RATES.  THE DEATH BENEFIT AND ACCOUNT                   
VALUE FOR A POLICY WOULD BE DIFFERENT FROM THOSE SHOWN                          
IF THE ACTUAL RATES OF RETURN AVERAGED 0%, 6%, OR 12% OVER A                    
PERIOD OF YEARS BUT ALSO FLUCTUATED ABOVE OR BELOW THOSE                        
AVERAGES FOR INDIVIDUAL POLICY YEARS. NO REPRESENTATION CAN BE                  
MADE BY THE COMPANY OR THE PORTFOLIOS THAT THESE                                
HYPOTHETICAL RATES OF RETURN CAN BE ACHIEVED FOR ANY ONE YEAR OR

OTHER POLICY BENEFITS AND PROVISIONS                                            

Limits on Rights to Contest the Policy                                          

Incontestability.  Subject to state regulation, Union Central                   
will not contest the policy, or any supplemental and/or rider                   
benefits (except accidental death and/or disability benefits),                  
after the policy or rider has been in force during the insured's                
lifetime for two years from the issue date or the effective date                
of the rider, unless fraud is involved.  Any increase in the                    
specified amount will be incontestable with respect to                          
statements made in the evidence of insurability for that                        
increase after the increase has been in force during the life of                
the insured for two years after the effective date of the                       
increase.                                                                       

Suicide Exclusion.  Subject to state regulation, if the insured                 
dies by suicide within two years after the issue date, we will                  
not pay a death benefit.  The policy will be terminated, and we                 
will return the premium payments made before death, less any                    
policy debt and any partial cash surrenders.  If the insured                    
dies by suicide within two years after an increase in specified                 
amount that is subject to evidence of insurability, we will not                 
pay any death benefit attributable to the increase.  In such                    
case, prior to calculating the death benefit, Union Central will                
restore to the cash value the sum of the monthly cost of                        
insurance charges made for that increase.                                       

Changes in the Policy or Benefits                                               

Misstatement of Age or Sex.  If the insured's age or sex has                    
been misstated in the application for the policy or in any                      
application for supplemental and/or rider benefits:                             

if the misstatement becomes known after the death of the                        
insured, then the death benefit under the policy or such                        
supplemental and/or rider benefits will be adjusted to the                      
correct amount (reflecting the correct age or sex) for the                      
monthly deduction made for the month in which death occurred;                   

if the misstatement becomes known during the lifetime of the                    
insured, policy values will be adjusted to those based on the                   
correct monthly deductions (reflecting the correct age or sex)                  
since the policy date.  If the policy's values are insufficient                 
to cover the monthly deduction on the prior monthly date, the                   
grace period will be deemed to have begun on such date, and                     
notification will be sent to the owner at least 61 days prior to                
the end of the grace period.                                                    

Other Changes.  At any time Union Central may make such changes                 
in the policy as are necessary to assure compliance at all times                
with the definition of life insurance prescribed by the Internal                
Revenue Code or to make the policy conform with any law or                      
regulation issued by any government agency to which it is                       
subject.                                                                        

When Proceeds Are Paid                                                          

Union Central will ordinarily pay any death benefit proceeds,                   
loan proceeds, partial cash surrender proceeds, or full                         
surrender proceeds within seven calendar days after receipt at                  
the home office of all the documents required for such a                        
payment.  Other than the death benefit, which is determined as                  
of the date of death, the amount will be determined as of the                   
date of receipt of required documents.  However, Union Central                  
may delay making a payment or processing a transfer request if                  
(1) the New York Stock Exchange is closed for other than a                      
regular holiday or weekend, trading on the New York Stock                       
Exchange is restricted by the SEC, or the SEC declares that an                  
emergency exists as a result of which the disposal or valuation                 
of separate account assets is not reasonably practicable; or (2)                
the SEC by order permits postponement of payment to protect                     
Union Central's policy owners. See also "Payments from the                      
Guaranteed Account," page   .                                                   

Reports to Policy Owners                                                        

Each year you will be sent a report at your last known address                  
showing, as of the end of the current report period:  account                   
value; cash value; death benefit; amount of interest credited to                
the guaranteed account; change in value of the variable account;                
premiums paid since the last report; loans; partial cash                        
surrenders; expense charges; and cost of insurance charges since                
the prior report; and any other information required by law.                    
You will also be sent an annual and a semi-annual report for                    
each portfolio underlying a subdivision to which you have                       
allocated account value, including a list of the securities held                
in each portfolio, as required by the 1940 Act.  In addition,                   
when you pay premium payments, or if you take out a loan,                       
transfer amounts or make partial cash surrenders, you will                      
receive a written confirmation of these transactions.                           

Assignment                                                                      

The policy may be assigned in accordance with its terms.  In                    
order for any assignment to be binding upon Union Central, it                   
must be in writing and filed at the home office.  Once Union                    
Central has received a signed copy of the assignment, the                       
owner's rights and the interest of any beneficiary (or any other                
person) will be subject to the assignment.  Union Central                       
assumes no responsibility for the validity or sufficiency of any                
assignment.  An assignment is subject to any policy debt.                       

Reinstatement                                                                   

The policy may be reinstated within five years after lapse and                  
before the maturity date, subject to compliance with certain                    
conditions, including the payment of a necessary premium payment                
and submission of satisfactory evidence of insurability.  See                   
your policy for further information.                                            

Supplemental and/or Rider Benefits                                              

The following supplemental and/or rider benefits may be                         
available and added to your policy.  Any monthly charges for                    
these benefits and/or riders will be deducted from your account                 
value as part of the monthly deduction (see page   ).  The                      
supplemental and/or rider benefits available with the policies                  
provide fixed benefits that do not vary with the investment                     
experience of the separate account.                                             

Term Insurance Rider for Other Insured Persons.  Provides a                     
death benefit amount payable on the death of other insured                      
persons specified.  The other insured death benefit amount may                  
be changed, subject to certain conditions.  In addition, the                    
rider coverage may be converted to a new policy on the other                    
insured, subject to certain conditions.                                         

Scheduled Increase Option Rider for the Insured.  Provides for                  
automatic increases in the specified amount on each annual date,                
subject to the terms of the rider; the amount of the increase is                
specified in the rider.  The rate class applicable to the                       
scheduled increases will be the rate class of the insured on the                
issue date of the rider.  There is no cost for this rider.                      

Guaranteed Death Benefit Rider.  Provides that the policy will                  
remain in force and will not lapse during the Guaranteed Death                  
Benefit Period, provided that the sum of premium payments to                    
date, less any partial cash surrenders and any policy debt,                     
equals or exceeds the Guaranteed Death Benefit Premium times the                
number of policy months since the policy date.  This rider                      
terminates on any monthly date when the sum of premium payments,                
less any partial cash surrenders and any policy debt, is less                   
than the Guaranteed Death Benefit Premium multiplied by the                     
number of policy months since the policy date.  Once terminated,                
this rider will not be reinstated. This rider is not available                  
for all ages and rate classes, or under certain circumstances                   
where the Term Insurance Rider for Other Insured Persons is also                
added to the policy.                                                            

Cost of Living Rider for the Insured.  Provides for automatic                   
increases in the specified amount on each annual date, subject                  
to the terms of the rider; the amount of the increase will be                   
based on increases in the Consumer Price Index, as specified in                 
the rider.  The rate class applicable to the cost of living                     
increases will be the rate class of the insured on the issue                    
date of the rider.  There is no cost for this rider.                            

Guaranteed Insurability Option Rider.  Provides the right to                    
increase the specified amount on each option date by the benefit                
amount shown in the rider.  No evidence of insurability will be                 
required.  Option dates are the annual dates nearest the                        
insured's 25th, 28th, 31st, 34th, 37th, and 40th birthdays.                     
Option dates may be advanced in the event of the insured's                      
marriage or adoption of a child.                                                

Accidental Death Benefit Rider.  Provides an additional death                   
benefit payable if the insured's death results from certain                     
accidental causes.  There is no cash value for this benefit.                    

Total Disability Benefit Rider - Waiver of Monthly Deduction.                   
Provides for waiver of the monthly deduction during the total                   
disability of the insured.                                                      

Total Disability Benefit Rider - Policy Continuation to Maturity                
Date Not Guaranteed.  Provides for the crediting to the policy                  
as premium payments the monthly total disability benefit set                    
forth in the rider during the total disability of the insured.                  

Children's Insurance Rider.  Provides a death benefit payable on                
the death of a child of the insured.  More than one child can be                
covered.  There is no cash value for this benefit.                              

Insurance Exchange Rider.  Provides the right to exchange the                   
policy for a new policy on the life of a substitute insured.                    
Exercise of the right is subject to satisfactory evidence of                    
insurability of the substitute insured, and may result in a cost                
or credit to the owner.  The new policy can be any adjustable                   
life insurance policy issued by Union Central at the time the                   
exchange privilege is exercised.  The policy date for the new                   
policy will generally be the same as the policy date of the                     
exchanged policy; the issue date for the new policy will be the                 
date of exchange.  The initial cash value under the new policy                  
will be the same as the cash value of the policy on the date of                 
the exchange.  There is no cost for this rider, and there are no                
charges or other fees imposed under the policy or the new policy                
at the time of the exchange.  For purposes of calculating any                   
surrender charges subsequently imposed on the policy acquired by                
exchange, we will take into account the number of policy years                  
that this policy, and the policy acquired by exchange, have been                
in force.  Exercise of this rider will result in a taxable                      
exchange.                                                                       

Accelerated Benefits Rider.  Union Central intends to offer in                  
the future a rider benefit that will allow you to receive an                    
accelerated payment of a portion of the policy's death benefit.                 
This advance payment of the death benefit will be available                     
where certain special needs exist, as described briefly below.                  
The right to exercise the rider will be subject to conditions                   
specified in the rider.  We will make the accelerated benefits                  
rider available to you only if (1) your state insurance                         
department has approved the rider, and (2) the availability of                  
the rider will not, in Union Central's view, jeopardize the                     
qualification of the policy as life insurance under federal                     
income tax law.  However, Union Central may determine not to                    
offer the benefit, or may offer a substantially different                       
benefit, to the extent that we deem advisable in light of future                
clarification or interpretation of applicable federal income tax                
law.  If the accelerated benefit rider is offered, it is                        
expected to provide that if the insured is diagnosed as                         
terminally ill, as defined in the rider, you may request an                     
accelerated payment of the policy's death benefit.  The payment                 
may be subject to discounting and charges.  Payment will be                     
subject to evidence satisfactory to Union Central. You should                   
consult your tax adviser before you request accelerated payment.                

ADDITIONAL RULES AND LIMITS APPLY TO THESE SUPPLEMENTAL AND/OR                  
RIDER BENEFITS.  NOT ALL SUCH BENEFITS MAY BE AVAILABLE AT ANY                  
TIME AND IN ANY GIVEN STATE, AND SUPPLEMENTAL AND/OR RIDER                      
BENEFITS IN ADDITION TO THOSE LISTED ABOVE MAY BE MADE                          
AVAILABLE.  PLEASE ASK YOUR UNION CENTRAL AGENT FOR FURTHER                     
INFORMATION, OR CONTACT THE HOME OFFICE.                                        

Participating                                                                   

The policy is issued on a participating basis, and as such is                   
eligible to share in Union Central's profits and surplus to the                 
extent determined by our Board of Directors in its sole                         
discretion.  Union Central does not currently anticipate that                   
the policies will participate in profits or surplus in the                      
foreseeable future.                                                             

State Variations                                                                

Certain policy features, including the "free look,"                             
incontestability, and suicide provisions, are subject to state                  
variation.  The owner should read his or her policy carefully to                
determine whether any variations apply in the state in which the                
policy is issued.                                                               

TAX CONSIDERATIONS 

The following summary provides a general description of the                     
Federal income tax considerations associated with the policy and                
does not purport to be complete or to cover all situations.                     
This discussion is not intended as tax advice.  Counsel or other                
competent tax advisers should be consulted for more complete                    
information.  This discussion is based upon Union Central's                     
understanding of the present Federal income tax laws as they are                
currently interpreted by the Internal Revenue Service (the                      
"Service").  No representation is made as to the likelihood of                  
continuation of the present Federal income tax laws or of the                   
current interpretations by the Internal Revenue Service.                        

Tax Status of the Policy                                                        

Section 7702 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended                   
(the "Code") sets forth a definition of a life insurance                        
contract for Federal income tax purposes.  Although the                         
Secretary of the Treasury (the "Treasury") is authorized to                     
prescribe regulations implementing Section 7702, while proposed                 
regulations and other interim guidance has been issued, final                   
regulations have not been adopted.  In short, guidance as to how                
Section 7702 is to be applied is limited.  If a policy were                     
determined not to be a life insurance contract for purposes of                  
Section 7702, such policy would not provide the tax advantages                  
normally provided by a life insurance policy.                                   

With respect to a policy issued on a standard basis, Union                      
Central believes that such a policy should meet the Section 7702                
definition of a life insurance contract.  With respect to a                     
policy that is issued on a substandard basis (i.e., a premium                   
class with extra rating involving higher than standard mortality                
risk), there is less guidance, in particular as to how the                      
mortality and other expense requirements of Section 7702 are to                 
be applied in determining whether such a policy meets the                       
section 7702 definition of a life insurance contract.  Thus, it                 
is not clear whether or not a policy issued on a substandard                    
basis would satisfy section 7702, particularly if the owner pays                
the full amount of premiums permitted under the policy.                         

If it is subsequently determined that a policy does not satisfy                 
Section 7702, Union Central may take whatever steps are                         
appropriate and reasonable to attempt to cause such a policy to                 
comply with Section 7702.  For these reasons, Union Central                     
reserves the right to modify the policy as necessary to attempt                 
to qualify it as a life insurance contract under Section 7702.                  

Section 817(h) of the Code requires that the investments of each                
of the subaccounts must be "adequately diversified" in                          
accordance with Treasury regulations in order for the policy to                 
qualify as a life insurance contract under Section 7702 of the                  
Code (discussed above).  The subaccounts, through the                           
portfolios, intend to comply with the diversification                           
requirements prescribed in Treas. Reg. Section 1.817-5, which                   
affect how the portfolio's assets are to be invested.  Union                    
Central believes that the subaccounts will, thus, meet the                      
diversification requirements, and Union Central will monitor                    
continued compliance with this requirement.                                     

In certain circumstances, owners of variable life insurance                     
contracts may be considered the owners, for federal income tax                  
purposes, of the assets of the subaccounts used to support their                
contracts.  In those circumstances, income and gains from the                   
subaccount assets would be includible in the variable contract                  
owner's gross income.  The IRS has stated in published rulings                  
that a variable contract owner will be considered the owner of                  
subaccount assets if the contract owner possesses incidents of                  
ownership in those assets, such as the ability to exercise                      
investment control over the assets.  The Treasury Department has                
also announced, in connection with the issuance of regulations                  
concerning diversification, that those regulations "do not                      
provide guidance concerning the circumstances in which investor                 
control of the investments of a segregated asset account may                    
cause the investor (i.e., the policyowner), rather than the                     
insurance company, to be treated as the owner of the assets in                  
the account."  This announcement also stated that guidance would                
be issued by way of regulations or rulings on the "extent to                    
which policyholders may direct their investments to particular                  
subaccounts without being treated as owners of the underlying                   
assets."                                                                        

The ownership rights under the policy are similar to, but                       
different in certain respects from, those described by the IRS                  
in rulings in which it was determined that policyowners were not                
owners of subaccount assets.  For example, an owner has                         
additional flexibility in allocating premium payments and                       
account  value.  These differences could result in an owner                     
being treated as the owner of a pro rata portion of the assets                  
of the subaccounts.  In addition, Union Central does not know                   
what standards will be set forth, if any, in the regulations or                 
rulings which the Treasury Department has stated it expects to                  
issue.  Union Central therefore reserves the right to modify the                
policy as necessary to attempt to prevent an owner from being                   
considered the owner of a pro rata share of the assets of the                   
subaccounts.                                                                    

The following discussion assumes that the policy will qualify as                
a life insurance contract for Federal income tax purposes.                      

Tax Treatment of Policy Benefits                                                

In General.  Union Central believes that the proceeds and cash                  
value increases of a policy should be treated in a manner                       
consistent with a fixed-benefit life insurance policy for                       
Federal income tax purposes.  Thus, the death benefit under the                 
policy should be excludible from the gross income of the                        
beneficiary under Section 101(a)(1) of the Code.                                

Depending on the circumstances, the exchange of a policy, a                     
change in the policy's death benefit option, a policy loan, a                   
partial cash surrender, a surrender, a change in ownership, or                  
an assignment of the policy may have Federal income tax                         
consequences.  In addition, federal, state and local transfer,                  
and other tax consequences of ownership or receipt of policy                    
proceeds depends on the circumstances of each owner or                          
beneficiary.                                                                    

The policy may also be used in various arrangements, including                  
nonqualified deferred compensation or salary continuance plans,                 
split dollar insurance plans, executive bonus plans, retiree                    
medical benefit plans and others.  The tax consequences of such                 
plans may vary depending on the particular facts and                            
circumstances of each individual arrangement.  Therefore, if you                
are contemplating the use of a policy in any arrangement the                    
value of which depends in part on its tax consequences, you                     
should be sure to consult a qualified tax advisor regarding the                 
tax attributes of the particular arrangement.                                   

Generally, the owner will not be deemed to be in constructive                   
receipt of the account value, including increments thereof,                     
until there is a distribution.  The tax consequences of                         
distributions from, and loans taken from or secured by, a policy                
depend on whether the policy is classified as a "Modified
Endowment Contract."  Whether a policy is or is not a Modified                  
Endowment Contract, upon a complete surrender or lapse of a                     
policy or when benefits are paid at a policy's maturity date, if                
the amount received plus the amount of indebtedness exceeds the                 
total investment in the policy, the excess will generally be                    
treated as ordinary income subject to tax.                                      

Modified Endowment Contracts.  Section 7702A establishes a class                
of life insurance contracts designated as "Modified Endowment                   
Contracts," which applies to life insurance contracts entered                   
into or materially changed after June 20, 1988.  The rules                      
relating to whether a policy will be treated as a Modified                      
Endowment Contract are extremely complex and cannot be fully                    
described in the limited confines of this summary.  In general,                 
a policy will be a Modified Endowment Contract if the                           
accumulated premiums paid at any time during the first seven                    
policy years exceeds the sum of the net level premiums which                    
would have been paid on or before such time if the policy                       
provided for paid-up future benefits after the payment of seven                 
level annual premiums.  A policy may also become a Modified                     
Endowment Contract after a material change.  The determination                  
of whether a policy will be a Modified Endowment Contract after                 
a material change generally depends upon the relationship of the                
death benefit and account value at the time of such change and                  
the additional premiums paid in the seven years following the                   
material change.                                                                

Due to the policy's flexibility, classification as a Modified                   
Endowment Contract will depend on the individual circumstances                  
of each policy.  In view of the foregoing, a current or                         
prospective owner should consult with a competent tax advisor to                
determine whether a policy transaction will cause the policy to                 
be treated as a Modified Endowment Contract.  Union Central has                 
established procedures for monitoring premium payments made                     
under the policies and for making efforts to notify you on a                    
timely basis if your policy is in jeopardy of becoming a                        
Modified Endowment Contract due to the payment of premiums.  If                 
acceptance of a premium paid would, in Union Central's view,                    
cause the policy to become a Modified Endowment Contract, then                  
to the extent feasible Union Central will not accept that                       
portion of the premium that would cause the policy to become a                  
Modified Endowment Contract unless the owner confirms in writing                
the owner's intent to convert the policy to a Modified Endowment                
Contract.  Union Central may return that portion of the payment                 
pending receipt of instructions from the owner.                                 

Distributions from Policies Classified as Modified Endowment                    
Contracts.  Policies classified as Modified Endowment Contracts                 
will be subject to the following tax rules:  First, all                         
distributions, including distributions upon surrender and                       
partial cash surrender from such a policy are treated as                        
ordinary income subject to tax up to the amount equal to the                    
excess (if any) of the account value immediately before the                     
distribution over the investment in the policy described below)                 
at such time.  Second, loans taken from or secured by such a                    
policy are treated as distributions from the policy and taxed                   
accordingly.  Past due loan interest that is added to the loan                  
amount will be treated as a loan.  Third, a 10 percent                          
additional income tax is imposed on the portion of any                          
distribution from, or loan taken from or secured by, such a                     
policy that is included in income except where the distribution                 
or loan is made on or after the owner attains age 59-1/2, is                    
attributable to the owner's becoming disabled, or is part of a                  
series of substantially equal periodic payments for the life (or                
life expectancy) of the owner or the joint lives (or joint life                 
expectancies) of the owner and the owner's beneficiary.                         

If a policy becomes a modified endowment contract after it is                   
issued, distributions made during the policy year in which it                   
becomes a modified endowment contract, distributions in any                     
subsequent policy year and distributions within two years before                
the policy becomes a modified endowment contract will be subject                
to the tax treatment described above.  This means that a                        
distribution from a policy that is not a modified endowment                     
contract could later become taxable as a distribution from a                    
modified endowment contract.                                                    

Distributions From Policies Not Classified as Modified Endowment                
Contracts.  Distributions from a policy that is not a Modified                  
Endowment Contract are generally treated as first, recovering                   
the investment in the policy (described below) and then, only                   
after the return of all such investment in the policy, as                       
distributing taxable income.  An exception to this general rule                 
occurs in the case of a decrease in the policy's death benefit                  
or any other change that reduces benefits under the policy in                   
the first 15 years after the policy is issued and that results                  
in a cash distribution to the owner in order for the policy to                  
continue complying with the Section 7702 definitional limits.                   
Such a cash distribution will be taxed in whole or in part as                   
ordinary income (to the extent of any gain in the policy) under                 
rules prescribed in Section 7702.                                               

Loans from, or secured by, a policy that is not a Modified                      
Endowment Contract are not treated as distributions.  Instead,                  
such loans are treated as indebtedness of the owner.                            

Finally, neither distributions (including distributions upon                    
surrender) nor loans from, or secured by, a policy that is not a                
Modified Endowment Contract are subject to the 10 percent                       
additional income tax rule.                                                     

Policy Loan Interest.  Interest paid on any loan under a policy                 
is generally not deductible.  A qualified tax adviser should be                 
consulted before deducting any policy loan interest.                            

Investment in the Policy.  Investment in the policy means:  (i)                 
the aggregate amount of any premiums or other consideration paid                
for a policy, minus (ii) the aggregate amount received under the                
policy which is excluded from gross income of the owner (except                 
that the amount of any loan from, or secured by, a policy that                  
is a Modified Endowment Contract, to the extent such amount is                  
excluded from gross income, will be disregarded), plus (iii) the                
amount of any loan from, or secured by, a policy that is a                      
Modified Endowment Contract to the extent that such amount is                   
included in the gross income of the owner.                                      

Multiple Policies.  All Modified Endowment Contracts that are                   
issued by Union Central (or its affiliates) to the same owner                   
during any calendar year are treated as one Modified Endowment                  
Contract for purposes of determining the amount includible in an                
owner's gross income under Section 72(e) of the Code.                           

Possible Charge for Union Central's Taxes                                       

At the present time, Union Central makes no charge for any                      
Federal, state or local taxes (other than the charge for state                  
premium taxes) that it incurs that may be attributable to the                   
subaccounts or to the policies.  Union Central, however,                        
reserves the right in the future to make additional charges for                 
any such tax or other economic burden resulting from the                        
application of the tax laws that it determines to be properly                   
attributable to the subaccounts or to the policies.  Owners will                
be notified in advance of the imposition of any such charges for                
taxes.  If any tax charges are made in the future, they will be                 
accumulated daily and transferred from the applicable subaccount                
to Union Central's General Account.  Any investment earnings on                 
tax charges accumulated in a subaccount will be retained by                     
Union Central.

The policies will be offered to the public on a continuous                      
basis, and we do not anticipate discontinuing the offering of                   
the policies.  However, we reserve the right to discontinue the                 
offering.  Applications for policies are solicited by agents who                
are licensed by applicable state insurance authorities and                      
appointed by us to sell our variable life contracts and who are                 
also registered representatives of Carillon Investments, Inc.                   
("Carillon Investments") or of a broker-dealer that has entered                 
into a selling agreement with Carillon Investments.  The address                
of Carillon Investments, one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries,                  
is 1876 Waycross Road, Cincinnati, Ohio 45240.   Carillon                      
Investments is registered with the SEC under the Securities                     
Exchange Act of 1934 as a broker-dealer and is a member of the                  
National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.                                

Carillon Investments acts as the principal underwriter (as                      
defined in the 1940 Act) for the separate account, pursuant to                  
an underwriting agreement between Union Central and Carillon                    
Investments.  Carillon Investments is not obligated to sell any                 
specific number of policies.  Selling agents may be paid a                      
maximum of 50% of planned periodic premiums paid up to an amount                
equal to one "target premium," plus 2% of any other first-year                  
premiums.  A "target premium" is an amount of premium based on                  
the insured's age at issue, sex, rate class, specified amount,                  
and supplemental and/or rider benefits.  Selling agents may also                
receive service fees in policy years after the first, additional                
compensation based on persistency or other policy-related                       
factors, as well as non-cash compensation.  Sales managers may                  
also be compensated.

Report of Independent Auditors                
=============================================================                   

To the Contractholders of Carillon Life                                         
Account and the Board of Directors of                                           
The Union Central Life Insurance Company                                        

We have audited the accompanying statements of assets and                       
liabilities of the Carillon Life Account (comprised of the                      
Carillon Fund, Inc. Equity, Capital, Bond, and S & P 500 Index                  
Subaccounts, the Scudder Variable Life Investment Fund Money                    
Market, Capital Growth, and International Subaccounts, MFS                      
Variable Insurance Trust Growth with Income and High Income                     
Subaccounts, and TCI Portfolios, Inc. Growth Subaccount) as of                  
December 31, 1996, the related statements of operations for the                 
year then ended and the statements of changes in net assets for                 
the year then ended.  These financial statements are the                        
responsibility of the Company's management.  Our responsibility                 
is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on                 
our audits.                                                                     

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted                   
auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and                   
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether                  
the financial statements are free of material misstatement.  An                 
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting                  
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  Our                   
procedures included confirmation of the number of shares owned                  
as of  December 31, 1996, by correspondence with the transfer                   
agents for Carillon Fund, Inc.  Scudder Variable Life Investment                
Fund, MFS Variable Insurance Trust, and TCI Portfolios, Inc.  An                
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and                
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating                 
the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that                  
our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.                          

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above                      
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position                
of each of the subaccounts constituting the Carillon Life                       
Account at December 31, 1996, the results of their operations                   
and changes in net assets for the year then ended in conformity                 
with generally accepted accounting principles.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS                   
=============================================================                   
DECEMBER 31, 1996 
NOTE 1 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES                                        

Carillon Life Account of The Union Central Life Insurance                       
Company (the Life Account) is a separate account registered

Investments, Inc., a broker-dealer registered under the                         
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and a wholly-owned subsidiary                   
of Union Central , serves as the distributor of variable                        
annuity contracts issued by Carillon Fund, Inc.  The shares of

Trust, and TCI Portfolios, Inc. are available and are being                     
marketed exclusively as a pooled funding vehicle for life                       
insurance companies writing all types of variable life                          
insurance policies and variable annuity contracts.  Scudder

contracts issued by TCI Portfolios, Inc.                                        

The assets of the Life Account are segregated from  the other                   
assets of Union Central and the investment performance of the                   
Account is independent of the investment performance of both                    
Union Central's general assets and other separate accounts.                     

Investment valuation - Assets of the Life Account are invested                  
in shares of the Funds at the net asset value of the Fund                       
shares.  Investments in Fund shares are subsequently valued at                  
the net asset value of the Fund shares held.                                    

Securities transactions and investment income - Securities                      
transactions are recorded on the trade date (the date the order                 
to buy or sell is executed), and dividend income is recorded on                 
the ex-dividend date.  Gains and losses on sales of Fund shares                 
are calculated on the first-in, first-out basis for financial                   
reporting and tax purposes.  All dividends and distributions                    
from the Subaccount are reinvested in additional shares of the                  
respective Subaccount at the net asset value per share.                         

Federal income taxes - The operations of the Life Account form                  
a part of and are taxed with the operations of Union Central.                   
Union Central is taxed as a life insurance company under                        
Subchapter L of the Internal Revenue Code.  Under existing                      
federal income tax law, separate account investment income and                  
capital gains are not taxed to the extent they are applied to                   
increase reserves under a contract issued in connection with                    
the Life Account.  Investment income and realized capital gains                 
and losses on assets of the Life Account are automatically                      
applied to increase or decrease reserves under the contract.                    
Accordingly, no provision for federal income taxes has been                     
made in these financial statements.

NOTE 3 - ACCOUNT CHARGE                                                         

Mortality and expense risk charge - A mortality and expense                     
risk charge for Union Central at an annual rate of .75% of the                  
net assets during the first ten policy years and .25% of net                    
assets thereafter of the Life Account is determined daily. The                  
mortality risk Union Central assumes is that the insureds on                    
the policies may die sooner than anticipated and therefore                      
Union Central will pay an aggregate amount of death benefits                    
greater than anticipated.  The expense risk assumed by Union                    
Central is that expenses incurred in assuming and administering                 
the policies and the separate account will exceed the amounts                   
realized from the administrative charges assessed against the                   
policies.

Report of Independent Auditors        

To the Board of Directors                                                       
The Union Central Life Insurance Company                                        

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of                 
The Union Central Life Insurance Company and subsidiaries as of                 
December 31, 1996 and 1995, and the related consolidated                        
statements of income, equity, and cash flows for the years then                 
ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the                 
Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an                       
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.                      

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted                   
auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and                    
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether                  
the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An                  
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting                  
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An                     
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and                
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating                 
the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that                   
our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.                          

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above                      
present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated                      
financial position of The Union Central Life Insurance Company                  
and subsidiaries at December 31, 1996, and 1995, and the                        
consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows                   
for the years then ended in conformity with generally accepted                  
accounting principles.

principles (GAAP) and include the accounts of The Union Central                 
Life Insurance Company (Union Central) and its subsidiaries:  The               
Manhattan Life Insurance Company (Manhattan Life), a mixed

"the Company".  All significant intercompany accounts and                       
transactions have been eliminated in the accompanying                           
consolidated financial statements.  Union Central also has the                  
following unconsolidated investment affiliates:  Carillon Fund,                 
Inc., a variable products mutual fund consisting of four                        
investment portfolios (equity, bond, asset allocation, and S&P                  
500 indexed); Carillon Investment Trust, a mutual fund; and                     
Summit Investment Trust, a high-yield mutual fund.  In addition,                
Carillon Advisors, Inc., owns 51% of First Summit Capital                       
Management, a registered investment advisor.                                    

The Company provides a wide spectrum of financial products and                  
related services for the benefit of individual, group and pension               
policyholders.  Such products and services include insurance to                 
provide for financial needs resulting from loss of life or income               
and management of funds accumulated for preretirement and                       
retirement needs.                                                               

The Company is licensed to do business in all 50 states in the                  
United States.                                                                  

The preparation of financial statements requires management to                  
make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in                  
the financial statements and accompanying notes.  Such estimates                
and assumptions could change in the future as more information                  
becomes known, which could impact the amounts reported and                      
disclosed herein.                                                               

Accounting Changes                                                              

On November 15, 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board                  
(FASB) issued a Special Report "A Guide to Implemention of                      
Statement 115 on Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and                 
Equity Securities"(SFAS 115 Special Report).  In accordance with                
provisions in the SFAS 115 Special Report, the Company                          
reclassified all "Held-to-Maturity" securities to "Available-for-               
Sale."  The adoption had an immaterial effect on the Company's                  
equity.                                                                         

In 1995, the Company adopted FASB Statement No. 114," Accounting                
by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan" as amended by FASB                       
Statement No. 118, "Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a                 
Loan-Income Recognition and Disclosures."  The effect of adoption               
was immaterial.                                                                 

Investments                                                                     

Fixed maturity and equity securities classified as available-for-               
sale are carried at fair value with net unrealized gains and                    
losses reported as a separate component of equity.                              

Other investments are reported on the following bases:                          

*   Mortgage loans on real estate are carried at their                    
aggregate unpaid balance less unamortized discount and            
less an allowance for possible losses.                            

*   Real estate acquired through foreclosure is carried at                
the lower of cost or its net realizable value.                    

*   Policy loans are reported at unpaid balances.                         

*   Cash and short-term investments presented on the Balance              
Sheets consist of cash-in-bank, cash-in-transit and               
commercial paper that has a maturity date of 90 days or           
less from the date acquired.                                      

The fair values of fixed maturity and equity securities represent               
quoted market values from published sources or calculated market                
values using the "yield method" if no quoted market values are                  
obtainable.                                                                     

Realized gains and losses, net of related deferred policy                       
acquisition cost amortization, on sales of investments, and                     
declines in the value of investments judged to be other-than-                   
temporary, are recognized on a specific identification basis.                   

Interest is not accrued on mortgage loans or bonds for which                    
principal or interest payments are determined to be                             
uncollectible.                                                                  

Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs                                               

The costs of acquiring new business, principally commissions,                   
certain expenses of the policy issue and underwriting department                
and certain variable agency expenses have been deferred.                        
Deferred policy acquisition costs are amortized consistent with                 
the methods described in "Policy Liabilities, Revenues, Benefits
and Expenses," and the effect of realized gains and losses on                   
deferred policy acquisition cost amortization is restored or                    
amortized and is netted against "Net realized losses on                         
investments".  Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs                
totalled $33,523,000 and $35,774,000, net of the effect of                      
realized losses on amortization of ($9,176,000) and ($5,180,000)                
for the years ended December 31, 1996 and 1995, respectively.                   
Deferred policy acquisition costs for participating life and                    
universal life business are adjusted to reflect the impact of                   
unrealized gains and losses on fixed maturity securities                        
available-for-sale.  These adjustments totalled $7,143,000, and                 
$21,914,000 at 1996 and 1995, respectively.                                     

Property, Plant and Equipment                                                   

Property, plant and equipment is valued at historical cost less                 
accumulated depreciation in the Balance Sheets.  It consists                    
primarily of Union Central's home office, capital leases for                    
furniture and equipment, furniture and fixtures and electronic                  
data processing equipment.                                                      

Depreciation is computed with the straight-line method over the                 
estimated useful lives of the respective assets, not to exceed 10               
years for office furniture and 5 years for electronic data                      
processing equipment.  Depreciation is computed for leasehold                   
improvements with the straight-line method over the shorter of                  
the remaining lease term or useful life of the improvements.                    

Deposit Funds                                                                   

The liability for deposit funds is generally established at the                 
policyholders' accumulated cash values plus amounts provided for                
guaranteed interest.                                                            

Policy Claims                                                                   

Policy claim reserves represent the estimated ultimate net cost                 
of all reported and unreported claims incurred.  In addition, a                 
claim adjustment expense reserve is held to account for the                     
expenses associated with administering these claims.  The                       
reserves for unpaid claims are estimated using individual case                  
basis valuations and statistical analyses.  The claim adjustment                
expense reserve is estimated using statistical analyses.  These                 
estimates are subject to the effects of trends in claim severity                
and frequency.  Although some variability is inherent in such                   
estimates, management believes that the reserves for claims and                 
claim related expenses are adequate.  The estimates are                         
continually reviewed and adjusted as necessary as experience                    
develops or new information becomes known; and such adjustments                 
are included in current operations.                                             

Dividends to Policyholders                                                      

Union Central's dividend liability is the amount estimated to                   
have accrued to policyholders' as of each year end.  Manhattan                  
Life's dividend liability is based on the dividend scale in                     
effect at the time the policy was issued.                                       

Separate Accounts                                                               

Separate Account assets and liabilities reported in the                         
accompanying financial statements pertain to segregated funds                   
which are administered for pension and other clients, including                 
purchasers of Union Central's variable insurance and annuity                    
contracts.  Other than amounts derived from, or otherwise                       
attributable to, the General Account (which amounts are included                
in surplus), assets of Separate Accounts are not available to                   
fund the liabilities of the General Account.  Separate Account                  
assets include common stocks, long-term bonds, mortgages and                    
short-term investments.  Separate Account liabilities represent                 
reserves established to meet withdrawal and future benefits                     
payment contractual provisions.  Union Central derives certain                  
fees for maintaining and managing the Separate Accounts, but                    
bears no investment risk on these assets, except to the extent                  
that it participates in a particular Separate Account.                          
Investment risk associated with market value changes are borne by               
the owner of the contract and not by Union Central.                             

Recognition of Premium Revenues and Related Costs                               

POLICY LIABILITIES, REVENUES, BENEFITS AND EXPENSES 

Traditional Insurance Products                                                  
Traditional insurance products include those products with fixed                
and guaranteed premiums and benefits and consist primarily of                   
whole life insurance policies, term insurance policies and                      
disability income policies.  Premiums for traditional products                  
are recognized as revenue when due.                                             

The liability for future policy benefits for participating                      
traditional life is computed using a net level premium method and               
the guaranteed mortality and dividend fund interest.  The                       
mortality and interest assumptions are equivalent to statutory                  
assumptions.  The liabilities for future policy benefits and                    
expenses for nonparticipating traditional life policies and                     
disability income policies are generally computed using a net                   
level premium method and assumptions for investment yields,                     
morbidity, and withdrawals based principally on company                         
experience projected at the time of policy issue, with provision                
for possible and adverse deviations.  Interest assumptions for                  
participating traditional life reserves for all policies ranged                 
from 2.25% to 5.50% for the years ended 1996 and 1995.                          

The costs of acquiring new traditional business, principally                    
commissions, certain policy issue and underwriting expenses (such               
as medical examination and inspection report fees) and certain                  
agency expenses, all of which vary with and are primarily related               
to the production of new and renewal business, are deferred to                  
the extent that such costs are deemed recoverable through future                
gross premiums.  Such non-participating deferred acquisition                    
costs are amortized over the anticipated premium paying period of               
the related policies, generally not to exceed 30 years, using                   
assumptions consistent with those used to develop policy benefit                
reserves.  For participating life insurance products, deferred                  
policy acquisition costs are being amortized in proportion to                   
estimated gross margins of the related policies.  Gross margins                 
are determined for each issue year and are equal to premiums plus               
investment income less death claims, surrender benefits,                        
administrative costs, policyholder dividends, and the increase in               
reserve for future policy benefits.  The future investment yields               
are assumed to range from 7.36% to 8.62% for the years ended 1996               
and 1995.  Changes in dividend payouts are assumed with changes                 
in yields.                                                                      

Universal Life and Other Interest Sensitive Products                            

Interest sensitive products include universal life and single                   
premium whole life products.  They are distinguished by the                     
existence of a separately definable fund that is credited with                  
interest and from which any policy charges are taken.  Revenues                 
for these products consist of policy charges for the cost of                    
insurance, policy administration charges, and surrender charges                 
that have been assessed against policyholder account balances                   
during the period.                                                              

Benefit reserves for universal life and other interest sensitive                
products are computed in accordance with the retrospective                      
deposit method and represent policy account balances before                     
applicable surrender charges.  Policy benefits that are charged                 
to expense include benefit claims incurred in the period in                     
excess of related policy account balances and interest credited                 
to account balances.  Interest crediting rates ranged from 4.75%                
to 7.60% for the years ended 1996 and 1995.                                     

The cost of acquiring universal life and other interest sensitive               
products, principally commissions, certain policy issue and                     
underwriting expenses (such as medical examination and inspection               
report fees) and certain agency expenses, all of which vary with                
and are primarily related to the production of new and renewal                  
business, are deferred to the extent that such costs are deemed                 
recoverable through future estimated gross profits.  Acquisition                
costs for universal life and other interest sensitive products                  
are amortized over the life of the policies in proportion to the                
present value of expected gross profits from surrender charges                  
and investment, mortality and expense margins.  The amortization                
is adjusted retrospectively when estimates of current or future                 
gross profits (including the impact of investment gains and                     
losses) to be realized from a group of products are revised.                    

Amounts assessed policyholders that represent revenue for                       
services to be provided in future periods are reported as                       
unearned revenue and recognized in income over the life of the                  
policies, using the same assumptions and factors as are used to                 
amortize deferred acquisition costs.  These charges consist of                  
policy fees and premium loads that are larger in the initial                    
policy years than they are in the later policy years.                           

Group Products                                                                  

Group products consist primarily of group life insurance, and                   
group long and short term disability income products.  Premiums                 
for group insurance products are recognized as revenue when due.                

The liabilities for future policy benefits and expenses for group               
life and disability income products are computed using statutory                
methods and assumptions, which approximate net level premium                    
reserves using assumptions for investment yields, mortality, and                
withdrawals based principally on company experience projected at                
the time of policy issue, with provisions for possible adverse                  
deviations.  Interest assumptions are based on assumed investment               
yields that range from 2.00% to 6.00% for the years ended 1996                  
and 1995.                                                                       

The costs of acquiring new group life and disability income                     
business, principally commissions, certain policy issue and                     
underwriting expenses (such as medical examination and inspection               
report fees) and certain agency expenses, all of which vary with                
and are primarily related to the production of new and renewal                  
business, are deferred to the extent that such costs are deemed                 
recoverable through future gross premiums.  Such deferred                       
acquisition costs are amortized over the anticipated premium                    
paying period of the related policies, generally not to exceed                  
ten years.                                                                      

Pension Products                                                                

Pension products include deferred annuities, guaranteed                         
investment contracts and payout annuities.  Revenues for the                    
deferred annuity products and guaranteed investment contracts                   
consist of investment income on policy funds, asset charges,                    
contract administration fees, and surrender charges that have                   
been assessed against policyholder account balances.  Expenses                  
for deferred annuity and guaranteed investment contracts products               
include the interest credited on policy funds and expenses                      
incurred in the administration and maintenance of the contracts.                
For payout annuities, premiums are recognized as revenue when due               
and expenses exclude the interest credited on policy funds.                     

Benefit reserves for the deferred annuity contracts and                         
guaranteed investment contracts represent the policy account                    
balances before applicable surrender charges.  Interest                         
assumptions on payout annuities are based on assumed investment                 
yields that ranged from 2.00% to 6.00% for the years ended 1996                 
and 1995.                                                                       

Commissions and other related costs of acquiring annuity                        
contracts that vary with and are primarily related to the                       
production of new and renewal business are deferred to the extent               
that such costs are deemed recoverable through future estimated                 
gross profits.  Acquisition costs are amortized over the life of                
the contracts in direct proportion to the present value of                      
expected gross profits from surrender charges and investment and                
expense margins.  The amortization is adjusted retrospectively                  
when estimates of current or future gross profits (including the                
impact of investment gains or losses) to be realized on a group                 
of contracts are revised.                                                       

Reinsurance                                                                     

Reinsurance premiums and claims are accounted for on bases                      
consistent with those used in accounting for the original                       
policies issued and the terms of the reinsurance contracts.                     
Premiums and benefits are reported net of reinsured amounts.                    

Allocation of Manhattan Life's Income and Equity                                

Manhattan Life's charter provides for the allocation of its                     
profits between its shareholders and its policyholders on a one-                
eighth/seven-eighths basis.  The profits allocated are equal to                 
income after taxes and interest on the Guaranteed Capital Reserve               
((GCR) see Note 5 for further discussion) but before policyholder               
dividends.  Manhattan Life's policyholders' and minority                        
shareholders' share of profits/losses are included in minority                  
interest in subsidiary's (income) loss in the Statements of                     
Income.  Manhattan Life's policyholders' and minority                           
shareholders' equity is included in minority interest in                        
subsidiary's equity in the Balance Sheets, and includes                         
policyholders' and minority shareholders' share of Manhattan                    
Life's change in unrealized gains or (losses) on available for                  
sale securities.  (See Note 5 for more in-depth discussion of                   
Manhattan Life's corporate charter.)                                            

Federal Income Taxes                                                            

The Company accounts for income taxes using the liability method                
for financial accounting and reporting of income taxes.  Under                  
this method, deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax                   
consequences of "temporary differences" by applying the                         
applicable tax rate to differences between the financial                        
statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets                 
and liabilities.

the Company in estimating the fair values of fixed maturity

At December 31, 1996 and 1995, the Company held unrated or less-                
than-investment grade (investment grade is defined as "Baa3" and                
higher on Moody's ratings and "BBB-" and higher on Standard and                 
Poor's bond ratings) corporate bonds of $177,364,000 and                        
$127,215,000.  Those holdings amounted to 6.5% and 4.5%,                        
respectively, of the Company's investments in bonds and 3.3% and

The provision for mortgage losses has fluctuated between periods.               
The Company establishes the mortgage reserve based upon its                     
continuing review of the mortgage portfolio and individual                      
problem mortgages.  The allowance for potential loan losses is                  
affected to a significant degree by general economic conditions.                
While the Company believes it has provided adequate mortgage                    
reserves, subsequent economic and market conditions may require                 
establishing additional reserves.                                               

The Company's mortgage portfolio is monitored closely through the               
review of loan and property information such as debt service                    
coverage, annual operating statements and property inspection                   
reports.  This information is evaluated in light of current                     
economic conditions and other factors such as geographic and                    
property-type loan concentrations.  This evaluation is part of                  
the regular review to determine whether adjustments to the                      
allowance for potential loan losses are warranted. Management                   
believes the mortgage loss reserve is sufficient to provide for                 
potential loan losses.  However, management cannot predict with                 
assurance where the economy is headed or how the mortgage and                   
real estate portfolios would be affected by various economic                    
circumstances.                                                                  

A summary of the characteristics of the Company's mortgage                      
portfolio (before deducting valuation reserves of $2,224,000 and

Real estate consists of investment real estate under lease and                  
foreclosed real estate.  The investment real estate under lease                 
is depreciated over 40 years.  The cost of the property totalled                
$17,383,000 at December 31, 1996 and 1995, and accumulated                      
depreciation totalled $4,212,000 and $3,839,000 at December 31,
1996 and 1995, respectively.  The net book value of foreclosed                  
real estate was $45,430,000 and $47,652,000 at December 31, 1996

NOTE 3 - REINSURANCE                                                            

In the ordinary course of business, the Company assumes and cedes               
reinsurance with other insurers and reinsurers.  These                          
arrangements provide greater diversification of business and                    
limit the maximum net loss potential on large or hazardous risks.               
Reinsurance ceded contracts do not relieve the Company from its                 
obligations to policyholders.  Reinsurance ceded is recorded as                 
an asset and is recorded in "Other assets" in the Balance Sheets.               
The Company remains liable to its policyholders for the portion                 
reinsured to the extent that any reinsurer does not meet its                    
obligations for reinsurance ceded to it under the reinsurance                   
agreements.  Failure of reinsurers to honor their obligations                   
could result in losses to the Company; consequently, allowances                 
will be established for amounts deemed or estimated to be                       
uncollectible.  To minimize its exposure to significant losses                  
from reinsurance insolvencies, the Company evaluates the                        
financial condition of its reinsurers and monitors concentrations               
of credit risk arising from similar geographic regions,                         
activities, or economic characteristics of the reinsurers.  No                  
losses are anticipated, and, based on management's evaluation,                  
there are no concentrations of credit risk at December 31, 1996                 
and 1995.  The Company retains the risk for varying amounts of                  
individual or group insurance written up to a maximum of                        
$1,000,000 on any one life or $4,000 per month disability risk                  
and reinsures the balance.                                                      

Reinsurance transactions with other insurance companies for the                 
years ended December 31, 1996 and 1995 are summarized as follows:

Benefits paid or provided were reduced by $18,747,000 and                       
$27,155,000 at December 31, 1996 and 1995, respectively, for                    
estimated recoveries under reinsurance treaties.                                

Union Central had ceded 22.5% of a block of ordinary life                       
insurance under a coinsurance/modified coinsurance agreement in                 
1988.  The amount of life insurance in-force ceded under the                    
agreement was $160,127,000 at December 31, 1995.  This                          
reinsurance agreement was terminated January 1, 1996.  There was                
no effect on net income in 1996.                                                

The Company, nor any of its related parties control, either                     
directly or indirectly, any reinsurers in which the Company                     
conducts business.  No policies issued by the Company have been                 
reinsured with a foreign company which is controlled, either                    
directly or indirectly, by a party not primarily engaged in the                 
business of insurance.                                                          

The Company has not entered into any reinsurance agreements in                  
which the reinsurer may unilaterally cancel any reinsurance for                 
reasons other than nonpayment of premiums or other similar                      
credits.

Federal income tax expense is calculated based on applying the                  
statutory corporate tax rate to taxable income, and adjusting                   
this amount for permanent differences between deductions allowed                
for financial statement purposes versus federal income tax                      
purposes.  Significant differences would include the surplus tax                
adjustment applicable to Union Central and the small company                    
deduction for life insurance companies that was available to                    
Manhattan Life prior to completing the reverse stock split                      
transaction described in Note 14.                                               

Prior to 1984, a portion of Manhattan Life's income was not                     
subject to income tax, but was accumulated for income tax                       
purposes in a special memorandum tax account designated                         
"policyholders' surplus account" (PSA).  Under provisions of the                
Tax Reform Act of 1984, the PSA was frozen at its December 31,                  
1983 balance.  The PSA will become subject to tax at current                    
rates if these amounts are distributed or if the balance of the                 
account exceeds certain limitations under the Internal Revenue                  
Code.  The balance in the PSA at December 31, 1996 was $1,348,000               
and the maximum tax at current rates would be $472,000.                         

NOTE 5 - SHAREHOLDER DIVIDENDS AND RESTRICTION ON TRANSFER OF                   
FUNDS FROM SUBSIDIARY                                                           

As stated in Note 1, Manhattan Life's charter provides for the                  
allocation of its profits between its shareholders and its                      
policyholders on a one-eight/seven-eighths basis.  The profits                  
allocated are equal to income after taxes and interest on the                   
Guaranteed Capital Reserve (GCR) but before policyholder                        
dividends.                                                                      

In administering Manhattan Life's charter's profit-sharing                      
provision, Manhattan Life and the New York Insurance Department                 
(the Department) have deemed the shareholders' portion of                       
Manhattan Life's profits to be equal to $1 for every $7 of                      
policyholder dividends paid on traditional, participating                       
contracts.  Manhattan Life's charter provides for three types of                
shareholder distributions, including distribution based on                      
profits:                                                                        

a)   Interest at a specified rate on the par value of the                 
guarantee capital shares issued and outstanding                 

($195,000 annually), which may be paid in any year              
dividends are distributed to policyholders and is               
not subject to prior regulatory approval,                       
b)   A distribution of the shareholders' portion of Manhattan             
Life's profits.  Such amounts may, at the discretion of         
the Company's Board of Directors, be distributed as a           
stock dividend of additional guarantee capital shares,          
paid in cash subject to certain limits and prior                
regulatory approval, or reserved for the benefit of the         
shareholders in the GCR, and                                    
c)   Interest, at the Company's portfolio earnings rate on                
invested assets, on the accumulated balance in the GCR.         

Manhattan Life's cash distributions to shareholders are subject                 
to prior approval by the Department.  Further, Manhattan Life and               
the Department have agreed to the following guidelines under                    
which shareholder distributions from the GCR would be permitted,                
subject to prior approval by the Department:                                    

If Manhattan Life's statutory-basis surplus is less than or               
equal to 9% of its statutory policy reserves, then principal              
and interest distributions are limited to the lesser of the               
prior year statutory gain from operations (after                          
policyholders' dividends and federal income taxes and before              
realized gains and losses), or the prior year's increase in               
statutory surplus or,                                                     

If its statutory-basis surplus exceeds 9% of statutory policy             
reserves, the principal and interest distributions are limited            
to the greater of the prior year statutory gain from                      
operations (after policyholders' dividends and federal income             
taxes and before realized gains and losses), or the prior year            
increase in statutory surplus.                                            

The foregoing limits are subject to adjustment, by the                          
Department, for unusually large realized gains or the effects of                
surplus relief reinsurance transactions.  Since Union Central                   
plans to eliminate minority interests in the Manhattan Life's                   
guarantee capital shares by using a reverse stock split to reduce               
all outstanding minority shares to fractional shares payable in                 
cash, Manhattan Life made no cash dividend payments to its                      
shareholders from principal or interest accumulated in the GCR                  
for the year ended December 31, 1996.  See Note 14 of Notes to                  
the Consolidated Financial Statements for detailed discussion                   
about the reverse stock split.  Based on the formula described                  
above, no shareholder dividends were made for the year ended                    
December 31, 1995, as Manhattan Life recorded both a statutory                  
loss before net realized gains and losses and a decrease in                     
statutory surplus.                                                              

The GCR represents a restricted segment of statutory unassigned                 
surplus, and as such, does not represent a commitment or                        
liability to pay shareholder dividends.  For financial statements               
prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting                       
principles, the GCR is included in shareholders' equity.  The                   
balance in the GCR of $16,127,000 and $14,910,000 and the

Manhattan Life is the only existing life insurance company                      
domiciled in New York which has authorized and outstanding                      
guarantee capital shares.  Neither applicable New York state law                
nor Manhattan Life's charter contain express provisions                         
establishing the extent of the interest of the holders of the                   
guarantee capital shares in the statutory unassigned surplus                    
(total surplus less guarantee capital shares and GCR) of                        
Manhattan Life and there has never been a judicial determination                
of the extent of such interest.  Further, the laws applicable to                
Manhattan Life do not provide for its voluntary liquidation or                  
dissolution; the Company may only be liquidated under the                       
supervision of the New York Superintendent of Insurance in the                  
event of insolvency.  In such a liquidation or dissolution, the                 
entire assets of Manhattan Life would be used to satisfy claims                 
of creditors and policyholders and there would be no statutory                  
unassigned surplus for distribution to the holders of the                       
guarantee capital shares.  Accordingly, in the opinion of counsel               
to Manhattan Life, no unqualified legal opinion can be rendered                 
as to the degree, if any, to which the holders of the guarantee                 
capital shares would be entitled to participate in any current or               
liquidating distribution of unassigned surplus.  However, in the                
view of such counsel, if there should occur a liquidation or                    
other winding-up of Manhattan Life's business in which assets                   
exceeded liabilities on policies and the claims of other                        
creditors, or if there should occur a partial distribution of                   
surplus in the absence of such a liquidation or winding-up,                     
although there are reasonable arguments which could be made to                  
the effect that the entire unassigned surplus would be                          
distributable solely to the policyholders or solely to the                      
shareholders, the more likely outcome if the question should be                 
litigated is that it would be held that one-eighth of the                       
unassigned surplus would be distributable to the shareholders and               
seven-eighths to the policyholders.                                             

NOTE 6 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES                                 

Leases                                                                          

The leases for office space for Manhattan Life and various field                
agency offices vary in duration from 1 to 15 years.  Some of                    
these leases include escalation clauses which vary with levels of               
operating expense.  Rental expense under these operating leases                 
totalled $3,907,000 and $3,413,000 in 1996 and 1995,                            
respectively.  The Company also leases furniture and equipment                  
under operating leases which expire in 2001.  Rental expense                    
under these leases totalled $182,000 and $206,000 in 1996 and                   
1995, respectively.                                                             

At December 31, 1996, the future minimum lease payments for all                 
noncancelable operating leases are as follows:

The Company also has capital leases for office furniture.                       
Lease expense under these leases was $466,000 and $493,000                      
in 1996 and 1995, respectively.

At December 31, 1996, the Company has outstanding agreements to                 
fund 41 mortgages totalling $37,280,000 in early 1997.  In                      
addition, the Company has committed to invest $20,800,000 in                    
limited partnerships during the years 1997 to 2000.  These                      
transactions are in the normal course of business for the                       
Company.                                                                        

Litigation                                                                      

In the normal course of business, the Company is party to various               
claims and litigation primarily arising from claims made under                  
insurance policies and contracts.  Those actions are considered                 
by the Company in estimating the policy and contract liabilities.               
The Company's management believes that the resolution of those                  
actions will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's                
financial position or results of operations.                                    

Guaranty Fund Assessments                                                       

The economy and other factors have caused an increase in the                    
number of insurance companies that are under regulatory                         
supervision.  This circumstance is expected to result in an                     
increase in assessments by state guaranty funds, or voluntary                   
payments by solvent insurance companies, to fund policyholder                   
losses or liabilities of insurance companies that become                        
insolvent.  These assessments may be deferred or forgiven under                 
most guaranty laws if they would threaten an insurers financial                 
strength and, in certain instances, may be offset against future                
premium taxes.  There were no charges to income in 1996 or 1995.                
The estimated liability of $1,399,000 at December 31, 1996 was                  
based on data provided by the National Organization of Life and                 
Health Insurance Guaranty Associations and is included in "Other                
liabilities" on the Balance Sheets.

The National Association of Insurance Commissioners is currently                
in the process of recodifying statutory accounting practices, the               
result of which is expected to constitute the only source of                    
"prescribed" statutory accounting practices.  The project,                      
expected to be completed in 1999 will likely change certain                     
prescribed accounting practices, and may result in changes to the               
accounting practices the Company uses to prepare its statutory                  
financial statements.                                                           

NOTE 8 - EMPLOYEE BENEFITS                                                      
The Company has pension plans covering substantially all of its                 
employees (The Plans).  Benefits are based on years of service                  
and the employee's highest five consecutive years of compensation               
out of the last ten years.  The contributions totalled $2,750,000               
and $2,393,000 in 1996 and 1995, respectively.  The Company's                   
funding policy is to contribute an amount between the minimum                   
required to meet ERISA funding standards and the maximum amount                 
that can be deducted for federal income tax purposes.                           

Pension expense includes the following components:

The unfunded accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) will vary from year to        
year as changes in the market value of the plans' assets differs from           
changes in the ABO.  The ABO varies from year to year as the rate used          
to discount future pension benefits related to the past service of plan         
participants changes.  The discount rate at each valuation date reflects        
available rates on high quality fixed income investments.  The                  
investment strategy for the plans' assets is designed to achieve                
somewhat higher yields over the long term than would be achieved by             
investing entirely in high quality fixed income investments.  Therefore,        
the market value of the plans' assets and the ABO do not change in the          
same amount from year to year.  The Company believes that its current           
funding policy will be adequate to meet all                                     
future plan obligations over the long term.

The plan assets are invested in Carillon Capital Fund, an affiliated            
mutual fund.                                                                    

The health care cost trend rate assumption has an insignificant effect          
on the amounts reported.  To illustrate, increasing the assumed health          
care cost trend rates by one percentage point in each year would                
increase the postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 1996          
by $124,000 and the interest cost and estimated eligibility cost                
components of the net periodic postretirement benefit cost by $6,000            
and less than $1,000, respectively.                                             

The weighted-average discount rate used in determining the accumulated          
postretirement benefit obligation was 7.25% and 7.50% at December 31,
1996 and 1995, respectively.                                                    

NOTE 10 - FAIR VALUES OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS                                  

The following methods and assumptions were used by the Company in               
estimating its fair value disclosures for financial instruments:                

Cash and short-term investments:  The carrying amounts reported           
in the balance sheets for these instruments approximate their fair        
values.                                                                   

Investment securities:  Fair values for bonds and preferred stock         
are based on quoted market prices, where available. If quoted             
market prices are not available, fair values are estimated using          
values obtained from independent securities broker dealers or             
quoted market prices of comparable instruments.  The fair values          
of common stock in Company sponsored mutual funds are based on            
quoted market prices and are recognized in "Equity securities"            
on the Balance Sheets.                                                    

Mortgage loans:  The fair values for commercial and residential           
mortgages in good standing are estimated using discounted cash            
flow analysis using interest rates currently being offered for            
similar loans to borrowers with similar credit ratings in                 
comparison with actual interest rates and maturity dates.                 
Fair values for mortgages with potential loan losses are based            
on discounted cash flow analysis of the underlying properties.            

Policy loans:  Management is unable to ascertain the estimated            
life of the policy loan portfolio.  Due to the excessive costs            
which would be incurred to determine this information,                    
management considers the estimation of its fair value to be               
impracticable.  The nature of a policy loan insures that the              
outstanding loan balance will be fully recoverable because the            
balance owed to the Company is always equal to or lower than              
the cash value of the insurance policy owed to the policyholder.          
Policy loans are stated at their aggregate unpaid balance in the          
balance sheets.                                                           

Investment contracts:  Fair values for the Company's liabilities          
under investment-type insurance contracts are estimated using             
discounted cash flow calculations, based on interest rates                
currently being offered for similar contracts with maturities             
consistent with those remaining for the contracts being valued.           

The carrying amounts and fair values of the Company's mortgage loans            
and liabilities for instrument type contracts are summarized as                 
follows:

The Company's other insurance contracts are excluded from Statement of          
Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS-107), "Disclosures about Fair Value

values of liabilities under all insurance contracts are taken into              
consideration in the Company's overall management of interest rate              
risk, which minimizes exposure to changing interest rates through the           
matching of investment maturities with amounts due under insurance              
contracts.  Additional data with respect to the carrying value and fair

As a result of changes in estimates of insured events in prior years,           
the provision of claims and claim adjustment expenses, increased by             
$7,237,000 and $5,989,000 in 1996 and 1995 due to lower than expected           
rates of claim terminations.  Included in the above balances are                
reinsurance recoverables of $1,287,000 and $2,713,000 at 1996 and               
1995, respectively.

On November 1, 1996, Union Central issued $50,000,000 of 8.20% Surplus          
Notes (Notes).  These Notes mature on November 1, 2026 and may not be           
redeemed prior to maturity.  The Notes are unsecured and subordinated           
to all present and future policy claims, prior claims and senior                
indebtedness.  Subject to prior written approval of the Superintendent          
of the Ohio Insurance Department, these Notes will pay interest semi-           
annually on May 1 and November 1.  Interest expense of $637,000 was             
accrued as of December 31, 1996, and is recorded in "Other                      
liabilities" in the Balance Sheets.  In connection with issuing the             
Notes, Union Central incurred and capitalized $765,000 of issuance              
cost.  This cost is recorded in "Other assets" in the Balance Sheets,           
and will be amortized to expense over the life of the Notes.                    

NOTE 14 - SUBSEQUENT EVENTS                                                     

At December 31, 1996 and 1995, Union Central owned approximately 73%            
of Manhattan Life's guarantee capital shares.  On January 28, 1997,             
the guarantee capital shareholders constituting at least two-thirds of          
the outstanding guarantee capital shares of Manhattan Life (including           
the shares owned by Union Central) approved Union Central's plan to             
eliminate the minority interests in Manhattan Life's guarantee capital          
shares by effecting a reverse stock split (the "Plan") that had                 
previously been approved by the New York Insurance Department.  Under           
the Plan, each holder of guarantee capital shares received a cash               
payment in lieu of the issuance of any resulting fractional guarantee           
capital shares, with the Company becoming sole remaining holder of              
Manhattan Life's guarantee capital shares.  The cost of redeeming the           
fractional shares, approximately $6,800,000, was funded by Manhattan            
Life; however, as part of the Plan, Union Central made a cash                   
contribution of approximately $1,800,000 to Manhattan Life's guarantee          
capital share account.

UNDERTAKING TO FILE REPORTS                           

Subject to the terms and conditions of Section 15(d) of the Securities          
Exchange Act of 1934, the undersigned Registrant hereby undertakes to           
file with the Securities and Exchange Commission such supplementary             
and periodic information, documents, and reports as may be prescribed           
by any rule or regulation of the Commission heretofore or hereafter             
duly adopted pursuant to authority conferred in that section.                   

RULE 484 UNDERTAKING                        

Reference is made to the Amended Articles of Incorporation and Code of          
Regulations of The Union Central Life Insurance Company (the "Code of           
Regulations"), filed as an exhibit to this Registration Statement.              
Specifically, Article VII of the Code of Regulations provides that              
Depositor shall, to the full extent permitted by the General                    
Corporation Law of Ohio, indemnify any person who is or was a director          
or officer of the Depositor and whom it may indemnify pursuant                  
thereto.  The Depositor may, within the sole discretion of its Board            
of Directors, indemnify in whole or in part any other person whom it            
may indemnify pursuant thereto.                                                 

Section 1701.13 of the Ohio General Corporation Law provides as                 
follows:                                                                        

(E)(1)  A corporation may indemnify or agree to indemnify any     
person who was or is a party, or is threatened to be made a party, to           
any threatened, pending, or completed action, suit, or proceeding,              
whether civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative, other than           
an action by or in the right of the corporation, by reason of the fact          
that he is or was a director, officer, employee, or agent of the                
corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as          
a director, trustee, officer, employee, member, manager, or agent of            
another corporation, domestic or foreign, nonprofit or for profit, a            
limited liability company, or a partnership, joint venture, trust, or           
other enterprise, against expenses, including attorney's fees,                  
judgments, fines, and amounts paid in settlement actually and                   
reasonably incurred by him in connection with such action, suit, or             
proceeding, if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably             
believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the                   
corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding,            
if he had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful.              
The termination of any action, suit, or proceeding by judgment, order,          
settlement, or conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its             
equivalent, shall not, of it self, create a presumption that the                
person did not act in good faith and in a manner he reasonably                  
believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the                   
corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding,            
he had reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful.               

(2)  A corporation may indemnify or agree to indemnify any          
person who was or is a party, or is threatened to made a party, to any          
threatened, pending, or completed action or suit by or in the right of          
the corporation to procure a judgement in its favor, by reason of the           
fact that he is or was a director, officer, employee, or agent of the           
corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as          
a director, trustee, officer, employee, member, manager, or agent of            
another corporation, domestic or foreign, nonprofit or for profit, a            
limited liability company, or a partnership, joint venture, trust, or           
other enterprise, against expenses, including attorney's fees,                  
actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with the defense          
or settlement of such action or suit, if he acted in good faith and in          
a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best             
interests of the corporation, except that no indemnification shall be           
made in respect of any of the following:                                        

(a)  Any claim, issue, or matter as to which such person is 
adjudged to be liable for negligence or misconduct in the performance           
of his duty to the corporation unless, and only to the extent that,             
the court of common pleas or the court in which such action or suit             
was brought determines, upon application, that, despite the                     
adjudication of liability, but in view of all the circumstances of the          
case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for            
such expenses as the court of common pleas or such other court shall            
deem proper;                                                                    

(b)  Any action or suit in which the only liability asserted
against a director is pursuant to section 1701.95 of the Revised Code.          

(3)  To the extent that a director, trustee, officer, employee,         
member, manager, or agent has been successful on the merits or                  
otherwise in defense of any action, suit, or proceeding referred to in          
division (E)(1) or (2) of this section, or in defense of any claim,             
issue, or matter therein, he shall be indemnified against expenses,             
including attorney's fees, actually and reasonably incurred by him in           
connection with the action, suit, or proceeding.                                

(4)  Any indemnification under division (E)(1) or (2) of this           
section, unless ordered by a court, shall be made by the corporation            
only as authorized in the specific case, upon a determination that              
indemnification of the director, trustee, officer, employee, member,            
manager, or agent is proper in the circumstances because he has met             
the applicable standard of conduct set forth in division (E)(1) or (2)          
of this section.  Such determination shall be made as follows:                  

(a)  By a majority vote of a quorum consisting of directors 
of the indemnifying corporation who were not and are not parties to or          
threatened with the action, suit, or proceeding referred to in                  
division (E)(1) or (2) of this section;                                         

(b)  If the quorum described in division (E)(4)(a) of this  
section is not obtainable or if a majority vote of a quorum of                  
disinterested directors so directs, in a written opinion by                     
independent legal counsel other than an attorney, or a firm having              
associated with it an attorney, who has been retained by or who has             
performed services for the corporation or any person to be indemnified          
within the past five years;                                                     

(c)  By the shareholders;                                   

(d)  By the court of common pleas or the court in which the 
action, suit, or proceeding referred to in division (E)(1) or (2) of            
this section was brought.                                                       

   Any determination made by the disinterested directors
under division (E)(4)(a) or by independent legal counsel under                  
division (E)(4)(b) of this section shall be promptly communicated to            
the person who threatened or brought the action or suit by or in the            
right of the corporation under division (E)(2) of this section, and,            
within ten days after receipt of such notification, such person shall           
have the right to petition the court of common pleas or the court in            
which such action or suit was brought to review the reasonableness of           
such determination.                                                             

(5)   (a)  Unless at the time of a director's act or omission that      
is the subject of an action, suit, or proceeding referred to in                 
division (E)(1) or (2) of this section, the articles or the                     
regulations of a corporation state, by specific reference to this               
division, that the provisions of this division do not apply to the              
corporation and unless the only liability asserted against a director           
in an action, suit, or proceeding referred to in division (E)(1) or             
(2) of this section is pursuant to section 1701.95 of the Revised               
Code, expenses, including attorney's fees, incurred by a director in            
defending the action, suit, or proceeding shall be paid by the                  
corporation as they are incurred, in advance of the final disposition           
of the action, suit, or proceeding, upon receipt of an undertaking by           
or on behalf of the director in which he agrees to do both of the               
following:                                                                      

(i)  Repay such amount if it is proved by clear and         
convincing evidence in a court of competent jurisdiction that his               
action or failure to act involved an act or omission undertaken with            
deliberate intent to cause injury to the corporation or undertaken              
with reckless disregard for the best interests of the corporation;              

(ii)  Reasonably cooperate with the corporation concerning  
the action, suit, or proceeding.                                                

(b)  Expenses, including attorney's fees, incurred by a     
director, trustee, officer, employee, member, manager, or agent in              
defending any action, suit, or proceeding referred to in division               
(E)(1) or (2) of this section, may be paid by the corporation as they           
are incurred, in advance of the final disposition of the action, suit,          
or proceeding, as authorized by the directors in the specific case,             
upon the receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the director,             
trustee, officer, employee, member, manager, or agent to repay such             
amount, if it ultimately is determined that he is not entitled to be            
indemnified by the corporation.                                                 

(6)  The indemnification authorized by this section shall not be        
exclusive of, and shall be in addition to, any other rights granted to          
those seeking indemnification under the articles, the regulations, any          
agreement, a vote of shareholders or disinterested directors, or                
otherwise, both as to action in their official capacities and as to             
action in another capacity while holding their offices or positions,            
and shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director,              
trustee, officer, employee, member, manager or agent and shall inure            
to the benefit of the heirs, executors, and administrators of such a            
person.                                                                         

(7)  A corporation may purchase and maintain insurance or furnish     
similar protection, including, but not limited to, trust funds,                 
letters of credit, or self-insurance, on behalf of or for any person            
who is or was a director, officer, employee, or agent of the                    
corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as          
a director, trustee, employee, member, manager, or agent of another             
corporation, domestic or foreign, nonprofit or for profit, a limited            
liability company, or a partnership, joint venture, trust, or other             
enterprise, against any liability asserted against him and incurred by          
him in any such capacity, or arising out of his status as such,                 
whether or not the corporation would have the power to indemnify him            
against such liability under this section.  Insurance may be purchased          
from or maintained with a person in which the corporation has                   
financial interest.                                                             

(8)  The authority of a corporation to indemnify persons pursuant     
to division (E)(1) or (2) of this section does not limit the payment            
of expenses as they are incurred, indemnification, insurance, or other          
protection that may be provided pursuant to divisions (E)(5), (6), and          
(7) of this section.  Divisions (E)(1) and (2) of this section do not           
create any obligation to repay or return payments made by the                   
corporation pursuant to division (E)(5), (6), or (7).                           

(9)  As used in division (E) of this section, "corporation"           
includes all constituent entities in a consolidation or merger and the          
new or surviving corporation, so that any person who is or was a                
director, officer, employee, trustee, member, manager, or agent of              
such a constituent entity, or is or was serving at the request of such          
constituent entity as a director, trustee, officer, employee, member,           
manager, or agent of another corporation, domestic or foreign,                  
nonprofit or for profit, a limited liability company, or a                      
partnership, joint venture, trust, or other enterprise, shall stand in          
the same position under this section with respect to the new or                 
surviving corporation as he would if he had served the new or                   
surviving corporation in the same capacity.                                     

Insofar as indemnification for liability arising under the Securities           
Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling             
persons of the Registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or              
otherwise, the Registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the           
Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification may be against          
public policy as expressed in the Act and may be, therefore,                    
unenforceable.  In the event that a claim for indemnification against           
such liabilities (other than payment by the Registrant of expenses              
incurred or paid by a director, officer, or controlling person of the           
Registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or                     
proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling                
person in connection with the securities being registered, the                  
Registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has            
been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of                     
appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by           
it is against public policy as expressed in the Act and will be                 
governed by the final adjudication of such issue.

What is variable life insurance?
The insurance industry has introduced different types of insurance to meet consumer needs. For example, universal life insurance was created to provide a solution for many of the perceived shortcomings of whole life insurance and term life insurance. (See “What Is Universal Life Insurance?”)
When consumers demanded even more changes from the life insurance industry, it responded with variable life insurance and the concept of investment control. Whereas whole life insurance provides fixed rates of return on the account value, at rates determined by the insurance company, variable life insurance provides the policyholder with investment discretion over the account value portion of the policy.
If you own a variable life policy, you may allocate your account value among a variety of investment subaccounts. The premiums you pay are fixed throughout the life of the contract, while the performance of your chosen subaccounts determines the growth of your account value, and can also determine the value of your death benefit.
There are usually several subaccount options to choose from, including stock, bond, and fixed-interest options. You can allocate your account value as you see fit, and you can be as conservative or aggressive as you wish.
A possible disadvantage is that the premiums of a variable life insurance policy generally are fixed and cannot be adjusted if your financial situation changes. A variable life policy does provide you with a guaranteed death benefit. If your subaccounts perform poorly, the death benefit could decline, but never below a defined level specified in the policy. Of course, any guarantees are contingent on the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company.
Withdrawals may be subject to surrender charges and are taxable if you withdraw more than your basis in the policy. Policy loans or withdrawals will reduce the policy's cash value and death benefit, and may require additional premium payments to keep the policy in force.
In sum, variable life offers the flexibility to design your own portfolio, together with the security of a guaranteed death benefit. As long as you pay your fixed premiums, your death benefit cannot go away. This is not the case with universal life insurance or variable universal life insurance.
The cost and availability of life insurance depend on factors such as age, health, and the type and amount of insurance purchased. As with most financial decisions, there are expenses associated with the purchase of life insurance. Generally, policies have contract limitations, fees, and charges, which can include mortality and expense charges, account fees, underlying investment management fees, administrative fees, and charges for optional benefits. In addition, if a policy is surrendered prematurely, there may be surrender charges and income tax implications. There may also be additional fees on changes associated with a variable universal life policy that are not associated with other investment products. Variable life policies are not guaranteed by the FDIC or any other government agency; they are not deposits of, nor are they guaranteed or endorsed by, any bank or savings association. The investment return and principal value of an investment option are not guaranteed. Because variable life subaccounts fluctuate with changes in market conditions, the principal may be worth more or less than the original amount invested when the annuity is surrendered.
Depending on your situation, variable life is an option to consider. If you are considering purchasing life insurance, consult a professional to explore your options.
Variable life insurance is sold by prospectus. Please consider the investment objectives, risks, charges, expenses, and your need for death-benefit coverage carefully before investing. The prospectus, which contains this and other information about the variable life policy and the underlying investment options, can be obtained from your financial professional. Be sure to read the prospectus carefully before deciding whether to invest.

	The Board of Directors of Calvert Variable Products, Inc. ("CVP")
	has approved a resolution to reorganize the Calvert VP Inflation Protected Plus Portfolio into the Calvert VP Investment Grade
	Bond Index Portfolio (the "Reorganization"). Each Portfolio is a series of Calvert Variable Products, Inc.


	 


	The CVP Board has recommended approval of the Reorganization
	by shareholders of the Calvert VP Inflation Protected Plus Portfolio. If the Reorganization is approved by the shareholders of
	the Calvert VP Inflation Protected Plus Portfolio, it will be merged into the Calvert VP Investment Grade Bond Index Portfolio
	on or about November 14, 2014. If your variable annuity Contract or variable life insurance Policy remains allocated to the Subaccount
	corresponding to the Calvert VP Inflation Protected Plus Portfolio at the time the Reorganization is consummated, those units will
	be replaced by units corresponding to the Calvert VP Investment Grade Bond Index Portfolio, and thereafter the value of your Contract
	or Policy will depend on the performance of the Calvert VP Investment Grade Bond Index Portfolio rather than the Calvert VP Inflation
	Protected Plus Portfolio. The number of Calvert VP Investment Grade Bond Index Portfolio units you receive will depend on the value
	of your Calvert VP Inflation Protected Plus Portfolio units at the time the Reorganization takes place.


	 


	If the Reorganization is approved, your prospectus is revised
	by deleting all mention of the Calvert VP Inflation Protected Plus Portfolio at the time of the Reorganization.


	 


	All other provisions remain as stated in your
	Contract or Policy and prospectus, as supplemented.


	 



	Please retain this Supplement with the
	current prospectus for your variable Contract or Policy with




	Ameritas Life Insurance Corp.

1. What is Carillon LifeCare™ Community?
Located in Lubbock, Texas, Carillon is a vibrant LifeCare™ community specifically designed for active, independent-minded retirees, age 55 and older. You’ll find warm, welcoming neighbors and an abundance of amenities catered to making life easier and more enjoyable. And should health needs change, we offer all levels of care from short-term rehabilitation to long-term care. We are passionate about West Texas hospitality, the Texas Tech Red Raiders, good friends and food, and providing the most comprehensive retirement choice to the Lubbock community for the past 40 years.
2. What is LifeCare™ and how can it benefit me?
Today, LifeCare™ is among the most popular options in retirement living. Residents pay an entrance fee, and are then guaranteed access to assisted living and 24-hour nursing care with virtually no increase in their  monthly expenses. LifeCare™ significantly reduces worry about the affordability or availability of long-term care services in the future.
LifeCare™ at Carillon gives you an all-in-one package of flexible services and amenities at a predictable cost. Plus, with LifeCare™, you have the security of knowing you’ll never need to move to another community, because you have everything you’ll ever need in one place! Carillon not only offers a full continuum of health care, it is the only true LifeCare™ community in Lubbock and the surrounding area.
3. How does LifeCare™ compare to my current living situation?
With the cost of skilled nursing care rising to amounts in excess of $6,000 per month, and the uncertainty surrounding government-provided financial assistance, our LifeCare™ program offers peace of mind for residents and their families that is second to none. Instead of worrying about the future, LifeCare™ lets you embrace it. Carillon residents have a clear plan for their future, and clear advantages from LifeCare™ with:
• Comfort. All the comforts of independent living and the support of onsite assisted living and rehab and skilled nursing from Carillon House, all in a single community.
• Variety. Multiple floor plans throughout a variety of living choices and financial options make it easy and affordable to make Carillon your home.
• Cost. The cost of living at Carillon includes a one-time entrance fee and a range of monthly fees to meet your specific needs. With a variety of financial options and living choices, you can select a residency agreement that fits you best. Choose a plan for estate preservation and guarantee an entry fee refund of 50%. Or, select a rental option for short-term flexibility.
4. How can I qualify for the LifeCare™ program?
At Carillon, we assess all prospective residents based on the same three requirements: age, medical and financial. Carillon residents (or their respective spouses) must be at least 55 years old to move in. Medically, the LifeCare™ program requires that residents begin in an independent living setting. It’s imperative to explore this option before care or assistance is needed! Financially, we take a conservative approach to ensure Carillon provides a comfortable fit for our residents, and that the community remains fiscally solvent for years to come. This requirement is explored with prospective residents in a confidential setting on a case-by-case basis.
5. What is life like at Carillon?
Active, comforting and fulfilling. Carillon residents enjoy a truly independent lifestyle, complete with a maintenance-free home, 24-hour security, multiple on-site dining options, convenient transportation services and endless amenities. We offer a wide variety of home styles and floor plans so you’re sure to find the perfect living choice to call home. You have easy access to the essentials — from restaurant-inspired dining to banking services and a hair salon. And when you want to venture out you can participate in educational and recreational activities, join a club, attend community events and get-togethers, swim, garden and take fitness classes — all just outside your front door! Because we’re a LifeCare™ community, you even have full and unlimited access to on-site nursing care. For even more insight, view our testimonials.
6. What are independent living, assisted living and full nursing care?
Independent living at Carillon caters to active retirees looking for maintenance-free living and a diverse offering of services and amenities. While there is no direct nursing care, staff members take care of housekeeping, maintenance, transportation, meals and more. Limited nursing care can be provided through the services of a home health agency.
Assisted living at Carillon involves nursing attention with activities of daily living, including dressing, bathing, grooming, ambulating, and toileting. Different communities offer different levels of care at varying cost levels, so it’s important to understand what is included in the price.
Full nursing care at Carillon refers to 24-hour supervision for residents with significant deficiencies in their activities of daily living.
7. What health services are available at Carillon?
It’s comforting to know that Carillon is a LifeCare™ community, specializing in providing all levels of care in one place. The Medicare/-certified health center is open to everyone.
• Assisted Living. We can provide supportive, personalized services beyond the scope of most assisted living communities. In short, if your needs change, you don’t have to move. You can continue to enjoy the comforting and familiar setting of our beautiful community.
• Skilled Nursing Care. From recuperative care after an illness or surgery, to attentive, around-the-clock skilled care, we offer both short- and long-term options that fit your needs.
• Outpatient and Rehab Therapies. We offer a variety of therapies, including physical, occupational, speech and aquatic on-site at Carillon House. Whether you’re recovering from an injury or require a rehabilitating treatment, we can tailor an outpatient program just for you.
• Memory Care. At Carillon, our staff provides highly specialized memory care with patience and compassion. Residents have the flexibility to participate in individual and group activities and explore their personal interests in a safe, nurturing setting.
8. What is the food like at Carillon?
Carillon offers everything a resident needs to lead a scrumptious life, including a wide array of dining options. We prepare award-winning, delicious cuisine at any of our four on-site restaurants, including:
• The Boren Bistro – Aromas from fresh-baked cookies and warm cinnamon rolls welcome you to this wireless Internet “hot spot”. With it’s charming ambiance, you can stroll in 12 hours a day for a specialty coffee, cocktail or light meal at your leisure.
• Hob Nob Diner – A fun loving, 1950’s atmosphere provides a wide range of menu offerings for breakfast or lunch. Top off your meal with a mouth-watering ice-cream sundae or twist your way over to the jukebox for some hoppin’ tunes!
• Skylight Dining Room – Creative temptations stimulate your senses as our chef prepares healthful combinations for breakfast, lunch and dinner. The menu is bursting with variety, flavor and fresh ingredients for a fulfilling dining experience.
• Starlight Restaurant – Embrace the Lubbock skyline and West Texas sunsets as you dine at this restaurant situated high above our Windsong residences. Join us for dinner, or treat yourself to our Sunday brunch specialties.
9. Are pets allowed at Carillon?
Yes! Carillon is a pet-friendly active community, and many of our homes have fenced-in yard areas, patios or balconies to give your furry friend his or her own freedoms. Designated trails allow for safe dog-walking throughout the community, and we provide numerous pet stations for convenient clean-up. We understand and value the bond between owners and their pets, so they are welcomed members of the Carillon family!
10. Does Carillon attach to my house and assets or affect my taxes?
Absolutely not! We understand you’ve planned carefully for retirement your entire life, and what’s yours is yours! In fact, Carillon’s financial requirement and regulation by the Texas Department of Insurance only further ensures that planning doesn’t end at retirement. Furthermore, LifeCare™ residents who meet this requirement are not denied access to health care due to financial limitations by no fault of their own.
There are possible tax advantages. Part of your fees may be deemed pre-paid medical expenses, and you may be able to deduct a percentage from your income tax return. Please consult your tax advisor for more information.
11. When is the best time to plan my transition to Carillon?
You should consider a move to Carillon when you are able to make the decision for yourself and before a health challenge affects your ability to qualify for the LifeCare™ benefit. It is a smart choice to make early in your retirement so you can take full advantage of all the benefits of living here and avoid any challenges that may arise in the process. As we always say, “There’s no better time than now. There’s no better place than here.”
12. What are the benefits of living in a retirement community?
Research shows that residents in retirement communities live longer, more active and fulfilling lives. They have access to nutritional meal options, wellness and fitness classes, life-long learning opportunities and a priceless network of friends. We strive to meet the emotional, physical, spiritual and intellectual needs of each individual resident to ensure Carillon is a place they are proud to call “home”.
13. Who sponsors or manages Carillon LifeCare Community?
Carillon operates as a self-owned, not-for-profit retirement community, governed by a local Board of Directors. They are dedicated to securing a stable future for the community, and they work side-by-side with residents and their families to ensure Carillon is a community you can be proud to call “home”. Carillon is managed by LifeCare™ Services, the nation’s leading developer and manager of senior living communities. LifeCare™ Services is a recognized national leader in senior living services.

WHEREAS, to the extent permitted by applicable insurance

the Portfolios on behalf of each Account to fund certain of the                 
aforesaid Contracts and the Underwriter is authorized to sell                   
such shares to separate accounts such as each Account at net                    
asset value.                                                                    

NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of their mutual promises, the                   
parties agree as follows:                                                       

ARTICLE  1.                 
Purchase and Redemption of Trust Portfolio Shares                 

1.1. For purposes of this Article 1, the Company shall be             
the Trust's agent for receipt of purchase orders and requests for               
redemption relating to each Portfolio from each Account, provided               
that the Company notifies the Trust of such purchase orders and                 
requests for redemption by 10:00 a.m. Eastern time on the next                  
following Business Day, as defined in Section 1.3.                              

1.2. The Trust agrees to make shares of the Portfolios                
available to the Accounts for purchase at the net asset value per               
share next computed after receipt of a purchase order by the                    
Trust (or its agent), as established in accordance with the                     
provisions of the then current prospectus of the Trust describing               
Portfolio purchase procedures on those days on which the Trust                  
calculates its net asset value pursuant to rules of the                         
Commission, and the Trust shall use best efforts to calculate                   
such net asset value on each day on which the New York Stock                    
Exchange is open for trading. The Company will transmit orders                  
from time to time to the Trust for the purchase of shares of the                
Portfolios. The Trustees of the Trust (the "Trustees") may refuse               
to sell shares of any Portfolio to any person, or suspend or                    
terminate the offering of shares of any Portfolio if such action                
is required by law or by regulatory authorities having                          
jurisdiction or if, in the sole discretion of the Trustees acting               
in good faith and in light of their fiduciary duties under                      
federal and any applicable state laws, such action is deemed in                 
the best interests of the shareholders of such Portfolio.                       

1.3 The Company shall submit payment for the purchase of              
shares of a Portfolio on behalf of an Account no later than the                 
close of the Federal Reserve Bank, which is 6:00 p.m. Eastern                   
time, on the next Business Day after the Trust receives the                     
purchase order. If payment in federal funds for any purchase is                 
not received by the Trust or its designated custodian or is                     
received after such time, the Company shall promptly upon the                   
Trust's written request, reimburse the Trust for any charges,                   
costs, fees, interest, or other expenses incurred by the Trust in               
connection with any advances to, or borrowings or overdrafts by,                
the Trust, or any similar expenses incurred by the Trust as a                   
result of transactions effected by the Trust based upon such                    
purchase order. Payment shall be made in federal funds                          
transmitted by wire to the Trust. Upon receipt by the Trust of                  
the federal funds so wired, such funds shall cease to be the                    
responsibility of the Company and shall become the responsibility               
of the Trust for this purpose. " Business Day" shall mean any day               
on which the New York Stock Exchange is open for trading and on                 
which. the Trust calculates its net asset value pursuant to the                 
rules of the Commission.                                                        

1.4 The Trust will redeem for cash any full or fractional             
shares of any Portfolio, when requested by the Company on behalf                
of an Account, at the net asset value next computed after receipt               
by the Trust (or its agent) of the request for redemption, as                   
established in accordance with the provisions of the then current               
prospectus of the Trust describing Portfolio redemption                         
procedures. The Trust shall make payment for such shares in the                 
manner established from time to time by the Trust. Redemption                   
with respect to a Portfolio will normally be paid to the Company                
for an Account in federal funds transmitted by wire to the                      
Company before the close of the Federal Reserve Bank, which is                  
6:00 p.m. Eastern time on the next Business Day after the receipt               
of the request for redemption. If payment in federal funds for                  
any redemption request is received by the Company after such                    
time, the Trust shall promptly upon the Company's written                       
request, reimburse the Company for any charges, costs, fees,                    
interest, or other expenses incurred by the Company as a result                 
of such failure to provide redemption proceeds within the                       
specified time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, such payment may                 
be delayed if, for example, the Portfolio's cash position so                    
requires or if extraordinary market conditions exist, but in no                 
event shall payment be delayed for a greater period than is                     
permitted by the 1940 Act.

may be netted against one another on any Business Day for the                   
purpose of determining the amount of any wire transfer on that                  
Business Day.                                                                   

1.6 Issuance and transfer of the Trust's Portfolio shares             
will be by book entry only. Stock certificates will not be issued               
to the Company or the Account. Portfolio Shares purchased from                  
the Trust will be recorded in the appropriate title for each                    
Account or the appropriate subaccount of each Account.                          

1.7 The Trust shall furnish, on or before the ex-dividend             
date, notice to the Company of any income dividends or capital                  
gain distributions payable on the shares of any Portfolio of the                
Trust. The Company hereby elects to receive all such income                     
dividends and capital gain distributions as are payable on a                    
Portfolio's shares in additional shares of the Portfolio. The                   
Trust shall notify the Company of the number of shares so issued                
as payment of such dividends and distributions. The Company                     
reserves the right, on its behalf and on behalf of the Accounts,                
to revoke this election and to receive all such dividends in                    
cash.                                                                           

1.8 The Trust shall calculate the net asset value of each             
Portfolio on each Business Day, as defined in Section 1.3. The                  
Trust shall make the net asset value per share for each Portfolio               
available to the Company or its designated agent on a daily basis               
as soon as reasonably practical after the net asset value per                   
share is calculated (normally by 6:30 p.m. Eastern time) and                    
shall use best efforts to make such net asset value per share                   
available by 7:00 p.m. Eastern time each Business Day.                          

1.9 The Trust agrees that its Portfolio shares will be sold           
only to Participating Insurance Companies and their separate

shares of any Portfolio will be sold directly to the general                    
public. The Company agrees that it will use Trust shares only for               
the purposes of funding the Contracts through the Accounts listed               
in Schedule A, as amended from time to time.

amended from time to time hereafter by mutual written agreement                 
of all the parties hereto shall be invested in the Trust, in such               
other Funds advised by the Adviser or its affiliates as may be                  
mutually agreed to in writing by the parties hereto, or in the                  
Company's general account, provided that such amounts may also be               
invested in an investment company other than the Trust if: (a)                  
such other investment company, or series thereof, has investment                
objectives or policies that are substantially different from the                
investment objectives and policies of the Portfolios; or (b) the                
Company gives the Trust and the Underwriter 45 days written

available as a funding vehicle for the Contracts; or (c) such                   
other investment company is available as a funding vehicle for                  
the Contracts at the date of this Agreement and the Company so

Agreement (a list of such funds appearing on Schedule C to this                 
Agreement); or (d) the Trust or Underwriter consents to the use                 
of such other investment company.

received; so long as and to the extent that the Commission                      
continues to interpret the 1940 Act to require pass-through                     
voting privileges for variable contract owners (or Trust Plan

2.10 If and only to the extent that, the Commission                   
interprets the 1940 Act to require pass-through voting privileges               
for Contract owners and Trust Plan Participants, the Company will               
provide pass-through voting privileges to Contract owners and                   
Trust Plan Participants whose Contract values are invested,                     
through the Accounts, in shares of one or more Portfolios of the                
Trust. If such voting privileges are required, the Trust shall                  
require all Participating Insurance Companies, including the                    
Company, to calculate voting privileges in the same manner and                  
the Company shall be responsible for assuring that the Accounts                 
calculate voting privileges in the manner established by the                    
Trust. If, and to the extent required by law or Commission or                   
Commission staff interpretations, the Company will vote shares of               
each Portfolio of the Trust held by an Account and for which no                 
timely voting instructions from Contract owners or Trust Plan                   
Participants are received in the same proportion as those shares                
held by that Account for which voting instructions are received.                
The Company and its agents will in no way recommend or oppose or                
interfere with the solicitation of proxies for Portfolio shares                 
held to fund the Contracts without the prior written consent of                 
the Trust, which consent may be withheld in the Trust's sole                    
discretion.                                                                     

2.11 The Trust and Underwriter shall pay no fee or other              
compensation to the Company under this Agreement except as                      
provided on Schedule E. Nevertheless, the Trust or the                          
Underwriter or an affiliate may make payments (other than                       
pursuant to a Rule 12b-1 Plan) to the Company or its affiliates                 
or to the Contracts' underwriter in amounts agreed to by the                    
Underwriter in writing and such payments may be made out of fees                
otherwise payable to the Underwriter or its affiliates, profits                 
of the Underwriter or its affiliates, or other resources                        
available to the Underwriter or its affiliates.

Underwriter immediately upon having a reasonable basis for                      
believing that such exemption no longer applies or might not                    
apply in the future.                                                            

3.3 The Company represents and warrants that interests under          
the Contracts funded by the Accounts are exempt from registration               
under section 3(a)(2) under the 1933 Act, that it will make every               
effort to maintain such exemption, and that it will notify the                  
Trust and the Underwriter immediately upon having a reasonable                  
basis for believing that such exemption no longer applies or                    
might not apply in the future; the Contracts will be issued and                 
sold in compliance in all material respects with all applicable                 
federal and state laws; and the sale of the Contracts shall                     
comply in all material respects with state insurance suitability                
requirements.

organized and validly existing under the laws of the State of

respects with the 1940 Act and the rules and regulations

3.5 The Trust represents and warrants that the Portfolio              
shares offered and sold pursuant to this Agreement will be                      
registered under the 1933 Act and the Trust shall be registered                 
under the 1940 Act prior to and at the time of any issuance or                  
sale of such shares. The Trust shall amend its registration                     
statement under the 1933 Act and the 1940 Act from time to time                 
as required in order to effect the continuous offering of its                   
shares. The Trust shall register and qualify its shares for sale                
in accordance with the laws of the various states only if and to                
the extent deemed advisable by the Trust or the Underwriter.

of each Portfolio will comply with the diversification                          
requirements for variable annuity, endowment or variable life                   
insurance contracts set forth in Section 817(h) of the Internal                 
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended ("Code"), and the rules and                    
regulations thereunder, including without limitation Treasury                   
Regulation 1.817-5, and will notify the Company immediately upon                
having a reasonable basis for believing any Portfolio has ceased                
to comply or might not so comply and will in that event                         
immediately take all reasonable steps to adequately diversify the               
Portfolio to achieve compliance within the grace period afforded                
by Regulation 1.817-5.                                                          

3.7 The Trust represents and warrants that it is currently            
qualified as a "regulated investment company" under Subchapter M                
of the Code, that it will make every effort to maintain such                    
qualification and will notify the Company immediately upon having               
a reasonable basis for believing it has ceased to so qualify or                 
might not so qualify in the future.                                             

3.8 The Trust represents and warrants that should it ever             
desire to make any payments to finance distribution expenses                    
pursuant to Rule 12b-1 under the 1940 Act, the Trustees,                        
including a majority who are not "interested persons" of the                    
Trust under the 1940 Act ("Disinterested Trustees"), will                       
formulate and approve any plan under Rule 12b-1 to finance                      
distribution expenses.                                                          

3.9 The Trust represents and warrants that it, its                    
directors, officers, employees and others dealing with the money                
or securities, or both, of a Portfolio shall at all times be                    
covered by a blanket fidelity bond or similar coverage for the                  
benefit of the Trust in an amount not less that the minimum                     
coverage required by Rule 17g-1 or other regulations under the                  
1940 Act. Such bond shall include coverage for larceny and                      
embezzlement and be issued by a reputable bonding company.                      

3.10 The Company represents and warrants that all of its              
directors, officers, employees, investment advisers, and other                  
individuals or entities dealing with the money and/or securities                
of the Trust are and shall be at all times covered by a blanket                 
fidelity bond or similar coverage which covers losses to the                    
Trust, in an amount not less than $5 million. The aforesaid bond                
shall include coverage for larceny and embezzlement and shall be                
issued by a reputable bonding company. The Company agrees to make               
all reasonable efforts to see that this bond or another bond                    
containing these provisions is always in effect, and agrees to                  
notify the Trust and the Underwriter in the event that such                     
coverage no longer applies.                                                     

3.11 The Underwriter represents that each Adviser is duly             
organized and validly existing under applicable corporate law and               
that each Adviser is registered and will during the term of this                
Agreement remain registered as an investment adviser under the                  
Advisers Act.                                                                   

3.12 The Trust currently intends for one or more Classes to           
make payments to finance its distribution expenses, including                   
service fees, pursuant to a Plan adopted under Rule 12b-1 under                 
the 1940 Act (" Rule 12b-1" ), although it may determine to                     
discontinue such practice in the future. To the extent that any                 
Class of the Trust finances its distribution expenses pursuant to               
a Plan adopted under Rule 12b-1, the Trust undertakes to comply                 
with any then current SEC and SEC staff interpretations                         
concerning Rule 12b-1 or any successor provisions.                              

ARTICLE IV.                   
Potential Conflicts                   

4.1 The parties acknowledge that a Portfolio's shares may be          
made available for investment to other Participating Insurance                  
Companies. In such event, the Trustees will monitor the Trust for               
the existence of any material irreconcilable conflict between the               
interests of the contract owners of all Participating Insurance                 
Companies. An irreconcilable material conflict may arise for a                  
variety of reasons, including: (a) an action by any state                       
insurance regulatory authority; (b) a change in applicable                      
federal or state insurance, tax, or securities laws or                          
regulations, or a public ruling, private letter                                 
ruling, no-action or interpretative letter, or any similar action               
by insurance, tax, or securities regulatory authorities; (c) an                 
administrative or judicial decision in any relevant proceeding;                 
(d) the manner in which the investments of any Portfolio are                    
being                                                                           
managed; (e) a difference in voting instructions given by                       
variable annuity contract and variable life insurance contract                  
owners; or (f) a decision by an insurer to disregard the voting                 
instructions of contract owners. The Trust shall promptly inform                
the Company of any determination by - the Trustees that an                      
irreconcilable material conflict exists and of the implications                 
thereof.                                                                        

4.2 The Company agrees to promptly report any potential or            
existing conflicts of which it is aware to the Trustees. The                    
Company will assist the Trustees in carrying out their                          
responsibilities under the Shared Funding Exemptive Order by                    
providing the Trustees with all information reasonably necessary                
for the Trustees to consider any issues raised including, but not               
limited to, information as to a decision by the Company to                      
disregard Contract owner voting instructions. All communications                
from the Company to the Trustees may be made in care of the                     
Trust.                                                                          

4.3 If it is determined by a majority of the Trustees, or a           
majority of the disinterested Trustees, that a material                         
irreconcilable conflict exists that affects the interests of                    
Contract owners, the Company shall, in cooperation with other                   
Participating Insurance Companies whose contract owners are also                
affected, at its own expense and to the extent reasonably                       
practicable (as determined by the Trustees) take whatever steps                 
are necessary to remedy or eliminate the irreconcilable material                
conflict, which steps could include: (a) withdrawing the assets                 
allocable to some or all of the Accounts from the Trust or any                  
Portfolio and reinvesting such assets in a different investment                 
medium, including (but not limited to) another Portfolio of the                 
Trust, or submitting the question of whether or not such                        
withdrawal should be implemented to a vote of all affected                      
Contract owners and, as appropriate, withdrawing the assets of                  
any appropriate group (i.e. , annuity contract owners, life                     
insurance policy owners, or variable contract owners of one or                  
more Participating Insurance Companies) that votes in favor of                  
such withdrawal, or offering to the affected Contract owners the                
option of making such a change; and (b) establishing a new                      
registered management investment company or managed separate                    
account.                                                                        

4.4 If a material irreconcilable conflict arises because of           
a decision by the Company to disregard Contract owner voting                    
instructions and that decision represents a minority position or                
would preclude a majority vote, the Company may be required, at                 
the Trust's election, to withdraw the affected Account's                        
investment in the Trust and terminate this Agreement with respect               
to such Account; provided, however that such withdrawal and                     
termination shall be limited to the extent required by the                      
foregoing material irreconcilable conflict as determined by a                   
majority of the disinterested Trustees. Any such withdrawal and                 
termination must take place within six (6) months after the Trust               
gives written notice that this provision is being implemented.                  
Until the end of such six (6) month period, the Trust shall                     
continue to accept and implement orders by the Company for the                  
purchase and redemption of shares of the Trust.                                 

4.5 If a material irreconcilable conflict arises because a            
particular state insurance regulator's decision applicable to the               
Company conflicts with a majority of other state regulators, then               
the Company will withdraw the affected Account's investment in                  
the Trust and terminate this Agreement with respect to such                     
Account within six (6) months after the Trustees inform the                     
Company in writing that it has determined that such decision has                
created an irreconcilable material conflict; provided, however,                 
that such withdrawal and termination shall be limited to the                    
extent required by the foregoing material irreconcilable conflict               
as determined by a majority of the disinterested Trustees. Until                
the end of such six (6) month period, the Trust shall continue to               
accept and implement orders by the Company for the purchase and                 
redemption of shares of the Trust.                                              

4.6 For purposes of Sections 4.3 through 4.6 of this                  
Agreement, a majority of the disinterested Trustees shall                       
determine whether any proposed action adequately remedies any                   
irreconcilable material conflict, but in no event will the Trust                
be required to establish a new funding medium for the Contracts.                
In the event that the Trustees determine that any proposed action               
does not adequately remedy any irreconcilable material conflict,                
then the Company will withdraw the Account's investment in the                  
Trust and terminate this Agreement within six (6) months after                  
the Trustees inform the Company in writing of the foregoing                     
determination; provided, however, that such withdrawal and                      
termination shall be limited to the extent required by any such                 
material irreconcilable conflict as determined by a majority of                 
the disinterested Trustees.                                                     

4.7 The Company shall at least annually submit to the Trustees                  
such reports, materials or data as the Trustees may reasonably                  
request so that the Trustees may fully carry out the duties                     
imposed upon them by the Shared Funding Exemptive Order, and said               
reports, materials and data shall be submitted more frequently if               
reasonably deemed appropriate by the Trustees.                                  

4.8 If and to the extent that Rule 6e-2 and Rule 6e-3(T) are                    
amended, or Rule 6e-3 is adopted, to provide exemptive relief                   
from any provision of the 1940 Act or the rules promulgated                     
thereunder with respect to mixed or shared funding (as defined in               
the Shared Funding Exemptive Order) on terms and conditions                     
materially different from those contained in the Shared Funding                 
Exemptive Order, then the Trust and/or the Participating                        
Insurance Companies, as appropriate, shall take such steps as may               
be necessary to comply with Rules 6e-2 and 6e-3(T), as amended,                 
and Rule 6e-3, as adopted, to the extent such rules are                         
applicable.                                                                     

ARTICLE V.              
Indemnification

Agreement Provisions            

If the Company, on behalf of any Account, purchases Trust             
Portfolio shares ("Eligible Shares") which are subject to a Rule                
12b-1 Plan adopted under the 1940 Act (the "Plan"), the Company                 
may participate in the plan.                                                    

To the extent the Company or its affiliates, agents or                
designees (collectively 9'you") provide administrative and other                
services which assist in the promotion and distribution of                      
Eligible Shares or Variable Contracts offering Eligible Shares,                 
the Underwriter, the Trust or their affiliates (collectively,                   
"we") may pay you a Rule 12b-1 fee. "Administrative and other                   
services" may include, but are not limited to, furnishing                       
personal services to owners of Contracts which may invest in                    
Eligible Shares ("Contact Owners") , answering routine inquiries                
regarding a Portfolio, coordinating responses to Contract Owner                 
inquiries regarding the Portfolios, maintaining such accounts or

or providing other services eligible for service fees as defined                
under NASD rules. Your acceptance of such compensation is your                  
acknowledgment that eligible services have been rendered. All                   
Rule 12b-1 fees, shall be based on the value of Eligible Shares                 
owned by the Company on behalf of its Accounts, and shall be                    
calculated on the basis and at the rates set forth in the                       
Compensation Schedule stated above. The aggregate annual fees                   
paid pursuant to each Plan shall not exceed the amounts stated as               
the "annual maximums" in the Portfolio's prospectus, unless an                  
increase is approved by shareholders as provided in the Plan.                   
These maximums shall be a specified percent of the value of a                   
Portfolio's net assets attributable to Eligible Shares owned by                 
the Company on behalf of its Accounts (determined in the same                   
manner as the Portfolio uses to compute its net assets as set                   
forth in its effective Prospectus).                                             

You shall furnish us with such information as shall                   
reasonably be requested by the Trust's Boards of Trustees                       
("Trustees ") with respect to the Rule 12b-1 fees paid to you                   
pursuant to the Plans. We shall furnish to the Trustees, for                    
their review on a quarterly basis, a written report of the                      
amounts expended under the Plans and the purposes for which such                
expenditures were made.                                                         

The Plans and provisions of any agreement relating to such            
Plans must be approved annually by a vote of the Trustees,                      
including the Trustees who are not interested persons of the                    
Trust and who have no financial interest in the Plans or any                    
related agreement ("Disinterested Trustees"). Each Plan may be                  
terminated at any time by the vote of a majority of the                         
Disinterested Trustees, or by a vote of a majority of the                       
outstanding shares as provided in the Plan, on sixty (60)                       
dayswritten notice, without payment of any penalty. The Plans may               
also be terminated by any act that terminates the Underwriting                  
Agreement between the Underwriter and the Trust, and/or the                     
management or administration agreement between Franklin Advisers,               
Inc. or Templeton Investment Counsel, Inc. or their affiliates                  
and the Trust. Continuation of the Plans is also conditioned on                 
Disinterested Trustees being ultimately responsible for selecting               
and nominating any new Disinterested Trustees. Under Rule 12b-1,                
the Trustees have a duty to request and evaluate, and persons who               
are party to any agreement related to a Plan have a duty to                     
furnish, such information as may reasonably be necessary to an                  
informed determination of whether the Plan or any agreement                     
should be implemented or continued. Under Rule 12b-1, the Trust                 
is permitted to implement or continue Plans or the provisions of                
any agreement relating to such Plans from year-to-year only if,                 
based on certain legal considerations, the Trustees are able to                 
conclude that the Plans will benefit each affected Trust                        
Portfolio and class. Absent such yearly determination, the Plans                
must be terminated as set forth above. In the event of the                      
termination of the Plans for any reason, the provisions of this                 
Schedule E relating to the Plans will also terminate.                           

Any obligation assumed by the Trust pursuant to this                  
Agreement shall be limited in all cases to the assets of the                    
Trust and no person shall seek satisfaction thereof from                        
shareholders of the Trust. You agree to waive payment of any                    
amounts payable to you by Underwriter under a Plan until such                   
time as the Underwriter has received such fee from the Fund.                    

The provisions of the Plans shall control over the                    
provisions of the Participation Agreement, including this                       
Schedule E, in the event of any inconsistency.                                  

You agree to provide complete disclosure as required by all           
applicable statutes, rules and regulations of all rule 12b-1 fees               
received from us in the disclosure documents. of the contracts.

Carillon is a good care facility. The staff is very good and helpful. On the first day, I called hospice in because they have a hospice in that building also. The rooms are nice -- about the size of a regular hospital room. They are carpeted and painted, and you can supply your furniture. They have all levels of care; you can start with assisted living and go all the way to hospice at the same facility. The dining room setup is nice. They have bible study, bingo, singing, exercise class, and church services. They have transportation to go to doctor’s appointments and shopping.

Carillon was the one I liked the best, but it was the most expensive one. It was really nice, and I liked everything about it. If money was no object, that's where I would go. The rooms and the dining room were very nice. The rooms were big, and the apartments were in the right size. They had lots of activities. They had food available even when it wasn't meal time; they could have snacks whenever they wanted something.

Bellecourt South assisted living facility looked very well kept from its exterior. Were checking it out as a possibility for our aunt. The staff greeted us with enthusiasm when we arrived.

The main rooms were all lovely  - fresh, nicely decorated and vibrant. The comfortably designed apartments included kitchenettes, spacious  bedrooms, full baths designed for safety and walk-in closets.

The meals offered all looked delicious and are prepared in a home style fashion in the lovely and well designed and decorated dining room.

They have a nice and refreshing pool, where they can do water aerobics, or take tai chi and other classes in the fitness center and go on scenic walks along the trails, in the park and courtyards.

There are lovely, comfortable chairs with great books in the library.  Our aunt would appreciate that the library is open 24 hours. They also enjoy doing crafts in the creative arts studio or woodworking shop and and socializing in the media rooms.

They are also taken out on many wonderful excursions. Some of the activities they enjoy include dances, the symphony, visits to gourmet restaurants and shops, line dancing clubs

This facility seems to be able to accommodate a variety of needs easily and with compassionate care. The staff works closely with each resident on an individual basis, to provide exactly what he or she requires.

What is Assisted Living?Assisted living is a housing arrangement for seniors who need some supervision and help with activities of daily living such as meal preparation, housekeeping and bathing, but who don't need skilled nursing care. At most assisted living communities, you can expect to see private or semiprivate rooms within a complex along with meals, shared dining, kitchenettes, common spaces for socializing, organized activities, transportation services, Alzheimer’s care, and more.





Assisted Living Care, Services and Amenities

Today’s senior assisted living communities offer a wide variety of services and amenities to their residents. Oftentimes less expensive than skilled nursing facilities or in-home care, most assisted living communities have a full, round-the-clock staff trained to assist residents with a variety of daily activities, from eating, bathing and dressing to medication management, toileting and help with incontinence. Many assisted living centers also provide specialized care for residents with dementia.Assisted living goes by different names in different states, and licensing requirements will vary. Here in our assisted living directory, you'll find assisted living providers, personal care homes, board and care homes, and alzheimer's care facilities.Most assisted living facilities also provide housekeeping, three daily meals plus snacks, scheduled transportation, health and exercise programs, and a host of organized health activities and events. Many communities feature on-site amenities like gyms, swimming pools, common areas for socializing, beauty salons, pharmacies, libraries, pets and more.

11 Signs It Might Be Time for Assisted Living







Costs of Assisted LivingThe average monthly cost of assisted living in the U.S. is about $3,300 per month for a one-bedroom unit. But it's important to note that the cost of assisted living varies widely depending on a number of factors. Base costs for assisted living centers typically cover room and board and meals. Other charges that may not be covered in the base fees might include deposits, entry fees, housekeeping, and laundry. Additional fees are typically charged for special care.Factors that affect the cost of assisted living include:


Level of Care and Types of Services Needed
Location
Amenities Included




Paying for Assisted LivingAssisted living can be pricey, but in many cases, it’s more affordable than in-home care or nursing home care in the same geographic area. There are many ways to pay for assisted living, which isn’t covered by Medicare, except in the case of long-term rehabilitation. Long-term care insurance, veteran’s benefits, life insurance, annuities, a bridge loan, or simply pooling family resources are all common ways to cover the costs of assisted living.

Senior Living: Assisted Living Facilities and Other Options
Not all senior living communities offer assistance for their residents, so it's important to familiarize yourself with the different types of communities and the types of services they provide.Assisted living homes are designed for residents that need some assistance with daily activities but do not need skilled nursing care. In addition to assisted living, there are:Independent living communities, commonly known as retirement communities, are where seniors who don’t require care live within a community of fellow seniors. Homes in these communities are typically smaller and easier to manage. Learn more about independent living communitiesContinuing Care Retirement Communities (CCRCs), provide a full range of housing choices and services on one campus -- from independent living to assisted living to skilled nursing. This option is best for those who want to be able to stay in one place as they age. Learn more about continuing care retirement communitiesBoard and care facilities are designed for seniors who can't live independently due to physical or mental disabilities but who don't require fulltime skilled nursing care.Skilled nursing facilities, also called nursing homes, are best for those with physical or mental health conditions requiring fulltime monitoring and medical care. Nursing homes that also offer rehabilitation services for those who need short-term, fulltime care are also considered "rehabilitation facilities.” Most skilled nursing residents live in semi-private rooms, and meals are usually provided.

A Caregiver's Guide to Assisted Living Facilities in TexasWhat they're calledOfficial name: Assisted Living FacilitiesCommon name: Assisted living facilitiesTo compare assisted living to board and care, skilled nursing, and other long-term residential care communities, see Residential Care Options: How to Decide.What they offer
Individual or shared (up to four persons) living units (from single rooms to multiroom apartments) with some cooking facilities; bathrooms may be shared
All meals, usually in a common dining area
General supervision
Assistance with administration and management of medications
Personal care services, including assistance with activities of daily living (ADLs) such as eating, dressing, bathing
Social and exercise activities
Note: Some facilities also offer respite care and other special services.What they costMedian monthly fees: $3,210 (higher for residents requiring memory care)State of Texas requirements
There are two types of assisted living facilities, offering care to residents with differing levels of need:


 In a Type A facility, a resident must be mentally and physically able to evacuate the facility unassisted in an emergency; the resident must be capable of following directions and must not require routine attendance during sleeping hours.
 In a Type B facility, a resident may need staff assistance to evacuate the facility and require attendance during sleeping hours; a resident may require assistance in transferring to and from bed but may not be permanently bedfast.


A resident may contract with outside licensed agencies to provide home healthcare.
State of Texas oversightThe Texas Department of Aging and Disability Services (800-458-9858 or 512-438-3161) oversees assisted living facilities.How to resolve problems or offer feedback
Contact the Texas long-term care ombudsman program at 800-458-9858; this is a free service to help residents informally resolve problems with a facility.
To register a complaint about a facility, contact the Texas Consumer Rights and Services Department on its website, or call 800-458-9858.
Rate and review assisted living facilities.
How to pay for assisted living in Texas
Most assisted living is paid for privately by the resident and/or his or her family.
Low-income veterans or surviving spouses of veterans may be eligible for Aid and Attendance or other payments from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), which can help pay for assisted living.
Some assisted living facilities offer sliding scale fees, making a higher level of care available to families that might not otherwise be able to afford it. Be sure to ask -- or ask a geriatric care manager in the area if he or she knows which facilities offer sliding scale fees.
Help finding and choosing a facility
Hire a geriatric care manager (most have extensive local knowledge about assisted living facilities in a particular geographic area, including space availability, resident needs assessments, sliding scale fees, and resident satisfaction). To find a geriatric care manager, see Caring.com's Senior Living Directory.
For details about assisted living facilities in each of the 50 U.S. states plus the District of
Columbia, see A Caregiver's Guide to Assisted Living Facilities.
