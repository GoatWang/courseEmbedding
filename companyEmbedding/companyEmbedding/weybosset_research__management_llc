OurHistory




In 1980 my sisters, mother, father and I were fortunate enough to come into a little capital. But once the celebration ended, the question remained: What to do with our newly acquired capital?
Serendipitously I had just begun working for a privately held Wall Street firm, Kidder, Peabody & Co., Incorporated. Over the course of the next ten years, through a process of trial and error, my father and I worked out a method, a philosophy, a way of investing that, frankly, worked very well. We were reinforced in our endeavor by a strong equity investment culture at Kidder, Peabody. (Some of the legends of 20th Century investing had passed through Kidder, including Bill Ruane and Julian Robertson.) Along the way, a cohort of clients assembled to invest alongside the Lewis clan.
Fast-forward the movie ten years, and our evolving method of investing was working so well that I was no longer interested in trading bonds for institutional investors and wealthy individuals, the primary way I’d made my living since starting at Kidder; I yearned to focus on the implementation and improvement of our evolving investment philosophy. This was the inception of Weybosset Research and Management LLC.
But first I spent five years with Compton Capital Management, an investment manager in Providence, RI. At Compton I met Jeannine Bizier who oversaw, and still oversees, our administrative affairs. In 2000, Jeannine convinced me to open our own firm, and in August of that year, Weybosset Research and Management LLC opened its doors.
Tom Lamb joined in 2003 after nine years as a security analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston. Tom is integral to the investment process here at Weybosset Research and Management.
After being Justin Deutsch’s client for four and a half years, in 2014 we decided that Weybosset and our clients would be much better served having him work in house with us. Justin has been, and will continue to be instrumental in our stock picking…. think trains, truck engines, healthcare, and food and drinks.
But despite a multi-decade history, and numerous changes along the way, we remain essentially what we have always been. We only invest on behalf of individuals (“our clients all have faces and mothers”), or entities associated with individuals. Our firm has grown mightily since 2000, but we spend no time at all marketing. We grow only by referrals from existing clients; and, of course, through appreciation of the assets we manage.
We are first of all dedicated to delivering the best possible service for our clients, and to long-term fundamental investing, an approach which has served us well for many, many years. We are long-term in our approach to investing, and also in our relationships with our clients, a substantial number of whom have been with us for twenty or thirty years. We have enjoyed a good multi-decade run and look forward to its continuation in the decades ahead.

Our Philosophy




Long-Range Investing
–Fla Lewis III, Principal
Individuals and institutions increasingly are turning to specialists to handle their investments. The trend makes sense, inasmuch as these same individuals would normally not attempt to remove their own gall bladders or fly without a pilot’s license. But those considering hiring someone to manage their investments (or investments for which they are responsible) are well advised to know as much as they can about the way the prospective manager goes about investing client money. Sometimes an existing investor will want to know more about how his or her investment manager has delivered the returns the client has already earned.
This little essay is designed to answer both inquiries briefly and in layman’s terms. It reflects an approach to investing that has served long-time clients, my family, and me personally well for more than 30 years. In some respects it is too brief—certain important considerations are skipped over or generalized into meaninglessness. Nevertheless, it is hoped that the following pages will give the interested reader a reasonable overview of the way we at Weybosset Research & Management LLC practice the art of investing. 
Since most of our efforts are devoted to activities in the stock market, let me begin with a discussion of our approach to equity investments.

Fixed Income Markets
—February 12, 2014
The fixed income market sure has changed in the last couple of months. A couple of months ago brokers were calling constantly with offers of short maturity bonds with decent yields – 5 to 7%.

About China’s Rebalancing
—August 29, 2013
We pay attention to the “growth” debates about China. Aside from arguments (important, for sure) about when or if mounting bad debt from poorly conceived infrastructure projects and ebullient property markets will crater GDP growth, the larger debate concerns the impact on the economy from its rebalancing. An insightful addition to this debate comes from [read more…]
