	As of the date hereof, includes Shares (as defined below) tendered in the Offer (as defined below) (excluding 607,135 Shares that were tendered pursuant to guaranteed
	delivery procedures) and includes Shares acquired pursuant to the exercise of the Top-Up Option (as defined below). Percentage ownership is calculated based on 34,531,922 Shares outstanding as of March 8, 2013, as stated by Online Resources
	Corporation to ACI Worldwide, Inc, and after giving effect to the issuance of Shares pursuant to the Top-Up Option.









	This Amendment No. 1 to Schedule 13D amends and supplements the Schedule 13D originally
	filed jointly on February 5, 2013 (the Schedule 13D) by ACI Worldwide, Inc., a Delaware corporation (ACI), and Ocelot Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of ACI
	(Purchaser), pursuant to the joint filing agreement filed with the original Schedule 13D, relating to the tender offer (the Offer) by Purchaser to purchase all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock, par value
	$0.0001 per share (each, a Share, and collectively, the Shares), of Online Resources Corporation, a Delaware corporation (ORCC), at a purchase price of $3.85 per Share in cash, without interest, less any
	applicable withholding taxes (the Offer Price), and the subsequent merger (the Merger) of Purchaser with and into ORCC upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Transaction Agreement, dated as of January
	30, 2013 (the Transaction Agreement), by and among ACI, Purchaser and ORCC.




	Capitalized terms used but not
	otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Schedule 13D.




	This Schedule 13D is hereby
	amended as follows:





	Item 4. Purpose of Transaction






	Item 5. Interest in Securities of ORCC






	Item 6. Contracts, Arrangements,
	Understandings, or Relationships with respect to Securities of ORCC





	Item 4, Item 5(a), (b) and (c) and Item 6 of the
	Schedule 13D are hereby amended and supplemented by adding the following at the end of each section thereof:




	The Offer
	expired at 12:00 midnight, New York City time, on Friday, March 8, 2013. According to American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, the depositary for the Offer, as of the expiration of the Offer, approximately 28,588,101 Shares were validly
	tendered and not properly withdrawn in the Offer, representing approximately 82.8% of ORCCs issued and outstanding shares. In addition, approximately 607,135 Shares were delivered through notices of guaranteed delivery. All Shares that were
	validly tendered and not properly withdrawn in the Offer have been accepted for purchase and payment at the Offer Price by the Purchaser, and all holders of these Shares will be paid promptly in accordance with the terms of the Offer.




	On March 11, 2013, Purchaser also exercised its Top-Up Option under the Transaction Agreement to purchase from ORCC 24,925,134 newly
	issued Shares (the Top-Up Shares) at a price per Share equal to the Offer Price, that when added to the number of Shares owned directly or indirectly by ACI and Purchaser at the time of such exercise, equals at least one Share more than
	90% of the number of ORCC Shares then outstanding (after giving effect to the issuance of the Top-Up Shares pursuant to the exercise of the Top-Up Option.




	Purchaser completed its acquisition of ORCC through the merger of Purchaser with and into ORCC, with ORCC continuing as the surviving corporation in the Merger and becoming a direct wholly-owned
	subsidiary of ACI, in accordance with the short-form merger provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the DGCL). The Merger became effective (the Effective Time) on March 11, 2013 at 8:34 a.m., upon the filing by
	Purchaser of a certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. Pursuant to the terms of the Transaction Agreement, at the Effective Time each Share (other than Shares directly owned by ACI or any of its subsidiaries
	(including Purchaser) or held by ORCC or any of its subsidiaries as treasury shares immediately prior to the Effective Time, which were canceled without the payment of any consideration, and Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
	held by a stockholder who is entitled to demand, and who properly demands, appraisal for such Shares in compliance with Section 262 of the DGCL) were canceled and converted into the right to receive the Offer Price. On March 11, 2013, ORCC notified
	the NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (NASDAQ) of the completion of the Merger and requested that trading of ORCCs Shares on NASDAQ be suspended. On March 11, 2013, ACI issued a press release announcing the consummation of the Merger.

	.



	 


	The foregoing beneficial ownership percentages are based on 93,105,055 shares of Common Stock outstanding as of November 1, 2016 according to the Company’s quarterly report on Form 10-Q, filed November 4, 2016.







	(b)

	(c)


	            


	On November 10, 2016, Essent Intermediate sold 2,300,000 shares of Common Stock to its broker at a price of $28.75 per share.  No other transactions in the Common Stock have been effected by any of the Reporting Persons within the past 60 days.








	(d)


	            


	Except as set forth in this Item 5 and for persons referred to in Item 2 of

	Amendment No. 3 to the Schedule 13D

	, no person is known to have the right to receive or the power to direct the receipt of dividends from, or the proceeds from the sale of, the Common Stock that may be deemed to be beneficially owned by the Reporting Persons.








	(e)


	            


	Not applicable.
