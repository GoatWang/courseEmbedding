        Comment Guidelines        


We encourage you to use comments to engage with users, share your perspective and ask questions of authors and each other. However, in order to maintain the high level of discourse we’ve all come to value and expect, please keep the following criteria in mind: 

Enrich the conversation
Stay focused and on track. Only post material that’s relevant to the topic being discussed.
Be respectful. Even negative opinions can be framed positively and diplomatically.
 Use standard writing style. Include punctuation and upper and lower cases.
NOTE: Spam and/or promotional messages and links within a comment will be removed
Avoid profanity, slander or personal attacks directed at an author or another user.
Don’t Monopolize the Conversation. We appreciate passion and conviction, but we also believe strongly in giving everyone a chance to air their thoughts. Therefore, in addition to civil interaction, we expect commenters to offer their opinions succinctly and thoughtfully, but not so repeatedly that others are annoyed or offended. If we receive complaints about individuals who take over a thread or forum, we reserve the right to ban them from the site, without recourse.
Only English comments will be allowed.

Perpetrators of spam or abuse will be deleted from the site and prohibited from future registration at Investing.com’s discretion.

Introduction


	  Propell Technologies Group, Inc., through its wholly owned subsidiary Novas Energy USA, is the exclusive U.S licensee of the Plasma Pulse enhanced oil recovery (EOR) well treatment designed to improve well production cost effectively and without acidization, hydrofracking or other chemicals. It develops and commercializes a treatment process intended to improve production and enhance recovery of oil and gas in existing wells. The Company was founded in 2012 and is based in Houston, Texas.
	  
PLASMA PULSE TECHNOLOGY

	  The Plasma Pulse Technology (PPT) is an environmentally friendly technology designed to assist producers to obtain sustained higher productivity from their wells. The tool cleans the wells completed production intervals to change the wells inflow conditions by clearing near wellbore damage and removing obstructions from the perforation zone in the well. It is relatively inexpensive to treat a well because it is applied using standard wire line cables and the service tools and crews are mobile.
	  

What is Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR)



	  EOR techniques are used to increase oil flow and extend the life of oil fields  
	  


		  Water flooding, thermal, Co2 or chemical injections
		  


	  Propell is the Exclusive Licensee of a Proprietary EOR Technology using Plasma
	  

	  Winner of Technology Innovation Award – For excellence in meeting current and future energy demand
	  


Plasma vs EOR Competition







Plasma Pulse Benefits



 



Fast



						Treatment usually done in a matter of hours


						Well goes back into production immediately
						




Safe



                        100's of wells treated with no damage or incidents
						




Clean



                        No chemicals
						

                        No water
						




Cost effective



						Use a wireline truck
						





 


Competition


 



High cost alternatives



                        Water and chemicals lead to environmental concerns
						




Hydraulic Fracturing



                        High pressure water, sand and chemicals, expensive
						




Acidizing



                        Chemicals, very short term effect
						




Hydro Slotting



                        High pressure water, expensive
						




Hydro Pulse



                        Tool remains in the well
						




Chemical Strategies



                        Temperature sensitive







Microbial



                        Well goes off-line for weeks
						







Next Generation Horizontal Tool



	  Propell's technology could be the game changer the industry is looking for
	  

	  Currently no effective EOR technologies exist
	  

	  Low cost vs Re-Fracking
	  

	  Acid treatments on horizontal wells is very ineffective
	  

	  May eliminate millions of gallons of water needed for horizontal refrack
	  


Primary Applications



	  Treatment of existing wells where production has slowed due to plugging
	  

	  Gravel pack maintenance on existing wells
	  

	  Pre-frac wellbore conditioning to reduce initiation pressure
	  

	  Water source well maintenance
	  

	  Injection well maintenance
	  

	  Conditioning of new wells in the perforated zone
	  


U.S. Market Opportunity


	  28.7% Annual EOR Industry Growth
	  


	  Vertical Stripper Wells
	  


		  394,202 marginal or stripper wells (less than 10 BOPD)
		  


			  Produced 275 million barrels of oil in 2009 (20% of U.S. production)
			  



	  Injection Wells
	  


		  Over 144,000 injection wells in the U.S.
		  


			  Enhanced recovery wells (water floods) account for 80%
			  

			  Texas – 52,016, Kansas – 16,658, Oklahoma – 10,629 Injection Wells
			  



	  Other opportunities
	  


		  Pre-Frac – reduce breakdown pressure
		  

		  Improve effectiveness of chemical treatments
		  

		  SAG D Wells (Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage)
		  

		  Near wellbore damage from construction, i.e. drilling muds, fluid invasion
		  


	  45,000 new wells drilled every year
	  


Revenue Models



	  Fee Based Model
	  


		  Operated by Propell  
		  

		  High margin
		  


	  Joint Venture Model
	  


		  Partner with well owners and operators
		  

		  Propell pays for the service
		  

		  Receive a percentage of the increase in production after royalties and operating expenses
		  


	  Additional upside capture through asset purchases
	  


		  De-risk the field by treating wells
		  

		  Acquire leases and wells with proven turnaround potential
		  

		  Keep 100% of the increase in production after expenses

	This treatment was the culmination of a Unilateral Proposal by Novas Energy USA and its Joint Venture partner, Grupo Industrial RJP, SA de CV (Grupo Industrial) to treat certain Pemex operated wells as part of a strategic alliance to market and sell Plasma Pulse oil recovery treatments in the United Mexican States.

	The first treatment met all safety guidelines and was completed on schedule without incident.

	The Company expects to receive results from the operator at which time it will be decided how to expand the program.

	Mexico is the 7th largest oil producing nation in the world.

	John A. Zotos, Director of Business Development for Propell Technologies in Mexico states "We could not be more pleased to partner with Grupo Industrial and become a part of the historic Energy Reform in Mexico. The opportunity to introduce Plasma Pulse technology to PEMEX, Mexico's sole producer of crude oil and natural gas is a high honor."

	"Mexico is the third largest producer of oil in the Western Hemisphere and a place where we offer strong competitive value," commented John Huemoeller II, Propell president and CEO. "We have every confidence in Grupo Industrial and its management to be a great partner as we roll out the treatment business in the region."

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score
A


Growth Score

Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

The ever popular one-page Snapshot reports are generated for virtually every single Zacks Ranked stock. It's packed with all of the company's key stats and salient decision making information. Including the Zacks Rank, Zacks Industry Rank, Style Scores, the Price, Consensus & Surprise chart, graphical estimate analysis and how a stocks stacks up to its peers.
The detailed multi-page Analyst report does an even deeper dive on the company's vital statistics. In addition to all of the proprietary analysis in the Snapshot, the report also visually displays the four components of the Zacks Rank (Agreement, Magnitude, Upside and Surprise); provides a comprehensive overview of the company business drivers, complete with earnings and sales charts; a recap of their last earnings report; and a bulleted list of reasons to buy or sell the stock. It also includes an industry comparison table to see how your stock compares to its expanded industry, and the S&P 500.
Researching stocks has never been so easy or insightful as with the ZER Analyst and Snapshot reports.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.
