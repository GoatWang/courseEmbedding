Experience. We deliver an end-to-end solution on time and on budget.

HamptonsPRIVATE RESIDENCESG Blocks helped build one of the Hamptons' most Eco-Friendly homes by harnessing 6 shipping containers to create a spacious, open, and highly efficient beachfront environment. 







Mini CooperMOBILE SHOWROOMWooing clients to your retail location has become harder. SG Blocks helped Mini Cooper create a mobile showroom that could be taken to where clients gather—a new fun and effective way to engage clients with your brand.

SG Blocks Receives Evaluation Service Report (ESR) from ICC



SG Blocks is the only container supplier to receive an ESR from the ICC







The ESR from International Code Council (ICC) will significantly expedite reviews and approvals by building departments, dramatically increasing acceptance of container fabrication in the construction industry. SG Blocks ESR mark will be inscribed on every container delivered to customers. Architects, engineers, developers and contractors can rely on SG Blocks’ ESR to differentiate themselves by using a product, that is sustainable, saves money and time and is qualitatively superior, in their projects.

 Patent application submitted for SG Blocks Universal BoxCode compliant universal standardized modules and modifications as well as completely interchangeable infill panels. Standardized modules reduce the time to obtain approvals, provide a consistent design and fabrication approach and reduce design and construction times and errors. 










Why Use Containers?



Containers are not only sustainable, but they also save time and money.Traditional building methods are depleting our planet's resources. It's time to start building smarter and better, with SG Blocks. We are destroying our planet's resources. Millions of acres of forest are depleted every year, much of it harvested for building. In contrast, containers can substantially offset a development's carbon footprint and reduce the use of natural resources. Containers are strong, corrosion resistant, and can reduce construction time by up to 40%. Hard and soft costs are lower as well, particularly in expensive urban and mid-rise markets. Containers are perfect solutions across diverse residential, industrial, commercial, and retail applications.
40% Faster Construction Time














Save 10-20% on Construction Costs













Here are a few more reasons to use SG Block's Containers for your next project: • Environmentally Green• Strong and Impervious• Scalable and Reconfigurable• Mobile and Portable• Low Energy Utilization• High Energy Efficiency Who's Building with SG Blocks?The very best companies and largest organizations trust SG Blocks to deliver their proprietary container-based solutions.

Profile
Business Description
SG Blocks, Inc. is the premier innovator in providing industry approved, code engineered cargo shipping containers to meet the growing demand for safe and green construction. Rather than consuming new steel and lumber, SG Blocks capitalizes on the structural engineering and design parameters a shipping container must meet and repurposes them for use in building. Offering a product that typically exceeds building code requirements, SG Blocks enables developers, architects, builders and owners to achieve greener construction, faster execution and stronger buildings of higher value and extended life.SG Blocks has an application in meeting safe and sustainable housing needs, particularly in hurricane and earthquake prone areas. Since its inception in 2007, SG Blocks has developed and implemented the technology to break away from standardized container construction at reduced costs and is committed to providing a construction methodology that will lessen the global carbon footprint.
Each container is a building block module that can be arranged in virtually any stacking configuration to create the spaces and volumes needed. Architectural creativity combined with engineering expertise is used in stacking and arranging the blocks, which can be interconnected and modified to suit the specific building space requirements.
SG Blocks' products have been featured in several media outlets including Fortune, NY Times, NY Post, USA Today, CNN, Washington Post and more. The company has completed projects for US Army and Navy, US Department of Veteran Affairs, The City of Santa Monica, Port of Houston Authority, Aman Resorts, BareBurger, Equinox, HGTV, Lacoste, Marriott Hotels & Resorts, Mini Cooper, Starbucks and more.
SG Blocks has an exclusive collaboration and supply contract with ConGlobal Industries Inc., the largest shipping container depot operator in the United States and an affiliation with PVE Sheffler, a prominent architectural and engineering services firm.

SG Blocks plans to use the net proceeds from the offering for working capital and other general corporate purposes and to repay the remaining portion of the Company's outstanding debt.
The offering is expected to close on or about June 27, 2017, subject to customary closing conditions.
