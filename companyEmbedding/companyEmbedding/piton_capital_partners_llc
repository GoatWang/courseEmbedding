Piton® Capital 
Invests in online businesses with network effects













The things that make a market better — demand, supply and information — are derived from customers, so more of them make a better market. This virtuous relationship, or network effect, can help firms dominate their industries. This is Piton’s sole purpose – to help entrepreneurs build the largest network effect business in their field.

Prior to this he worked in telecoms corporate finance and held operating roles in classified media publishing. In his time with UBS he helped create Sunrise, the alternative telecom services provider in Switzerland, and made investments in sector-leading companies such as Betfair which became the world’s largest betting exchange. Greg has a Masters of Management degree from the Kellogg Graduate School of Management.

Fundraising?

If you are running a network effects business and raising a VC round we would like to meet you and discuss your business and its financial requirements. Contact us at info@pitoncap.com.
We would ideally like to see:
•         Management presentation
•         Operating metrics / KPI’s
•         Financial history and forecasts
If you think Piton is the sort of partner you are looking for we would encourage you to see us early, well before your fundraise, and keep us updated on the progress of your business. It is not necessary to do this but it is the most effective way to make sure we are up to speed at the right time.
