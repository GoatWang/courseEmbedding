Letter to Participants

 n��DEAR PARTICIPANT, A more optimistic tone characterized the financial markets in the second quarter of 2003. In fact, it was the best quarter in 4�1/2 years for both the U.S. stock market and markets outside the
United States, even as the long-standing bond market rally persisted. � The market rallies were very welcome after the long bear market. In general, investors should expect both good and bad markets within any extended time span. Good financial planning takes this into account by diversifying your portfolio
with an asset allocation that is appropriate to your stage in life and your tolerance for the possibility of loss. � A financial professional can help you create a complete picture of the potential demands on your resources. Moreover, financial professionals are familiar with the
long-term returns and historical volatility of various asset classes. Together, you and your financial professional can plan an investment program that takes into account your reasons for investing, the time you have to reach your goals, and the
amount of risk you feel comfortable assuming. � On behalf of Prudential
Financial, I would like to thank you for your confidence in our products. We look forward to continuing to serve your investment needs. � Sincerely, � 
 David R. Odenath, Jr. Chairman,
��

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF  VCA-2  �


Note�1:
�
General  � The Prudential Variable Contract Account-2 (VCA-2 or the Account) was established on January 9, 1968 by The Prudential Insurance Company of America (�Prudential�) under the laws of the State of New Jersey and is
registered as an open-end, diversified management investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. VCA-2 has been designed for use by public school systems and certain tax-exempt organizations to provide for the purchase and
payment of tax-deferred variable annuities. The investment objective of the Account is long-term growth of capital. Its investments are composed primarily of common stocks. Although variable annuity payments differ according to the investment
performance of the Account, they are not affected by mortality or expense experience because Prudential assumes the expense risk and the mortality risk under the contracts.  �


Note�2:
�
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  � Securities Valuation:����Securities listed on a securities exchange are valued at the last sale price on such exchange on the day of
valuation or, if there was no sale on such day, at the mean between the last reported bid and ask prices, or at the last bid price on such day in the absence of an asked price. Securities traded via Nasdaq are valued at the official closing price
provided by Nasdaq. Securities that are actively traded in the over-the-counter market, including listed securities for which the primary market is believed by Prudential Investments LLC (�PI� or �Manager�), in consultation with
the subadviser(s); to be over-the-counter, are valued by an independent pricing agent or principal market maker. Options on securities and indices traded on an exchange are valued at the mean between the most recently quoted bid and asked prices on
such exchange. Futures contracts and options thereon traded on a commodities exchange or board of trade are valued at the last sale price at the close of trading on such exchange or board of trade or, if there was no sale on the applicable
commodities exchange or board of trade on such day, at the mean between the most recently quoted bid and asked prices on such exchange or board of trade or at the last bid price in the absence of an asked price. Any security for which a reliable
market quotation is unavailable is valued at fair value by a Valuation Committee appointed by the Account�s Committee Members.  � Investments in mutual funds are valued at their net asset value as of the close of the New York Stock Exchange on the date of the valuation.  � Short-term investments which mature in more than 60 days are valued based on current
market quotations. Short-term investments having maturities of 60 days or less are valued at amortized cost which approximates market value. Amortized cost is computed using the cost on the date of purchase, adjusted for constant accretion of
discount or amortization of premium to maturity.  � Securities
Transactions and Investment Income:����Securities transactions are recorded on the trade date. Realized gains (losses) on sales of securities are calculated on the identified cost basis. Dividend income is recorded on the
ex-dividend date and interest income, including amortization of premiums and accretion of discount on debt securities, as required is recorded on the accrual basis. Income and realized and unrealized gains and losses are allocated to the
Participants and Prudential on a daily basis in proportion to their respective ownership in VCA-2. Expenses are recorded on the accrual basis which may require the use of certain estimates by management.  � Options:����The Account may either purchase or write options
in order to hedge against adverse market movements or fluctuations in value caused by changes in prevailing interest rates with respect to securities which the Fund currently owns or intends to purchase. The Account�s principal reason for
writing options is to realize, through receipt of premiums, a greater current return than would be realized on the underlying security alone. When the Account purchases an option, it pays a premium and an amount equal to that premium is recorded as
an asset. When the Account writes an option, it receives a premium and an amount equal to that premium is recorded as a liability. The asset or liability is adjusted daily to reflect the current market value of the option.  � If an option expires unexercised, the Account realizes a gain or loss to the extent of
the premium received or paid. If an option is exercised, the premium received or paid is an adjustment to the proceeds from the sale or the cost of the purchase in determining whether the Account has realized a gain or loss. The difference
 �


between the premium and the amount received or paid on effecting a closing purchase or sale transaction is also
treated as a realized gain or loss. Gain or loss on purchased options is included in net realized gain or loss on investment transactions. Gain or loss on written options is presented separately as net realized gain or loss on written options.
 � The Account, as writer of an option, may have no control over whether
the underlying securities may be sold (called) or purchased (put). As a result, the Account bears the market risk of an unfavorable change in the price of the security underlying the written option. The Account, as purchaser of an option, bears the
risk of the potential inability of the counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts.  � Written options involve elements of both market and credit risk in excess of the amounts reflected in the Statements of Assets and Liabilities.  � Federal Income Taxes:����The operations of VCA-2 are part of, and are taxed with, the operations of
Prudential. Under the current provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, Prudential does not expect to incur federal income taxes on earnings of VCA-2 to the extent the earnings are credited under the Contracts. As a result, the Unit Value of VCA-2
has not been reduced by federal income taxes.  � Annuity
Reserves:����Reserves are computed for purchased annuities using the Prudential 1950 Group Annuity Valuation (GAV) Table, adjusted, and a valuation interest rate related to the Assumed Investment Result (AIR). The valuation
interest rate is equal to the AIR less .5% in contract charges defined in Note 3. The AIRs are selected by each Contract-holder and are described in the prospectus.  �


Note�3:
�
Investment Management Agreement and Charges  � The Account has a management agreement with PI. Pursuant to this agreement, PI has responsibility for all investment advisory services and supervises the
subadviser�s performance of such services. PI has entered into a subadvisory agreement with Jennison Associates LLC (�Jennison�). The subadvisory agreement provides that Jennison will furnish investment advisory services in connection
with management of the Account. PI pays for the services of Jennison.  � A
daily charge, at an effective annual rate of 0.125% of the current value of the Participant�s (other than Annuitants� and Prudential�s) equity in VCA-2, is charged to the Account and paid to PI for investment management services. An
equivalent charge is deducted monthly in determining the amount of Annuitants� payments.  � A daily charge, paid to PI for assuming mortality and expense risks, is calculated at an effective annual rate of 0.375% of the current value of the Participant�s (other than Annuitants� and Prudential�s) equity
in VCA-2. A one-time equivalent charge is deducted when the Annuity Units for Annuitants are determined.  � Prudential, PI and Jennison are indirect, wholly-owned subsidiaries of Prudential Financial, Inc.  � An annual administration charge of not more than $30 annually is deducted from the accumulation account of certain Participants either
at the time of withdrawal of the value of the entire Participant�s account or at the end of the fiscal year by canceling Accumulation Units. This deduction may be made from a fixed-dollar annuity contract if the Participant is enrolled under
such a contract.  � A charge of 2.5% for sales and other marketing expenses
is deducted from certain Participant�s purchase payments. For the six months ended June 30, 2003, Prudential has advised the Account it has received $440 for such charges.  �


Note�4:
�
Purchases and Sales of Portfolio Securities  � For the six months ended June 30, 2003, the aggregate cost of purchases and the proceeds from sales of securities, excluding short-term investments, were
$81,399,585 and $90,269,960, respectively.  � Investment in the Core
Funds:����The Account invests in the Taxable Money Market Series (the �Series�), a portfolio of Prudential Core Investment Fund, pursuant to an exemptive order received from the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The Series is a money market mutual fund registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, and managed by PI. During the six months ended June 30, 2003, the Account earned $75,273, from the Series by investing its excess cash in the
Series.  �




Note�5:
�
Unit Transactions  � The number of Accumulation Units issued and redeemed for the six months ended June 30, 2003 and the year ended December 31, 2002, respectively are as follows:

Net Increase (Decrease) in Net Assets Resulting from Surplus Transfers  � The increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from surplus transfers represents the net increases to/(reductions from) Prudential�s investment Account. The
increase (decrease) includes reserve adjustments for mortality and expense risks assumed by Prudential.  �


Note�7:
�
Participant Loans  � Participant loan initiations are not permitted in VCA-2. However, participants who initiated loans in other accounts are permitted to direct loan repayments into
VCA-2.  � For the six months ended June 30, 2003 and the year ended
December 31, 2002, $5,691 and $11,777 of participant loan principal and interest has been paid to VCA-2, respectively. The participant loan principal and interest repayments are included in purchase payments and transfers in within the Statement of
Changes in Net Assets.  �

A variable annuity is designed for people willing to take more risk with their money in exchange for greater growth potential.
When planning for retirement, you might want to consider a variable annuity. Variable annuities are long-term contracts between you and an insurance company, in which the insurer agrees to make periodic payments to you in exchange for your purchase payment(s), beginning either immediately or at some future date. There are two phases to a variable annuity. The first is the accumulation phase, where you have the potential to grow your assets on a tax-deferred basis until your money is withdrawn. The second is the annuitization phase, where variable annuities provide guaranteed payments for a specified period of time or for the rest of your life.
Today's, variable annuities can help address the many challenges facing retirees and pre-retirees like you. You need to prepare for the likelihood of a lengthy retirement. A long retirement combined with a potentially higher cost of living, means traditional sources like Social Security and pensions may not be sufficient to fund your retirement. A variable annuity has benefits and features that can help.
Variable Annuity Benefits:
• A variety of professionally managed investment options
• Optional living benefits (available at an additional cost), that can help protect your retirement income
• A guaranteed death benefit to help protect your beneficiaries
• An opportunity for your investment to grow on a tax-deferred basis















A variable annuity is a long-term investment designed to create lifetime income in retirement. Investment returns will fluctuate and the principal value, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than the original investment. Withdrawals or surrenders may be subject to contingent deferred sales charges. Withdrawals and distributions of taxable amounts are subject to ordinary income tax and, if made prior to age 59 1/2, may be subject to an additional 10% federal income tax penalty. Withdrawals can reduce the living and death benefits and account value.

All guarantees, including optional benefits, are backed by the claims-paying ability of the issuing company and do not apply to the underlying investment options. Guarantees do not apply to the safety or investment performance of the underlying subaccounts in the variable annuity.


Prudential Annuities does not provide tax, accounting, or legal advice. Please consult your own attorney or accountant.

 Market Overview  unaudited
 
Annual Report
 
December 31, 2015  
Equity Market Overview  After experiencing heightened
volatility in late 2015, the S&P 500 Index recorded a 1.39% gain.  Events that affected market performance during the year included the ongoing Greek
fiscal crisis, low energy prices, a strong US dollar, slowing growth in China, and the timing of the Federal Reserve Banks (Fed) interest rate hike. 
Stocks stumbled early in the year over concerns about US economic growth, but rebounded in the second quarter on more upbeat forecasts, reaching highs in May. More
uncertainty hit the market as oil prices continued lower. However, domestic equities advanced cautiously on earnings reports and news of moderate growth in the US economy on encouraging employment numbers. 
In late August, in order to pre-empt an expected rate hike by the Fed in September, China surprised global markets by devaluing its currency, the yuan,
in order to shield its flagging exports against a more expensive dollar. Subsequently, Chinese stocks plunged and weighed on virtually all equity markets. US equities experienced a correction and rebounded in October. 
Jitters over the timing of the Feds first interest rate rise in nearly a decade loomed over equity markets until mid December, as the Fed hiked rates by
0.25%. Markets rose immediately after the news, but then hit more turbulence through the end of the year on concerns over economic conditions in China. 
Sector performance was mixed, with five in positive territory and five falling into negative territory. Consumer discretionary topped all sectors with a 10.11%
increase on powerful gains in the Internet, retail, and catalogue, and strong gains in the hotels, restaurants, and leisure industry. Health care posted a solid 6.89% gain for the year with help from the life sciences, tools, and services
industries, and from gains in health care providers and services industries. Consumer staples rose by 6.60%, driven by the tobacco, food products, and personal products industries. Internet technology, with high returns in internet software and
services, propelled the sector to a 5.92% gain. Telecommunications, hit by weakness in the diversified telecommunication industry, landed a 3.40% return. 
On the downside, financials fell slightly, returning -1.53%, hurt by heavy losses in consumer finance and capital markets, while real estate showed positive
returns. Industrials returned -2.53% on significant declines in road and rail products, trading companies, and distributors. Utilities returned -4.85% on severe weakness in independent power generators, while gas utilities were strong. Materials
returned -8.38% on sharp declines in mining and metals. Price destruction in oil drove energy down to a return of -21.12%.  The
Russell US Indexes, which measure equity performance with respect to stock-specific styles (value and growth) and capitalization levels (small-, mid-, and large-cap), were mixed, as growth style stocks generally outpaced value style. Small-cap
stocks, as measured by the Russell 2000® Index, fell -4.41%. The Russell Midcap® Index returned -2.44%. In large-cap stocks, the Russell 1000® Value Index fell, returning -3.83% against the positive 5.67% return of the Russell 1000® Growth Index.  The Morgan Stanley Capital International Europe
Australasia and Far East Index (MSCI-EAFE), which measures the performance of developed markets excluding the United States and Canada, returned -0.81%, net of dividends, for the year.  International equities were pressured by geopolitical events, falling commodity prices, ongoing economic weakness in Europe, and a sustained manufacturing decline in China. European countries posted mixed
performance, with heavily weighted countries struggling. Germany returned -1.89%, and France was marginally in the red with a -0.11% return. Oil producer Norway tumbled to a return of -14.99%. Stocks in the UK skidded to a -7.56% return. On the upside, Denmark led all countries, returning 23.43%.  In
Asia, stocks were mixed on falling commodity prices and uncertainty over Chinas weakening economic health. Japan returned 9.57% on higher corporate profits but a weaker economy. Countries with close links to China declined. Hong Kong returned
-0.54% and Singapore stumbled, returning -17.71%. Commodity producer Australia returned -9.95% and New Zealand fell by -6.26%.  The MSCI Emerging Markets
Index returned -14.92%. The Brazil, Russia, India, and China (BRIC) group returned -13.46%. Brazil, which is mired in a deep recession, plunged to a -41.37% return. Russia gained 4.21%. India returned -6.12% and China, hit by rollercoaster volatility, returned -7.82%.

$10,000 INVESTED OVER 10 YEARS 
  

 
For the year ended December 31, 2015, the Prudential Variable Contract Account-2 returned -1.14%. 
The net assets of the Portfolio at December 31, 2015 were $243.0 million.  The Accounts investment objective is long-term growth of capital. It is subadvised by Jennison Associates LLC (Jennison).  What were market conditions during the reporting period?  Weak energy prices, a strong US dollar, and slowing
economic growth in China were key influences on the global economic landscape in 2015. Overall it was an environment with volatility in global financial markets, sluggish economic expansion, and below-average market earnings growth. Merger and
acquisition activity continued at a torrid pace, and 2015 was set to challenge records for the number and size of transactions announced.  In 2015,
large-cap value stocks trailed large-cap growth stocks by the widest margin since 2009 and the seventh time in 10 years that the asset class has lagged. 
What strategies or holdings affected the Accounts performance?  While the S&P 500 Index (the Index) returned 1.39%, there was significant performance disparity across sectors and capitalizations. Consumer discretionary posted the largest gain and health care, consumer
staples, telecommunications services, and information technology also advanced. Energy and materials suffered the largest declines.  The Account
meaningfully trailed the Index. Stock selection in industrials, financials, information technology, and consumer discretionary proved detrimental to relative results. SLM and Navient were laggards in financials and the overall Account. Negative
sentiment weighed on shares of SLM. Jennison believes that the business model remains strong and, at the current valuation, the reward to risk is very attractive. The Account no longer holds a position in Navient. 
Marathon Oil and Hertz were other notable detractors. Marathon was hurt along with other exploration and production companies amid plummeting oil prices. Prudential
Investments continues to like the companys healthy balance sheet and improving resource base, while finding it attractively valued relative to peers. Hertz Global Holdings suffered from a number of operational challenges. Jennison believes the
low-expectations profile of the company fits its contrarian thinking, especially given the multiple options that Hertz has to improve business performance and free cash flow generation.
Key contributors were diverse and found across sectors. Prudential Investments continues to like Alphabets (formerly Google) solid competitive position,
strong advertising revenue, and YouTube income-generating opportunities. Revenue continued to grow strongly, margins improved, and capital expenditure growth slowed. In health care, Cigna continued to benefit from increasing enrollments and global
expansion plans. Jennison likes the companys consistent growth and finds its valuation attractive. In consumer discretionary, Carnival continues to benefit from better pricing control and expansion into China. In information technology,
Jennison believes Microsoft has renewed potential to increase earnings. The company has a firmly installed base, strong account control, and minimal competition in two primary areas that are shifting to a subscription profile  Office and
Windows.  While the Accounts holdings trailed the Index, the materials sector was a source of relative gain due to an underweight stance.
   The S&P 500 Index is an unmanaged, market value-weighted index of over
500 stocks generally representative of the broad stock market. Investors cannot invest directly in an index. For a complete list of holdings, refer to the Statement of Net Assets section of this report.

Calculated by accumulating the actual per unit amounts daily. 


**
Total return does not consider the effects of sales loads. Total return is calculated assuming a purchase of a share on the first day and a sale on the last day of each year
reported. Total returns may reflect adjustments to conform to generally accepted accounting principles. 


***
These calculations exclude PICAs equity in VCA-2.  The above
table does not reflect the annual administration charge, which does not affect the Accumulation Unit Value. This charge is made by reducing Participants Accumulation Accounts by a number of Accumulation Units equal in value to the charge.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF 
VCA-2   


Note 1:
 
General  The Prudential Variable Contract
Account-2 (VCA-2 or the Account) was established on January 9, 1968 by The Prudential Insurance Company of America (PICA) under the laws of the State of New Jersey and is registered as an open-end, diversified management investment
company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (1940 Act), as amended. VCA-2 has been designed for use by public school systems and certain tax-exempt organizations to provide for the purchase and payment of tax-deferred variable
annuities. The investment objective of the Account is long-term growth of capital. Its investments are composed primarily of common stocks. Although variable annuity payments differ according to the investment performance of the Account, they are
not affected by mortality or expense experience because PICA assumes the expense risk and the mortality risk under the contracts.   


Note 2:
 
Accounting Policies  The Account follows
investment company accounting and reporting guidance of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standard Codification Topic 946 Financial Services-Investment Companies. The following accounting policies conform to U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles. The Account consistently follows such policies in the preparation of its financial statements. 
Security Valuation:    The Account holds securities and other assets that are fair valued at the close of each day the
New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) is open for trading. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The
Accounts Committee Members (the Committee) has adopted Valuation Procedures for security valuation under which fair valuation responsibilities have been delegated to Prudential Investments LLC (PI or
Manager). Under the current Valuation Procedures, the established Valuation Committee is responsible for supervising the valuation of portfolio securities and other assets. The Valuation Procedures permit the Account to utilize
independent pricing vendor services, quotations from market makers, and alternative valuation methods when market quotations are either not readily available or not deemed representative of fair value. A record of the Valuation Committees
actions is subject to the Committees review, approval, and ratification at its next regularly-scheduled quarterly meeting.  Various
inputs determine how the Accounts investments are valued, all of which are categorized according to the three broad levels (Level 1, 2, or 3) detailed in the table following the Accounts Schedule of Investments. 
Common and preferred stocks, exchange-traded funds, and derivative instruments, such as futures or options, that are traded on a national securities
exchange are valued at the last sale price as of the close of trading on the applicable exchange where the security principally trades. Securities traded via NASDAQ are valued at the NASDAQ official closing price. To the extent these securities are
valued at the last sale price or NASDAQ official closing price, they are classified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy.  In the event
that no sale or official closing price on valuation date exists, these securities are generally valued at the mean between the last reported bid and asked prices, or at the last bid price in the absence of an ask price. These securities are
classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy, as the inputs are observable.  Common and preferred stocks traded on foreign
securities exchanges are valued using pricing vendor services that provide model prices derived using adjustment factors based on information such as local closing price, relevant general and sector indices, currency fluctuations, depositary
receipts, and futures, as applicable. Securities valued using such model prices are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy, as the adjustment factors are observable. Such securities are valued using model prices to the extent that the
valuation meets the established confidence level for each security. If the confidence level is not met or the vendor does not provide a model price, securities are valued in accordance with exchange-traded common and preferred stocks discussed
above.  Investments in open-end, non-exchange-traded mutual funds are valued at their net asset values as of the close of the NYSE on the
date of valuation. These securities are classified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy since they may be purchased or sold at their net asset values on the date of valuation. 
  C1 


Fixed income securities traded in the over-the-counter (OTC) market are generally valued
at prices provided by approved independent pricing vendors. The pricing vendors provide these prices after evaluating observable inputs including, but not limited to yield curves, yield spreads, credit ratings, deal terms, tranche level attributes,
default rates, cash flows, prepayment speeds, broker/dealer quotations, and reported trades. Securities valued using such vendor prices are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. 
OTC derivative instruments are generally valued using pricing vendor services, which derive the valuation based on inputs such as underlying asset
prices, indices, spreads, interest rates, and exchange rates. These instruments are categorized as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. 
Account Securities and other assets that cannot be priced according to the methods described above are valued based on pricing methodologies
approved by the Committee. In the event that unobservable inputs are used when determining such valuations, the securities will be classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. 
When determining the fair value of securities, some of the factors influencing the valuation include: the nature of any restrictions on disposition
of the securities; assessment of the general liquidity of the securities; the issuers financial condition and the markets in which it does business; the cost of the investment; the size of the holding and the capitalization of the issuer; the
prices of any recent transactions or bids/offers for such securities or any comparable securities; any available analyst media or other reports or information deemed reliable by the investment adviser regarding the issuer or the markets or industry
in which it operates. Using fair value to price securities may result in a value that is different from a securitys most recent closing price and from the price used by other mutual funds to calculate their net asset values. 
Rights:    The Account may hold rights acquired either through a direct purchase, including as part of private placement,
or pursuant to corporate actions. Rights entitle the holder to buy a proportionate amount of common stock at a specific price and time through the expiration dates. Such rights are held as long positions by the Account until exercised, sold or
expired. Rights are valued at fair value in accordance with the Committee Members approved fair valuation procedures. 
Restricted and Illiquid Securities:    The Account may hold up to 15% of its net assets in illiquid securities, including
those that are restricted as to disposition under securities law (restricted securities). Restricted securities, sometimes referred to as private placements are valued pursuant to the valuation procedures noted above. 
Securities Transactions and Net Investment Income:    Securities transactions are recorded on the trade date. Realized
gains or losses from investment and currency transactions are calculated on the identified cost basis. Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date. Interest income, including amortization of premium and accretion of discount on debt
securities, as required, is recorded on the accrual basis. Expenses are recorded on the accrual basis, which may require the use of certain estimates by management that may differ from actual. Income and realized and unrealized gains and losses are
allocated to the Participants and PICA on a daily basis in proportion to their respective ownership in VCA-2. 
Estimates:    The preparation of the financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  Federal
Income Taxes:    The operations of VCA-2 are part of, and are taxed with, the operations of PICA. Under the current provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, PICA does not expect to incur federal income taxes on earnings of
VCA-2 to the extent the earnings are credited under the Contracts. As a result, the Unit Value of VCA-2 has not been reduced by federal income taxes.  Annuity Reserves:    Reserves are computed for purchased annuities using the Prudential 1950 Group Annuity Valuation (GAV) Table, adjusted, and a valuation interest rate related to the
Assumed Investment Result (AIR). The valuation interest rate is equal to the AIR less 0.50% in contract charges defined in Note 3. The AIRs are selected by each Contract-holder and are described in the prospectus. 
 


Note 3:
 
Investment Management Agreement and Charges 
The Account has a management agreement with PI. Pursuant to this agreement, PI has responsibility for all investment advisory services and
supervises the subadvisers performance of such services. PI has entered into a subadvisory agreement with Jennison Associates LLC (Jennison). The subadvisory agreement 
  C2 



provides that Jennison will furnish investment advisory services in connection with management of the Account. PI pays for the services of Jennison. 
A daily charge, at an effective annual rate of 0.125% of the current value of the Participants (other than Annuitants and PICAs)
equity in VCA-2, is charged to the Account and paid to PI for investment management services. An equivalent charge is deducted monthly in determining the amount of Annuitants payments. 
A daily charge, paid to PI for assuming mortality and expense risks, is calculated at an effective annual rate of 0.375% of the current value of the
Participants (other than Annuitants and PICAs) equity in VCA-2. A one-time equivalent charge is deducted when the Annuity Units for Annuitants are determined.  PICA, PI and Jennison are indirect, wholly-owned subsidiaries of Prudential Financial, Inc. (Prudential).  An annual administration charge of not more than $30 annually is deducted from the accumulation account of certain Participants either at the time of withdrawal of the value of the entire Participants account
or at the end of the fiscal year by canceling Accumulation Units. This deduction may be made from a fixed-dollar annuity contract if the Participant is enrolled under such a contract. 
A charge of 2.5% for sales and other marketing expenses is deducted from certain Participants purchase payments. For the year ended December
31, 2015, PICA has advised the Account it has not received any sales charges.   


Note 4:
 
Other Transactions with Affiliates  The
Account may enter into certain securities purchase or sale transactions under Board approved Rule 17a-7 procedures. Rule 17a-7 is an exemptive rule under the 1940 Act, that permits purchase and sale transactions among affiliated investment
companies, or between an investment company and a person that is affiliated solely by reason of having a common (or affiliated) investment adviser, common directors, and/or common officers. Such transactions are subject to ratification by the Board.
 During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Account invested in the Prudential Core Taxable Money Market Fund (the Core
Fund), a portfolio of the Prudential Investment Portfolios 2, registered under the 1940 Act, and managed by PI. Earnings from the Core Fund are disclosed on the Statement of Operations as affiliated dividend income. 
 


Note 5:
 
Purchases and Sales of Portfolio Securities 
For the year ended December 31, 2015, the aggregate cost of purchases and the proceeds from sales of securities, excluding short-term investments,
were $124,398,528 and $156,359,562, respectively.   


Note 6:
 
Unit Transactions  The number of Accumulation
Units issued and redeemed for the year ended December 31, 2015 and the year ended December 31, 2014, respectively, are as follows:

Note 7:
 
Net Increase (Decrease) In Net Assets Resulting From Surplus Transfers  The increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from surplus transfers represents the net increases to/(reductions from) PICAs investment Account. The increase (decrease) includes reserve adjustments for
mortality and expense risks assumed by PICA.   


Note 8:
 
Participant Loans  Participant loan
initiations are not permitted in VCA-2. However, participants who initiated loans in other accounts are permitted to direct loan repayments into VCA-2. 
  C3 


For the year ended December 31, 2015 and year ended December 31, 2014, $2,119 and $2,166 of
participant loan principal and interest have been paid to VCA-2, respectively. The participant loan principal and interest repayments are included in purchase payments and transfers in within the Statement of Changes in Net Assets. 
 


Note 9:
 
New Accounting Pronouncements  In January
2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01 regarding Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. The new guidance is intended to enhance the reporting model for financial instruments to provide users of
financial statements with more decision-useful information and addresses certain aspects of the recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. The new standard affects all entities that hold financial assets or owe
financial liabilities. The new guidance is effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. At this time, management is evaluating the implications of ASU No.
2016-01 and its impact on the financial statements and disclosures has not yet been determined.  In May 2015, the FASB issued ASU No.
2015-07 regarding Disclosures for Investments in Certain Entities That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share. The amendments in this update are effective for the Account for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim
periods within those fiscal years. ASU No. 2015-07 will eliminate the requirement to categorize investments in the fair value hierarchy if their fair value is measured at net asset value
(NAV) per share (or its equivalent) using the practical expedient in the FASBs fair value measurement guidance. Management has evaluated the implications of ASU No. 2015-07 and has determined that there is no impact on the
financial statement disclosures.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
THE COMMITTEE AND PARTICIPANTS OF  THE PRUDENTIAL VARIABLE CONTRACT
ACCOUNT-2:  We have audited the accompanying statement of net assets of The Prudential Variable Contract Account-2 (hereafter referred to as the
Account) as of December 31, 2015, and the related statement of operations for the year then ended, the statements of changes in net assets for each of the years in the two-year period then ended, and the financial highlights for each of
the years in the five-year period then ended. These financial statements and financial highlights are the responsibility of the Accounts management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial
highlights based on our audits.  We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our procedures included confirmation of securities owned as of December 31, 2015, by correspondence with the custodian and brokers or by other appropriate auditing
procedures where replies from brokers were not received. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.  In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Account as of December 31, 2015, the results of its operations, the changes in its net assets and the financial highlights for the years or periods described in the first paragraph
above, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

AUDIT COMMITTEE POLICY 
on 


Pre-Approval of Services Provided by the Independent Accountants 
The Audit Committee of each Prudential Mutual Fund is charged with the responsibility to monitor the independence of the Funds
independent accountants. As part of this responsibility, the Audit Committee must pre-approve any independent accounting firms engagement to render audit and/or permissible non-audit services, as required by law. In evaluating a
proposed engagement of the independent accountants, the Audit Committee will assess the effect that the engagement might reasonably be expected to have on the accountants independence. The Committees evaluation will be based on: 
 


 
●
 
 a review of the nature of the professional services expected to be provided, 
 


 
●
 
 a review of the safeguards put into place by the accounting firm to safeguard independence, and 
 


 
●
 
 periodic meetings with the accounting firm. 
Policy for Audit and Non-Audit Services Provided to the Funds 
On an annual basis, the scope of audits for each Fund, audit fees and expenses, and audit-related and non-audit services (and fees proposed in
respect thereof) proposed to be performed by the Funds independent accountants will be presented by the Treasurer and the independent accountants to the Audit Committee for review and, as appropriate, approval prior to the initiation of such
services. Such presentation shall be accompanied by confirmation by both the Treasurer and the independent accountants that the proposed services will not adversely affect the independence of the independent accountants. Proposed services shall be
described in sufficient detail to enable the Audit Committee to assess the appropriateness of such services and fees, and the compatibility of the provision of such services with the auditors independence. The Committee shall receive periodic
reports on the progress of the audit and other services which are approved by the Committee or by the Committee Chair pursuant to authority delegated in this Policy. 
The categories of services enumerated under Audit Services, Audit-related Services, and Tax Services are
intended to provide guidance to the Treasurer and the independent accountants as to those categories of services which the Committee believes are generally consistent with the independence of the independent accountants and which the Committee (or
the Committee Chair) would expect upon the presentation of specific proposals to pre-approve. The enumerated categories are not intended as an exclusive list of audit, audit-related or tax services, which the Committee (or the Committee Chair) would
consider for pre-approval.  Audit Services

Individual audit-related services that fall within one of these categories and are not presented to the Audit Committee as part of the annual
pre-approval process will be subject to pre-approval by the Committee Chair (or any other Committee member on whom this responsibility has been delegated) so long as the estimated fee for those services does not exceed $30,000.

pre-approval process will be subject to pre-approval by the Committee Chair (or any other Committee member on whom this responsibility has been delegated) so long as the estimated fee for those services does not exceed $30,000. 
Other Non-audit Services  Certain
non-audit services that the independent accountants are legally permitted to render will be subject to pre-approval by the Committee or by one or more Committee members to whom the Committee has delegated this
authority and who will report to the full Committee any pre-approval decisions made pursuant to this Policy. Non-audit services presented for pre-approval pursuant to this paragraph will be accompanied by a confirmation from both the Treasurer and
the independent accountants that the proposed services will not adversely affect the independence of the independent accountants.

Pre-approval of Non-Audit Services Provided to Other Entities Within the Prudential Fund Complex 
Certain non-audit services provided to Prudential Investments LLC or any of its affiliates that also provide ongoing services to the
Prudential Mutual Funds will be subject to pre-approval by the Audit Committee. The only non-audit services provided to these entities that will require pre-approval are those related directly to the
operations and financial reporting of the Funds. Individual projects that are not presented to the Audit Committee as part of the annual pre-approval process will be subject to pre-approval by the Committee Chair (or any other Committee member
on whom this responsibility has been delegated) so long as the estimated fee for those services does not exceed $30,000. Services presented for pre-approval pursuant to this paragraph will be accompanied by a confirmation from both the Treasurer and
the independent accountants that the proposed services will not adversely affect the independence of the independent accountants. 
Although the Audit Committee will not pre-approve all services provided to Prudential Investments LLC and its affiliates, the Committee will
receive an annual report from the Funds independent accounting firm showing the aggregate fees for all services provided to Prudential Investments and its affiliates.

Back to topProduct Agreement BasicsBuying and selling are the basis of business, but in the rush to complete a transaction, it's sometimes easy to skip the details. Writing up a solid Product Agreement may actually save you money down the road. It's smart to get a written quote up front. In a Product Agreement, you can describe the items in detail and include quality standards that the seller must meet. You can specify when and where your items will be delivered. What happens if the goods don't arrive, or come late? Or what if you don't get paid for the products? Or if the price suddenly changes? You might not realize you don't have anything beyond a verbal agreement until it's too late. Customers might be counting on you having products on a certain date. You might have even accepted backorders. Or maybe you run a small business and getting paid on time means your mortgage gets paid. A Product Agreement can help keep you in the clear.

Back to topPromissory Note with Installment Payments BasicsLoans can be structured in a number of ways, but a Promissory Note with Installment Payments helps keep things easy. Whether you're the lender or the borrower, you know exactly what each payment will be. Interest rates are easily calculated and all the terms and obligations are clearly spelled out. The exact same payments will be made until the loan is repaid, and the payment schedule is laid out. Loans don't have to be complicated, if you'd prefer to keep things simple then installments can be a great choice. As a lender, how your loans are designed is up to you, but it's still a good idea to have the details in writing. Using a Promissory Note with Installment Payments is one way to keep the loan process simple.
