Points Buy, Gift and Transfer | Points
























































						Buy, Gift & Transfer
					

						Sell your loyalty currency directly to your members
					








						Create engaged customers and increase revenue in your own loyalty program with Points’ core products: Buy, Gift and Transfer. Points Buy and Gift lets your members buy points or miles for themselves that are deposited into their accounts, or as gifts for others deposited via email codes. Points Transfer enables a member within your program to transfer currency out of his or her own account and into that of another member.
					






						How it Works
					

						Individual loyalty programs, merchants or any other consumer service applications can implement Buy, Gift and Transfer functionality by plugging into our Loyalty Commerce Platform’s BGT-specific APIs.
					

						BGT products also include features to help grow and optimize the funnel, such as:
					

Inline, which allows customers to buy extra points/miles during the online travel-booking process
Call Centre, which enables call centre agents to sell points/miles to customers by phone
Fast Track, which allows members to skip the login page and go directly to the BGT storefront with their member details pre-populated
Distributed offers, which enables our partners to distribute personalized member offers to channels outside the BGT storefront, such as their homepage, their loyalty wallet etc
Personalized offers, which enables our partners to hyper-target offers for their members based on member validation   and single sign on data




Benefits
Cost-effective

						Your members pay per point or mile purchased. Points is responsible for all processing fees, and you incur no operation costs. Our quick implementation process gets you up and running, with minimal effort from your IT team, so you can remain focused on your core business.
					
Best-in-class security

						We offer proven fraud management procedures to protect our partners. This includes best-in-class security, market-leading fraud prevention, SOX and Level 1 PCI compliance.
					
Significant revenue

						Buy, Gift and Transfer generates a total of more than $400 million in revenue for our loyalty program partners each year. We’ll support your program and help it succeed with our full-service marketing plans, best-practice operations and campaign analysis.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
