About TruXedo
Since the introduction of the Original TruXedo in 2000, TruXedo, Inc., has led the industry with new and innovative truck bed cover concepts that emphasize style, quality, durability, and functionality. The entire TruXedo family shares your passion for automotive customization and we will continue to expand and diversify our product line to meet your needs.
In 2014, we launched Titanium. This hard rolling truck bed cover offers the full bed access that TruXedo is known for, along with the extra security that some consumers look for in a truck bed cover. Aluminum slats are bonded to UV-resistant, industrial-quality, leather-grain fabric to create a unique cover that combines superior strength with our signature low-profile look.
In 2017, we are thrilled to launch a brand new, premium soft roll-up cover called Pro X15. We took the best qualities from our number one selling cover, the Lo Pro, and mixed in amazing new features such as a Xtra-low profile design and superior-grade matte black fabric. There is no doubt that this is the best looking truck bed cover we’ve ever made.
The Lo Pro soft rolling truck bed cover continues to be North America’s #1 selling truck bed cover, providing the ultimate in style and functionality.
At TruXedo, we remain committed to providing the highest quality engineered products, shortest lead times, world-class customer service and best warranties in the industry. Your satisfaction is our ultimate goal!
TruXedo is part of the Truck Hero family of brands
Sincerely,
The TruXedo Family

From humble beginnings, Truck Hero has rapidly grown in the past few years to include manufacturers such as BAK Industries, UnderCover, N-Fab, BedRug, Retrax, TruXedo, and more. Truck Hero's commitment to innovation, exceptional engineering, and state-of-the-art American manufacturing is evident in every product. Whether you're looking for a tonneau cover, running boards, or even a premium bed liner for your truck, your pickup truck deserves the best accessories made in the USA – Truck Hero accessories.

About
We at RealTruck are proud to offer Truck Hero accessories. And, we know you will be happy you chose this brand too. They put the smackdown on how a customized truck should be. Everything from Truck Hero truck bed covers to nerf bars and running boards, each accessory has been tested, purchased, and loved by many. If you look into the products it’s easy to see the attention to detail and customer ease of use each accessory has in mind, which is something not widely found. You’ll also get great value and free shipping with any purchase.
History
Based in Ann Arbor, Michigan, Truck Hero has an umbrella of select accessories and manufacturers. While this company didn’t happen overnight, they have been a thoughtful and fast growing since its inception in 2007. Since then they’ve carefully added a number of brands. These include BAK, BedRug, Extang, N-Fab, Retrax, Advantage Truck Accessories, TruXedo, and UnderCover. Why these brands? Answer: They make accessories with superior functionality, impressive durability, and really, really ridiculously good looking style.
But, what’s even better is Truck Hero’s dedication to products that are made in the USA. From the beginning, Truck Hero (formally THI) has made sure that 100% of these accessories are American made. This means that all design work, manufacturing, and marketing is done in the good ol’ United States of America. We love this and hope you do to0 as it means people like our friends and neighbors - real people who understand our expectations - have built these accessories to last for life.
More
If you have any doubts, let us put your mind at ease. Part of the beauty of any Truck Hero accessory is they are easy to install. With the ability to read a manual and maybe a cup of coffee to keep you going, installation is pretty straight forward. When in doubt, you can either give us a call or check out our product videos on YouTube!

We estimate that the net proceeds to us from the sale of 5,555,556 shares of
common stock in this offering will be approximately $88.0 million based upon an
assumed initial public offering price of $18.00 per share, the midpoint of the
estimated price range set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, and after
deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated
offering expenses payable by us (excluding $1.7 million of offering expenses
paid by us prior to September 30, 2015).

We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock by
the selling stockholders.

A $1.00 increase (decrease) in the assumed initial public offering price of
$18.00 per share would increase (decrease) the net proceeds to us from this
offering by approximately $5.2 million, assuming the number of shares offered by
us, as set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, remains the same and
after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated
offering expenses payable by us (excluding $1.7 million of offering expenses
paid by us prior to September 30, 2015). Similarly, each increase (decrease) of
one million shares offered by us would increase (decrease) the net proceeds to
us from this offering by approximately $16.7 million, assuming the assumed
initial public offering price remains the same and after deducting estimated
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable
by us (excluding $1.7 million of offering expenses paid by us prior to
September 30, 2015).

The principal purposes of this offering are to increase our financial
flexibility, create a public market for our common stock and facilitate our
future access to the public equity markets.

We intend to use approximately $57.0 million of the net proceeds that we receive
from this offering to repay all of the indebtedness outstanding under our Second
Lien Credit Facility, including accrued interest, applicable prepayment premium
payments and related costs and expenses. We intend to use approximately
$3.0 million of the net proceeds that we receive from this offering to repay a
portion of the indebtedness outstanding under the revolving credit facility
under our First Lien Credit Facility.

Our First Lien Credit Facility matures on July 28, 2020. Loans under the
revolving credit facility of our First Lien Credit Facility bear interest at
(i) LIBOR plus 3.0% or (ii) the prime rate plus 4.0%, with a LIBOR rate floor of
1.00% and a prime rate floor of 1-month LIBOR plus 1.00%. Loans under the term
loan facility of our First Lien Credit Facility bear interest at (i) LIBOR plus
5.5% or (ii) the prime rate plus 4.5%, with a LIBOR rate floor of 1.00%. On
April 24, 2015, we amended our First Lien Credit Facility to increase our
borrowings under that facility by $38.0 million and we used the net proceeds
from those additional borrowings in connection with the 2015 Acquisitions. Our
Second Lien Credit Facility matures on January 28, 2021. Loans under the Second
Lien Credit Facility bear interest, at our option, at (i) LIBOR plus 8.75% or
(ii) the prime rate plus 7.75%, with a LIBOR rate floor of 1.00% and a prime
rate floor of 1-month LIBOR plus 1.00%.

We currently intend to use $28 million of net proceeds that we receive from this
offering to pay the applicable cash consideration in connection with our
acquisition of N-FAB. We currently intend to use any remaining net proceeds that
we receive from this offering for working capital and other general corporate
purposes. We may also use a portion of the net proceeds for future acquisitions
or investments, however we have not entered into any agreements or commitments
with respect to any acquisitions or investments at this time, other than our
planned acquisition of N-FAB.

Our expected use of net proceeds from this offering represents our current
intentions based upon our present plans and business condition. Pending the use
of proceeds from this offering as described above, we plan to invest the net
proceeds that we receive in this offering in short-term and intermediate-term
interest-bearing obligations, investment-grade investments, certificates of
deposit, or direct or guaranteed obligations of the U.S. government.


The markets for our products are highly competitive. We compete with other
companies that manufacture and retail accessory and appearance products. While
the pricing of competing products is a factor, we believe competition in the
accessory and appearance products market is principally based on product
functionality and design, brand recognition, delivery lead times, quality and
warranty. The ability to innovate products and features is a key point of
differentiation among top competitors. Original equipment automotive suppliers
have not historically competed in these product types.

Within the market for truck bed covers, our main competitors include The Truck
Accessories Group, LLC (under the brands Leer, Century, Pace Edwards and
Raider), Roll-N-Lock Corporation, SnugTop, Agri-Cover, Inc. (under the brand
Access), Bridgeway Enterprises, Inc. (under the TonnoPro brand), Lund
International, Inc., Bestop, Inc. Truck Covers USA and American Tonneau Company.
Within the market for truck caps, our main competitors include The Truck
Accessories Group, LLC (under the brands Leer, Century and Raider) and SnugTop.
To our knowledge, we are the only manufacturer of carpeted bed liners in North
America. Within the market for molded plastic or spray-on liners, the main
competitors include Sports Resorts International (under the Rugged Liner brand),
Rhino Linings Corporation, Advanced Protective Coatings, Inc. (under the Line-X
brand), Industrial Polymers Corporation (under the Speedliner brand), DualLiner,
LLC, Pendaform Company (under the Pendaliner brand) and Old World Industries,
LLC (under the Herculiner brand).

The online retail channel for sales of pickup truck accessories is highly
fragmented. Our RealTruck and Auto Customs subsidiaries compete primarily with a
fragmented set of small specialty online truck accessory retailers, generalist
auto parts retailers with online offerings including AutoZone, Inc. (through its
AutoAnything subsidiary), U.S. Auto Parts Network, Inc., Advance Auto Parts,
Inc., The Pep Boys and National Automotive Parts Association (also known as
“NAPA”) and large ecommerce retailers such as Amazon.com, Inc. and eBay, Inc.


Company Description
We are a fast-growing designer, manufacturer and marketer of branded consumer
accessories for pickup trucks. The pickup truck market is large and expanding,
driven in part by evolving pickup designs that have increased functionality and
versatility, making trucks more suitable as family and


 lifestyle vehicles. Our
products include accessories manufactured by us that we sell through multiple
channels, primarily truck bed covers, truck caps and bed liners, as well as a
broad range of third-party branded vehicle accessories that we sell online,
including floor mats, grill guards, steps, tool boxes and towing products. Our
primary products, truck bed covers and truck caps, enclose the beds of pickup
trucks, providing for cargo security and weather protection as well as aesthetic
enhancement, while bed liners protect truck beds and cargo from damage. Our
products enhance the functionality and aesthetics of pickup trucks and enable
consumers to customize and personalize their vehicles. Our portfolio of owned
brands, complemented by the online sales of third-party branded products, makes
us one of the leaders by sales in the pickup truck accessory market.

We are the top manufacturer of truck bed covers in North America. We are also
one of the top manufacturers of truck caps, including fiberglass and aluminum
offerings, and the largest manufacturer in North America of carpeted bed liners,
a premium alternative to molded plastic or spray-on liners. We market our
manufactured accessories under eight primary brands that offer over 85 product
styles compatible with over 9,000 unique vehicle configurations. We have
developed products for nearly every make and model of pickup truck that has been
manufactured for the North American market in the last 40 years. In addition to
products that we manufacture, we also sell third-party branded products directly
to consumers online, including over 95,000 SKUs across over 200 brands. We
believe our expanded product offering and our innovation are contributing to
increasing penetration of our accessories among pickup truck owners.

In 2014, there were approximately 50 million registered pickup trucks in North
America, where over 97% of our net sales were generated. We reach pickup truck
owners through a variety of channels including specialty installers, online
retailers and pickup truck dealerships. To support our marketing efforts, we
advertise through traditional and online media and maintain a highly-skilled
salesforce to promote our brands and products across our distribution channels.
We believe the development of our distribution channels, our expanded product
offering and our sales and marketing efforts have contributed to increased
penetration of our accessories on pickup trucks. Sterling Associates Group
reported that penetration of truck bed covers on the installed base of existing
trucks was approximately 20-25% in 2014. With only 20-25% penetration of the
50 million trucks on the road, we believe there is a significant opportunity for
continued growth of the truck bed cover market.
