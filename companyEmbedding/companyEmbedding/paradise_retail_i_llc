What business type is right for you?
When you're starting a new business, you want to determine the business structure that's right for you. What's the difference between a limited liability company (LLC) and a corporation (Inc.)? And how is a C corporation different from an S corporation? Use these charts to help decide what business type is best for your needs.








LLC vs. Corporation






Limited Liability Company (LLC)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my LLCCorporation (Inc)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my Corporation







What is an S corporation?
After you create a corporation or LLC, you also have the opportunity to decide how you'd like your business to be taxed.Single owner LLCs can be taxed either as a sole proprietorship or a corporation.  LLCs with more than one owner can be taxed either as a partnership or a corporation.  Income from LLCs treated as sole proprietorships or partnerships is reported directly on the owner’s individual tax returns.New corporations, as well as LLCs considering corporate taxation can choose between filing taxes as a C corporation ("C corp") or an S corporation ("S corp"). An S corp is considered a "pass-through entity," which means the business itself isn't taxed. Instead, income is reported on the owners' personal tax returns. Businesses taxed as C corporations are not pass through entities.  Income is taxed at the corporate level, and, if dividends are distributed, at the individual level as well.We can help you understand your options so you choose what's best for your business. Talk to one of our network of attorneys today.








C-corp or S-corp 






Here's a comparison of some key characteristics of businesses that choose to be treated as C corps and S corps.C DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensS DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensYou don't have to decide about S corp status right away. You have 75 days after the formation of your business to file with the IRS. If you're still not sure what to do, you may want to consult with one of our attorneys or tax specialists.





Step-by-Step Guide on Starting Your Business













Easy as 1-2-3




1. Select the business structure that's right for you and fill out a simple questionnaire.





2. We'll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state.





3. You'll receive your completed paperwork by mail.








Ask away. We have answers.



Common questions

Can I start a business without creating a corporation or LLC?
You don't need a corporation or LLC to go into business. Many business owners are in partnerships or are sole proprietors. But both a corporation and LLC canshield you from liability and may offer tax advantages.


What are the main differences between an LLC and a sole proprietorship?
You don't need to file any paperwork with your state to create a sole proprietorship (though you may still need business permits and licenses to operate lawfully). But an LLC protects you from personal liability  - a sole proprietorship doesn't.Also, LLCs provide more flexibility as you grow your business.


What are the main differences between an LLC and an S corporation?
An LLC has more flexibility and fewer corporate formalities than an S corporation. S corporations are required to have annual meetings of shareholders and directors, while meetings of LLC member and/or managers are not required..  Also,  LLCs can provide for a flexible management structure by members or managers, while corporations require management by a Board of Directors.Learn more.


Do I need a name or DBA for my business?
You only need a DBA ("doing business as") if you are operating a sole proprietorship or partnership and you want to use a fictitious name for the business. You don't need a DBA for an LLC or a corporation unless you are using a name other than your LLC or corporate name while doing business.Learn more.


Do I need any other licenses or permits to start my business? 
Some cities, counties, and states require businesses to obtain licenses and permits to operate lawfully. We can help you figure out what you need. Learn More.

Compare Business Structures – LLC vs. Corporation, S Corporation and C Corporation 

		 You’ve decided to start a business, but you’re not sure where to begin. You don’t know if you should form an LLC or corporation, and need guidance to help you choose the right business structure. Each business structure has its advantages and disadvantages that are important to understand because choosing the wrong business entity could result in legal and tax implications down the road. The information above will allow you to compare LLC vs. corporation, and learn the difference between an S corporation and C corporation. LLCs and corporations both offer personal liability protection, but the most significant difference between LLC and corporation is that corporations are preferred by outside investors. When comparing LLC vs S corp, there are a few important differences to be aware of which are outlined above. Once you determine which business structure you need, you can start a business with LegalZoom in just three easy steps. The process begins by filling out a simple questionnaire. We’ll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state, and you’ll receive your completed paperwork by mail. If you need help deciding which business structure is right for you, a LegalZoom legal plan attorney can explain how each business entity works and help you decide.

Should you file a  DBA as a  sole owner, form an LLC, or Incorporate? In general, if you are one person,  and have a lot of personal assets, incorporate or form an LLC.  You will be protected from law suits/creditors and you may  save on business taxes.   An LLC is far superior to incorporation because it protects both your business and personal assets.

Business License

What is a Business License?
Though it is called a business license, an occupational business license, a home occupation permit etc., It is a type of tax registration.  All small businesses, even home or online businesses must register for occupational business tax.  This type of tax license is different from income, sales, or employment tax.  The small business is taxed on the basis of the nature of business, its location, the number of employees and several other factors such as the gross annual receipts.  
So, for example, you are a small home business selling stuff online.  You need to get a business license.  In addition to the tax, which is usually a flat tax per year – average about $40 per year, you may have to go thru inspections to get the business license.
How Can I get a Business License?
You are issued a business license because the government regulates businesses and this is one type of regulation.  For instance, they also require you to get a resale license if you sell taxable merchandise.  The bottom line is that you need to get a business license.  Keep in mind that you cannot get one without first getting a fictitious business name registration, as is the case in Florida.

 	
Retail businesses need at least a wholesale license AKA seller permit, a business license and a DBA doing business as fictitious business name.
The retail industry includes retailers such as home repair, electronics, clothing, furniture, car parts, and food retail businesses.  There are about 20 to 30 million retail businesses in the USA. Even though less than 50%, the retail industry is a leading business startup for the U.S. economy and, together with the government sector, employs more laborers than the other sectors.   More than 30% of the GNP, though, less than $4,000,000.00 is generated thru retail sales business.  The process that the retailer uses is simple: he finds what the consumer need is and he satisfies it with better quality and less expenses than the competition.   So, you can buy merchandise from China, for instance, and sell it in the U.S. for profit. You buy an item at $1 and sell it @ $2.  A no brainer!

 HERE IS MORE DETAIL ON SETTING UP  YOUR 
retailLLC BUSINESS IN  Paradise Valley : 







✔ 1



 To start your LLC business, first, Set up an LLC which you can do here online.
 Otherwise, you will need to select a structure other than the LLC business structure. For example,
 
Selecting a business structure determines how 
  the government will tax you.  For example, an LLC has a more favorable tax treatment compared to a sole owner.
Regardless of legal structure, all businesses need a Business License and an EIN but also need to select a legal stucture choosing from Sole Propritor, 
 Partnership, LLC, or Corproration. 
...more about selecting a structure...





✔ 2



 Thus, file a DBA if you don't file an LLC.  You are required to file a DBA if you are a partneship or a sole owner and you don't form an LLC. If you form an LLC, you need an LLC Certificate if you select the LLC structure etc.
 
A DBA, LLC or Corporation Certificate is Issued by The State.   A DBA  Doing Business As is the registration
of your businesss name. (A DBA is also called a Fictitious /Assumed Business Name or Trade Name. IMPORTANT: YOU DON'T NEED TO FILE A DBA IF YOU FORM AN LLC!
Note, you can be an one member/shareholder LLC or Corp., so,  if you set up an LLC or Corp.,
you don't need to file a DBA. ...more about selecting a structure... 




✔ 3



So, all businesses need to select a legal structure, in this case an LLC, and obtain a
Business License 
and   A Federal LLC(EIN) 
(While all businesses must obtain a business license, the EIN is for  Employers, Independent Contractors, LLCs, Partnerships, and Corporations that 
 are required to obtain a federal EIN.  If you are a sole owner independent contractor or an employer, you will need an EIN or you can nevertheless obtain it
 and use it instead of your social sec #.

Finally, your LLC may need a  retail 
Seller's Permit. 
IF... IF,  you want to buy/sell/lease wholesale or sell retail as an LLC (in small amounts) items or materials, You will Need a Seller's Permit

  a federal LLC number.

LLC 



Instead of filing a fictitious business name DBA Filing (about $49 plus state and legal newspaper publication fees)  in

If you will set up a corporation or form an LLC, you will not have to file a DBA (Doing Business As) unless your corproration or LLC name will be different that the busienss name you will trade under.  

  Businesses that use the full legal name of the owner as a business name do not need to register an assumed business name.  So, for example, your name is "John X Doe" and you use that as a business name. 
    
Incorporation

✔ Incorporation

If you do form an retail  llc or incorporate  (about $49 plus state fees for most states)  your retail business instead of just filing a fictitious business name (dba), 
it will help you avoid legal and financial personal liability arising out of business transactions and you will not have to register the Paradise Valley business name.
Instead of filing a  Maricopa County fictitious business name (our service fee includes dba business name filing and legal paper publication) you can elect to incorporate in  
 AZ  or form an AZ LLC (starts @ $49 plus state fee  for most states & includes bylaws and LLC operating agreement)..

                                                      how much is a business license in tennessee? do you know what rules and regulations are for starting our own food trailer in Tennessee? 

I do but we are curious because cooking/food is our passion and we want to provide to people what we love & we wanted to know what everything we have to do it will only be my fiancé my mother in law and I working it. we either want a food truck or a food trailer For a Fragance Shop are there any USDA requirements? In order for a person to purchase more than three properties is a EIN needed. Hey I was wondering if I needed a business license to sell online like for a online boutique? 

                                                      There are about 20 to 30 million retail businesses in the USA. Even though less than 50%, the retail industry is a leading business start-up for the U.S. economy and, together with the government sector, employs more laborers than the other sectors. 
                                                        More than 30% of the GNP, though, less than $4,000,000.00 is generated through retail sales business. 

                                                      The process that the retailer uses is simple: he finds what the consumer need is and he satisfies it with better quality and less expenses than the competition.   
                                                      So, you can buy merchandise from China, for instance, and sell it in the U.S. for profit. You buy an item at $1 and sell it @ $2.  A no brainer! Though less than 2 million retail businesses, thee about 1.5 million retail stores but that does not include the online sellers like eBay, Amazon, or Etsy, sellers.

                                                        Perhaps the most popular and prominent type of retail business is the retail store, such as various retail shops on busy streets, department stores like Dillard, and other merchandise walk in stores.

                                                       However, the business retail stores such as home depot, office depot, and best buy stores are retail stores.  There are levels of stores as well.  
                                                      There can be a 99 cent store but also K-Mart, a higher type of shopping experience, and, also Gucci who caters to the rich tastes.

A wholesale business is an operation where you buy large amounts of merchandise from a manufacturer and you sell it in smaller amounts to reseller’s such as department, high-volume and specialty stores, or directly to the consuming public.  So, for example, a manufacturer in China produces t-shirts by the millions.  You enter into a deal to buy 1,000,000 t-shirts fob Long Beach Port.  You pay them and they ship it to the USA.  You pick it up and you store them in a warehouse.  You advertise and sell small or large amounts of t-shirts to retailers or individual consumers.  The term wholesale as opposed to retail means that you buy and sell large quantities usually just for resale of these merchandise.

          LLC (Limited Liability Company) FAQs: 
Q: Should I consider forming an LLC?   
A: Perhaps filing an llc may be a good idea though some start with an S corp. On the other hand, if you want to issue shares, you may want a C corporation.   If your business name is.  
deSusanwestratch , Inc.Co.    
requires a fictitious business name registration, which also requires a fee to be registered.  
Registering a fictitious business name does not protect that name nor does it protect the business owner from personal liability related to business actions as setting up a limited liability company (LLC) does.   
Our recommendation that since you need to pay a fee to register the business name, simply form a limited liability company (LLC) for a similar fee and get both corporate status and protection for the name as well as personal liabilities.   
So, for instance, if someone slips and falls in your business premises, they can sue you personally if you are not a limited liability company (LLC).  
Also, consider the prestige that a limited liability company (LLC) affords.  Is a name like John's Transmissiona shop  better than   AEMCOO TRANS, LLC? 

Q: Where should I Incorporate or set up an LLC. I.e., what state?
A: We always recommend that you file an llc in the state you conduct business. So, you can form an LLC (Limited Liabiliity Company). 
Q: How should I name my business LLC? 
A: You can brainstorm or try a google search. Find an interesting name.  If you cannot find in on google, then more than 90% it is available.
Q:  Do I need a lot of capital to form an LLC? 
A:  No, you don't need capital to start an LLC. 
Q: Do I need a lawyer to set up an LLC? If I set up an LLC, will the LLC help me protect my business LLC from creditors?
A: We can set up your llc here. You don' t need a laywer.  And yes, actually, only an LLC can help you protect the LLC from its creditors especially if you have another partner member owner in that LLC.
Q: Do I need to obtain a federal  or state LLC number before forming a limited liability company (LLC)  or getting other licenses?
A: 
Q: How do I build credit under my LLC business? 
A: Start by applying for a line of credit for your LLC from your bank if you already have some personal credit.

What capital you need to start your business?  In my opinion, very little even though some may tell you that you that in  PARADISE VALLEY business with just $7161 or $716655 that depends on your budget. Starting your business in  
PARADISE V PARADISE VALLEY MARICOPA PARADISE VALLEY, 85253 calls for some numbers: it has about 17560
residents, though  only about 7565 families in this zip code area but still enough to support your business of the state of Arizona. 
 In addition,  consider that a(n) 480 telephone area code my be desirable to increase reachability and 
and identifiability. Nevertheless, you will need a place to set up and operate your business from    
as well as  a place to reside or you can also buy a home  (about $646100 avergage value) , which 
note that you can use the house as a home based business as well. Your physical address in  PARADISE VALLEY will be 
your business address. For Instance, your business address could be 71082  PARADISE VALLEY Hwy/Blvd  or 77TH Street/Ave or 
PARADISE VALLEY,  Arizona 85253. You can use a 85253  P.O. Box address as your as 
your business mailing address. E.g. P.O Box 
69944
 PARADISE VALLEY,Arizona 85253 .
At any rate, in 9204 area you have to consider the demographics before 
 starting any type of business. Briefly, there are about 16655,  anglo saxons, 
517 latinos, and 161 Americans of African Origin in the  85253 zipcode area. Another consideration 
is targeting your prospects income level to advertise for your new business. Each family here makes
about $117487 per family and has about 2.63 persons per household. Considering weather conditions, take note
 that the elevation is 1082 feet, and you are in 7  time zone.

What business type is right for you?
When you're starting a new business, you want to determine the business structure that's right for you. What's the difference between a limited liability company (LLC) and a corporation (Inc.)? And how is a C corporation different from an S corporation? Use these charts to help decide what business type is best for your needs.








LLC vs. Corporation






Limited Liability Company (LLC)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my LLCCorporation (Inc)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my Corporation







What is an S corporation?
After you create a corporation or LLC, you also have the opportunity to decide how you'd like your business to be taxed.Single owner LLCs can be taxed either as a sole proprietorship or a corporation.  LLCs with more than one owner can be taxed either as a partnership or a corporation.  Income from LLCs treated as sole proprietorships or partnerships is reported directly on the owner’s individual tax returns.New corporations, as well as LLCs considering corporate taxation can choose between filing taxes as a C corporation ("C corp") or an S corporation ("S corp"). An S corp is considered a "pass-through entity," which means the business itself isn't taxed. Instead, income is reported on the owners' personal tax returns. Businesses taxed as C corporations are not pass through entities.  Income is taxed at the corporate level, and, if dividends are distributed, at the individual level as well.We can help you understand your options so you choose what's best for your business. Talk to one of our network of attorneys today.








C-corp or S-corp 






Here's a comparison of some key characteristics of businesses that choose to be treated as C corps and S corps.C DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensS DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensYou don't have to decide about S corp status right away. You have 75 days after the formation of your business to file with the IRS. If you're still not sure what to do, you may want to consult with one of our attorneys or tax specialists.





Step-by-Step Guide on Starting Your Business













Easy as 1-2-3




1. Select the business structure that's right for you and fill out a simple questionnaire.





2. We'll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state.





3. You'll receive your completed paperwork by mail.








Ask away. We have answers.



Common questions

Can I start a business without creating a corporation or LLC?
You don't need a corporation or LLC to go into business. Many business owners are in partnerships or are sole proprietors. But both a corporation and LLC canshield you from liability and may offer tax advantages.


What are the main differences between an LLC and a sole proprietorship?
You don't need to file any paperwork with your state to create a sole proprietorship (though you may still need business permits and licenses to operate lawfully). But an LLC protects you from personal liability  - a sole proprietorship doesn't.Also, LLCs provide more flexibility as you grow your business.


What are the main differences between an LLC and an S corporation?
An LLC has more flexibility and fewer corporate formalities than an S corporation. S corporations are required to have annual meetings of shareholders and directors, while meetings of LLC member and/or managers are not required..  Also,  LLCs can provide for a flexible management structure by members or managers, while corporations require management by a Board of Directors.Learn more.


Do I need a name or DBA for my business?
You only need a DBA ("doing business as") if you are operating a sole proprietorship or partnership and you want to use a fictitious name for the business. You don't need a DBA for an LLC or a corporation unless you are using a name other than your LLC or corporate name while doing business.Learn more.


Do I need any other licenses or permits to start my business? 
Some cities, counties, and states require businesses to obtain licenses and permits to operate lawfully. We can help you figure out what you need. Learn More.

Compare Business Structures – LLC vs. Corporation, S Corporation and C Corporation 

		 You’ve decided to start a business, but you’re not sure where to begin. You don’t know if you should form an LLC or corporation, and need guidance to help you choose the right business structure. Each business structure has its advantages and disadvantages that are important to understand because choosing the wrong business entity could result in legal and tax implications down the road. The information above will allow you to compare LLC vs. corporation, and learn the difference between an S corporation and C corporation. LLCs and corporations both offer personal liability protection, but the most significant difference between LLC and corporation is that corporations are preferred by outside investors. When comparing LLC vs S corp, there are a few important differences to be aware of which are outlined above. Once you determine which business structure you need, you can start a business with LegalZoom in just three easy steps. The process begins by filling out a simple questionnaire. We’ll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state, and you’ll receive your completed paperwork by mail. If you need help deciding which business structure is right for you, a LegalZoom legal plan attorney can explain how each business entity works and help you decide.
