design






engineering






compliance

production






logistics









ideation


We immerse ourselves in the process of understanding the real needs of the client. Using our experience and expertise we can quickly identify the creative solution and production issues that need tackling.









design


This starts with a co-creation session with the Forward Design Team, Production Experts and Client Representatives. The ideation workshop format results in a focused design prototype / production concept.
 
From the first sketch to the last prototype, we create ideas that bring visions to life. Our in-house capabilities include: ideation, hand sketches, illustrations, 3D modelling, mockups and 3D printing. Our experienced staff facilitates an open communication with clients to make sure we find successful design solutions each and every time.









engineering


Our ethos lies in creating products that exceed the standard in design and craft. We are constantly innovating and utilising the newest and best technologies to develop quality products.
 
We have generated an impressive portfolio of successful product solutions by doing continual market, manufacturing and materials research. Our aim is to push boundaries, both technically and creatively, whilst reducing the total cost.








global compliance


Rigorous, regulatory testing by the world’s leading compliance laboratories ensures that products manufactured by Forward meet and surpass the highest global standards of certification.
 
Our independent partner laboratories include:
Environmental & Health
• Intertek and SGS: Fully accredited labs testing for all environmental and health requirements including RoHS, REACH, Phthlates, AZO, BPA, PVC as well as cycle testing
• ARDL - Akron, Ohio: Specialty latex laboratory testing for latex content
Packaging and Accelerated Life Testing
• Westpak, California: An independent testing laboratory offering extensive package testing services























prototyping


We have extensive experience in the development of a working prototype models that can be tested and validated prior to production including injection moulding (abs/pc/etc), compression moulding (silicones available in medical and FDA approved materials).








production


Over thirty-five years operational experience in China has given us a unique understanding of the region and through FORWARD CHINA, where more than 2000 personnel are employed in over 800,000sq.ft. of production resources, we strive to operate centres of  manufacturing excellence. In fact, Forward China’s QC staff consistently receive ‘Exceptional Supplier’ ratings from our global clients. And as we produce over 5 million units per month, that’s quite an achievement.
 
We also set the agenda when it comes to addressing the challenges of ethical standards for personnel.
 
Supporting this manufacturing resource is our highly skilled team of procurement specialists, based in our Dongguan offices. All part of our process of providing clients with a bespoke product development resource that is second to none.








logistics


At Forward Industries we believe that developing a sustainable supply chain is key to maintaining successful client partnerships.
 
Our suppliers are located in key strategic areas throughout China, allowing us the flexibility to review production needs and balance capacity and competitiveness. We manufacture over 5 million units per month, which are stored in our environmentally controlled  100,000 sq. ft. warehouse facilities.
