1The annualized distribution rate shown is expressed as a percentage equal to the projected annualized distribution amount per share (which is calculated by annualizing the monthly cash distribution per share as of the date indicated, without compounding), divided by net asset value (NAV) per share as of the date indicated. The annualized distribution rate shown may be rounded. The payment of future distributions on FSEP’s common shares is subject to the discretion of FSEP’s board of trustees and applicable legal restrictions and, therefore, there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of any such future distributions. For the three months ended March 31, 2017, approximately 75% of FSEP's distributions were funded through net investment income, 2% distributions on account of investments in portfolio companies and 23% on expense reimbursement from sponsor. The determination of the tax attributes of FSEP’s distributions is made annually at the end of FSEP’s fiscal year, and a determination made on an interim basis may not be representative of the actual tax attributes of FSEP’s distributions for a full year. The actual tax characteristics of distributions to shareholders are reported to shareholders annually on Form 1099-DIV. FSEP's total expenses as a percentage of average net assets attributable to common shares was 4.88% for the year ended December 31, 2016.
        

2The distribution reinvestment price is subject to change. The price at which shares of FSEP’s common shares are issued under its distribution reinvestment plan is determined by FSEP’s board of trustees, or a committee thereof, at a price per share that is (i) not less than the NAV per share immediately prior to the payment of the distribution and (ii) not more than 2.5% greater than the NAV per share as of such date.

1
Shareholder Returns (Without Sales Charge) are the total returns an investor received for the highlighted period taking into account all distributions paid during such period, compounded monthly. Except for the Shareholder Return (Without Sales Charge) for the YTD period, the calculation assumes that the investor purchased shares at FSEP’s public offering price, excluding selling commissions and dealer manager fees, at the beginning of the applicable period and reinvested all cash distributions pursuant to FSEP’s distribution reinvestment plan ("DRP"). Since FSEP closed its public offering in November 2016, and has since issued new shares only pursuant to its DRP, the calculation of FSEP’s Shareholder Return (Without Sales Charge) for the YTD period assumes that the investor purchased shares at the beginning of the applicable period at a price based upon FSEP’s DRP on such date. Valuation as of the end of each period is the redemption price pursuant to FSEP’s share repurchase program on such date. Shareholder Returns (Without Sales Charge) do not include selling commissions and dealer manager fees, which could total up to 10% of FSEP’s public offering price. Had such selling commissions and dealer manager fees been included, performance would be lower. Upon liquidation or redemption, market conditions may cause the actual values to be more or less than the values shown.
FSEP is now closed to new investors. FSEP’s total expenses as a percentage of average net assets attributable to common shares was 4.88% for the year ended December 31, 2016.


2Shareholder Returns (With Sales Charge) are the total returns an investor received for the highlighted period taking into account all distributions paid during such period, compounded monthly. The calculation assumes that the investor purchased shares at FSEP’s public offering price, including the maximum selling commissions and dealer manager fees, at inception and reinvested all distributions pursuant to FSEP’s DRP. Valuation as of the end of the period is the redemption price pursuant to FSEP’s share repurchase program on such date. Upon liquidation or redemption, market conditions may cause the actual values to be more or less than the values shown.
              

3Cumulative cash distributions per share reflect the total regular cash distributions paid since inception on a per share basis as of May 31, 2017. The payment of future distributions on FSEP’s shares is subject to the sole discretion of FSEP’s board of trustees and applicable legal restrictions and, therefore, there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of any such future distributions.

The following are some of the risks an investment in our common shares involves; however, you should carefully consider all of the information found in FSEP's annual report on Form 10-K and other reports filed with the SEC.

Because there is no public trading market for our common shares and we are not obligated to effectuate a liquidity event by a specified date, it will be difficult for you to sell your common shares. If you are able to sell your common shares before we complete a liquidity event, it is likely that you will receive less than what you paid for them. While we intend to conduct quarterly tender offers for our common shares, only a limited number of our common shares will be eligible for repurchase and we may suspend or terminate the share repurchase program at any time.
Our distributions may be funded from unlimited amounts of offering proceeds or borrowings, which may constitute a return of capital and reduce the amount of capital available to us for investment. Any capital returned to shareholders through distributions will be distributed after payment of fees and expenses.
An investment strategy focused primarily on privately held companies presents certain challenges, including the lack of available information about these companies.
Investing in middle market companies involves a number of significant risks, any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.
A lack of liquidity in certain of our investments may adversely affect our business.
We are subject to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates, which may have a substantial negative impact on our investments.
We have borrowed funds to make investments, which increases the volatility of our investments and may increase the risks of investing in our securities.
FSEP is a long-term investment for persons of adequate fnancial means who have no need for liquidity in their investment. To invest in FSEP, an investor must have either (i) a net worth of at least $70,000 and an annual gross income of at least $70,000, or (ii) a net worth of at least $250,000. Some states, such as Kansas, impose higher suitability standards. Please consult the prospectus for a detailed description of the suitability standards imposed on investors, including heightened standards required by certain states. 
Our previous distributions to shareholders were funded in significant part from the reimbursement of certain expenses, including through the waiver of certain investment advisory fees, that are subject to repayment to our affiliate, FS Investments, and our future distributions may be funded from such waivers and reimbursements. Significant portions of these distributions may not be based on our investment performance and such waivers and reimbursements by FS Investments may not continue in the future. If FS Investments had not agreed to reimburse certain of our expenses, including through the waiver of certain advisory fees, significant portions of these distributions may come from offering proceeds or borrowings. The repayment of amounts owed to FS Investments will reduce the future distributions to which you would otherwise be entitled.

Returns reflect temporary contractual fee waivers and/or expense reimbursements. Had the ETF incurred all expenses and fees, investment returns would have been reduced. Investment returns and ETF share values will fluctuate so that investors' shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. ETF returns assume that dividends and capital gains distributions have been reinvested in the Fund at NAV.The "Net Asset Value" (NAV) of a VanEck Vectors Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) is determined at the close of each business day, and represents the dollar value of one share of the fund; it is calculated by taking the total assets of the fund, subtracting total liabilities, and dividing by the total number of shares outstanding. The NAV is not necessarily the same as the ETF 's intraday trading value. VanEck Vectors ETF investors should not expect to buy or sell shares at NAV.

Alternative Investment Product: FS Energy and Power Fund - White Securities LawWhite Securities Law | Securities Fraud Attorneys and FINRA Arbitration Lawyers

Alternative Investment Product: FS Energy and Power Fund




(Last Updated On: March 31, 2017)Have you suffered investment losses in FS Energy & Power Fund (FSEP II)? If so, The White Law Group may be able to help you recover your losses by filing a FINRA Dispute Resolution claim against the brokerage firm that sold you the investment.
FS Energy & Power Fund (FSEP II) is a non-traded business development company (BDC) designed to provide investors a combination of income, growth and diversification by investing primarily in the debt and income-oriented securities of private U.S. energy and power companies.
It is an investment offered by Franklin Square Capital Partners.
On September 27, 2016, FS Energy and Power Fund increased its public offering price, in accordance with its share pricing policy, to $8.25 per share from $8.15 per share.  The increase in the offering price is effective as of September 21, 2016.
According to their website, Franklin Square Capital Partners gives investors access to alternative asset classes, strategies and asset managers that typically have been available to only the largest institutional investors.
Franklin Square often raises money for investments through Reg D private placement offerings like the company did for FS Energy & Power Fund.  These Reg D private placements are then typically sold by brokerage firms in exchange for a large up front commission, usually between 7-10%, as well as additional “due diligence fees” that can range from 1-3%.
The trouble with alternative investment products, like FS Energy & Power Fund and other similar BDCs, is that they involve a high degree of risk and are typically sold as unregistered securities which lack the same regulatory oversight as more traditional investment products like stocks or bonds.
The White Law Group is investigating the liability that brokerage firms may have for improperly selling BDCs like FS Energy & Power Fund.
Broker dealers that sell alternative investments are required to perform adequate due diligence on all investment recommendations to ensure that each investment recommendation that is made is suitable for the investor in light of the investor’s age, risk tolerance, net worth, financial needs, and investment experience.
However, another problem with Reg D private placements is that the high sales commissions and due diligence fees the brokers earn for selling such products sometimes can provide brokers with an enormous incentive to push the product to unsuspecting investors who do not fully understand the risks of these types of investments or to outright misrepresent the basic features of the products – usually focusing on the income potential and tax benefits while downplaying the risks.
Fortunately, FINRA does provide for an arbitration forum for investors to resolve such disputes and if a broker or brokerage firm makes an unsuitable investment recommendation or fails to adequately disclose the risks associated with an investment they may be found liable for investment losses in a FINRA arbitration claim.
To determine whether you may be able to recover investment losses incurred as a result of your purchase of FS Energy & Power Fund or another Franklin Square BDC, please contact The White Law Group at 1-888-637-5510 for a free consultation.
The White Law Group is a national securities fraud, securities arbitration, and investor protection law firm with offices in Chicago, Illinois and Vero Beach, Florida. The firm represents investors throughout the country in claims against their brokerage firm.

Strategy & Benefits

Key Benefits
You know that TRADING is different than investing. But the opportunity to take advantage of short-term trends is only won, if you get the direction right.
Whether you’re a bull or a bear, Direxion is with you. Our leveraged ETFs are powerful tools built to help you:

Magnify your short-term perspective with daily 3X leverage
Go where there’s opportunity, with bull and bear funds for both sides of the trade; and
Stay agile – with liquidity to trade through rapidly changing markets

Leveraged and inverse ETFs pursue daily leveraged investment objectives which means they are riskier than alternatives which do not use leverage. They seek daily goals and should not be expected to track the underlying index over periods longer than one day. They are not suitable for all investors and should be utilized only by investors who understand leverage risk and who actively manage their investments.







Target Index

The Energy Select Sector Index (IXETR) is provided by S&P Dow Jones Indices and includes domestic companies from the energy sector which includes the following industries: oil, gas and consumable fuels; and energy equipment and services.  One cannot directly invest in an index.

* The Net Expense Ratio includes management fees, other operating expenses and Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses. If Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses were excluded, the Net Expense Ratio would be 0.95%.  The Funds’ Adviser, Rafferty Asset Management, LLC (“Rafferty”) has entered into an Operating Expense Limitation Agreement with each Fund, under which Rafferty has contractually agreed to cap all or a portion of its management fee and/or reimburse each Fund for Other Expenses through September 1, 2018, to the extent that the Fund’s Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses exceed 0.95% of the Fund’s daily net assets other than the following:  taxes, swap financing and related costs, acquired fund fees and expenses, dividends or interest on short positions, other interest expenses, brokerage commissions and extraordinary expenses. If these expenses were included, the expense ratio would be higher.
The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. For the most recent month-end performance please visit the funds website at direxioninvestments.com.
Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus.

Strategy & Benefits

Key Benefits
You know that TRADING is different than investing. But the opportunity to take advantage of short-term trends is only won, if you get the direction right.
Whether you’re a bull or a bear, Direxion is with you. Our leveraged ETFs are powerful tools built to help you:

Magnify your short-term perspective with daily 3X leverage
Go where there’s opportunity, with bull and bear funds for both sides of the trade; and
Stay agile – with liquidity to trade through rapidly changing markets

Leveraged and inverse ETFs pursue daily leveraged investment objectives which means they are riskier than alternatives which do not use leverage. They seek daily goals and should not be expected to track the underlying index over periods longer than one day. They are not suitable for all investors and should be utilized only by investors who understand leverage risk and who actively manage their investments.







Target Index

The Energy Select Sector Index (IXETR) is provided by S&P Dow Jones Indices and includes domestic companies from the energy sector which includes the following industries: oil, gas and consumable fuels; and energy equipment and services.  One cannot directly invest in an index.

* The Net Expense Ratio includes management fees, other operating expenses and Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses. If Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses were excluded, the Net Expense Ratio would be 0.95%.  The Funds’ Adviser, Rafferty Asset Management, LLC (“Rafferty”) has entered into an Operating Expense Limitation Agreement with each Fund, under which Rafferty has contractually agreed to cap all or a portion of its management fee and/or reimburse each Fund for Other Expenses through September 1, 2018, to the extent that the Fund’s Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses exceed 0.95% of the Fund’s daily net assets other than the following:  taxes, swap financing and related costs, acquired fund fees and expenses, dividends or interest on short positions, other interest expenses, brokerage commissions and extraordinary expenses. If these expenses were included, the expense ratio would be higher.
The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. For the most recent month-end performance please visit the funds website at direxioninvestments.com.
Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus.

The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. For the most recent month-end performance please visit the funds website at direxioninvestments.com.
Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
