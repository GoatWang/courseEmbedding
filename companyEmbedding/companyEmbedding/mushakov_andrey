 Andrey  Mushakov
Executive Vice President / International Nuclear Operations
 Dr. Mushakov oversees the nuclear fuel technology division of Lightbridge Corporation and is an expert in cost modeling and the economics of the nuclear fuel cycle. He has been with Lightbridge since 2000, and in 2006 he was named executive vice president for international nuclear operations.
In 2009, Dr. Mushakov led Lightbridge’s efforts to establish its Russian Branch Office in Moscow and oversaw its successful operation from 2009 to 2014 when Lightbridge made a decision to move its critical path fuel development and demonstration activities out of Russia due to increased political risk. Since mid-2014, Dr. Mushakov has been spearheading an effort within Lightbridge to establish cooperation agreements with Canadian Nuclear Laboratories in Canada, and more recently, with Institute for Energy Technology in Norway to enable successful execution of fuel sample fabrication and irradiation work according to our schedule.
He was also instrumental in negotiating Lightbridge's collaborative agreements with AREVA, the world's largest nuclear energy firm, and led a Lightbridge technical team that successfully completed these collaborative projects with AREVA over a period of two years. More recently, he coordinated a successful negotiation team effort that led to execution of a Joint Development Agreement with AREVA NP.
Dr. Mushakov has been a featured speaker at international conferences and panels on nuclear fuel technology, including the Wharton Energy Conference and the World Nuclear Fuel Cycle Conference.
He earned a Ph.D. in economics from St. Petersburg State University of Economics and Finance, an M.S. degree in management from Hult International Business School, and a B.S. degree in banking and finance from the Financial University under the Government of the Russian Federation.
