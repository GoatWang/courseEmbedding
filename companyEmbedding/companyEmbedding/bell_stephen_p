Community Contributor Kimberly Gudewicz, Johnson & Bell




Johnson & Bell is pleased to announce that Stephen P. Ellenbecker has joined the firm's Construction and Product Liability practice groups.Stephen P. Ellenbecker concentrates his practice in the areas of product liability, construction, and general civil litigation. Among other areas, he was a trial attorney on cases involving the food industry and the welding industry. He works on litigation as both local and national counsel and coordinates scheduling, discovery and trial work with national and local counsel, respectively.  Mr. Ellenbecker was selected as one of the "Forty Illinois Attorneys Under Forty to Watch" for 2008 by Chicago's Law Bulletin Publishing Company, publishers of Chicago Lawyer magazine and the Chicago Daily Law Bulletin. This highly coveted distinction recognizes him as one of the top young attorneys in his field.Since 1975, Johnson & Bell's trial attorneys have offered premier defense representation throughout the Midwest and nationally. Our trial lawyers work for one or more practices and draw on years of experience, as well as niche educational and professional backgrounds. While our business is national in scope, we offer Chicagoland-area clients convenient access to our attorneys either at our headquarters in Chicago's Loop, or at our other full-service office in Crown Point, Indiana.Follow Johnson & Bell on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/johnson-&-bell-ltd-
