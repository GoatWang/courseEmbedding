TARGET DATE FUNDS. Target date funds are funds with the target date being the approximate date when investors plan to start withdrawing their money. Generally, the asset allocation of each fund will change on an annual basis with the asset allocation becoming more conservative as the fund nears the target retirement date. The principal value of the fund(s) is not guaranteed at any time, including at the target date.

RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH INVESTING IN THE FUNDS. Certain underlying J.P. Morgan Funds may invest in foreign/emerging market securities, small capitalization securities and/or high-yield fixed income instruments. There may be unique risks associated with investing in these types of securities. International investing involves increased risk and volatility due to possibilities of currency exchange rate volatility, political, social or economic instability, foreign taxation and differences in auditing and other financial standards. The Fund may invest a portion of its securities in small-cap stocks. Small-capitalization funds typically carry more risk than stock funds investing in well-established "blue-chip" companies since smaller companies generally have a higher risk of failure. Historically, smaller companies' stock has experienced a greater degree of market volatility than the average stock. Securities rated below investment grade are called "high yield bonds," "non-investment grade bonds," "below investment-grade bonds," or "junk bonds." They generally are rated in the fifth or lower rating categories of Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investor Service. Although these securities tend to provide higher yields than higher rated securities, there is a greater risk that the Fund's share price will decline. Real estate funds may be subject to a higher degree of market risk because of concentration in a specific industry, sector or geographical sector. Real estate funds may be subject to risks including, but not limited to, declines in the value of real estate, risks related to general and economic conditions, changes in the value of the underlying property owned by the trust and defaults by borrower.

	There may be additional fees or expenses associated with investing in a Fund of Funds strategy.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Diversification does not guarantee investment returns and does not eliminate the risk of loss.
Bonds are subject to interest rate risks. Bond prices generally fall when interest rates rise.
The price of equity securities may rise or fall because of changes in the broad market or changes in a company's financial condition, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably. Equity securities are subject to "stock market risk" meaning that stock prices in general may decline over short or extended periods of time.
International investing involves a greater degree of risk and increased volatility. Changes in currency exchange rates and differences in accounting and taxation policies outside the U.S. can raise or lower returns. Also, some overseas markets may not be as politically and economically stable as the United States and other nations. Investments in emerging markets can be more volatile.
Real estate investments may be subject to a higher degree of market risk because of concentration in a specific industry, sector or geographical sector. Real estate investments may be subject to risks including, but not limited to, declines in the value of real estate, risks related to general and economic conditions, changes in the value of the underlying property owned by the trust and defaults by borrower.
Investments in commodities may have greater volatility than investments in traditional securities, particularly if the instruments involve leverage. The value of commodity-linked derivative instruments may be affected by changes in overall market movements, commodity index volatility, changes in interest rates, or factors affecting a particular industry or commodity, such as drought, floods, weather, livestock disease, embargoes, tariffs and international economic, political and regulatory developments. Use of leveraged commodity-linked derivatives creates an opportunity for increased return but, at the same time, creates the possibility for greater loss. 
Derivatives may be riskier than other types of investments because they may be more sensitive to changes in economic or market conditions than other types of investments and could result in losses that significantly exceed the original investment. The use of derivatives may not be successful, resulting in investment losses, and the cost of such strategies may reduce investment returns.
There is no guarantee that the use of long and short positions will succeed in limiting an investor's exposure to domestic stock market movements, capitalization, sector swings or other risk factors. Investing using long and short selling strategies may have higher portfolio turnover rates. Short selling involves certain risks, including additional costs associated with covering short positions and a possibility of unlimited loss on certain short sale positions.

Accordingly, any discussion of U.S. tax matters contained herein (including any attachments) is not intended or written to be used, and cannot be used, in connection with the promotion, marketing or recommendation by anyone unaffiliated with JPMorgan Chase & Co. of any of the matters addressed herein or for the purpose of avoiding U.S. tax-related penalties.

Seeking Better Participant Outcomes
For many plan sponsors, off-the-shelf target date funds—those based on the needs of the general population—will be a strong choice for a default investment option.  At SSGA, we have created what we believe is the best off-the-shelf solution for target date funds to help your participants achieve their retirement goals.

Nonlinear glidepath helps mitigate riskOur glidepath is designed to address the common risks participants face when investing for retirement: shortfall, inflation, market volatility and longevity.
Strategic forecasts offer optimized asset allocationCombining our proprietary macroeconomic forecasts with decades of institutional portfolio management experience, we design efficient long-term asset allocations intended to address the changing risks participants face throughout their accumulation and decumulation phases.
Broad asset class exposure improves diversificationAs a result of increased diversification, participants’ investments can benefit from reduced risk and the potential to maximize returns over time.

Focusing on real income replacementState Street Target Retirement Funds are designed to help participants meet their goals by providing a meaningful level of real income replacement in retirement.
Addressing key risksTarget Retirement Funds can help improve participant outcomes by maintaining an appropriate asset allocation and addressing key risks participants face over time.
Offering both off-the-shelf and custom solutionsThrough SSGA, plan sponsors can choose high-quality, off-the-shelf target date funds. We can also customize your target date funds to address specific participant needs or demographics.

Inflation protection
Marginal real asset exposure
Meaningful exposure to TIPS, REITs and commodities—increasing into retirement

The information show in this chart is intended for illustrative purposes only.


Seeking Better Participant Outcomes
For many plan sponsors, off-the-shelf target date funds—those based on the needs of the general population—will be a strong choice for a default investment option.  At SSGA, we have created what we believe is the best off-the-shelf solution for target date funds to help your participants achieve their retirement goals.

Nonlinear glidepath helps mitigate riskOur glidepath is designed to address the common risks participants face when investing for retirement: shortfall, inflation, market volatility and longevity.
Strategic forecasts offer optimized asset allocationCombining our proprietary macroeconomic forecasts with decades of institutional portfolio management experience, we design efficient long-term asset allocations intended to address the changing risks participants face throughout their accumulation and decumulation phases.
Broad asset class exposure improves diversificationAs a result of increased diversification, participants’ investments can benefit from reduced risk and the potential to maximize returns over time.

American Funds Target Date Retirement Series®










A Smart Choice for Investing for Retirement
A target date fund is a professionally managed collection of mutual funds designed to help you invest for retirement.  
One Fund, Many Benefits














A Long-Term Investment
Target date funds are designed to help you invest for retirement and meet your changing needs over time.










A Variety of Investments
Each fund is made up of a broad range of investments. That’s important when saving for retirement because spreading your investment dollars among different types of investments can help reduce volatility.













Investments That Change Over Time
Investment professionals adjust the investment mix to become more conservative as the target date approaches. This can help provide a measure of protection from market declines.










Professional Oversight
Investment professionals manage the investment mix so you don’t have to. In fact, they continue to manage the funds for an additional 30 years into retirement.
















An Investment Mix That Changes Over Time
The investments in each of our funds change over time based on the target retirement date. This gradual shift is called a “glide path.”














Here’s how it works:
1. Significant stock investments throughout the lifetime of your fund can help manage the risk of outliving your savings in retirement.
2. An increased emphasis on bonds as you near your retirement date can help manage the risk of market declines.
3. Each fund is managed for 30 years beyond retirement, so you could feasibly use a single fund for decades.














How the Investment Mix Changes Over Time







    





Each target date fund is composed of a mix of the American Funds and is subject to the risks and returns of the underlying funds. 
































Benefit From Professional Oversight and a Commitment to Low Fees

 Experience Can Make a Difference
Our funds are managed by a Portfolio Oversight Committee, a team of veteran investment professionals that have navigated good and bad market conditions.  
Our Investment Professionals Invest Alongside You
In addition to managing the funds, our investment professionals invest their own money in the funds.  
Low Fees Are Crucial to Positive Investor Outcomes
There are fees and expenses associated with investing through an employer’s retirement plan. High investment fees and costs can reduce your long-term retirement savings. The lower the costs, the better it is for you. 



















Award-Winning Funds  

Eight of our American Funds target date retirement funds have won 2016 Lipper Fund Awards for superior results.*
Eleven American Funds have been cited for excellence in the Morningstar® FundInvestor℠ "Fantastic 45" list — the most of any fund family.†









*The 2016 Lipper Fund Awards were awarded on March 22, 2016. Seven funds in the American Funds Target Date Retirement Series (R-6 share class) were cited as Best Mixed-Asset Target Funds for multiple time frames, and one for a single period, based on the Consistent Return as defined by superior consistency and risk-adjusted return when compared to Lipper Mixed-Asset Target Date Fund peer groups.
†Source: Morningstar, Fund Spy article, September 13, 2016. Morningstar evaluated funds based on criteria including manager ownership, fund results and expense ratios, as well as Morningstar risk, analyst and parent ratings. Not all 11 funds listed in the “Fantastic 45” are in each target date fund. Underlying funds may change over time. 
































Find Your Target Date Fund
The target date is the year closest to the year you plan to retire. To find your target date fund, add your birth year to the year you plan to retire and begin taking retirement withdrawals. The retirement age is 65 for many investors but may be different for you. 


















 To determine your retirement year:
 
 Birth Year
    +      Retirement Age

 Retirement Year





























Select the fund that is closest to your Retirement Year
2060  |  2055  |  2050  |  2045  |  2040  |  2035  |  2030  |  2025  |  2020  |  2015  |  2010

Investments are not FDIC-insured, nor are they deposits of or guaranteed by a bank or any other entity, so they may lose value.
Investors should carefully consider investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. This and other important information is contained in the fund prospectuses and summary prospectuses, which can be obtained from a financial professional and should be read carefully before investing. 
Although the target date funds are managed for investors on a projected retirement date time frame, the funds' allocation strategy does not guarantee that investors' retirement goals will be met. The target date is the year in which an investor is assumed to retire and begin taking withdrawals. American Funds investment professionals manage the target date fund's portfolio, moving it from a more growth-oriented strategy to a more income-oriented focus as the fund gets closer to its target date. Investment professionals continue to manage each fund for 30 years after it reaches its target date.

Investments are not FDIC-insured, nor are they deposits of or guaranteed by a bank or any other entity, so they may lose value.
You could lose money by investing in American Funds U.S. Government Money Market Fund. Although the fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. An investment in the fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other governmental agency, entity or person. The fund’s sponsor has no legal obligation to provide financial support to the fund, and you should not expect that the sponsor will do so at any time.
  
Investors should carefully consider investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. This and other important information is contained in the fund prospectuses and summary prospectuses, which can be obtained from a financial professional and should be read carefully before investing.
Bond ratings, which typically range from AAA/Aaa (highest) to D (lowest), are assigned by credit rating agencies such as Standard & Poor's, Moody's and/or Fitch, as an indication of an issuer's creditworthiness.
The use of derivatives involves a variety of risks, which may be different from, or greater than, the risks associated with investing in traditional cash securities, such as stocks and bonds. American Funds Strategic Bond Fund may engage in frequent and active trading of its portfolio securities, which may involve correspondingly greater transaction costs, adversely affecting the fund's results.
Fund shares of U.S. Government Securities Fund are not guaranteed by the U.S. government.
Investing outside the United States involves risks, such as currency fluctuations, periods of illiquidity and price volatility, as more fully described in the prospectus. These risks may be heightened in connection with investments in developing countries. Diversification does not eliminate the risks of investing; losses are possible in diversified portfolios. Small-company stocks entail additional risks, and they can fluctuate in price more than larger company stocks.
The return of principal for bond funds and for funds with significant underlying bond holdings is not guaranteed. Fund shares are subject to the same interest rate, inflation and credit risks associated with the underlying bond holdings. The value of fixed income securities may be affected by changing interest rates and changes in credit ratings of the securities. Lower rated bonds are subject to greater fluctuations in value and risk of loss of income and principal than higher rated bonds. Investments in mortgage-related securities involve additional risks, such as prepayment risk, as more fully described in the prospectus. While not directly correlated to changes in interest rates, the values of inflation-linked bonds generally fluctuate in response to changes in real interest rates and may experience greater losses than other debt securities with similar durations.
For more information about the risks associated with each fund or underlying fund, go to its detailed fund information page or read the prospectus. Investment allocations for funds of funds may not achieve fund objectives. There are expenses associated with the underlying funds in addition to fund-of-funds expenses. The funds' risks are directly related to the risks of the underlying funds, as described herein. Each target date fund is composed of a mix of the American Funds and is subject to the risks and returns of the underlying funds. Underlying funds may be added or removed during the year. Although the target date funds are managed for investors on a projected retirement date time frame, the funds' allocation strategy does not guarantee that investors' retirement goals will be met. The target date is the year in which an investor is assumed to retire and begin taking withdrawals. American Funds investment professionals actively manage the target date fund's portfolio, moving it from a more growth-oriented strategy to a more income-oriented focus as the fund gets closer to its target date. Investment professionals continue to manage each fund for 30 years after it reaches its target date. The target allocations are as of January 1, 2017, and are subject to the Portfolio Oversight Committee's discretion. The funds’ investment adviser anticipates that the funds will invest their assets within a range that deviates no more than 10% above or below these allocations. Investment professionals gradually adjust the portfolio over time so that it becomes more preservation-oriented. The funds' allocation strategy does not guarantee that investors' education savings goals will be met. The target date is the year in which the beneficiary is expected to begin taking withdrawals. Investors and their advisors should periodically evaluate their investment to determine whether it continues to meet their needs. The Retirement Income Portfolio Series' investment allocations may not achieve fund objectives, and adequate income through retirement is not guaranteed. There are expenses associated with the underlying funds in addition to fund-of-funds expenses. The funds’ risks are directly related to the risks of the underlying funds. Payments consisting of return of capital will result in a decrease in an investor’s fund share balance. Higher rates of withdrawal and withdrawals during declining markets may result in a more rapid decrease in an investor’s fund share balance. Persistent returns of capital could ultimately result in a zero account balance.
State-specific tax-exempt funds are more susceptible to factors adversely affecting issuers of their states' tax-exempt securities than more widely diversified municipal bond funds. Income from municipal bonds may be subject to state or local income taxes . Certain other income, as well as capital gain distributions, may be taxable.

Investments are not FDIC-insured, nor are they deposits of or guaranteed by a bank or any other entity, so they may lose value.
Investors should carefully consider investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. This and other important information is contained in the fund prospectuses and summary prospectuses, which can be obtained from a financial professional and should be read carefully before investing. 
Although the target date funds are managed for investors on a projected retirement date time frame, the funds' allocation strategy does not guarantee that investors' retirement goals will be met. The target date is the year in which an investor is assumed to retire and begin taking withdrawals. American Funds investment professionals manage the target date fund's portfolio, moving it from a more growth-oriented strategy to a more income-oriented focus as the fund gets closer to its target date. Investment professionals continue to manage each fund for 30 years after it reaches its target date.

1Based on one-year net asset growth as of February 28, 2017.
2The 2017 Lipper Fund Awards were awarded on March 23, 2017, and based on risk-adjusted returns as of November 30, 2016.
3The market indexes are unmanaged and, therefore, have no expenses. Investors cannot invest directly in an index. There have been periods when the fund has lagged the index.
Returns shown have all distributions reinvested. If a sales charge had been deducted, the results would have been lower.
Returns are average annual total returns for benchmark indexes and average annual excess total returns for funds' Class R-6 shares from fund inception through 12/31/16. The 17 American Funds equity-focused underlying funds and the relevant index/index blends with which they were compared are as follows: AMCAP, GFA, NEF, AMF, FI, ICA and WMIF (Standard & Poor’s 500 Index); NPF (MSCI All Country World Index. Prior to 10/1/11, the fund was compared to the MSCI World Index); IFA (65% Standard & Poor’s 500 and 35% Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate indexes); AMBAL (60% Standard & Poor’s 500 and 40% Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate indexes); EUPAC (MSCI All Country World ex USA Index. Prior to 4/1/06, the fund was compared to the MSCI EAFE Index); CIB (70% MSCI All Country World and 30% Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate indexes); SCWF (MSCI ACWI Small Cap Index. Prior to 10/1/09, the fund was compared to the S&P Global < $3 Billion Index); WGI (MSCI All Country World. Prior to 12/1/11, the fund was compared to the MSCI World Index); NWF (MSCI All Country World Index); IGI (MSCI All Country World ex USA Index. Prior to 7/1/11, the fund was compared to the MSCI EAFE Index); and GBAL (60% MSCI All Country World and 40% Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate indexes). All relevant indexes and index blends listed are or include funds’ primary benchmarks.

5Source: Morningstar, Fund Spy article, September 13, 2016. Morningstar evaluated funds based on criteria including manager ownership, fund results and expense ratios, as well as Morningstar risk, analyst and parent ratings.
Morningstar’s criteria are as follows (fund eligibility changes as criteria change, as noted in brackets): (1) Fund must have outperformed its prospectus benchmark over the tenure of the longest tenured manager; minimum of five years required. Test was run using returns through August 2016; (2) expenses must be in cheapest quintile of category; (3) Parent Grade must be positive [2012: neutral or better]; (4) manager investment in fund must be more than $1,000,000 [2012-2014: $500,000]; (5) fund must be a “medalist” (rated Bronze, Silver or Gold) [2012: n/a]; (6) Morningstar Risk rating must be below High [2012-2013: n/a]. Using these criteria, the tool filtered 45 out of nearly 8,000 funds, excluding true institutional funds [2012: no exclusion for institutional funds], for all share classes in Morningstar database, as of August 2016; 11 of the 45 were American Funds. Additional criteria: 2012—positive people score required; 2015—cheapest retail share class selected; 2016—returns over benchmark gauged vs. category benchmark, not prospectus benchmark.
Not all 11 funds listed in the “Fantastic 45” are in each target date fund. Underlying funds may change over time.
6Based on Class R-6 share results for rolling periods through December 31, 2016. Periods covered are the shorter of the fund’s lifetime or since the comparable Lipper inception date (except Capital Income Builder and SMALLCAP World Fund, for which the Lipper average was used).
7Allocations shown reflect the funds’ target allocations for January 1, 2017. The funds’ investment adviser anticipates that the funds will invest their assets within a range that deviates no more than 10% above or below the allocations shown. Allocation percentages and underlying funds are subject to the Portfolio Oversight Committee’s discretion and may change over time. For quarterly updates of fund allocations, visit americanfundsretirement.com.
8Results as of March 31, 2017. Percentile rankings for one-, three- and five-year periods calculated by Morningstar. Ten-year rankings calculated by Capital Group, using data obtained from Morningstar.
Rankings are based on the funds’ average annual total returns (Class R-6 shares at net asset value) within the applicable Morningstar categories. The Morningstar rankings do not reflect the effects of sales charges, account fees or taxes. Past results are not predictive of results in future periods. Investment results assume all distributions are reinvested and reflect applicable fees and expenses. The Morningstar category average includes all share classes for the funds in the category. While American Funds R-6 shares do not include fees for advisor compensation and service provider payments, the share classes represented in the Morningstar category have varying fee structures and can include these and other fees and charges resulting in higher expenses.


























Figures shown are past results and are not predictive of results in future periods. Current and future results may be lower or higher than those shown. Share prices and returns will vary, so investors may lose money. Investing for short periods makes losses more likely. View fund expense ratios and returns. 
Investments are not FDIC-insured, nor are they deposits of or guaranteed by a bank or any other entity, so they may lose value.
Investors should carefully consider investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. This and other important information is contained in the fund prospectuses and summary prospectuses or the collective investment trust's Characteristics statement, which can be obtained from a financial professional, Capital or your relationship manager, and should be read carefully before investing. 
Investing outside the United States involves risks, such as currency fluctuations, periods of illiquidity and price volatility, as more fully described in the prospectus. These risks may be heightened in connection with investments in developing countries. Small-company stocks entail additional risks, and they can fluctuate in price more than larger company stocks. 
The return of principal for bond funds and for funds with significant underlying bond holdings is not guaranteed. Fund shares are subject to the same interest rate, inflation and credit risks associated with the underlying bond holdings. Lower rated bonds are subject to greater fluctuations in value and risk of loss of income and principal than higher rated bonds. Funds of funds’ bond ratings relate to the securities held by the portfolios' underlying mutual funds; if agency ratings of those holdings differ, the security will be considered to have received the highest of those ratings.  
For more information about the risks associated with each fund or underlying fund, go to its detailed fund information page or read the prospectus. Investment allocations for funds of funds may not achieve fund objectives. There are expenses associated with the underlying funds in addition to fund-of-funds expenses. The funds' risks are directly related to the risks of the underlying funds, as described herein. Although the target date funds are managed for investors on a projected retirement date time frame, the funds' allocation strategy does not guarantee that investors' retirement goals will be met. The target date is the year in which an investor is assumed to retire and begin taking withdrawals. American Funds investment professionals manage the target date fund's portfolio, moving it from a more growth-oriented strategy to a more income-oriented focus as the fund gets closer to its target date. Investment professionals continue to manage each fund for 30 years after it reaches its target date. 
We offer a range of share classes designed to meet the needs of retirement plan sponsors and participants. The different share classes incorporate varying levels of advisor compensation and service provider payments. Because Class R-6 shares do not include any recordkeeping payments, expenses are lower and results are higher. Other share classes that include recordkeeping costs have higher expenses and lower results than Class R-6. 
Investment results assume all distributions are reinvested and reflect applicable fees and expenses. 

For the following funds, the investment adviser is currently reimbursing a portion of the funds' fees or expenses, without which the results would have been lower and net expenses higher.
- American Funds U.S. Government Money Market Fund is currently reimbursing a portion of the fund's fees and expenses. Please see the Financial Highlights table in the fund’s most recent prospectus for details.
- American Funds Corporate Bond Fund, American Funds Emerging Markets Bond fund, American Funds Strategic Bond Fund, American Funds Retirement Income Portfolio Series funds and American Funds 2060 Target Date Retirement Fund are currently reimbursing a portion of other expenses through at least January 1, 2018.
The investment adviser may elect at its discretion to extend, modify or terminate the reimbursements at that time. Please see each fund's most recent prospectus for details.  
     Read details about how waivers and/or reimbursements affect the results for each fund. View  
     results and yields without fee waiver and/or expense reimbursement.  
     


The Capital Group companies manage equity assets through three investment groups. These groups make investment and proxy voting decisions independently. Fixed income investment professionals provide fixed income research and investment management across the Capital organization; however, for securities with equity characteristics, they act solely on behalf of one of the three equity investment groups. 
Fund results for periods before a share class was sold are hypothetical. These hypothetical returns were calculated by adjusting Class A share results without a sales charge for the difference between the Class A share expense ratio and the estimated expense ratio for the share class as of the date of first sale.

Find out about American Funds target date funds
Many investors are intimidated by the idea of selecting and maintaining a well-designed asset allocation for their retirement accounts. If this sounds like you, you might want to consider a target date fund.
American Funds target date funds at a glance

The 11 funds in the American Funds Target Date Retirement Series® are designed around retirement dates that are spaced five years apart, ranging from 2010 to 2060.
Each of the target date funds could serve as a single, diversified retirement investment.
Each fund invests in a mix of American Funds — mutual funds managed with a long-term focus based on thorough research and attention to risk.
Fund portfolios are managed and periodically adjusted over time. The funds have a more growth-oriented strategy when retirement is years away and a more income-oriented focus as the fund gets closer to its target date. The target date is the year in which an investor is assumed to retire and begin taking withdrawals.
After the retirement date is reached, each fund will be managed for 30 years to pursue income, capital conservation and some growth.

Find out which target date fund might be right for you by using the table below.

How your fund changes over time
The chart below illustrates the basic investment strategy of the target date funds. Find the asset allocation of your fund on the left. As you move to the right, you’ll see how the investment mix is expected to change over time.
For example, locate the 2025 fund at the top of the chart. The fund began with about 5% of its assets invested in bond funds. You can see how the portion of bond fund holdings could gradually increase over time.


Target investment allocation strategy







The allocations and target strategy are subject to change.
Although the target date funds are managed on a projected retirement date time frame, the fund’s allocation strategy does not guarantee that your retirement goals will be met. Allocation percentages and underlying funds are subject to the Portfolio Oversight Committee’s discretion and will evolve over time. Underlying funds may be added or removed during the year. For quarterly updates of the underlying fund allocations, visit the target date fund details pages available on the Fund Overviews page.
Let a financial professional assist you
A financial professional can help you determine if a target date fund makes sense for you. Together, you can create a customized savings plan and assess your overall situation, including your other assets, specific financial needs and risk tolerance.
Investing outside the United States involves risks, such as currency fluctuations, periods of illiquidity and price volatility, as more fully described in the prospectus. These risks may be heightened in connection with investments in developing countries. Small-company stocks entail risks, and they can fluctuate in price more than larger company stocks. Lower rated bonds are subject to greater fluctuations in value and risk of loss of income and principal than higher rated bonds. The return of principal in bond funds and for funds with significant bond holdings is not guaranteed. Fund shares are subject to the same interest rate, inflation and credit risks that are associated with the bonds owned by the underlying fund. Fund shares of the U.S. Government Securities Fund are not guaranteed by the U.S. government.
Investments are not FDIC-insured, nor are they deposits of or guaranteed by a bank or any other entity, so they may lose value. Investors should carefully consider investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. This and other important information is contained in the fund prospectuses and summary prospectuses, which can be obtained from a financial professional or downloaded and should be read carefully before investing.

TARGET DATE FUNDS. Target date funds are funds with the target date being the approximate date when investors plan to start withdrawing their money. Generally, the asset allocation of each fund will change on an annual basis with the asset allocation becoming more conservative as the fund nears the target retirement date. The principal value of the fund(s) is not guaranteed at any time, including at the target date.

RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH INVESTING IN THE FUNDS. Certain underlying J.P. Morgan Funds may invest in foreign/emerging market securities, small capitalization securities and/or high-yield fixed income instruments. There may be unique risks associated with investing in these types of securities. International investing involves increased risk and volatility due to possibilities of currency exchange rate volatility, political, social or economic instability, foreign taxation and differences in auditing and other financial standards. The Fund may invest a portion of its securities in small-cap stocks. Small-capitalization funds typically carry more risk than stock funds investing in well-established "blue-chip" companies since smaller companies generally have a higher risk of failure. Historically, smaller companies' stock has experienced a greater degree of market volatility than the average stock. Securities rated below investment grade are called "high yield bonds," "non-investment grade bonds," "below investment-grade bonds," or "junk bonds." They generally are rated in the fifth or lower rating categories of Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investor Service. Although these securities tend to provide higher yields than higher rated securities, there is a greater risk that the Fund's share price will decline. Real estate funds may be subject to a higher degree of market risk because of concentration in a specific industry, sector or geographical sector. Real estate funds may be subject to risks including, but not limited to, declines in the value of real estate, risks related to general and economic conditions, changes in the value of the underlying property owned by the trust and defaults by borrower.

TARGET DATE FUNDS. Target date funds are funds with the target date being the approximate date when investors plan to start withdrawing their money. Generally, the asset allocation of each fund will change on an annual basis with the asset allocation becoming more conservative as the fund nears the target retirement date. The principal value of the fund(s) is not guaranteed at any time, including at the target date.

RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH INVESTING IN THE FUNDS. Certain underlying J.P. Morgan Funds may invest in foreign/emerging market securities, small capitalization securities and/or high-yield fixed income instruments. There may be unique risks associated with investing in these types of securities. International investing involves increased risk and volatility due to possibilities of currency exchange rate volatility, political, social or economic instability, foreign taxation and differences in auditing and other financial standards. The Fund may invest a portion of its securities in small-cap stocks. Small-capitalization funds typically carry more risk than stock funds investing in well-established "blue-chip" companies since smaller companies generally have a higher risk of failure. Historically, smaller companies' stock has experienced a greater degree of market volatility than the average stock. Securities rated below investment grade are called "high yield bonds," "non-investment grade bonds," "below investment-grade bonds," or "junk bonds." They generally are rated in the fifth or lower rating categories of Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investor Service. Although these securities tend to provide higher yields than higher rated securities, there is a greater risk that the Fund's share price will decline. Real estate funds may be subject to a higher degree of market risk because of concentration in a specific industry, sector or geographical sector. Real estate funds may be subject to risks including, but not limited to, declines in the value of real estate, risks related to general and economic conditions, changes in the value of the underlying property owned by the trust and defaults by borrower.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Diversification does not guarantee investment returns and does not eliminate the risk of loss.
Bonds are subject to interest rate risks. Bond prices generally fall when interest rates rise.
The price of equity securities may rise or fall because of changes in the broad market or changes in a company's financial condition, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably. Equity securities are subject to "stock market risk" meaning that stock prices in general may decline over short or extended periods of time.
International investing involves a greater degree of risk and increased volatility. Changes in currency exchange rates and differences in accounting and taxation policies outside the U.S. can raise or lower returns. Also, some overseas markets may not be as politically and economically stable as the United States and other nations. Investments in emerging markets can be more volatile.
Real estate investments may be subject to a higher degree of market risk because of concentration in a specific industry, sector or geographical sector. Real estate investments may be subject to risks including, but not limited to, declines in the value of real estate, risks related to general and economic conditions, changes in the value of the underlying property owned by the trust and defaults by borrower.
Investments in commodities may have greater volatility than investments in traditional securities, particularly if the instruments involve leverage. The value of commodity-linked derivative instruments may be affected by changes in overall market movements, commodity index volatility, changes in interest rates, or factors affecting a particular industry or commodity, such as drought, floods, weather, livestock disease, embargoes, tariffs and international economic, political and regulatory developments. Use of leveraged commodity-linked derivatives creates an opportunity for increased return but, at the same time, creates the possibility for greater loss. 
Derivatives may be riskier than other types of investments because they may be more sensitive to changes in economic or market conditions than other types of investments and could result in losses that significantly exceed the original investment. The use of derivatives may not be successful, resulting in investment losses, and the cost of such strategies may reduce investment returns.
There is no guarantee that the use of long and short positions will succeed in limiting an investor's exposure to domestic stock market movements, capitalization, sector swings or other risk factors. Investing using long and short selling strategies may have higher portfolio turnover rates. Short selling involves certain risks, including additional costs associated with covering short positions and a possibility of unlimited loss on certain short sale positions.
JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its affiliates do not provide tax advice. Accordingly, any discussion of U.S. tax matters contained herein (including any attachments) is not intended or written to be used, and cannot be used, in connection with the promotion, marketing or recommendation by anyone unaffiliated with JPMorgan Chase & Co. of any of the matters addressed herein or for the purpose of avoiding U.S. tax-related penalties.

Strategic forecasts offer optimized asset allocationCombining our proprietary macroeconomic forecasts with decades of institutional portfolio management experience, we design efficient long-term asset allocations intended to address the changing risks participants face throughout their accumulation and decumulation phases.
Broad asset class exposure improves diversificationAs a result of increased diversification, participants’ investments can benefit from reduced risk and the potential to maximize returns over time.
