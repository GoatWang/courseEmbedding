Capital One® Secured Mastercard®


                                            I never had played in credit before, and someone suggested this card to me to build credit for the first time. I've been really satisfied for the most part. They report quickly and accurately, remind me when my bill is due, and the customer service has been kind and thorough....show more

Wells Fargo


                                            I find it quite disturbing to see 24 one star, the lowest, ratings on the first page of Wallet Hub's most recent reviews of Wells Fargo. Somehow, in its overall summary, Wallet Hub still gives the impression Wells Fargo is a good banking option. What's going on here?

Navy Federal Credit Union nRewards® Credit Card


                                            I thought this was a good program until I tried to order a Yeti cooler on the members mall and every cooler in every size was out of stock.

Bed Bath & Beyond® Credit Card


                                            The Bed Bath & Beyond Mastercard was purchased from US Bank in October 2016.

                                            It is my opinion that you would do better to find a different company. In the long run they will charge you plenty and the support is virtually non-existent. They don't even have a working answering system. They are disorganized  and a nightmare to work with.

Making simple transfers or even looking at accounts is harder and more confusing. bring back the old version.

What are analysts saying about Imperva stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about Imperva stock: 
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "Imperva Inc. is engaged in the development of protection software and services for business applications and databases. The Company delivers innovative technology to give full audit accountability and separation of duties to meet regulatory compliance. It offers SecureSphere Data Security Suite to protect sensitive data from hackers and malicious insiders along with providing a fast and cost-effective route to regulatory compliance and establishes a repeatable process for data risk management. The Company's SecureSphere offers database security solutions to secure sensitive data stored in databases, File Security solutions to protect sensitive files on file servers, storage devices, content repositories, and meet regulatory compliance mandates and Web Application Security solutions to protect web applications from cyber attacks. Imperva Inc. is headquartered in Redwood Shores, California.   " (5/9/2017)
2. Evercore ISI analysts commented, "We believe that the quarter was in part helped by the deposition of Skyfence which carried annual operating expenses of ~$25M (and revenue of ~$1M). There is likely a tailwind to margins in 2Q from the deposition as well, despite the company’s ongoing plans to reinvest the savings in growth areas. Management guided to ~7% non-GAAP margins for F17 which compares favorably to consensus of ~5.6% going into the quarter. We continue to believe that the company is working to improve its business but has largely overcome the execution challenges that plagued results last year. We are encouraged by the high level of growth (+64.5% y/y in 1Q17) seen in the company’s subscription offerings which may be further helped by the introduction of FlexProtect which makes form factor (on-prem vs cloud) less relevant. This should offset concerns on the company’s on-premise WAF decline." (5/5/2017)

LiteSpeed 11 ft. Hammock Tree Straps With Climber-rated Wiregate Carabiners Included- Easy, Adjustable Cinch Buckle System. No More Loops. Strong, Lightweight, Pure Polyester. 


                        HANG ANY HAMMOCK IN SECONDS- We designed our LiteSpeed system with ease of use in mind. Most hammock suspension systems require a lot of work to properly hang your hammock. Using cinch buckle technology you can make infinite adjustments quickly and spend more time hanging and less time fiddling                        
                             ropes or heavy loop systems., THE MOST COMPLETE KIT ON THE MARKET- Unlike other hammock strap kits on the market we have included everything you need. A pair of 11 ft x 1 inch 100% reinforced polyester tree friendly straps, two high strength cinch buckles wound with a genuine amsteel continuous loop & two lightweight 12kn rated aluminum wire gate carabiners. Also include a length of PVC pipe for easy installation., COMPATIBLE WITH MOST HAMMOCKS- Our system works with ENO, Grand Trunk, Hennessey, Yukon, Kammock and most other brands. Installation is a snap so you can upgrade your old clunky system in minutes., LIGHTWEIGHT- Weighing in at 13 ounces the LiteSpeed system is the lightest complete system on the market. Loop systems such as the Atlas by ENO are heavy and only include the straps, VERSATILE AMSTEEL LOOP- Amsteel is an amazing synthetic fiber with a breaking point of over 1600 lbs. Our cinch buckle is wound with a amsteel continuous loop. Either attach your hammock with a carabiner directly to the loop or install the loop using the included PVC pipe into the channel of your gathered end hammock (recommended),

Outpost Camping Hammock With Adjustable LiteSpeed Cinch Buckle Suspension System- Includes 11’ 100% Polyester Tree Straps, Wire Gate Carabiners- Parachute Nylon 


                        WHY IS THE OUTPOST HAMMOCK WORTH IT? It works. It simply works. It is truly the easiest hammock to set up and take down. We don't claim to include a suspension system and then give you cheap rope, you don't have to tie knots, and we guarantee our products. We built the hammock because we were sick                        
                             of the cheap, low quality offerings around. This hammock is worth it. Period., SIZE MATTERS - At 11 ft. long, the Outpost I hammock is the longest on the market. The extra length allows you more room to spread out on a diagonal angle and helps you lay flatter. The Outpost I is still lightweight and compact perfect for longer backpacking treks. It weighs in at 1 lbs 10 oz (LiteSpeed Included), HIGH QUALITY NYLON - Outpost Hammocks are constructed with 70D parachute nylon that is strong (Rated at 400 lbs but tested to over 1000 lbs), durable, and dries quickly. Best camp hammock on the market., GEAR FITS INTO ONE STUFF SACK - The Outpost and Litespeed Suspension System all fit conveniently into one integrated stuff sack making it portable (Packed Dimension 8"x6.5"x4.5") and easy to pack for travel, hiking, backpacking, the beach, or any outdoor adventure., HANG YOUR HAMMOCK IN SECONDS - Our best-in-class LiteSpeed suspension system is fast, strong and infinitely adjustable. Using cinch buckles made from cold rolled steel you can adjust your hammock to the perfect hanging angle. Spend less time setting up and more time hanging out. Our straps are made from reinforced 100% stretch-free, tree-friendly polyester.,
