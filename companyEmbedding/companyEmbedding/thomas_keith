Keith Thomas, born and raised in the Atlanta suburb of Conyers, Georgia, is a Grammy Award-winning producer and songwriter with 40 #1 Billboard hits. His production and artist management company, Levosia Entertainment, is currently in Nashville, Tennessee.

Career[1][edit]
Born and raised in the Atlanta suburb of Conyers, GA., Thomas was singing lead for his father's gospel group by the age of nine. His ability as a keyboard player led him, while still in High School, to recording sessions in Atlanta studios. Here he came to the attention of country superstar Ronnie Milsap.
Thomas moved to Nashville as Ronnie's first staff writer for Milsap's newly formed publishing company, Ronjoy Music. Shortly thereafter, Thomas signed on with Word Records and began a seven-year tenure as their staff writer and producer. During this time, Thomas produced over 16 albums for various artists earning over 20 #1 singles.
Encouraged by this success, Thomas left Word and founded his own publishing and production company, Yellow Elephant Music, and began writing and producing music for BeBe & CeCe Winans. During their four album collaboration, the three sold over 3 million albums and had nine top 30 singles, six of which went top 10 and two of which went #1. As a result of this relationship, BeBe & CeCe earned four Grammy awards, an additional Grammy nomination, and five Dove awards.
1990s[edit]
In 1991, Thomas crossed over into the world of mainstream pop when he partnered with longtime friend Amy Grant to garner their first #1, Top 40 hit, "Baby Baby." At the same time, Thomas focused his talents on former Miss America, soon to become international pop and movie star, Vanessa Williams. He wrote and produced five tracks on her Comfort Zone album including the #1 hit, "Save the Best for Last". These two #1 songs with Grant and Williams earned Thomas Grammy nominations for Producer of the Year, Song of the Year, and Record of the Year.
Responding to the momentum created by this success, Thomas acquired The Bennett House recording complex in Franklin, TN. Twenty minutes from downtown Nashville, The Bennett House not only accommodates Thomas' personal project studio and administrative offices but also offers outside clients a 19th-century recording environment that is unique in the Nashville music scene.
Christening the move into The Bennett House, Thomas turned his attention again to Amy Grant by writing and producing for her House of Love album. This album boasted several hits for Thomas including the songs, "Lucky One," and the title track, "House of Love." Thomas produced the song "The Sweetest Days" for Vanessa Williams as well as records for James Ingram, Peabo Bryson, Deborah Cox, Regina Belle and Wendy Moten. In 1995, Thomas wrote and produced the hit song, "I Could Fall In Love," for Selena. Selena thus became the first artist to place both a Spanish- and an English-language song in the top 10 of the Hot Latin Tracks chart. "I Could Fall in Love" became the fifth best-charting song from that chart in 1995 and remained the highest-charting English-language song for two years, until Celine Dion's 1998 single "My Heart Will Go On" surpassed it when it peaked at number 1. The album, Dreaming Of You, on which "I Could Fall In Love" appears, has now been certified 35x platinum. That year Thomas also produced Williams' Academy Award winning single, "Colors of the Wind," for the multi-platinum selling motion picture soundtrack, Pocahontas.
In 1997, Thomas completed tracks for Grant's next album, Behind The Eyes and Williams' follow up album, Next. He also produced records for Michael Bolton, Luther Vandross, Brian McKnight, Tamia and Puff Johnson.
In early 1998, Thomas produced several songs for Williams and Jon Secada for the movie, Dance with Me. He also produced the track, "I Do (Cherish You)," for 98°'s multi-platinum album on Universal Records, 98° and Rising. The song was also featured in the Julia Roberts/Hugh Grant romantic comedy, Notting Hill. In addition, Thomas was nominated for a Grammy for Producer of the Year for the 1998 Grammy awards.
In late 1998, Thomas served as the principle Producer and co-Executive Producer for the multi-artist Touched By An Angel album featuring songs inspired by the popular television series. On this project, Thomas worked with Deana Carter, Amy Grant, Faith Hill, Uncle Sam and Wynonna.
Early in 1999, Thomas produced the track "Precious Wings" on MJJ artist Tatyana Ali for the movie, The Adventures of Elmo in Grouchland. During that year he also produced tracks for Yolanda Adams, Wild Orchid and Vanessa Williams. Thomas also produced the song, "You're Where I Belong," for Trisha Yearwood for the movie, Stuart Little.
2000s[edit]
In early 2000, Thomas wrote and produced the hit song, "I Wanna Be With You," for Mandy Moore. The song was featured in the Columbia Pictures film, Center Stage.
After a three-year hiatus at the turn of the millennium, in 2005 Thomas formed Levosia Entertainment, with an emphasis on developing young undiscovered talent. His initial discovery, Jordan Pruitt, he signed with Hollywood Records, and in conjunction with the release of her debut album, No Ordinary Girl, Jordan opened for numerous Disney sponsored concert tours, including High School Musical: The Concert, The Cheetah Girls and Demo Lovato.
Thomas next became aware of a young YouTube sensation, Savannah Outen. Her three singles released to Radio Disney, "Goodbyes", "If You Only Knew" and "Fighting For My Life", received unprecedented airplay for an independent label artist, twice beating out The Jonas Brothers and The High School Musical for the Dot Com Top 3 #1 position. Under Thomas’s watch, Savannah’s YouTube fan response grew to 75 million YouTube views with 250,000 subscribers.
In 2009 Thomas produced the Grammy Award winning Heather Headley album, Audience of One. In 2012 Thomas produced the Grammy nominated band, forever JONES’ new album, Musical Revival released April 10, 2012 on EMI Records. He also reconnected with Headley in 2012 to produce a project in conjunction with her lead role in the stage adaptation of The Body Guard, which opened in the UK, November 2012. The Whitney Houston tribute moves from the UK to Broadway in 2014.[needs update]
2010s[edit]
Thomas also produced the title track and three additional songs for The Voice finalist, Chris Mann’s 2012 debut CD, Roads on Universal Republic.
In early 2013 Thomas was asked to participate in the reality series Chasing Nashville on Lifetime, which follows seven aspiring artists from West Virginia, Kentucky and North Carolina.

Career[1][edit]
Born and raised in the Atlanta suburb of Conyers, GA., Thomas was singing lead for his father's gospel group by the age of nine. His ability as a keyboard player led him, while still in High School, to recording sessions in Atlanta studios. Here he came to the attention of country superstar Ronnie Milsap.
Thomas moved to Nashville as Ronnie's first staff writer for Milsap's newly formed publishing company, Ronjoy Music. Shortly thereafter, Thomas signed on with Word Records and began a seven-year tenure as their staff writer and producer. During this time, Thomas produced over 16 albums for various artists earning over 20 #1 singles.
Encouraged by this success, Thomas left Word and founded his own publishing and production company, Yellow Elephant Music, and began writing and producing music for BeBe & CeCe Winans. During their four album collaboration, the three sold over 3 million albums and had nine top 30 singles, six of which went top 10 and two of which went #1. As a result of this relationship, BeBe & CeCe earned four Grammy awards, an additional Grammy nomination, and five Dove awards.
1990s[edit]
In 1991, Thomas crossed over into the world of mainstream pop when he partnered with longtime friend Amy Grant to garner their first #1, Top 40 hit, "Baby Baby." At the same time, Thomas focused his talents on former Miss America, soon to become international pop and movie star, Vanessa Williams. He wrote and produced five tracks on her Comfort Zone album including the #1 hit, "Save the Best for Last". These two #1 songs with Grant and Williams earned Thomas Grammy nominations for Producer of the Year, Song of the Year, and Record of the Year.
Responding to the momentum created by this success, Thomas acquired The Bennett House recording complex in Franklin, TN. Twenty minutes from downtown Nashville, The Bennett House not only accommodates Thomas' personal project studio and administrative offices but also offers outside clients a 19th-century recording environment that is unique in the Nashville music scene.
Christening the move into The Bennett House, Thomas turned his attention again to Amy Grant by writing and producing for her House of Love album. This album boasted several hits for Thomas including the songs, "Lucky One," and the title track, "House of Love." Thomas produced the song "The Sweetest Days" for Vanessa Williams as well as records for James Ingram, Peabo Bryson, Deborah Cox, Regina Belle and Wendy Moten. In 1995, Thomas wrote and produced the hit song, "I Could Fall In Love," for Selena. Selena thus became the first artist to place both a Spanish- and an English-language song in the top 10 of the Hot Latin Tracks chart. "I Could Fall in Love" became the fifth best-charting song from that chart in 1995 and remained the highest-charting English-language song for two years, until Celine Dion's 1998 single "My Heart Will Go On" surpassed it when it peaked at number 1. The album, Dreaming Of You, on which "I Could Fall In Love" appears, has now been certified 35x platinum. That year Thomas also produced Williams' Academy Award winning single, "Colors of the Wind," for the multi-platinum selling motion picture soundtrack, Pocahontas.
In 1997, Thomas completed tracks for Grant's next album, Behind The Eyes and Williams' follow up album, Next. He also produced records for Michael Bolton, Luther Vandross, Brian McKnight, Tamia and Puff Johnson.
In early 1998, Thomas produced several songs for Williams and Jon Secada for the movie, Dance with Me. He also produced the track, "I Do (Cherish You)," for 98°'s multi-platinum album on Universal Records, 98° and Rising. The song was also featured in the Julia Roberts/Hugh Grant romantic comedy, Notting Hill. In addition, Thomas was nominated for a Grammy for Producer of the Year for the 1998 Grammy awards.
In late 1998, Thomas served as the principle Producer and co-Executive Producer for the multi-artist Touched By An Angel album featuring songs inspired by the popular television series. On this project, Thomas worked with Deana Carter, Amy Grant, Faith Hill, Uncle Sam and Wynonna.
Early in 1999, Thomas produced the track "Precious Wings" on MJJ artist Tatyana Ali for the movie, The Adventures of Elmo in Grouchland. During that year he also produced tracks for Yolanda Adams, Wild Orchid and Vanessa Williams. Thomas also produced the song, "You're Where I Belong," for Trisha Yearwood for the movie, Stuart Little.
2000s[edit]
In early 2000, Thomas wrote and produced the hit song, "I Wanna Be With You," for Mandy Moore. The song was featured in the Columbia Pictures film, Center Stage.
After a three-year hiatus at the turn of the millennium, in 2005 Thomas formed Levosia Entertainment, with an emphasis on developing young undiscovered talent. His initial discovery, Jordan Pruitt, he signed with Hollywood Records, and in conjunction with the release of her debut album, No Ordinary Girl, Jordan opened for numerous Disney sponsored concert tours, including High School Musical: The Concert, The Cheetah Girls and Demo Lovato.
Thomas next became aware of a young YouTube sensation, Savannah Outen. Her three singles released to Radio Disney, "Goodbyes", "If You Only Knew" and "Fighting For My Life", received unprecedented airplay for an independent label artist, twice beating out The Jonas Brothers and The High School Musical for the Dot Com Top 3 #1 position. Under Thomas’s watch, Savannah’s YouTube fan response grew to 75 million YouTube views with 250,000 subscribers.
In 2009 Thomas produced the Grammy Award winning Heather Headley album, Audience of One. In 2012 Thomas produced the Grammy nominated band, forever JONES’ new album, Musical Revival released April 10, 2012 on EMI Records. He also reconnected with Headley in 2012 to produce a project in conjunction with her lead role in the stage adaptation of The Body Guard, which opened in the UK, November 2012. The Whitney Houston tribute moves from the UK to Broadway in 2014.[needs update]
2010s[edit]
Thomas also produced the title track and three additional songs for The Voice finalist, Chris Mann’s 2012 debut CD, Roads on Universal Republic.
In early 2013 Thomas was asked to participate in the reality series Chasing Nashville on Lifetime, which follows seven aspiring artists from West Virginia, Kentucky and North Carolina.

Career[1][edit]
Born and raised in the Atlanta suburb of Conyers, GA., Thomas was singing lead for his father's gospel group by the age of nine. His ability as a keyboard player led him, while still in High School, to recording sessions in Atlanta studios. Here he came to the attention of country superstar Ronnie Milsap.
Thomas moved to Nashville as Ronnie's first staff writer for Milsap's newly formed publishing company, Ronjoy Music. Shortly thereafter, Thomas signed on with Word Records and began a seven-year tenure as their staff writer and producer. During this time, Thomas produced over 16 albums for various artists earning over 20 #1 singles.
Encouraged by this success, Thomas left Word and founded his own publishing and production company, Yellow Elephant Music, and began writing and producing music for BeBe & CeCe Winans. During their four album collaboration, the three sold over 3 million albums and had nine top 30 singles, six of which went top 10 and two of which went #1. As a result of this relationship, BeBe & CeCe earned four Grammy awards, an additional Grammy nomination, and five Dove awards.
1990s[edit]
In 1991, Thomas crossed over into the world of mainstream pop when he partnered with longtime friend Amy Grant to garner their first #1, Top 40 hit, "Baby Baby." At the same time, Thomas focused his talents on former Miss America, soon to become international pop and movie star, Vanessa Williams. He wrote and produced five tracks on her Comfort Zone album including the #1 hit, "Save the Best for Last". These two #1 songs with Grant and Williams earned Thomas Grammy nominations for Producer of the Year, Song of the Year, and Record of the Year.
Responding to the momentum created by this success, Thomas acquired The Bennett House recording complex in Franklin, TN. Twenty minutes from downtown Nashville, The Bennett House not only accommodates Thomas' personal project studio and administrative offices but also offers outside clients a 19th-century recording environment that is unique in the Nashville music scene.
Christening the move into The Bennett House, Thomas turned his attention again to Amy Grant by writing and producing for her House of Love album. This album boasted several hits for Thomas including the songs, "Lucky One," and the title track, "House of Love." Thomas produced the song "The Sweetest Days" for Vanessa Williams as well as records for James Ingram, Peabo Bryson, Deborah Cox, Regina Belle and Wendy Moten. In 1995, Thomas wrote and produced the hit song, "I Could Fall In Love," for Selena. Selena thus became the first artist to place both a Spanish- and an English-language song in the top 10 of the Hot Latin Tracks chart. "I Could Fall in Love" became the fifth best-charting song from that chart in 1995 and remained the highest-charting English-language song for two years, until Celine Dion's 1998 single "My Heart Will Go On" surpassed it when it peaked at number 1. The album, Dreaming Of You, on which "I Could Fall In Love" appears, has now been certified 35x platinum. That year Thomas also produced Williams' Academy Award winning single, "Colors of the Wind," for the multi-platinum selling motion picture soundtrack, Pocahontas.
In 1997, Thomas completed tracks for Grant's next album, Behind The Eyes and Williams' follow up album, Next. He also produced records for Michael Bolton, Luther Vandross, Brian McKnight, Tamia and Puff Johnson.
In early 1998, Thomas produced several songs for Williams and Jon Secada for the movie, Dance with Me. He also produced the track, "I Do (Cherish You)," for 98°'s multi-platinum album on Universal Records, 98° and Rising. The song was also featured in the Julia Roberts/Hugh Grant romantic comedy, Notting Hill. In addition, Thomas was nominated for a Grammy for Producer of the Year for the 1998 Grammy awards.
In late 1998, Thomas served as the principle Producer and co-Executive Producer for the multi-artist Touched By An Angel album featuring songs inspired by the popular television series. On this project, Thomas worked with Deana Carter, Amy Grant, Faith Hill, Uncle Sam and Wynonna.
Early in 1999, Thomas produced the track "Precious Wings" on MJJ artist Tatyana Ali for the movie, The Adventures of Elmo in Grouchland. During that year he also produced tracks for Yolanda Adams, Wild Orchid and Vanessa Williams. Thomas also produced the song, "You're Where I Belong," for Trisha Yearwood for the movie, Stuart Little.
2000s[edit]
In early 2000, Thomas wrote and produced the hit song, "I Wanna Be With You," for Mandy Moore. The song was featured in the Columbia Pictures film, Center Stage.
After a three-year hiatus at the turn of the millennium, in 2005 Thomas formed Levosia Entertainment, with an emphasis on developing young undiscovered talent. His initial discovery, Jordan Pruitt, he signed with Hollywood Records, and in conjunction with the release of her debut album, No Ordinary Girl, Jordan opened for numerous Disney sponsored concert tours, including High School Musical: The Concert, The Cheetah Girls and Demo Lovato.
Thomas next became aware of a young YouTube sensation, Savannah Outen. Her three singles released to Radio Disney, "Goodbyes", "If You Only Knew" and "Fighting For My Life", received unprecedented airplay for an independent label artist, twice beating out The Jonas Brothers and The High School Musical for the Dot Com Top 3 #1 position. Under Thomas’s watch, Savannah’s YouTube fan response grew to 75 million YouTube views with 250,000 subscribers.
In 2009 Thomas produced the Grammy Award winning Heather Headley album, Audience of One. In 2012 Thomas produced the Grammy nominated band, forever JONES’ new album, Musical Revival released April 10, 2012 on EMI Records. He also reconnected with Headley in 2012 to produce a project in conjunction with her lead role in the stage adaptation of The Body Guard, which opened in the UK, November 2012. The Whitney Houston tribute moves from the UK to Broadway in 2014.[needs update]
2010s[edit]
Thomas also produced the title track and three additional songs for The Voice finalist, Chris Mann’s 2012 debut CD, Roads on Universal Republic.
In early 2013 Thomas was asked to participate in the reality series Chasing Nashville on Lifetime, which follows seven aspiring artists from West Virginia, Kentucky and North Carolina.

Whitehorse Close in Edinburgh, from a calotype by Thomas Keith


Thomas Keith MA, MD, LL.D., FRCSEd (27 May 1827 – 9 October 1895 ), was a Victorian surgeon and amateur photographer from Scotland. He developed and improved the wax paper process and his photographs are recognised for their composition and use of shade. He was an early practitioner of the operation of ovariotomy (ovarian cystectomy) where his published results were amongst the best in the world.

Early life and education[edit]
Thomas Keith was born in St Cyrus, Kincardineshire in 1827, one of seven sons of Rev. Dr. Alexander Keith, a Church of Scotland minister, one of the 450 who broke away to form the Free Church of Scotland, an event known as the Disruption of 1843. Rev Keith took an early interest in photography travelling with his elder son George Skene Keith (1819-1910) to the Holy Land in 1844 where he took daguerreotype views of notable places in Syria.[1] This early family interest in photography when it was still in its infancy was undoubtedly a major stimulus to the photographic career of Thomas Keith which began some eight years after the expedition of his father and brother to the Holy Land. Keith's mother, Jane Blaikie (1793–1837), was the sister of Sir Thomas Blaikie, the Scottish magistrate. Three of Thomas Keith's brothers entered the medical profession.[2]
Thomas Keith was educated at Aberdeen Grammar School and the Royal High School, Edinburgh then studied at Marischal College, Aberdeen where he qualified MA. His medical training took place entirely in Edinburgh.[3]
Early Surgical Career[edit]
In 1848, at the age of 21 he graduated MD from the University of Edinburgh and was appointed house surgeon in the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh to James Syme (1799–1870), the Professor of Surgery. This appointment was to last for fifteen months and it was during this time that he learned from Syme the principles of surgery which were to form the basis of his future success. It was from Syme that he came to appreciate the importance of absolute cleanliness in the surgical wound and meticulous attention to detail, particularly with haemostasis. Their respect was mutual. When Syme’s wife became ill, Syme, who could have chosen any surgeon in the land to attend her, chose Keith. Keith was succeeded as house surgeon by the young Joseph Lister, and the two remained friends for life.
Before starting in practice in Edinburgh, Keith spent two years in Turin as a surgeon to a family friend, the Hon Ralph Abercromby, British resident minister (ambassador) at the Court of Victor Emmanuel II, the King of Sardinia (and later first King of a united Italy).[4]
On return to Edinburgh, Keith went into medical practice with his brother George Skene Keith (1819–1910) in Great Stuart Street. George had studied medicine in Aberdeen and Edinburgh, qualified MD in 1841 and become FRCPE in 1845.[5] In that year he became assistant to Professor James Young Simpson, Professor of Midwifery at the University of Edinburgh. On 4 November 1847, Simpson with George Keith and his other assistant James Mathews Duncan (1826–1890), (another photographic enthusiast), conducted the famous experiment at 52 Queen Street, Edinburgh during which the trio discovered the anaesthetic effects of chloroform.[6]
Thomas Keith came to specialise in gynaecology and in 1862 performed his first ovariotomy (excision of ovarian cyst) but in the years 1853–56 he devoted much of his time to photography.[7]
Photographic career[edit]
The leading pioneers of photography in Scotland included David Octavius Hill and Robert Adamson whose many calotypes included a portrait of Thomas Keith’s father, Rev. Alexander Keith. This early contact with them, and with the other photographic pioneers Sir David Brewster and Dr James Brewster, had stimulated Rev. Keith and his son George to learn how to produce daguerreotypes. This in turn initiated Thomas Keith's interest.[8]
He was a founding member of the Photographic Society of Scotland.
In his photography Thomas Keith used the waxed paper process developed by Gustave Le Gray (1820-1884), which he simplified and improved. His work showed great artistic skill and a mastery of the chemistry involved.These included a series of intricate chemical processes including waxing the paper before iodising it with a solution of potassium iodide and other chemicals, then sensitising it to light with a solution of silver nitrate and acetic acid. Keith published the details of his modification of le Gray’s technique in Photographic Notes in 1856, noting that the original technique was ‘not suitable for our climate’. He describes various changes he tried in the chemical solutions, in timing and in temperature, all carefully recorded along with their effects on the final image. This account shows his meticulous attention to detail and his willingness to innovate and experiment.[9] He often shared his photographic excursions around Edinburgh with his brother-in-law John Forbes White. Because of the pressures inflicted by his medical practice, Keith did not continue with photography after 1856, but by this time he had created a priceless photographic record of nineteenth-century Edinburgh and images of Dysart in Fife and Iona.
Keith's prints and negatives are held by a number of institutions including the Edinburgh Central Library, the Scottish National Portrait Gallery, the Royal Scottish Academy, the National Museum of Photography, Film and Television, the Canadian Centre for Architecture, George Eastman House, Harry Ransom Center [10][11][12][13]
Later surgical career[edit]
After 1856 Keith devoted himself to surgery and in particular to the then new and controversial procedure of ovariotomy. The first documented successful performance of this procedure was by Ephraim McDowell (1771–1830) in Kentucky in 1809.[14] McDowell had studied surgery in Edinburgh under John Bell (1763–1820) who described the operation but never performed it. Bell’s successor in Edinburgh John Lizars (1787–1860), was sent McDowell’s account and he performed the first successful ovariotomy in Britain, publishing the results in 1825. [15] Surgeons like Charles Clay (1801–1893) in Manchester and Thomas Spencer Wells (1818-1897) in London began to perform the procedure regularly, but the mortality rate was so high that mainstream medical opinion felt that it was too dangerous to perform. [16] Keith performed his first ovariotomy in 1862, having learned the technique from Spencer Wells.[17] From the outset he recorded his results in detail. His early mortality rate was consistently lower [18] that of other published series like Spencer Wells [19] Keith further reduced the mortality rate to 4% when he began to use antiseptic technique, taught to him by his lifelong friend Joseph Lister. [20]
The leading American gynaecologist J. Marion Sims (1813–1883) visited Keith to find the ‘secret’ of these remarkable results and concluded that Keith’s meticulous attention to detail was largely responsible for his ‘success which so outstripped that of all other operators, that it became a wonder and admiration of surgeons all over the world.’ [21] Keith gained a wordwide reputation. He began to perform the hysterectomy procedure, again with low mortality compared to other published series. [22] In 1888 Keith moved to London, living at Charles Street, Berkeley Square. His reputation was such that he was consulted by eminent people such as Lady Randolph Churchill (1854-1921), but his years here were dogged by ill health. The congenital cystinuria, which had caused him to pass urinary calculi from childhood and had required operations, now caused a renal abscess which drained by his son and surgical partner Skene Keith (1858–1919.[3] He attributed some of his health problems to the large quantities of bicarbonate which he took to combat the condition and his repeated exposure to antiseptic agents may also have been a factor in his death at the age of 67.[3]
He died early on the morning of Wednesday, 9 October 1895 and was buried in Kensal Green Cemetery. On 4 June 1854 he had married Elizabeth Johnston, first cousin to Jessie (née Grindlay) wife of Sir James Young Simpson, and they had had six children, all of whom survived him.[3]

This appointment was to last for fifteen months and it was during this time that he learned from Syme the principles of surgery which were to form the basis of his future success. It was from Syme that he came to appreciate the importance of absolute cleanliness in the surgical wound and meticulous attention to detail, particularly with haemostasis. Their respect was mutual. When Syme’s wife became ill, Syme, who could have chosen any surgeon in the land to attend her, chose Keith. Keith was succeeded as house surgeon by the young Joseph Lister, and the two remained friends for life.
Before starting in practice in Edinburgh, Keith spent two years in Turin as a surgeon to a family friend, the Hon Ralph Abercromby, British resident minister (ambassador) at the Court of Victor Emmanuel II, the King of Sardinia (and later first King of a united Italy).[4]
On return to Edinburgh, Keith went into medical practice with his brother George Skene Keith (1819–1910) in Great Stuart Street. George had studied medicine in Aberdeen and Edinburgh, qualified MD in 1841 and become FRCPE in 1845.[5] In that year he became assistant to Professor James Young Simpson, Professor of Midwifery at the University of Edinburgh. On 4 November 1847, Simpson with George Keith and his other assistant James Mathews Duncan (1826–1890), (another photographic enthusiast), conducted the famous experiment at 52 Queen Street, Edinburgh during which the trio discovered the anaesthetic effects of chloroform.[6]
Thomas Keith came to specialise in gynaecology and in 1862 performed his first ovariotomy (excision of ovarian cyst) but in the years 1853–56 he devoted much of his time to photography.[7]
Photographic career[edit]
The leading pioneers of photography in Scotland included David Octavius Hill and Robert Adamson whose many calotypes included a portrait of Thomas Keith’s father, Rev. Alexander Keith. This early contact with them, and with the other photographic pioneers Sir David Brewster and Dr James Brewster, had stimulated Rev. Keith and his son George to learn how to produce daguerreotypes. This in turn initiated Thomas Keith's interest.[8]
He was a founding member of the Photographic Society of Scotland.
In his photography Thomas Keith used the waxed paper process developed by Gustave Le Gray (1820-1884), which he simplified and improved. His work showed great artistic skill and a mastery of the chemistry involved.These included a series of intricate chemical processes including waxing the paper before iodising it with a solution of potassium iodide and other chemicals, then sensitising it to light with a solution of silver nitrate and acetic acid. Keith published the details of his modification of le Gray’s technique in Photographic Notes in 1856, noting that the original technique was ‘not suitable for our climate’. He describes various changes he tried in the chemical solutions, in timing and in temperature, all carefully recorded along with their effects on the final image. This account shows his meticulous attention to detail and his willingness to innovate and experiment.[9] He often shared his photographic excursions around Edinburgh with his brother-in-law John Forbes White. Because of the pressures inflicted by his medical practice, Keith did not continue with photography after 1856, but by this time he had created a priceless photographic record of nineteenth-century Edinburgh and images of Dysart in Fife and Iona.
Keith's prints and negatives are held by a number of institutions including the Edinburgh Central Library, the Scottish National Portrait Gallery, the Royal Scottish Academy, the National Museum of Photography, Film and Television, the Canadian Centre for Architecture, George Eastman House, Harry Ransom Center [10][11][12][13]
Later surgical career[edit]
After 1856 Keith devoted himself to surgery and in particular to the then new and controversial procedure of ovariotomy. The first documented successful performance of this procedure was by Ephraim McDowell (1771–1830) in Kentucky in 1809.[14] McDowell had studied surgery in Edinburgh under John Bell (1763–1820) who described the operation but never performed it. Bell’s successor in Edinburgh John Lizars (1787–1860), was sent McDowell’s account and he performed the first successful ovariotomy in Britain, publishing the results in 1825. [15] Surgeons like Charles Clay (1801–1893) in Manchester and Thomas Spencer Wells (1818-1897) in London began to perform the procedure regularly, but the mortality rate was so high that mainstream medical opinion felt that it was too dangerous to perform. [16] Keith performed his first ovariotomy in 1862, having learned the technique from Spencer Wells.[17] From the outset he recorded his results in detail. His early mortality rate was consistently lower [18] that of other published series like Spencer Wells [19] Keith further reduced the mortality rate to 4% when he began to use antiseptic technique, taught to him by his lifelong friend Joseph Lister. [20]
The leading American gynaecologist J. Marion Sims (1813–1883) visited Keith to find the ‘secret’ of these remarkable results and concluded that Keith’s meticulous attention to detail was largely responsible for his ‘success which so outstripped that of all other operators, that it became a wonder and admiration of surgeons all over the world.’ [21] Keith gained a wordwide reputation. He began to perform the hysterectomy procedure, again with low mortality compared to other published series. [22] In 1888 Keith moved to London, living at Charles Street, Berkeley Square. His reputation was such that he was consulted by eminent people such as Lady Randolph Churchill (1854-1921), but his years here were dogged by ill health. The congenital cystinuria, which had caused him to pass urinary calculi from childhood and had required operations, now caused a renal abscess which drained by his son and surgical partner Skene Keith (1858–1919.[3] He attributed some of his health problems to the large quantities of bicarbonate which he took to combat the condition and his repeated exposure to antiseptic agents may also have been a factor in his death at the age of 67.[3]
He died early on the morning of Wednesday, 9 October 1895 and was buried in Kensal Green Cemetery. On 4 June 1854 he had married Elizabeth Johnston, first cousin to Jessie (née Grindlay) wife of Sir James Young Simpson, and they had had six children, all of whom survived him.[3]

Early life and education[edit]
Thomas Keith was born in St Cyrus, Kincardineshire in 1827, one of seven sons of Rev. Dr. Alexander Keith, a Church of Scotland minister, one of the 450 who broke away to form the Free Church of Scotland, an event known as the Disruption of 1843. Rev Keith took an early interest in photography travelling with his elder son George Skene Keith (1819-1910) to the Holy Land in 1844 where he took daguerreotype views of notable places in Syria.[1] This early family interest in photography when it was still in its infancy was undoubtedly a major stimulus to the photographic career of Thomas Keith which began some eight years after the expedition of his father and brother to the Holy Land. Keith's mother, Jane Blaikie (1793–1837), was the sister of Sir Thomas Blaikie, the Scottish magistrate. Three of Thomas Keith's brothers entered the medical profession.[2]
Thomas Keith was educated at Aberdeen Grammar School and the Royal High School, Edinburgh then studied at Marischal College, Aberdeen where he qualified MA. His medical training took place entirely in Edinburgh.[3]

After 1856 Keith devoted himself to surgery and in particular to the then new and controversial procedure of ovariotomy. The first documented successful performance of this procedure was by Ephraim McDowell (1771–1830) in Kentucky in 1809.[14] McDowell had studied surgery in Edinburgh under John Bell (1763–1820) who described the operation but never performed it. Bell’s successor in Edinburgh John Lizars (1787–1860), was sent McDowell’s account and he performed the first successful ovariotomy in Britain, publishing the results in 1825. [15] Surgeons like Charles Clay (1801–1893) in Manchester and Thomas Spencer Wells (1818-1897) in London began to perform the procedure regularly, but the mortality rate was so high that mainstream medical opinion felt that it was too dangerous to perform. [16] Keith performed his first ovariotomy in 1862, having learned the technique from Spencer Wells.[17] From the outset he recorded his results in detail. His early mortality rate was consistently lower [18] that of other published series like Spencer Wells [19] Keith further reduced the mortality rate to 4% when he began to use antiseptic technique, taught to him by his lifelong friend Joseph Lister. [20]
The leading American gynaecologist J. Marion Sims (1813–1883) visited Keith to find the ‘secret’ of these remarkable results and concluded that Keith’s meticulous attention to detail was largely responsible for his ‘success which so outstripped that of all other operators, that it became a wonder and admiration of surgeons all over the world.’ [21] Keith gained a wordwide reputation. He began to perform the hysterectomy procedure, again with low mortality compared to other published series. [22] In 1888 Keith moved to London, living at Charles Street, Berkeley Square. His reputation was such that he was consulted by eminent people such as Lady Randolph Churchill (1854-1921), but his years here were dogged by ill health. The congenital cystinuria, which had caused him to pass urinary calculi from childhood and had required operations, now caused a renal abscess which drained by his son and surgical partner Skene Keith (1858–1919.[3] He attributed some of his health problems to the large quantities of bicarbonate which he took to combat the condition and his repeated exposure to antiseptic agents may also have been a factor in his death at the age of 67.[3]
He died early on the morning of Wednesday, 9 October 1895 and was buried in Kensal Green Cemetery. On 4 June 1854 he had married Elizabeth Johnston, first cousin to Jessie (née Grindlay) wife of Sir James Young Simpson, and they had had six children, all of whom survived him.[3]
