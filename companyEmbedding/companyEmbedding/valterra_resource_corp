Valterra Identifies New High-grade Samples at the Bobcaygeon Graphite Project
June 18, 2014
Valterra Resource Corporation (TSX.V: VQA; the “Company” or “Valterra”) reported today that new sampling from the Bobcaygeon graphite property located in southern Ontario, continues to expand and develop targeting at two prospects on the project.
Sampling and mapping at the Salerno Zone returned values of up to 24.5% Cg over 1.0 metres in graphite-rich horizons within gneissic marbles near the contact with gneissic clastic metasedimentary rocks. The new assay results confirm both earlier sampling in the area and extend mineralization to the north and northeast. The graphite-rich horizon lies along the north contact of the Salerno Creek Deformation Zone, and is believed to extend some 1800 meters to the west and is up to 60 to 120 meters wide. Further sampling on the Salerno Creek Zone suggests that there is potential for several other parallel zones located to the north of the current sampling; assays from these samples are pending. 
Table: Select Assays from Surface Sampling on the Bobcaygeon Project

The Salerno Creek Zone is one of two areas identified by the company that have been targeted for drill testing in 2014, pending financing, as part of the continued exploration of the Bobcaygeon project.
Mapping at the Crystal zone has identified visible graphite throughout a +120 meter wide corridor within a gneissic clastic metasediment and a gneissic marble; where the contacts are bounded by major fault zones. Surface chip sampling has identified wide intervals of +1% Cg throughout the zone including 2.9% Cg over 7.0 metres and 2.5% Cg over 4.0 metres, with additional anomalous graphite values identified in sampling approximately 250 metres to the south and several hundred metres to the northeast of the current sampling. Visually the zone appears to continue on all sides. Trenching and further surface reconnaissance is warranted to upgrade this zone for drill targeting. The Crystal Zone is located between the Discovery Zone to the southwest and the Salerno Zone to the northeast and provides geological continuity along the +24 kilometre strike-length of the graphitic stratigraphy located on the Bobcaygeon property.

About the Bobcaygeon Project
The Bobcaygeon Graphite Property is favorably situated in Precambrian calcitic marble of the Grenville Province with four past producing flake-graphite mines located to the northeast of the property and within the same geological belt. At least six flake graphite-bearing zones, ranging from +1 metre to +100 metres thick, have been located on surface and numerous other targets are indicated over a +24 kilometre strike-length; all of which require further definition before the full potential of the project can be determined.
High-grade graphite horizons (+5% Cg) occur on the property at the Discovery and Salerno zones. Trenching at the Discovery zone has uncovered a high-grade vein which returned graphite values of 36.8% Cg over 1.5m, 20.2% Cg over 1.4m, and 14.6% Cg over 0.7m. Sampling and mapping has identified a drill-ready target of over 600 metres that is supported by recent EM and IP/Res geophysics on the property. Scout drilling at the Discovery zone trench has identified high-grade graphite averaging 6.4% Cg over 3.4 metres about 12 metres down dip from the surface sampling.
Historic drilling in the 1990’s at the Salerno Zone (for zinc) identified graphite-bearing stratigraphy over a +2km strike length. Mapping in the area has identified multiple graphite horizons and sampling has confirmed the high-grade potential of this newly developed occurrence. Current planning would test through drilling a +4 kilometre cumulative strike-length of the target area.
Further regional work including mapping, prospecting and trenching is planned to delineate the full extent of the graphitic stratigraphy throughout the property.
About Valterra Resource Corporation
Valterra is focused on early stage mineral properties with the potential to host large deposits, in regions with excellent infrastructure. Over the last several years, Valterra has acquired and developed several key projects including the Swift Katie porphyry copper gold mineral property in which it holds a 100% interest subject to an option agreement with the Riverside Alliance which has the right to earn an 80% interest through the expenditure of $4 million over four years with 2014 expenditures estimated at $600,000.
The Company is currently earning a 100% interest in the Bobcaygeon graphite property situated within the Grenville Graphite Trend of southeast Ontario which it intends to develop as its primary property as part of its focus on the graphite sector. Through its recently announced production and marketing strategic alliance with Great Lakes Graphite Inc., Valterra looks to access the increasing demand for high-grade graphite product throughout North America. Alliance partner, Great Lakes Graphite Inc. continues its development of promising graphite properties in Quebec on the eastern portion of the prolific Grenville Graphite Trend.

Valterra Resource Corp. Acquires Option to Purchase the Weepah Mesothermal Gold Project; Provides Swift-Katie Exploration Update - Junior Mining Network











































































			Valterra Resource Corp. Acquires Option to Purchase the Weepah Mesothermal Gold Project; Provides Swift-Katie Exploration Update		



                        Project Acquisition                    



                        Nevada                    




Vancouver, British Columbia--(Newsfile Corp. - June 26, 2017) - Valterra Resource Corporation (TSXV: VQA) (OTCQB: VRSCF) ("Valterra") reported today that the Company has acquired an option to purchase the Weepah Mesothermal Gold project in Esmeralda County, Nevada from Nevada Select Royalty, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Ely Gold & Minerals Inc. (TSXV: ELY) (OTC Pink: ELYGF).
The property consists of 76 lode mining claims and one (1) patented claim, totaling approximately 590 hectares, and is accessible from Highway 95 approximately 32 km southwest of the town of Tonopah, Nevada. The Weepah property lies within the prolific Walker Lane Gold belt in western Nevada and is surrounded by active advanced exploration and development gold projects with growing mineral resources and reserves, including Eastside (Columbus Gold), Mineral Ridge (Scorpio Gold), Three Hills and Hasbrouck (West Kirkland), and Gemfield (private).
Valterra, through its wholly-owned Nevada subsidiary, may acquire a 100% interest in the property by making the following staged payments totaling US$1 million over a period of four years: US$100,000 at closing (which may be paid in shares); US$100,000 on first anniversary of closing (which may be paid in shares); US$200,000 on second anniversary of closing; US$200,000 on third anniversary of closing; and US$400,000 on fourth anniversary of closing. The property is subject to royalties totaling 3% of net smelter returns which Valterra may reduce to 2% for US$2.5 million. Advance minimum royalty payments will be due upon the anniversary of the option exercise as follows: US$25,000 on first, second and third anniversaries, and US$35,000 on subsequent anniversaries.
Historical production at Weepah occurred from shallow underground mines and a small open pit during two separate time intervals. From 1935 to 1939, Weepah Nevada Mining Co. produced gold from 305,000 metric tonnes grading 5.8g/t. From 1986 to 1987, Sunshine Mining Co. produced at various grades approximately 60,000 oz. of additional gold with accessory silver. Historic production figures are from several published and unpublished company reports; however, a qualified person has not done sufficient work to verify these grades and tonnages, and Valterra cautions that these historic production figures should not be relied upon.
The gold mineralization at Weepah occurs within two broad shear zones. The western shear zone was exploited by the small open pit and adjacent underground workings. The eastern shear zone was exploited by historic workings and was extended by recent drilling. The zones have been traced for several hundred meters along strike and variably down dip. Portions of the shear zones are exposed at surface or in workings and portions have been traced by widely spaced drill holes beneath shallow gravel cover, which is generally less than 10m to 30m thick. Vein textures and geochemistry suggest the mineralization is similar to many other mesothermal vein deposits along the western margin of North America.
Work conducted by Valterra earlier this year included data compilation, 3D modeling, and identification of drill targets. Confirmation sampling by Valterra in the open pit yielded results similar to those reported by others. Highlighted Valterra sampling includes:

South Pit face - Chip-channel samples of up to 3m of 9.01 g/t Au and 7m of 5.67 g/t Au in two adjacent samples,
North Pit face - Chip-channel samples of up to 8m of 3.50 g/t Au and 1.2m of 2.81 g/t Au in two adjacent samples, and
Center of Pit - A float sample returned 16.2g/t Au and 10.6g/t Ag.

Historic data provided with the property includes various geophysical surveys, geological mapping, bedrock sampling, interpretation of satellite imagery, and 4300m in 24 Reverse Circulation (RC) drill holes. Based on historic drilling, CSAMT & magnetics, the two ~50m-wide mineralized structural zones have a combined strike potential of ~2,000m. Other advantages of the Property include excellent infrastructure, low topography, and minimal cultural and environmental concerns.
Proposed 2017 Exploration/drill program 
The company is planning an initial 2,250m drill program consisting of five fences along the two identified shear zones, with each fence consisting of three (3) drill holes each for a total of 15 holes. Additional sampling is planned to identify other potential shear zones and zoning patterns that have been indicated by multi-element geochemistry from very limited surface sampling.

2017 Swift-Katie Exploration Program
The initial 2017 Phase I mapping, soil sampling and drilling exploration program at Valterra's Swift-Katie Project in southern British Columbia, is scheduled to commence in early July and is budgeted at approximately C$250,000. Eight to ten core holes totaling 1300 metres are planned and will focus on the near-surface gold potential of an 2,500 metre long alteration zone that extends through the southern Swift part of the property.
Priority drill targets have been optimized with a focus on five areas of strongly anomalous gold mineralization (>0.5g/t Au over +10 metres in historical drilling and trenching) with higher-grade trench results of up to 8.5g/t Au over 2 metres and 100g/t Au over 2 metres.
Exploration results to date support the Company's belief of a widespread gold-enriched, vein system at the Swift target and a large alkali porphyry system at the Katie target. Further work will be designed to continue to expand the known mineral systems and evaluate several other targets which remain to be tested on the Project.
Valterra is currently funded to complete the proposed exploration work, permits with the BC regulatory agencies are in place and program planning activities are ongoing.
Appointment of Director
Valterra is pleased to announce the appointment of Joseph A. Kizis, Jr. as a director. Mr. Kizis is a Registered Geologist and a Certified Professional Geologist with a B.S. in Geology from Kent State University and an M.S. in Geology from the University of Colorado. He has 40 years of experience in exploration for gold, silver, copper, molybdenum, lead, zinc, and uranium in the U.S., Canada and abroad. He is the President and a director of Bravada Gold Corporation and previously of Homestake Resource Corporation as well as Fortune River Resource Corp. (which amalgamated with Bravada Gold Corporation in 2011). Mr. Kizis has held previous executive positions and directorships with Fairmile GoldTech, Sierra Geothermal, the Geological Society of Nevada, and the GSN Foundation.
President and Chairman Lawrence Page Q. C. commented, "Joe has been involved with the Manex Group of Companies for the past 15 years, working with an exceptional group of exploration geology consultants at our Reno Office. When Valterra received the Weepah submittal, we asked Joe and his group to evaluate the newly consolidated property as a potential acquisition. Based on their work, the Board invited Joe to join as a Director and to oversee exploration and development of Weepah using his experienced team in Reno."

Valterra is exploring for mineral deposits in British Columbia, Canada and Esmeralda County, Nevada and represents a well-structured and experienced geologic team, management group, and Board of Directors.

Valterra's recently aquired Weepah project in Esmeralda County, Nevada adds a high-grade, past producing gold property in the prolific Walker Lane Gold Belt in Nevada.
Confirmation sampling by Valterra in the open pit yielded results similar to those reported by others. Highlighted Valterra sampling includes:

South Pit face - Chip-channel samples of up to 3m of 9.01 g/t Au and 7m of 5.67 g/t Au in two adjacent samples,
North Pit face - Chip-channel samples of up to 8m of 3.50 g/t Au and 1.2m of 2.81 g/t Au in two adjacent samples, and
Center of Pit – A float sample returned 16.2g/t Au and 10.6g/t Ag.

Valterra is also active in south-eastern BC at Salmo and controls the >8,300 hectare ‘Swift Katie’ bulk-tonnage and high-grade porphyry/epithermal Au-Cu-Ag property.
The ‘Swift’ target was drilled in Q3/Q4 of 2016 with 6 NQ2 holes totalling 1,954m.  1980s to 2016 Drill Highlights*: 

6.6m averaging 0.96g/t Au in hole SK16-011
3.5m grading 13.3g/t Au, 201g/t Ag & 0.33% Cu from SK14-002
10m averaging 1.83g/t Au from hole 87-6, including 2.0m grading 5.15g/t Au;
1.5m grading 1.43g/t Au from hole 87-7; and 
3.6m averaging 1.27g/t Au from hole 87-8.

* Historical assay results have not been verified by Valterra and should not be relied upon as such.
The ‘Katie’ deposit is an alkaline Cu-Au-Ag porphyry system.  The potassic core has elevated Cu and Au values and is surrounded by a broad propylitic zone.  Sulphide minerals include pyrite, chalcopyrite with minor sphalerite, tetrahedrite, bornite and molybdenum.
The project has excellent infrastructure with major highways nearby, established forestry access routes on-site, proximal high capacity power network nearby and a skilled regional workforce (pop. >25,000 in the district).  Moreover, BC/Canada provides many generous investment and tax advantages in a politically stable jurisdiction.

Valterra and Great Lakes Graphite Form Strategic Alliance on Bobcaygeon Graphite Project Posted May 22, 2014  · Add Comment  

May 22, 2014, Toronto: Great Lakes Graphite Inc. (“Great Lakes Graphite”)(GLK-TSX.V) and Valterra Resource Corporation (“Valterra”)(VQA-TSX.V) have entered into a Strategic Alliance (“Alliance”) with respect to provision of services relating to development, production and marketing of graphite product from Valterra’s Bobcaygeon graphite property (“Bobcaygeon Project”) in Ontario.
The Alliance has an initial term of three years during which Great Lakes Graphite will provide consulting services to Valterra, utilizing its specialized personnel, to assist in the development of the Bobcaygeon Project inclusive of assistance in raising development money for the Project. In exchange for these services Valterra is providing Great Lakes with consulting fees and preferential access to ownership participation in the property.
President Lawrence Page Q.C. said “The relationship with Great Lakes Graphite provides Valterra with access to experts with unique and specialized knowledge of the graphite sector inclusive of all disciplines from exploration through to production and marketing. As Valterra develops a graphite resource at the Project, it can define extraction, beneficiation and sales procedures within the Alliance on a cost efficient basis”.
Great Lakes Graphite CEO Paul Gorman stated, “Bobcaygeon has all of the characteristics of an outstanding flake graphite project: grade, size potential and access to infrastructure and markets. When Great Lakes met with Valterra to discuss our mutual interest in the graphite space, we quickly realized there was an opportunity to work together to move Bobcaygeon forward faster. By leveraging the strengths of each company we can create value for both sets of shareholders.”
 About the Bobcaygeon Project 
The Bobcaygeon Graphite Property is favorably situated in Precambrian calcitic marble of the Grenville Province with four past producing flake-graphite mines located to the northeast of the property and within the same geological belt. At least six flake graphite-bearing zones, ranging from +1 metre to +100 metres thick, have been located on surface and numerous other targets are indicated over a +24km strike-length; all of which require further definition before the full potential of the project can be determined.
High-grade graphite horizons (+5% Cg) occur on the property at the Discovery and Salerno zones. Trenching at the Discovery zone has uncovered a high-grade vein which returned graphite values of 36.8% Cg over 1.5m, 20.2% Cg over 1.4m, 14.6% Cg over 0.7m. Sampling and mapping has identified a drill-ready target of over 600 metres that is supported by recent EM and IP/Res geophysics on the property.
Historic drilling in the 1990’s at the Salerno zone (for zinc) identified graphite-bearing stratigraphy over a +2km strike length. Mapping in the area has identified two different graphite horizons and sampling has confirmed the high-grade potential of this newly developed occurrence. Current planning would test through drilling a +4km cumulative strike-length of the target area.
Further regional work including mapping, prospecting and trenching is planned to delineate the full extent of the graphitic stratigraphy throughout the property.

("GRIL"), an arm's length party to Valterra.GRIL has been established to exploit investment opportunities in the junior mining and natural resources sectors worldwide, with an investment objective to generate medium and long-term capital growth. GRIL will re-register as a public company and be constituted as an investment trust with the name Global Resources Investment Trust Plc ("GRIT") and seek admission of its ordinary shares on the main market for listed securities on the London Stock Exchange. Pursuant to the share exchange agreement, GRIT will issue and deliver to Valterra 186,069 ordinary shares of GRIT at a deemed price of £1.00 per share (the "GRIT Shares") in exchange for the issuance of 6,000,000 units of Valterra at a deemed price of £0.031 (approximately $0.05) per unit. Each unit consists of one common share and one common share purchase warrant exercisable at $0.07 per share for a period of 2 years. Valterra will, at its election, sell the GRIT Shares through the facilities of the London Stock Exchange to realize proceeds of the transaction.Closing of the transaction is subject to a number of conditions precedent, including approval of the TSX Venture Exchange, and GRIT successfully listing on the London Stock Exchange.Bobcaygeon ProjectValterra has added 9 new claims totalling 55 units to the Bobcaygeon project located in Southeast Ontario. The claims have now been processed and registered with the Ontario government. The property now totals 172 claims, 9 patents and 4 leases for a total of 19,506 hectares (195.1 sq km), located within the Galway, Cavendish, Glamorgan, Anstruther, Cardiff and Monmouth townships.The new claims reflect the continued expansion of the claim group on its northern boundary and in particular the areas around the newly identified Crystal and Salerno graphite occurrences located 10 km and 23 km respectively along strike and to the northeast of the Discovery trench. Assay Results from reconnaissance sampling on these occurrences (as reported in NR-11-13, June 5th, 2013) returned both high-grade graphite (up to 15% Cg over 1.5 metres) and multiple values greater than 1%Cg. Historical geological data indicates widespread accessory graphite throughout the host stratigraphy including the visual identification of graphite in diamond drill holes and suggests strong exploration potential within these areas.Initial sampling in the Discovery Zone area returned assays of up to 69.1% Cg in grab sample and up to 36.8%Cg over 1.5 metres in channel sampling.The Salerno and Crystal zones are associated with the Salerno Creek Deformation Zone (SCDZ) that forms a major tectonic boundary between the Bancroft Terrane and Harvey-Cardiff Arch. The terrane contact hosts the majority of past-producing graphite mines and significant graphite occurrences in the belt; and, the deformation zones are within major regional-scaled fault complexes.Project Milestones Since the identification of high-grade graphite on the property in late 2012, Valterra has continued to advance the project through the early exploration stage and metallurgical evaluation. Completed work includes reconnaissance mapping and prospecting resulting in the identification of four new discoveries including the 1.75km-long Corridor zone, located 1 km to the north of the original graphite discovery and the Crystal and Salerno Occurrences referred to in the proceeding text.Surface IP geophysics over a 10 line-kilometre grid covering the initial graphite discovery has identified an 800m x 400m chargeability anomaly which remains a primary drill target. Several shallow drill holes were completed in the area of the discovery trench in order to better define the geology, structural controls and lens geometry in this overburden dominated area. High-grade, near surface drill results (6.36% Cg over 3.38m; including 31.90% Cg over 0.53m in hole BOB13-004, see NR-08-13) suggest that the target graphite horizon may be flat-lying or gently undulating; or that multiple target horizons exist in this area. Valterra is planning to conduct additional drilling, geophysics and prospecting in the area near the Discovery Zone and regionally within the district-scaled property.Read MoreMetallurgical Testing SummarySeveral stages of Metallurgical testing were conducted on a +20kg sample from the Discovery Zone area in order to help evaluate the marketability of potential graphite products from the Bobcaygeon property and resulted in the identification of an ultra-high-purity, fine-flake graphite concentrate grading 99.97% C and medium to jumbo flake concentrates grading +94% Cg. The fine-flake flotation concentrate was subjected to a two-stage leach process followed by LOI analyses on the leach residue.Previously reported highlights from metallurgical work conducted at SGS Lakefield includes:55.9% of the concentrate separates into the fine-flake category (-150 mesh) which through further leach testing produced the ultra-high purity analysis reported above.  31.7% of the concentrate separates into the large and jumbo flake categories (+80 mesh or >0.178mm) grading 94.9% C by LOI. This includes 14.6% of the concentrate at a +48 mesh (jumbo flake) grading 94.7% C by LOI. 12.4% of the concentrate separates into the medium-flake category (-80 to +150 mesh) grading 96.3% C by LOI. 34% Cg head-grade was returned in trench float sampling of primarily flake graphite with flakes of up to 3mm in length.These Preliminary flotation and leaching test results demonstrate the potential to produce marketable, very high-margin natural graphite products utilizing industry-standard processing techniques from the entire concentrate, including the ultra-high-purity fine-flake fraction. Only flake graphite with purity of 99.9% is suitable for Li- ion battery manufacturing which is currently dominated by high-cost synthetic graphite. Current synthetic prices range from US$7,000-20,000 per tonne and Valterra is targeting this market with natural graphite products that may provide a distinct cost advantage.Future Exploration at BobcaygeonYear-one successes from prospecting, trenching, metallurgy, geophysics and diamond drilling have defined numerous targets property-wide that merit exploration in 2013/14. Valterra has budgeted C$500,000 to $750,000 and is planning to conduct additional exploration in the Discovery Zone area and regionally within the district-scaled property. Preliminary plans are highlighted by diamond drilling of between 2,000 to 2,500m.Recent metallurgical reports, ground-geophysical data, updated corporate presentations and photographs are available on Valterra's website at www.valterraresource.com.About GraphiteGraphite is a naturally occurring form of carbon with wide-ranging and unique physical properties. Graphene is derived from graphite and is one of the strongest known substances with a tensile strength 200 times the strength of steel. The industrial development of graphene is at an early stage but will eventually become a replacement for several expensive electronic components such as silicon semi-conductors. There are three natural primary graphite occurrences - vein, flake, and amorphous where the highest quality product can command prices in excess of $2,000 per tonne. In pricing graphite, the flake size is a key factor with the large flake (>.178mm) ores commanding the highest prices in markets dominated by multi-national eco-automobile manufacturers, high-tech industries and nuclear energy companies. Recent pricing and demand increases have accelerated numerous exploration and investment opportunities in the graphite market.The Province of Ontario is an excellent locale to explore owing to superior geology, geoscience knowledge, infrastructure, political stability and tax incentives. Several projects are advancing in the graphite field including Northern Graphite Corporation, Zenyatta Ventures Inc. and Ontario Graphite Ltd.The Bobcaygeon property is hosted in rocks of the Grenville geological province which hosts most of the known significant graphite deposits in Canada.Corporate NewsFrederick Sveinson has tendered his resignation as President of Valterra in order to pursue other opportunities. The board of directors thanks Mr. Sveinson for his valuable contributions to Valterra and wishes him every success in the future. Lawrence Page Q. C., Chairman, will act as interim President pending designation of a President with specific knowledge of development and marketing in the graphite industry.About Valterra Resource CorporationValterra is a Manex Resource Group Company.
