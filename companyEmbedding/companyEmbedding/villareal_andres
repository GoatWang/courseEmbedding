Andres Villarreal - SecureLink


























































 

 


 

















SecureLink > The Team > Andres Villarreal
Andres Villarreal Software Developer

Started with SecureLink in: 2014
Favorite SecureLink feature: The audit logs, I love seeing everything that happens.
Favorite thing about working at SecureLink: The amazing workplace culture and being able to work on such a technically cool product.
iOS or Android: Android
Mac or PC: Anything as long as I can install GNU/Linux on it. 🙂
What do you do when you're not helping SecureLink and its customers: Playing old videogames, making music, and working on my own programming projects.

I've programmed stuff since I was 12, it has always been one of my biggest hobbies and eventually became my career. I believe programming is a craft and I strive to improve and refine my skills constantly.
I also devote a lot of time trying to come up with stuff to post on my tech blog. Beware: as my efforts have been fruitless, the content might be a little stale.
