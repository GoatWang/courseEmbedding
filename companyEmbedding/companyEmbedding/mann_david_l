Wells Fargo


                                            I find it quite disturbing to see 24 one star, the lowest, ratings on the first page of Wallet Hub's most recent reviews of Wells Fargo. Somehow, in its overall summary, Wallet Hub still gives the impression Wells Fargo is a good banking option. What's going on here?

The Business Gold Rewards Card from American Express OPEN


                                            Approached at airport to sign up for this card. Already had a few. Signed up anyway as some pressure applied. Did a status check to see where I sat with the promotion 80% at the spending goal and was told there was no promotion. So I closed all AMEX cards but this one and plan...show more

                                            WalletHub is by far my favorite credit monitoring tool and has made it really easy for me to gain an understanding of my score. Signing up was a very simple process and there were no extra strings attached.

Bed Bath & Beyond® Credit Card


                                            The Bed Bath & Beyond Mastercard was purchased from US Bank in October 2016. My advice: If you have been with US Bank and made the transition to Comenity - check your credit report.

                                            It is my opinion that you would do better to find a different company. In the long run they will charge you plenty and the support is virtually non-existent. They don't even have a working answering system. They are disorganized  and a nightmare to work with.

                                            i love banking with veridian, but the new updated online banking is garbage.10x harder to navigate than before staring from the log in page. Making simple transfers or even looking at accounts is harder and more confusing. bring back the old version.

I live on a fixed income. Its very difficult. My father and I are fairly comfortable, but due to the 40+ derogatory items on my credit report, which are all medically related. Lexington law, if you can afford their services, have done soo much for me. In only two months time, they removed 25+ items off my report. Unfortunately I'm unable to continue working with them, due to the roughly $100/mo fee, which is a bit too high for me.… read more

Who is taking it?  If you are just paying taxes and insurance no one can take it from you if you send a letter of intentions and pay what you can every month.  You might put the home up for a fast sale and with the money move into something affordable while paying the six thousand.

If you love saxaphone, you'll love this albumIf you like Grover Washington, Boney James, Gato Barbieri and Bob James - get this album.  Sensual, elegant.  Great talking or dinner music.By a reviewer (Plainsboro, NJ, USA)

lodestar player and gentlemanBeautiful album.  All the albums David Mann has to date are wonderful.  On the soprano saxophone, for me... he is just the best.  Equally great on all the saxophones - but particularly on the soprano which is the most difficult to control according to many professional artists.  Anyone who loves the saxophone and a player with true mastery of his instruments - plus the rare artistry that goes with a real feel for music, should collect David Mann's music.  Years ago I booked him into a club in Pennsylvania and I've been following his career since. His brother Ned Mann is a fabulous guitarist and bassist and an equal talent in his own right.  Great people - superlative artists.By glasgow992 (Portland, Maine, USA)
