Pretium Is Nearing First Gold Pour At The Giant Brucejack Project - Pretium Resources Inc (NYSE:PVG) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Pretium Is Nearing First Gold Pour At The Giant Brucejack ProjectMay.23.17 | About: Pretium Resources (PVG) Fabio Herrero Gold & precious metals, oil & gas, long only, Deep ValueSummaryPretium owns the Brucejack project, a high-grade underground gold mine complex in British Columbia, Canada. It is weeks from cash flow and has an 18 years minimum mine life.Commissioning is nearing completion and ore is being introduced to the mill. Production is expected to be 500,000oz Au at a very high grade (16.1 g/t) compared to industry averages.The project sports an industry low All-In-Sustaining Cost of $446 with a 34% IRR and an NPV of almost $2B at a gold price of $1250.Pretium additionally owns the Snowfield deposit, with 35m ounces of gold just north of the existing mine. It is the 6th biggest undeveloped gold deposit in the world.Pretium (NYSE:PVG) is one of the biggest stories of the last few years in the gold mining space. The sheer size of it made believers and detractors of this project, even leading to a full-blown controversy. I am squarely bullish on Pretium and since at least 2012 I have seen the project grow. Thus, with the project now being in the final stages of construction, I am happy to see the share price momentarily depressed and will soon start to buy. I wrote about Pretium for the first time some months ago when I penned an article about 10 junior gold miners finishing construction in 2017. Currently, Pretium is doing as expected as they are currently finishing construction on the Brucejack project. In this article I will explain in detail why the Brucejack project and the whole Pretium endeavor is a winning story and a strong buy at the current market price. This article will be organized as follows: firstly, we will describe Brucejack as a mine project in general included the exploration potential around it. Next, we will revisit a controversy surrounding the consistency of the ore and outline why I firmly believe that there is actually more gold present on site than the conservative estimates that were made back in the day indicate. After assessing the quality of the assets in portfolio we will move to the management track record and capital structure sections in order to inform an eventual trading decision. Finally, in the valuation section, we will go deeper into how much Pretium is really worth vis a vis its market price, the amount of ore in the ground and its industry peers. This will be followed by a buy recommendation in the conclusion.
 The Brucejack project The Brucejack project is located in British Columbia, Canada, which is a safe and reliable jurisdiction. The company is very involved in the region and has different agreements with the local communities. This is reflected by for instance the fact that around 50% of the workforce is locally sourced from Northwestern British Columbia, 42% from the rest of British Columbia while the remaining 8% is from elsewhere in Canada. Moreover, commercial contracting and employment of local First Nations workforce has been ongoing since the project's discovery. Brucejack location. (Company Presentation May 2017). 

 Construction of the mine is almost completed and as of the beginning of May, the construction team has in fact successfully handed over underground development to the operations crew while two long-hole drills are currently drilling off the stopes. This means that we are only weeks away from the moment that cash flow will literally start to pour in. Brucejack does not only include the gigantic Valley of the Kings (VoK) deposit - which is where the mine is currently being built - but also other satellite deposits that are already at the exploration stage (as per the map above). The other significant known deposit on the property is the Snowfield gold deposit, which we will discuss at further length in the exploration section. Here it must be noted that the Brucejack and Snowfield deposits are generally seen as the 6th and 28th biggest undeveloped gold deposits in the world (see below), hence making Pretium a potentially huge player. Top 50 Undeveloped deposits (2013 Global Gold Mine & Deposit Ranking, Natural Resource Holdings). 


 As for now, the primary focus of the mine is the Valley of the Kings deposit which is comprised of high-grade visible gold going up to kilograms per tonne in some intercepts. This is within a lower grade gold quartz stockwork system. Proven and probable mineral reserves in the Valley of the Kings of 8.1m oz Au (15.6m tonnes grading 16.1 g/t Au) were outlined with a feasibility study completed in June 2014 and updated in December 2016. Mine life is projected to be eighteen years with a total gold production of 7.27m oz Au. December 2016 Mineral Reserve Estimate (May 2017 Corporate Presentation). 

 Gold and silver recoveries are respectively 96.7% and 90.0% while average annual gold production will be between a sizeable 504,000 oz in the years 1-8 and 404,000 oz average during the expected life of mine. This is without considering the already known mineralization systems that were previously found nearby the existing mine plan. In short, we are talking about high grades and a gigantic deposit. Or is this too good to be true? The Controversy Back in 2013 there was a controversy surrounding the resignation of Strathcona Mineral Services Ltd., one of the companies dealing with Pretium Resource's bulk sample. They had a disagreement with Snowden Mining Industry Consultants, which was the other independently qualified party for the feasibility studies. According to Strathcona, the Snowden studies were not valid and could thus not interpreted as mineral resources and reserves. The controversy was also covered by Hebba Investments in this article of October 2013 and it took quite some time for the dust to settle. However, Strathcona's reservations were proven unfounded by the spectacular results of a 10,000t bulk sampling process that was made later in 2013. In my opinion, Snowden's methods were more than redeemed as results proved in accordance with their earlier assessments on both the lateral and vertical continuity of the vein systems comprising the stockwork, as well as the location of high-grade corridors of mineralization in between the more vastly mineralized envelope. To go into the details: the 5,865oz of gold that were produced from the 10,302 dry tonnes of excavated material surpassed the target of 4000 oz of gold which were estimated to be produced from the bulk sample by almost 50%. This is clearly remarkable and I am eager to see the actual numbers when production will be properly underway later during the year.
 Moreover, since 2013, Pretium has released hundreds of drill holes with fantastic results. At every point, they consistently found equal or greater amounts of gold than expected in the estimations. I hence feel confident that this past controversy is no longer relevant and we will not discount Pretium's data and resource estimates in our valuation. Exploration Near the Valley of the Kings deposit there are a number of satellite deposits that have shown very promising results. The West Zone has a proven and probable mineral resource estimate of 0.6m oz Au and 26m oz Ag with respectively 6.9 and 279 g/t. Moreover, the company encountered high grade intercepts in many other places, including on the east side, while there is also potential at depth. Nearby exploration potential (Corporate Presentation June 2016) 

 Snowfield is where the real unlocked value lies for Pretium. It lies just north of Brucejack and hosts a near-surface, low-grade, bulk tonnage, porphyry-style gold deposit with gold-copper, molybdenum and rhenium mineralization. Currently, a higher grade gold-copper core with silver and molybdenum has been outlined. The company completed a NI 43-101 resource estimate in February 2011. The gold resource includes an astounding 25.9m oz Au of measured and indicated resources and 9.0m oz of inferred resources at a cut-off grade of 0.30g equivalent per tonne. In short, we can say that this is a relatively low grade yet gigantic deposit as mineral resources furthermore include:- silver resources of 75.8m oz measured and indicated & 51.0m oz inferred- copper resources of 2.98 billion oz measured and indicated and 1.10 billion oz inferred - molybdenum resources of 258.3m oz measured and indicated and 127.7m oz inferred- rhenium resources of 22.5m oz measured and indicated and 11.5m oz inferred
 Snowfield is at the moment in stand-by as the company wants to stay opportunistic on the way it will realize value. Pretium has however entered into a confidentiality and cooperation agreement with Seabridge Gold (NYSEMKT:SA), whose KSM project shares a common boundary with Snowfield. The two are operating on a win-win basis and the company does not need to expend further funds on the project until 2022. Overall, despite the stand-by status, this is an enormous asset that the market is valuing at almost zero. In my opinion, this is one of many reasons why this stock is undervalued and thus a good buy currently. Something which we will elaborate more on in the valuation section. Let´s now move on and check management track record and capital structure of the company. Management Pretium is the creation of Robert A. Quartermain, the current Executive Chairman. Over his 40-year career in the resource industry he gained an extensive global experience in geology, exploration and development. Here is the bio from the company website: Dr. Quartermain was the president of Silver Standard Resource (NASDAQ:SSRI) from 1985 to 2010, over which time the company grew from a small exploration company with a market capitalization of over $2 million, to a company with a producing mine, five advanced development properties, a pipeline of early stage exploration properties and a market capitalization of over $2.0 billion. Dr. Quartermain is currently the Executive Chairman of Pretium Resources, which he incorporated in 2010... .... and is now completing construction of a gigantic high grade gold mine. Joseph Ovsenek is the President, Director and CEO of Pretium. He joined the company in January 2011 and is the person in charge of all day-to-day operations. Ovsenek has over 20 years of international management and legal experience in the precious metals industry. Before Pretium, he served in senior management roles for Silver Standard for fifteen years. Apart from being responsible for the company financing, he was also instrumental in developing the corporate strategy here via the acquisition and sale of several assets.
 George Paspalas acts as the lead director of Pretium. He was previously President and CEO of MAG Silver (NYSEMKT:MAG), President and CEO of Aurizon Mines and COO of Silver Standard Resources Inc. Before this he worked with Placed Dome and was responsible for constructing and operating complex open pit and underground mines in Canada, South Africa, Tanzania, Australia and South America. Current CFO is Tom Yip, who brings with him 25 years of financial management experience in the mining industry. Until recently, he was the CFO for International Tower Hill Mines (NYSEMKT:THM). The other directors and managers are all experienced and I believe able to well manage this company. Capital Structure Share capitalization is clean with 6.67m incentive options and no warrants against 180.84m shares outstanding, meaning an acceptable and normal dilution (that is actually substantially lower than usual when benchmarked against the junior gold miners peer group). Share capitalization and top shareholders (Company Website) 

 Management has a 1.98% ownership (+ incentive options), something that I always like to see. BlackRock - with $5.4 trillion in assets under management the world's largest asset manager - is the biggest shareholder, followed by another asset management company: Van Eck Associates. Silver Standard is a historical partner of Pretium while Zijin Mining participated in a pre-construction financing. Orion Mine Finance is the partner in the $540m construction package that financed the mine. The other major shareholders are a mix of merchant banks and asset management firms. We can confidently assess that the quality of the share structure is good, with strong hands keeping management on track while management itself has skin in the game and, as we have said, is willing and capable to deliver.
 Valuation As the company will become a producer over the next few months, much of the execution risk associated with mine building will be behind Pretium. The main incognito is the price of the main commodities produced, namely gold and silver. As we and the company are price takers in this, we will consider a flat gold price in the next foreseeable future for the purpose of our analysis. In this valuation, we will value the Snowfield project at $0 as it is too speculative in nature and the monetization path is not clear at this point. It is however a fantastic asset and makes that Pretium is not a one asset company and hence it offers a lower risk profile compared to others that are. Economics of the Brucejack project (Corporate Presentation May 2017). 

 I am not the only bullish analyst. On May 1st, The StreetWiseReport published three analyst views that, in my opinion, are spot on. BMO Capital Markets analyst Andrew Kaip notes that Pretium: "continues to make positive progress at its Brucejack mine, with a number of components and services commissioned or moving thereto, and wet commissioning nearing completion. The company remains on track for the production of gold concentrate and doré in the coming weeks." He highlights that "PVG has over 187kt of ore stockpiled on surface and underground, up from ~163kt in late March" and rates Pretium as an Outperform with a target price of $19.50." Moreover, Eric Zaunscherb, an analyst with Canaccord Genuity, Maintaining the target price of $17.50 and reiterating a Buy recommendation, Zaunscherb highlights that "Pretium Resources is trading at a 0.67x P/NAV(5%). This is a premium to the means of peer covered development companies at 0.59x and covered small- to mid-cap producers at 0.58x. A premium is justified given the project's scale, scalability (exploration potential), low sovereign risk, and potential appeal as an M&A target."
 It is important to note here that the Pretium share price went down somewhat from the beginning of the month making the P/NAV5 closer to 0.60, even better for new investors. Finally, ROTH Capital Partners analyst Joe Reagor believes that: "Brucejack will begin initial gold production in the coming weeks and that it will steadily increase production over the remainder of 2017." He also explains that the company will "avoid running high value ore through the mill until it optimizes recoveries and throughput... estimating production of 41,000, 72,000, and 117,000 ounces of gold over the three remaining quarters of 2017, respectively." He stated that the firm's "valuation for PVG is USD$3.0 B or USD$15.69 per fully diluted share. Pretium's share price was $9.09 at the close of May 19th 2017 which I think is a steal. Considering that starting now it will literally become a cash machine as it has some of the lowest all-in sustaining cash cost per oz in the industry at $446 per oz of gold. Brucejack's AISC compared to intermediate gold producers (Corporate Presentation September 2016). 

 Here we must consider that at a gold price of $1250, the company would generate $3.5B in cash flow. In the event of a gold bull market in the next years, Pretium will generate billions of dollars more in free cash flow at almost no added cost. Production estimates and economics (Corporate Fact Sheet March 2016). 


 Some other positive factors that are not fully considered by the market is that the construction-financing package included a stream that the company could decide to buy back. Pretium has the flexibility to buy back some of the stream that it sold to Orion Mine Finance, further enhancing the economics of the project. Here you can find the details of the stream. Stream Agreement between Pretium and Orion Finance (Company website). 

 Before moving to the conclusion I would also highlight that all present calculation use a conservative CAD:USD of 0.75 (while it is presently closer to 0.73). Costs are mainly in CAD while revenue are in USD, meaning that if the Canadian dollar would fall more, the company would benefit from an even lower production cost. Note here that, of course, the opposite is also possible. Before we conclude, we must consider a last valuation metric that is always interesting to take into account. The market cap is now $1.6B and for this, a shareholder gets 13m oz gold at Brucejack and 35m an Snowfield, i.e. a grand total of 48m. This leads to a price of $33.33 per oz of gold in the ground ($1,600,000,000 / Oz 48,000,000 = $33.33). Relatively cheap compared to industry peers, especially if we consider a re-rate as a producer and that it is in a safe jurisdiction. With a P/NAV of 0.70 that will be soon be re-rated as Pretium becomes a producer, no more dilution expected, the possibility to enhance the economics of the project by buying back some of the stream, the ownership of Snowfield I feel confident into recommending a buy of Pretium at this price. Conclusion Pretium is highly leveraged to the price of gold and as such it has some inherent risk that are not company specific but industry specific.
 That said, if we consider a flat gold environment in the foreseeable future, at $9.09 per share it is a compelling buy as we have seen. Our valuation is robust as we are entirely discounting the value of Snowfield, the 6th biggest undeveloped gold deposit in the world. I recommend to immediately open a buy order with a limit at $9.09 or lower with a target of $13.60 or 50% more in the next 12 months, which is when the company re-rates as a high margin producer.

One of the key data points that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 795 days until expiration the newly available contracts represent a potential opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

    corporate events, tax ramifications, and other factors. Fixed income securities are subject to increased loss of principal during periods of rising interest rates.


The 1-Year Return/Return Since Inception indicates the performance of this particular motif over the last 12 months or, if the motif was created within the past 12 months, since the date the motif was created. See how we calculate returns.


The Motif Index level represents the performance of a benchmark motif (a motif in our catalog) over time. It is set at 
1000 on the date of inception of the motif. For example, a Motif Index of 1100 represents a 10% return since inception. Similarly, the change in the Index over a 
specified period represents the period return on the portfolio holding the same share weights as the benchmark motif.
The Motif Index is a measure created and maintained by the firm, which has the discretion to change the holdings that comprise the index and to make alterations to a particular Motif Index.


Popularity shows you how much interest a motif is attracting, compared to other motifs. We base this score on a proprietary formula that uses factors like how many people are viewing the motif, and how much conversation about it is happening in the community, in a range from Low-to-High.
The Volatility measurement for a Motif represents the annualized standard deviation of daily returns on a portfolio holding the same share weights as the Motif, and is measured in a range from Low to High. Since the standard deviation of returns are commonly used as a measure of portfolio risk, a Volatility measurement that is High is indicative of the fact that holding the motif in the past subjected the holder to larger fluctuations or higher risk.
The Valuation metric represents the present valuation of the stocks in the motif relative to the broader equity market. The Valuation metric is calculated as the composite Price-to-Earnings ratio for the stocks in the motif weighted by their respective share weights in a range from Low to High.


Standard pricing: $9.95 total commission per motif transaction. Other fees may apply. For details on fees and commissions, please

                    Pretium Resources Inc.
                










                Pretivm is creating value through gold at its 100%-owned, advanced-stage Brucejack Project located in northern British Columbia. The high-grade gold opportunity at Brucejack, one of the largest and highest-grading undeveloped gold projects in the world, is the catalyst for near-term production, and our focus.

A feasibility study completed in June 2014 has outlined Proven and Probable mineral reserves in Brucejacks Valley of the Kings comprising 6.9 million ounces of gold (13.6 million tonnes grading 15.7 grams per tonne gold).  Pretivm is advancing Brucejack to production as a 2,700 tonnes per day underground mine.

All of the major regulatory permits required to begin development work on the high-grade underground gold mine at Brucejack have been issued, and commercial production is targeted to commence in 2017.

Expert Comments:






  
      Joe Reagor, ROTH Capital Partners
  

(7/6/17)

		
		"On July 3, 2017, Pretium Resources Inc. announced that the Brucejack mine had achieved commercial production during the month of June 2017. . .we believe the company is poised for a number of significant catalysts over the remainder of 2017 including: production results in Q3, achieving nameplate capacity, potential to exceed nameplate capacity and an anticipated rerating as a producer. Thus, we are reiterating our Buy rating."
		
		












  
      Heiko Ihle, Rodman & Renshaw
  

(7/6/17)

		
		"On July 3, 2017, Pretium Resources Inc. announced the beginning of commercial production at its Brucejack mine. . .we remain impressed with management's ability to accelerate and complete commissioning of the site on time, as well as their efforts to begin commercial production in a smooth fashion."
		
		












  
      Andrew Kaip, BMO Capital Markets
  

(7/4/17)

		
		"Pretium Resources Inc. announced that it declared commercial production at its Brucejack mine, a full quarter ahead of our estimate. The focus for the company now turns toward troubleshooting in the plant, ramping up to full design rates and moving toward reserve grade."
		
		












  
      Jeff Killeen, CIBC World Markets
  

(7/4/17)

		
		"Pretium Resources Inc. declared commercial production at the Brucejack mine on July 3, which is slightly earlier than our expectation of mid-Q3/17. The company noted the plant operated at an average of ~87% of nameplate capacity of ~2,700 tpd in June. . .Pretium signaled that 'higher grade ore' is now being fed through the plant."
		
		












  
      Eric Zaunscherb, Canaccord Genuity
  

(7/4/17)

		
		"Yesterday, Pretium Resources Inc., the British Columbia-based company, announced that commercial production had been achieved at its high-grade Brucejack project. . .the company waited only three days into H2/17 to deliver the exciting news, saying in a release yesterday that over 70 Kt ore had been processed at Brucejack during the month of June."
		
		
















Good News Pouring In for a British Columbia Miner
				(6/22/17)

			    		Once again analysts are talking about this British Columbia mining company that just announced its first gold pour.

      Eric Zaunscherb, Canaccord Genuity
  

(6/21/17)

		
		"Yesterday Pretium Resources Inc. announced it had poured its first gold from the Brucejack project; this is a major milestone for the company as it has been working diligently to bring the project into commercial production, a declaration expected in the back half of this year. Pretium also announced that the flotation and gravity circuits at its newly constructed mill are in operation, with gold-silver flotation concentrate production underway and shipment forthcoming."

      Andrew Kaip, BMO Capital Markets
  

(6/21/17)

		
		"Pretium Resources Inc. announced that it poured first gold at its Brucejack mine. The focus for the company now turns towards the ramp-up to commercial production, and while we model a declaration for the end of Q3/17, Pretium could declare commercial production earlier than expected."
		
		












The  Gold Report Interview with Louis James 

(5/17/17)

		
		"An example of a company just about to complete its run up the Golden Runway is Pretium Resources Inc., Bob Quartermain's monster-sized, super-high-grade gold play in British Columbia. What's interesting is that it's on the verge of pouring its first bar of gold, but the stock has not yet risen as much as we'd expect. That's despite the company completing construction ahead of schedule. The reason is that because the deposit is so exceptional, Pretium has done some things differently. This has some critics saying the mine will not produce as much gold as projected. But Pretium's bulk sample produced something like 60% more gold than was expected based on the model. That tells me that the company was not being risky or cavalier; in fact, it was being conservative. We're about to find out if I'm right. So, instead of production being the end of the story for this company, I see it as a beginning."

      Eric Zaunscherb, Canaccord Genuity
  

(5/1/17)

		
		"Pretium Resources Inc. will have much of the execution risk associated with mine building behind it over the next few months, likely making the current share price lull an attractive opportunity. . .in our view, the company should have ample financial resources to later in 2017."
		
		












  
      Joe Reagor, ROTH Capital Partners
  

(5/1/17)

		
		"Pretium Resources Inc. specifically stated that wet commissioning at Brucejack was nearing completion and that it had begun introducing ore into the process. Additionally, the company stated that underground infrastructure construction was close to fully complete and commissioned. . .we believe Brucejack will begin initial gold production in the coming weeks and that it will steadily increase production over the remainder of 2017."
		
		












  
      Andrew Kaip, BMO Capital Markets
  

(5/1/17)

		
		"Pretium Resources Inc. highlighted that it remains on track for the production of gold concentrate and doré in the coming weeks. . .the test stope is ready for production and four other production stopes are being drilled. Handover from the construction team to the operations crew has been completed."

		
		












  
      Byron King, Gold Speculator
(4/11/17)

		
		"We're right on the cusp of Pretium Resources Inc. moving to production here. . .it won't be long before the company is up and running as a true gold producer. . .over time, and as gold prices rise, Pretium is highly leveraged to the upside."
		
		












  
      Andrew Kaip, BMO Capital Markets
  

(4/3/17)

		
		"Pretium Resources Inc. announced that the 57 km transmission line connecting the Brucejack mine to the British Columbia hydro power grid was completed on March 21 and was energized on March 31. . .we view the completion and energizing of the transmission as a positive development for the company, which will provide lower cost power to operations."

		
		












  
      Byron King, Gold Speculator
(3/28/17)

		
		"Pretium Resources Inc. is already mining ore to create a stockpile for the mill; we're looking for final checkouts and to get the mill up and running. Then the company will begin to transition from advanced-stage developer to a full-fledged producer, with cash flow from sale of gold. . .over time, and as gold prices rise, Pretium is highly leveraged to the upside."
		
		












  
      Heiko Ihle, Rodman & Renshaw
  

(3/8/17)

		
		"Pretium Resources Inc. continues to advance its high-grade Brucejack project toward production while minimizing the impact from the very few issues, notably the power line, that did not go as planned. In our opinion, the heavy lifting with regard to the project has been completed, and we expect to see the commissioning of Brucejack next month."
		
		












  
      Andrew Kaip, BMO Capital Markets
  

(2/28/17)

		
		"Pretium Resources Inc. is nearing completion of construction at Brucejack, with commissioning on track for early April 2017. All major components have been delivered to site, and the company has over 130 Kt ore stockpiled on surface and underground."
		
		












  
      Jeff Killeen, CIBC World Markets
  

(2/14/17)

		
		"We are resuming coverage of Pretium Resources Inc. with the completion of the US$100M aggregate principal convertible senior subordinated notes, which included the overallotment option of US$10M. . .commercial production [at Brucejack] in early Q3/17 seems likely with development on track and process plant construction ~2 months ahead of schedule."
		
		












  
      Andrew Kaip, BMO Capital Markets
  

(2/14/17)

		
		"Pretium Resources Inc. closed its convertible notes offering for gross proceeds of US$100M. The company intends to use the proceeds for working capital during start-up of the Brucejack mine and for general corporate purposes. . .as PVG anticipates dry commissioning of the mill in March and wet commissioning in April, we now forecast the company to have adequate capital resources, including the remaining portion of its undrawn credit facility, to fund the remainder of capital construction as well as the required working capital during start-up."
		
		












  
      Heiko Ihle, Rodman & Renshaw
  

(2/6/17)

		
		"Pretium Resources Inc. announced that commissioning of its high-grade Brucejack gold project is expected to occur ahead of schedule. . ..we highlight that the updated timeline is ahead of our estimate for mid-year commissioning; therefore, we are increasing our gold production estimate for the year to just shy of 120 Koz from just over 93 Koz ounces."
		
		












  
      Joe Reagor, ROTH Capital Partners
  

(2/5/17)

		
		"Pretium Resources Inc. provided an update on its Brucejack project; the project is ahead of schedule with dry commissioning expected in March and wet commissioning expected in April. Previously, the company had estimated a mid-2017 commissioning of the mill, making this a two- to four-month improvement, in our view."
		
		












  
      Jeff Killeen, CIBC World Markets
  

(2/3/17)

		
		"Construction and commissioning of Pretium Resources Inc.'s Brucejack is two to three months ahead of schedule. . .some of the extra spending has resulted in being ahead of schedule on a number of items, and the company plans to now be commissioning the process plant in early April versus late Q2 previously. It was noted that underground development remains on track and that ~100 Kt ore has been stockpiled ahead of commissioning."
		
		












  
      Eric Zaunscherb, Canaccord Genuity
  

(2/3/17)

		
		"Pretium Resource Inc. released a project update on the high grade underground Brucejack gold project. . .with news of cost overruns out of the way, a major component of execution risk is now out of the way and priced in, potentially creating an attractive entry point. . .management notes that its financial resources are sufficient to complete construction and commissioning."
		
		












  
      Andrew Kaip, BMO Capital Markets

The  Gold Report Interview with Doug Groh 

(10/18/16)

		
		"Pretium Resources Inc. is a very interesting developer. Over the last few years as the gold market turned down, it was up against the wind developing its deposit in the Valley of the Kings in northern British Columbia. There's been a lot of criticism of the project, but I'm very hopeful and excited to watch as it goes into commercial production in the next year. It has identified amazing grades. I feel very comfortable that it is going to achieve its objectives. We might see sporadic production over the years because of the nature of that deposit and the nature of the high grade there, but I'm quite optimistic that it'll work out well. I think the naysayers will be humbled in due course but there probably will be ups and downs along the way, which will make it exciting for investors if they like to trade. . .as much as the mine management team is well prepared for operating in difficult weather conditions and mining a high-grade deposit with relatively narrow veins, there will likely be periods when operations don't go as planned. And yet, it is an amazing ore deposit, which in time should yield tremendous value."

		"We recently completed a site visit to Pretium Resources Inc.'s Valley of the Kings high grade underground gold deposit. . .mineralization is hosted in a relatively complex epithermal system ~188-183Ma overprinted or remobilized on a 110Ma deformation event. Key individual veins are fairly continuous and traceable between levels. . .geologists have been experimenting with various proxy indicators but a powerful indicator has emerged recently. A package defined by anomalous Fe/S/As demonstrates excellent predictability for higher grade, leading to the potential for geologists to map and guide mine development with handheld spectrometers to minimize dilution and maximize head grade."

The  Gold Report Interview with Joe Reagor 

(5/5/16)

		
		"We like Pretium Resources Inc. because it has very high-quality assets with a large number of gold ounces, high grade, in a good jurisdiction and has a solid management team with a proven track record. If a company has those things, then it's in position to turn it into a world-class producing asset. . .Pretium's recent drill results are a further confirmation of what everyone sees in that deposit. It's essentially a low-grade halo around some record-high gold intercepts over very short lengths, sub-5 meter intercepts, sometimes sub-1m intercepts of apparently significant high-grade gold. Having been underground at that deposit, I saw spots in the wall where a drill hole missed by two or three inches what would have been a significant high-grade intercept. Instead, it shows up as just a low-grade intercept. So the point of Pretium's infill drilling is to delineate as much as it can ahead of time an estimate of what production might look like, so that it can provide reasonable guidance to the market once it's in production sometime next year. One of the concerns that a lot of people still have is it will be very difficult to put a range on what production will be, given the highly variable nature of the deposit. That's why it's still doing additional drilling, even as it brings it into development."

The  Gold Report Interview with Joe Reagor 

(2/8/16)

		
		Last year, after Pretium Resources Inc. made its construction decision and announced its financing without any equity component, its stock value improved significantly despite a flat gold and silver price because there was short covering on the name. . .a lot of investors expected Pretium to be bought by now but the Rubicon situation has deterred companies from acquiring high-grade but highly variable deposits. Highly variable deposits are always difficult to estimate. Pretium's Brucejack has a unique geological structure that is more geologically similar to a Pacific Island than a traditional high-grade Canadian gold deposit. As such, a lot of Canadian producers have balked at acquiring Pretiumthey'd rather let it prove itself in production and pay more later than have it underperform and be punished by the market. The company is in a holding pattern until it reaches production, but it trades at a healthy discount to its net asset value. . .if Pretium were able to get to the production levels and cash costs in the current mine model, it would be remarkably similar in size and cost level to what used to be Osisko Mining Corp.'s Canadian Malartic mine. Something close to that valuation would probably make the private equity folks very happy. It would be a multiple of what it paid for its investment. . .any large private equity investment in a company is usually a vote of confidence, but it's not to say that they were privy to anything that the rest of us weren't. Pretium is still using the same models and information. There may be confidentiality agreements to get additional information, but in a project of this nature, the vast majority of the information you want to know to make an investment is publicly available. Private equity is just confident that management is derisking it as much as it can before production."

The Gold Report Interview with Ralph Aldis 

(2/1/16)

		
		"Pretium Resources Inc. is getting there; 2017 is the expected date for Brucejack to be in production. It continues to put out very good drill holes. After the drama with the initial bulk sample in late 2013, it delivered 4 Koz as estimated. The company just released the fifth set of fan drill definitions and it is continuing to hit. I think it had one hole that was 20,000 g/t. One of the brokers jokingly suggested measuring in number of Rolexes per ton. I think Pretium is doing the right work to understand the geometry of the ore body. That's so important. Pretium is getting the right three-dimensional picture of the ore and its distribution. The great thing is it could literally mine here and repay all its capital in a modestly short period of time. Even after it depletes the high grade, it will still be a huge gold camp. Who knows where gold prices will be in 10 years? Maybe all that other 1 g/t gold will actually be worth something. . .working capital as of Sept. 30, 2015, was $432M. We should get an updated funding capital expenditure estimate for the project this quarter because there are other cost savings that will probably come in. Certainly, the exchange rate is very favorable. Sourcing the equipment with the market in a distressed state could lower prices as well. Pretium still has a little bit more funding to do, but I don't really look at that as a major headwind. I was very pleased with the deal that it did for this last set of funding where it negotiated with private equity. It also put a cap on the royalty. So the company has been very astute about trying to preserve the value for the shareholders, and the management team owns a lot of stock themselves. I'm pretty happy with what Pretium is doing."

		"Among juniors, Adrian Day sees a lot of companies doing good work in this market. 'Pretium Resources Inc. is advancing the Valley of the Kings project. The company had to raise new equity, but if a company has a good asset and is demonstrating that it's advancing the project without being wasteful, the market should give it credit for adding value.'"

		"We are transitioning coverage of Pretium Resources Inc. with a Buy rating. . .we consider the company to be one of the premier gold developers within the industry, given its robust project economics, long reserve mine life and safe operating jurisdiction. As a result of the significant discount to Pretium's fundamental valuation, we feel that today's share price presents an attractive entry point for long-term investors."

		"The higher Canadian dollar gold price combined with moving our valuation ahead to the end of 2016 generated a positive impact on the valuation of Pretium Resources Inc.'s permitted, high-grade, underground Brucejack gold project, which is currently under construction in northwest British Columbia. This netted out to an increase of CA$0.35/share in the company's stock, or 34% overall, to a target price of CA$9.50/share. . .leading us to upgrade our recommendation to Speculative Buy from Hold, as our target price implies a 15% return to current levels."

The  Gold Report Article with Andrew Kaip 

(10/12/15)

		
		[A lot of people here are familiar with Pretium Resources Inc.'s deal with Blackstone Tactical Opportunities and Orion Mine Finance Group. There's a debt component, an equity component and a streaming component.] "Private equity funds pride themselves on being flexible in the financing solutions that they offer mining companies. Pretium is a perfect example. These private equity firms worked with Pretium to come up with a comprehensive financing package. Brucejack is still not fully funded, but to attract $540M from two investors in this market is extraordinary. Orion has been doing streaming deals for quite some time but the number of ounces that are covered under this streaming deal is capped. Royalty and streaming companies typically want life-of-mine exposure to give them that optionality. So if you're Pretium management, that's pretty attractive because Brucejack contains a lot of ounces. You're going to see more of these hybrid deals."

Value Through Gold























RAMPING UP PRODUCTION OF THE HIGH-GRADE BRUCEJACK GOLD MINE 
COMMERCIAL PRODUCTION ANNOUNCED JULY 2017









Brucejack


Pretivm is ramping up production of the high-grade underground Brucejack Gold Mine.  Brucejack is located in northwestern British Columbia, approximately 65 kilometers north of Stewart, BC the property consists of 122,133 hectares (over 301,798 acres).  The primary focus of the Mine is the Valley of the Kings deposit which is comprised of high-grade visible gold within a lower grade gold quartz stockwork system. A feasibility study completed in June 2014 updated in December 2016 has outlined Proven and Probable mineral reserves in the Valley of the Kings of 8.1 million ounces of gold (15.6 million tonnes grading 16.1 grams per tonne gold).  All major federal and provincial regulatory permits required to begin development work towards commercial production at the Brucejack Mine were received in 2015. Construction commenced on September 5, 2015 and commercial production was announced on July 3, 2017.  2015/2016 Infill Drill Program
The Valley of the Kings infill drill program continued through 2015 and into the second quarter of 2016. The program which consisted of 63, 740 meters in 367 drill holes was designed to target stope areas to be mined in the first three years of the current mine planin years 1 through 3 of the current mine plan(1320-meter level to 1200-meter level). 
The planned drill program was expanded to include extensions of Domain 20 which are adjacent to areas being mined in the early years of the 2014 Feasibility Mine Plan. Roughly 200 vertical meters over a strike length of 250 meters were drilled at 7.5 to 10-meter centers from five underground drill stations.
The primary purpose of the drilling was grade control, with the additional benefit of infill drilling inferred and non-stope indicated resources in the same area. Results from the program continue to confirm the style and grade distribution of the gold mineralization in the area being tested, which includes the intersection of high grade and visible gold. (See news release dated June 4, 2015, April 5, 2016, April 26, 2016. May 12, 2016 and May 31, 2016)
 


June 2014 Feasibility Study & February 2017 Capital Cost Update 
A feasibility study for the Brucejack Mine was completed in June 2014 and updated in December 2016 for an underground mine with an operating rate of 2,700 tonnes per day using a mining method of long-hole stoping and cemented paste backfill (see news release dated June 19, 2014 and February 3, 2016). Stopes will be mined using a combination of longitudinal and transverse mining, depending on zone width and orientation. Cemented paste tailings will be prepared in a paste plant located on surface near the mill and then pumped underground for distribution to the stopes. 

Highlights of the June 2014 Brucejack feasibility study and capital cost update (see news release dated Feb 3, 2017). Using base case US$1,100/oz gold, US$14/oz silver and exchange rate of 0.75 US$/C$ include:

- Proven and Probable mineral reserves in the Valley of the Kings of 8.1 million ounces of gold (15.6 million tonnes grading 16.1 grams per tonne gold);  
- Base case pre-tax Net Present Value (5% discount) of US$2.34 billion;
   
    
- Mine life of 18 years producing an estimated 7.3 million ounces of gold;
- Average annual production of 504,000 ounces of gold over the first 8 years and 404,000 ounces of gold over the life of mine;
- Base case pre-tax Internal Rate of Return of 34.4%, with payback estimated at 3.3 years;
- US$811 million estimated capital cost, including contingencies and 3-months working capital;
​- Average operating costs of C$163.05/tonne milled over mine life.






Valley of the Kings High-Grade Gold Mineral Resources
The mineral resource is based on the July 2016 Mineral Resource update and the December 2013 Mineral Resource estimate (see news release dated July 21,2016 and December 19, 2013) December 2013 Mineral Resource estimate (see news release dated December 19, 2013). The high-grade gold resources in the Valley of the Kings (5.0 g/t gold-equivalent cut-off) total:

9.1 million ounces of gold in the Measured and Indicated Resource categories (16.4 million tonnes grading 17.2 grams of gold per tonne); and

The input data for the 2016 mineral resource update compromised 63,740 meters in 367 drill holes.The input data for the Valley of the Kings December 2013 estimate comprises 922 drillholes for 218,127 meters including 9 historical surface drillholes (579 meters), 24 surface drillholes completed since the previous November 2012 Mineral Resource (5,100 meters) and 409 underground exploration drillholes completed since the previous November 2012 Mineral Resource (38,829 meters).  These figures exclude intervals with no gold values and drillholes outside of the Valley of the King area. 

2015 Regional Exploration Program

The 2015 grass-roots exploration program was comprised of prospecting, airborne EM, magnetic and radiometric surveys, and a surface drill program. The 2015 surface exploration drill program consisted of approximately 20,000 meters of drilling, which targeted porphyry/epithermal-style mineralization to the east of the Brucejack Mine. 
The 2015 regional exploration program was successful in expanding the size of the hydrothermal system that includes the Valley of the Kings and confirming the potential for additional mineralized zones to the east. With the discovery of the Flow Dome Zone the program was successful in extending the strike length of the Valley of the Kings gold mineralization 1,000 meters to the east of the current Valley of the Kings Measured and Indicated Mineral Resource. Results from the 2015 program will be used to prioritize targets for follow-up regional exploration programs. (See news release dated December 15, 2015)
2013 Exploration Program
The Mineral Resource estimate has been informed by extensive work focused on the geological interpretation of the Valley of the Kings.  The high-grade mineralization in the Valley of the Kings is hosted in a broad deformed stockwork, and a key outcome from 2013’s 10,000-tonne Bulk Sample Program (the “Program”) was the underground confirmation of both lateral and vertical continuity of the vein systems comprising this stockwork, and the location of high-grade corridors of mineralization. The Valley of the Kings remains open to the east and west along strike and at depth.
The underground drilling completed in 2013 includes Program drilling (16,789 meters) and additional underground exploration drilling (22,041 meters).  Drill data, in conjunction with underground mapping and surface mapping, has resulted in a robust geological model for the Valley of the Kings with well-defined mineralized domains.
The excavation of the 10,000 tonnes of Program material was completed in late August, and a total of 5,865 ounces of gold was produced from processing (see news release dated December 13, 2013).
