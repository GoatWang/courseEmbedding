Michael N. Vittorio
MICHAEL N. VITTORIO is President and Chief Executive Officer of The
First National Bank of Long Island and The First of Long Island
Corporation. Established as The First National Bank of Glen Head in
1927, The First National Bank of Long Island is the sole subsidiary of
The First of Long Island Corporation. His professional contributions to
the financial services industry span nearly three decades. Beginning his
banking career as a teller in 1975, he progressed in positions of
increasing responsibility at several top-tier financial institutions.
When Mr. Vittorio joined the bank in July 2002, he served as Executive
Vice President in charge of Strategic Initiatives. In this capacity, he
oversaw new product development, sales and product training, extended
branch and loan development and strategic risk. Appointed to the Board
of Directors and elected President of both The First National Bank of
Long Island and The First of Long Island Corporation in February 2003,
Mr. Vittorio added Chief Executive Officer to his title just seven
months later. His many accomplishments include spearheading the bank’s
move into Manhattan where three new commercial offices have been
established. He also led several successful campaigns that expanded the
bank’s menu of products and services. Under his leadership, free
checking, mutual funds and annuities are now offered to bank customers.
Mr. Vittorio previously dedicated thirteen years of service at J.P.
Morgan Chase, most recently as Senior Vice President, where he managed
Chase Insurance Agency’s Insurance Brokerage and Advisory Service
Business. Throughout his tenure with the organization from 1989 to 2002,
his many appointments included Vice President of Chase’s Commercial
Division on Long Island and Vice President of the lower Middle Market
Division for New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. He also held
assignments as Middle Market Regional Manager and Chief Lending Officer
for Chase’s Small Business Division. Earlier in his career, he held
posts at Chemical Bank, Anchor Savings Bank and The Brooklyn Savings
Bank. A 1994 graduate of The University of Delaware’s Stonier School of
Banking, Mr. Vittorio’s academic achievements include a Bachelor of Arts
degree in Political Science from Fairfield University and a Master’s in
Professional Studies from Long Island University, C.W. Post. A Trustee
of New York Law School and the Metropolitan College of New York, he is
also a member of The New York Bankers Association’s Education Committee,
and is past Chairman of the Small Business Committee.
