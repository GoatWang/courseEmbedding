Why is this contact information displayed? [Close]
The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

Stonerise Capital Partners - Our Team













about usstrategyteamcontactinvestor



Team
Jeffrey A. Cozad
Mr. Cozad co-founded Stonerise Capital Partners in 2007. From 2000 to 2006, Mr. Cozad was a Partner at Blum Capital Partners where he was a member of the firm's investment team, Management/Finance committees and also led the firm's capital markets efforts. During Mr. Cozads tenure at Blum, the firm deployed over $3.5 billion in capital in investments including both public strategic blocks and private equity investments, including the highly successful CB Richard Ellis investment (a board on which he served for 5 years).  Prior to joining Blum, Mr. Cozad was a Managing Director of Security Capital Group Incorporated, a $4.5 billion global real estate research, investment and operating management company. His responsibilities included overseeing seven portfolio companies with an aggregate market value of approximately $8.0 billion, and from 1994 to 1996 running the firms Global Capital Markets Group.  Mr. Cozad played key leadership roles in managing Security Capitals growth as the firms assets grew from $100 million as a start-up company in 1991 to over $20 billion at the time the company was sold to General Electric in 2001. Previously, Mr. Cozad was employed by both Morgan Stanley and LaSalle Partners Incorporated. Prior public company board seats include: CB Richard Ellis, Regency Realty and Security Capital U.S. Realty. Prior private company board/advisory committee seats include: Pacific Retail Trust and Pall Mall Partners. Mr. Cozad holds an MBA from The University of Chicago Booth School of Business. He also received a BA in Economics and Management from DePauw University, where he serves on the Board of Trustees.
