			Guy L. Smith was appointed a member of the Board of Directors in June 2005. Mr. Smith has been the Executive Vice President of Diageo, the world's leading premium drinks company, since 2000 and is responsible for Corporate Relations and Marketing Public Relations. At Diageo, Mr. Smith's responsibilities include overseeing the corporation's civic and social responsibility efforts in North America, including the Diageo Marketing Code. The code governs the company's social responsibility activities with regard to the marketing and sale of alcoholic beverages and the company's undertakings to reduce underage access and abuse of alcohol. From 1998 to 1999, prior to joining Diageo, Mr. Smith was Special Advisor to President Clinton on The White House staff, where he served on the impeachment defense team. Mr. Smith also served as an informal strategic communications advisor to President Clinton from the beginning of the Clinton Administration. From 1999 to 2000, Mr. Smith was associated with The Hawthorn Group, a Washington-based public affairs firm, as well as with his own firm, Smith Worldwide Inc., from 1994 to 1996, which focused on reputation and crisis management. He was Chief Operating Officer of Hill & Knowlton International Public Relations, from 1992 to 1993, where he consulted with the firm's largest consumer product, technology, and legal clients. Prior to that Mr. Smith was Vice President-Corporate Affairs, the senior public affairs and public relations officer, for Philip Morris Companies Inc. from 1975 to 1992. During his 17 years with Philip Morris, Mr. Smith led the Corporate Affairs departments of the Miller Brewing Company and The Seven-Up Company, both then Philip Morris operating companies. Mr. Smith began his career as a reporter and assistant city editor for The Knoxville Journal. He is currently chairman of the Barrier Island Trust, an environmental protection organization and sits on the Board of Advisors of Mount Vernon, George Washington's home outside Washington, D.C. Mr. Smith also serves as an Honorary Battalion Chief of the Fire Department of New York. Mr. Smith was selected to serve as a Director in part due to his extensive experience with the alcoholic beverage business and other businesses that rely on age verification, his work in government and public relations, his knowledge of the Company, including as a director of Intelli-Check, Inc. prior to the merger with Mobilisa and his general business experience.

Book Condition Notes



Synopsis
Big business has come to the sleepy town of Fradley in the form of a partnership attempting to turn a disused local wartime RAF station into a major international airport. 
Retired schoolmaster Hartley Lowe is leading the mounting local opposition, and he soon discovers that the site was built on an ancient Druidic stone circle complete with its dark rituals and human sacrifices. He foretells all sorts of misfortune, but as the ancient druids claim back their land, the level that the terror reaches is beyond even his expectations.

Item Description: Taylor Francis Inc, United States, 2002. Paperback. Book Condition: New. Language: English . Brand New Book. Listed as one of the 30 Best Business Books of 2002 by Executive Book Summaries Proactive Risk Management s unique approach provides a model of risk that is scalable to any size project or program and easily deployable into any product development or project management life cycle. It offers methods for identifying drivers (causes) of risks so you can manage root causes rather than the symptoms of risks. Providing you with an appropriate quantification of the key factors of a risk allows you to prioritize those risks without introducing errors that render the numbers meaningless. This book stands apart from much of the literature on project risk management in its practical, easy-to-use, fact-based approach to managing all of the risks associated with a project. The depth of actual how-to information and techniques provided here is not available anywhere else.  Bookseller Inventory # AAS9781563272653

This book stands apart from much of the literature on project risk management in its practical, easy-to-use, fact-based approach to managing all of the risks associated with a project. The depth of actual how-to information and techniques provided here is not available anywhere else.  Bookseller Inventory # AAS9781563272653

        Mingo Junction, a working-class town in the upper Ohio River Valley, has a rich mix of ethnicities and races with a history going back to the Mingo Indians, including visits from George Washington in the 1770s. Early settlement came as the coal mining industry flourished, followed by iron and steel foundries and accompanying railroads and river barge traffic. Mingo’s chief industry is its steel mill, first Carnegie Steel Mill, then Wheeling-Pitt Steel Mill for over 100 years. The town’s deep character is etched in its work, social, cultural, and natural landscapes. This is seen in its schools, churches, businesses and industry, daily life, active social organizations, and its famous figures: Jake Strott and George Kakasic of the 1930s Pittsburgh Steelers (Pirates); Joe Fortunato of the Chicago Bears; coach Woody Hayes; Spud Hughes, inventor of menthol cigarettes; and Bill (Lil Squirt) Albaugh, spokesperson for Squirt soda. Renowned singing groups include The Antones, The Stereos, Buddy Sharp and the Shakers, The Mingo Men, and Bob Parissi of Wild Cherry. Among major movies filmed in the town are Reckless, Hearts of Steel, and 1978 Academy Award winner The Deer Hunter.

Description
A top social media guru shares the secrets to expanding your
business through relationships
People have always done business with people they know, like,
and trust. That's the essence of "relationship marketing." Today,
the popularity of online social networking has caused a paradigm
shift in relationship marketing. This book helps businesspeople and

expert Mari Smith outlines a step-by-step plan for building a
sizable, loyal network comprised of quality relationships that

web, and to improve your own leadership and relationship skills
through emotional and social intelligence, this book is for
you.


Outlines how to become a significant "center of influence" for
your customers and prospects


Explains the unspoken rules of online etiquette—and the
common "turnoffs" that drive customers and potential partners
away


Details the unique cultures of Facebook, Twitter, and other
popular online platforms


Shows exactly what to automate and delegate to build your
social media persona, yet still retain the personal touch

Business is about people…and always has been. No one can succeed in business without building relationships – after all, who wants to do business with someone they don’t know…or worse, someone they don’t like!
People have always done business with people they know, like, and trust. That's the essence of "relationship marketing." But now the popularity of online social networking has shifted methods of connecting with consumers, stakeholders, and potential partners – and businesses that master both new and traditional ways of nurturing customer relationships are gaining market share.
In The New Relationship Marketing: How to Build a Large, Loyal, Profitable Network Using the Social Web, social marketing expert Mari Smith outlines a proven nine-step program for building a sizable, loyal network comprised of quality relationships that garner leads, publicity, sales, and more.
Mari aims to help busy professionals, executives and business owners foster high quality relationships with customers and their community at large. Just as she does in The New Relationship Marketing, Mari can discuss:

How to become a significant "center of influence" for your customers and prospects
The unspoken rules of online etiquette—and the common turnoffs that drive customers and potential partners away
How to navigate the unique cultures of Facebook, Twitter, and other popular online platforms
What you can automate and delegate to build your social media persona, yet still retain the personal touch
Unique culture of each popular online platform and how to interact within it

“Those individuals and companies with the largest ‘social footprint’ get the biggest successes, the big bucks, the big wins,” says Smith. “It's not what you know, it's who you know – but, more importantly, who knows you and what they know about you.”
By fostering high quality relationships with customers and their community at large, businesses can easily begin to see an increase in measurable results, including profits.
