Each sink includes a cabinet and countertop cut-out templates for perfect, predictable installation results (unlike fireclay competitors). Available accessories include stainless steel bottom basin racks that are custom-sized to the sink basin. Constructed of durable KOHLER Cast Iron, this sink is available in a wide variety of colors and features a deckless design for customized faucet.

PRODUCT DETAILS:

The Whitehaven apron-front kitchen sink features a streamlined and versatile farmhouse style. The Self-Trimming design requires only a simple rough cut, overlapping the cabinet face for beautiful results. The tall integral apron also acts as a drip edge to protect the cabinet from water damage. A large single basin accommodates large pots and pans, while the sloped bottom helps with draining and cleanup. Crafted from enameled cast iron, this sink resists chipping, cracking, or burning for years of beauty and reliable performance.
