Joseph W. “Chip” Marshall, III is Vice Chairman of the firm and also serves as Vice Chairman of Griffin, our affiliated investment bank.
A prominent and highly regarded figure in the health care industry and the Greater Philadelphia marketplace, Chip is the former Chairman and CEO of Temple University Health System, one of the largest health care organizations in Pennsylvania. In this capacity, he was responsible for an integrated delivery system comprised of five acute-care hospitals, a 120-bed behavioral health center, a critical care ground transportation company and a physician management company. During his tenure, all hospitals in the Temple health system received Joint Commission on the Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) scores of 95 or better, which placed it in the top tier of health systems in the country. Chip also served as Director of Health Partners, a provider-owned Medicaid/Medicare Health Maintenance Organization operating in Greater Philadelphia, which maintained Medicaid and Medicare enrollment of approximately 180,000 people.
Equally active in the higher education community, Chip has been a member of the Temple University Board of Trustees for more than 20 years and serves on its Executive Committee, among other committees, and is a member of the Board of Trustees of Salus University, formerly the Pennsylvania College of Optometry.
In addition, Chip has held several significant government-appointed positions, including being one of the original appointees to the seven-member Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board, which has jurisdiction over all aspects of the authorization, implementation and operation of slot machines in the Commonwealth. During his tenure, the board established the agency of state government charged with regulating the newly created gaming industry in Pennsylvania. He was involved with issuing the regulations necessary to implement the Pennsylvania Race Horse Development and Gaming Act, which permitted slot machines at racetracks converting them into racinos, and worked with other board members to issue six permanent racino licenses and five permanent casino licenses in December 2006.
Chip also served on the Medicaid Commission created by Congress and established by the Honorable Michael O. Leavitt, Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, where he advised the Secretary on ways to modernize the Medicaid program to provide high-quality health care to its beneficiaries in a financially sustainable way. He also served as Vice Chairman and Chairman of the Pennsylvania State Ethics Commission, which regulates the conduct of the majority of public employees, elected officials and candidates for public office in Pennsylvania.

Harenza, CEO and Senior Managing Director of Griffin. “He brings a wealth of knowledge and industry expertise to Griffin that will allow us to enhance the services we offer to clients operating in the health care and related industries throughout the Commonwealth, “ said Mr. Harenza. “This is especially important given the current climate and need for health care systems to consolidate, both horizontally and vertically.”
“The firm has an enterprise unlike any other in the region,” said Mr. Marshall. “The fusion of sophisticated legal services, investment banking services and government affairs advisory is unmatched by any other professional services firm.”
“I look forward to joining the Stevens & Lee/Griffin platform and working to bring the benefits of its vertically integrated team to businesses in the Greater Philadelphia marketplace and across the Commonwealth,” said Mr. Marshall.

The Lakota Way of Strength and Courage
Lessons in Resilience from the Bow and Arrow

															In Lakota tradition, the bow and arrow were more than tools for hunting or battle.  The bow’s resilience and flexibility, the arrow’s grace and power, the archer’s focus and patiencein these, we find the essential qualities for living a life of strength, purpose, and simplicity. In The Lakota Way of Strength and Courage, Joseph M. Marshall builds upon the central metaphor of the bow and arrow to provide a treasury of insights, stories, and irreplaceable wisdom. With elegant and captivating writings, this master storyteller illuminates timeless lessons on:

 •Transformationhow we can preserve what is fundamental even as our external circumstances change

 •Simplicitythe story of grandmother Grass Braid, who understood that “the more you know, the less you need to carry”

 •Strength and Resiliencywhat the history and lore of the Lakota can teach us about growing through adversity

 •Purposehow the world unveils our purpose to us, as revealed in story of the Keeper of the Winter Count

Once, the Lakota people relied on the ash bow and the willow arrow to provide food and sustenance. Today, these simple tools can offer us something even more precious: a way to nourish our souls with spiritual wisdom. Joseph M. Marshall offers a book that is at once profound, honest, and rich with meaning as he reveals  The Lakota Way of Strength and Courage.

PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/26/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

As with all your investments through Fidelity, you must make your own determination whether an investment is appropriate for you.  Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.  Foreign securities are subject to interest-rate, currency-exchange-rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.  Illiquidity is an inherent risk associated with investing in real estate and REITs.  There is no guarantee the issuer of a REIT will maintain the secondary market for its shares and redemptions may be at a price which is more or less than the original price paid.  Closed-end funds can trade at a discount to their NAV.  Shareholders of Master Limited Partnerships may be treated as partners for tax purposes.  Partnerships issue a Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) rather than a Form 1099 form for tax purposes. It lists the partner's share of income, deductions, credits, etc.  Speak with your tax advisor to determine how this may affect you.  A royalty trust is a type of corporation, mostly in the United States or Canada, usually involved in oil and gas production or mining.  Royalty trusts may have special tax treatment, so you should consult a tax advisor on the potential tax consequences of investing in them.News, commentary and events are from third-party sources unaffiliated with Fidelity.
