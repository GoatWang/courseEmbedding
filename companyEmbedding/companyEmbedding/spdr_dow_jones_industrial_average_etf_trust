DIA Fund Description
The SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF tracks a price-weighted index of 30 large-cap US stocks, selected by the editors of the Wall Street Journal.
  
DIA FactSet Analytics Insight
Despite the name recognition that comes from tracking the Dow and its own popularity, DIA is not the ideal ETF for investors who want broad-based exposure to US large-caps. The fund’s tiny portfolio, arbitrary selection, and antiquated weighting produce significant sector biases relative to the market, and cover only a fraction of the large-cap space, typically represented by hundreds of names. Stocks are price-weighted, not cap-weighted, which can produce major sector realignments when multiple holdings change, as occurred in September 2013. Still, DIA tends to move with the broader market day-to-day, and some may prefer its typically (slightly) lower beta.DIA is extremely liquid, with huge assets and a long track record, and is reasonably priced. The fund’s UIT structure is shared by a few other long-lived ETFs (like SPY), with the most notable effects being a slight cash drag since stock dividends received in between the ETF’s distributions can’t be reinvested as is typically the case. UITs must also hold every stock in the index at all times, which can tie the PM’s hands. Still, for exposure to the Dow—a concentrated, universally-cited basket of household names—DIA is a great choice.

Arrow Dow Jones Global Yield ETF (GYLD) Rises 1.71% for Jul 18

The Rank Correlation Index (RCI) is based on an analysis algorithm by Charles Spearman. The indicator shows statistical relations between date and price as a correlation without the relationship between the two variables is of affine type.More notable recent First Trust DJ Internet Index Fund (ETF) (NYSEARCA:FDN) news were published by: "Seekingalpha.com which released: "First Trust Blows Competition Out Of Water" on July 12, 2017, also Benzinga.com with their article: "ï"¿Should You Worry About A Trump Trap?" published on April 25, 2017, Nasdaq.com published: "First Trust Dow Jones Internet Index Fund Experiences Big Outflow" on March 02, 2017. The RSI was developed by J. Welles Wilder in the late 1970's. Other technical analysts have built upon the work of Wilder. The ADX alone measures trend strength but not direction. Normal oscillations tend to stay in the range of -100 to +100. The indicator is computed by using the average losses and gains of a stock over a certain time period. A level of 50 would indicate neutral market momentum. The 14-day RSI is now at 66.99, the 7-day stands at 74.58, and the 3-day is sitting at 86.45.Jul 17 is a negative day so far for First Trust Dow Jones Internet ETF (NYSEARCA:FDN) as the ETF is active during the day after losing 0.09% to hit $98.58 per share. A value of 25-50 would support a strong trend. A value of 50-75 would signal a very strong trend, and a value of 75-100 would indicate an extremely strong trend. ADX is used to gauge trend strength but not trend direction. Using the ADX with the Plus Directional Indicator (+DI) and Minus Directional Indicator (-DI) may help determine the direction of the trend as well as the overall momentum.SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (NYSE:DIA) was the recipient of some unusual options trading activity on Thursday. Although the CCI indicator was developed for commodities, it has become a popular tool for equity evaluation as well. In terms of Moving Averages, the 7-day is resting at 35.35.Investors may be watching other technical indicators such as the Williams Percent Range or Williams %R. A CCI reading of +100 may represent overbought conditions, while readings near -100 may indicate oversold territory.The ETF is -5.29% of its 52-Week High and 39.05% of its low, and is now having ATR of 1.3. In general, if the indicator goes above -20, the stock may be considered overbought. Alternately, if the indicator goes under -80, this may show the stock as being oversold.
