Sageview Capital   –  Strategy
























































 



















										Engaged, Long-Term Partner for Growing Companies 										








Strategy
November 7th, 2013
wpadmin

Strategy
Sageview’s investment efforts are focused on three primary sectors: technology, financial services, and business services.
Focus on Select Growth Industries
Sageview’s investment efforts are focused on three primary sectors: technology, financial services, and business services. These industries are characterized by above-GDP growth trends and a large number of small and mid-sized companies, creating a robust opportunity set in which attractive investment returns can be achieved without the use of excessive financial leverage.  Sageview’s investment team has deep industry experience and a strong track record in these verticals.
Proactive and Proprietary Sourcing
Sageview focuses primarily on minority investments and other opportunities where governance or structure often fall outside the mandates of traditional private equity and venture capital funds. Sageview’s extensive global relationship network is a valuable sourcing engine, and the majority of our investments are proprietary in nature, with Sageview as the lead or only investor and a member of the Board of Directors.
Asymmetric Risk-Return
Sageview pursues a rigorous underwriting approach that prioritizes capital preservation and risk-mitigation, while maintaining attractive upside optionality.  Sources of downside protection might include recurring cash flow, tangible asset values, structural protections, hedging, or other means.  By investing in equity and equity like securities, Sageview maintains exposure to upside performance.
Active Approach to Ownership
Sageview targets a portfolio of 15-20 total investments, enabling the firm to concentrate efforts on opportunities where Sageview’s capital, expertise and active involvement can have a meaningful impact on value creation.   Sageview looks to partner with founders and management teams who have a demonstrated track record of success, a clear strategy for value creation, and incentives that are aligned with those of other shareholders.
Opportunistic Investing in Public Markets
Sageview opportunistically invests in public companies and special situations, consistent with the firm’s history and experience.  Our focus is primarily on situations where we can be an engaged, impactful anchor shareholder to small and mid-cap public companies.

Our Approach

Sageview provides growth capital to small and mid-sized companies in the technology, financial services, and business services sectors. We combine active ownership, industry experience and a partnership approach to drive long-term value for our portfolio companies and investors.READ MORE



Working with Sageview


“We were looking for a capital partner that was different from the other firms we had interacted with, and Sageview’s approach stood out.  They have been engaged in nearly every aspect of our business – strategic discussions, executive hires, financial planning and monitoring, operational efficiency, board composition to name a few – and have constructively supported our growth initiatives.  They are an important part of Avalara’s success.”Scott McFarlane, CEO, Avalara
“Sageview has brought practical, straight-forward thinking to help grow GoPro and take it to the next level.  They know when to be deeply involved and when to apply a deft touch, and have been committed partners since day one.”Nick Woodman, CEO, GoPro
“We’ve worked with many investors over the years and what makes Sageview unique is their approach beyond economics. Their principals make a significant personal investment both financially and intellectually and care deeply about driving the best outcome for all. Their exceptional knowledge of our business to its core, experience and perspective is helping us grow and evolve into one of the dominant and most innovative brands in the wealth counseling business.”Joe Duran, CEO, United Capital
“We chose to partner with Sageview because of their ability to help us grow our business, and their engaged approach was evident from day 1. They helped us map the investments we need to scale the business, then helped us achieve that scale by introducing us to potential Fortune 500 customers.”Prashanth Palakurthi, CEO, Reflexis
“Sageview invested in EverBank in the depth of the financial crisis in 2008.  Making an investment at that time is a testament to the work they put in to understand the business and the management team and our vision for growth.  Since then we have grown from a $6 billion institution to nearly $20 billion today.  Along the way, we have benefited from Sageview’s years of investment experience and board leadership.”Rob Clements, CEO, EverBank
“The team at Sageview has taken a leadership role on the Exaro board from day one, working seamlessly with  management and our other investors.  They have been instrumental in helping us think through various strategic opportunities by combining a rigorous analytical approach and nuanced understanding of the E&P business with the benefit of years of experience as business owners.”Chris Beato, CEO, Exaro
“I joined Cadence when it was started in large part due to Sageview’s involvement. They bring more than capital to the table – they are part of the team and  have an invaluable network.  They have deep experience and expertise and have been tremendously supportive of our management team.  It is valuable for me to have Sageview as a sounding board – it helps me make better decisions. It’s a strong partnership.”Paul Murphy, CEO, CadencePrev

Edward Gilhuly Insider Sell Transaction
As stated in the SEC, a public form for the trade of 150,000 shares of GoPro Inc (NASDAQ:GPRO)  8.10 +0.04 0.50% by Edward Gilhuly was filled. Edward Gilhuly serves as a director of the fabricated metal product manufacturing’s company. The form was filled on August 4, 2015. These insider shares were unloaded at average $64.2 for a share, and are worth $9,633,135 USD, making the trade a very significant one. This is not his first insider trade, in the last 30 days, he sold another 253,400 shares worth $16,332,906 USD. This massive sell will probably draw attention, as he now owns 1.43% of the total market cap of the Company.
Gopro Inc Stock Rating, Sentiment and Fundamentals
In our view, the trade made by Edward Gilhuly, shows his lack of trust and confidence in the Company’s stock price and future. Seventeen equity analysts who cover Gopro Inc’s stock are predicting earnings of $1.85 per share for 2015 giving the fabricated metal product manufacturing’s company a forward price to earnings ratio of 33.64. These analysts suggest EPS growth rate of not more than 31.90% Year-Over-Year.
Analysts at Pacific Crest maintained their “sector weight” rating for GoPro Inc (GPRO) on June 22, 2015.
Pacific Crest noted: “GoPro continues to perform better than expected, but we think the stock’s valuation largely reflects this. With GPRO trading at 29x our new 2016 EPS estimate, we view multiple expansion as unlikely. We prefer AMBA as a derivative with multiple shots at upside and higher growth and profitability…The strong report and guidance were consistent with our checks; however, some small Hero 4 Session revenue slipping into Q2 combined with a $55 million uptick in inventory said to be in preparation for the holiday quarter could give some investors pause.”
