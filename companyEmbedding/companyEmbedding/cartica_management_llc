A smart product management hub for retailthat streamlines digital content and data sharing






 





















Our mission
 
We have made it our mission to provide brands and retailers simple and affordable tools that tackle many challenges in digital product management and distribution by:













Solving the practical challenge of organizing, sourcing, and sharing product content.









Giving brands and retailers access to a whole new level of detailed ecommerce data and analytics
















Take control of your products with Plytix
 









Our Story
 
The idea for Plytix evolved from our time at Google, when we were working with some of the biggest companies in the e-commerce space. At the time, technology allowed tracking user behaviour on individual websites, but we wanted to give brands and retailers access to a whole new level of detailed data, bringing them a better understanding of their products through 3rd party product analytics. 
 
Since then Plytix has evolved into an end-to-end product management eco-system where brands and retailers can organize, analyze, and share product content and performance in a user-friendly and efficient way without breaking the bank. 
 




























Our Team
 
We're a diverse, international team passionate about creating extraordinary client experiences and serious about revolutionizing e-commerce. We are growing rapidly and we're always on the look out for smart, driven people to join our team.

An Attorney General Under (Friendly) Fire: Why Removing Jeff Sessions Is Beside the Point in President Trump’s War Against Robert Mueller

WASHINGTON, 28 de febrero de 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Cartica Management, LLC ("Cartica"), firma global y líder en la administración de activos alternativos centrada en la gestión activa de acciones de mercados emergentes, expresó su apoyo a las acciones tomadas por la Bolsa Mexicana de Valores (BMV) el pasado 21 de febrero, las cuales recomiendan que todas las emisoras proporcionen más del mínimo estatutario de 15 días de aviso para las asambleas anuales de los accionistas. La comunicación de la BMV señaló que la recomendación fue hecha después de ser consultada con la Comisión Nacional Bancaria y de Valores (CNBV) y citó la solicitud de Cartica para que las emisoras realicen los avisos y que todos los materiales de apoyo estén disponibles electrónicamente por lo menos 30 días antes de cualquier asamblea de accionistas. 








"Cartica agradece a la BMV y a la CNBV por su capacidad de respuesta a las preocupaciones de los inversionistas sobre cómo los cortos periodos de aviso practicados por muchas de las más importantes emisoras mexicanas han estado privando los derechos de los accionistas minoritarios. Esperamos que las emisoras tomen la recomendación de la BMV y que en esta próxima temporada de asambleas un porcentaje alto de emisoras mexicanas proporcione a sus accionistas 30 días de aviso de sus Asambleas Generales Anuales y al mismo tiempo otorguen todos los materiales de apoyo electrónicamente. Si esto pasa, sólo puede ser positivo para el mercado, para los accionistas y en última instancia para las propias compañías", dijo Mike Lubrano, Director General de Gobierno Corporativo y Sustentabilidad de Cartica. 
El 30 de enero, Cartica emitió un comunicado haciendo pública su solicitud formal a la CNBV y a la BMV para exigir a todas las emisoras públicas en México: 1) extender el periodo para el aviso previo de las asambleas de accionistas hasta por lo menos 30 días; y 2) rescindir las disposiciones de los estatutos que requieren la aprobación del Consejo de Administración para que un accionista adquiera un 10% de las acciones con derecho a voto y ejerza su derecho estatutario de nominar a un director para el Consejo.
Otros grandes inversionistas institucionales, incluyendo Aberdeen Asset Management, Franklin Templeton Investments, CalPERS y CalSTRS, están apoyando activamente los esfuerzos de Cartica.
Cartica y estos inversionistas continuarán abogando por las medidas legales y regulatorias para exigir a las compañías listadas que rescindan las disposiciones de los estatutos que requieren la aprobación del Consejo o de la mayoría de los accionistas, antes de que un accionista minoritario pueda adquirir el 10% de las acciones con derecho a voto y ejerzer su derecho estatutario a elegir a un director para el Consejo. 
"Los redactores de la Ley de Mercados de Valores de México fueron sabios al empoderar a la minoría de los accionistas a elegir a un director para los Consejos, los cuales están típicamente dominados por los nominados del controlador. Las disposiciones de los estatutos que intentan quitar este contrapeso a la dominación de los accionistas mayoritarios es ilegal y el regulador y la bolsa deberían unirse a los inversionistas para insistir en que sean retirados.", dijo el Sr. Lubrano. 
About Cartica Management, LLC:
Cartica Management, LLC (www.cartica.com) es una firma global de gestión de activos alternos centrada en la propiedad activa de acciones de mercados emergentes. La firma busca desencadenar el crecimiento a largo plazo en sus inversiones al asociarse con equipos directivos, Consejos, y accionistas para impulsar cambios positivos en gobernanza y operaciones. Cartica fue fundada en 2008 por antiguos ejecutivos de International Finance Corporation (IFC), miembro del Grupo del Banco Mundial, con sede en Washington D.C. A partir del 1 de enero de 2017, la firma tiene $2.4 mil millones de dólares bajo su administración.

A smart product management hub for retailthat streamlines digital content and data sharing






 





















Our mission
 
We have made it our mission to provide brands and retailers simple and affordable tools that tackle many challenges in digital product management and distribution by:













Solving the practical challenge of organizing, sourcing, and sharing product content.









Giving brands and retailers access to a whole new level of detailed ecommerce data and analytics
















Take control of your products with Plytix
 









Our Story
 
The idea for Plytix evolved from our time at Google, when we were working with some of the biggest companies in the e-commerce space. At the time, technology allowed tracking user behaviour on individual websites, but we wanted to give brands and retailers access to a whole new level of detailed data, bringing them a better understanding of their products through 3rd party product analytics. 
 
Since then Plytix has evolved into an end-to-end product management eco-system where brands and retailers can organize, analyze, and share product content and performance in a user-friendly and efficient way without breaking the bank. 
 




























Our Team
 
We're a diverse, international team passionate about creating extraordinary client experiences and serious about revolutionizing e-commerce. We are growing rapidly and we're always on the look out for smart, driven people to join our team.
