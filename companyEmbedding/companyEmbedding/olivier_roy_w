Q&A with Roy W. Olivier, president & CEO, ARI
May 1, 2014
By Jonathan Sweet 


 
From websites to social media to online reputation management, digital marketing is rapidly evolving. With its recent acquisitions and product releases, ARI is increasing its investment in those areas.
This month, we talked to ARI president & CEO Roy Olivier about what’s driving that growth strategy and why it’s so important to the company’s future.
Boating Industry: When you look at the marine industry for 2014, what’s ARI’s outlook for this year?
Olivier: We actually look at industry agnostic numbers and industry numbers and in both cases we see 2014 shaping up to be a pretty good year, barring some sort of unexpected event that would affect the economy. Most of the dealers and manufacturers that we deal with are reporting increased website traffic, increased leads and are doing well. I think 2014 is shaping up to look like a pretty strong year.
Boating Industry: You’re in a number of other industries as well. Does that carry across the other markets ARI is working in?
Olivier: Yeah, I think so. We serve several industries. A couple of them are not tied as closely to the economy as powersports, RV, marine and some of those. Definitely, in the consumer spending-oriented industries that we’re in, the fact that the economy has continued to expand has lead to more traffic and lead to more leads and lead to more sales than in previous years. In general, we think 2014 will be an up year for most of the verticals that we’re in.
Boating Industry: What do you see as major challenges to a continued industry recovery?
Olivier: I think the biggest challenge in our minds is consumer sentiment as formed by the mixed economic signals we’re seeing. The government – their spending affected Q4 GDP by a full percentage point. We’re seeing mixed messages. You pick up the paper one day and the economy’s doing well. Pick up the paper next day and you get a message the economy’s doing well.
I think if people feel like the economy’s doing well and they feel like their house is going up in value and they feel like their job is secure, we’re going to see increased spending. If some event or series of events occur that erode that confidence, that’s going to have an impact on the business.
Boating Industry: What makes you optimistic about the marine industry?
Olivier: We’re optimistic because the dealers who are still around are much more educated and much more resourceful than in previous years. They’re focused on investing in things that will grow their business. Specifically, a lot of technology investment to drive leads and create an electronic dialogue with their customers via social media, email, mobile messaging and other methods.
Boating Industry: Last year, you acquired Duo Web Solutions. What made that an attractive move for ARI?
Olivier: Duo was really an acquisition that directly links to our strategy to provide additional marketing services to dealers and manufacturers. Duo had a suite of services primarily designed to address search engine marketing, online reputation management, email and other services to help those dealers have strategies and tactics for creating that electronic dialogue with their customers via social media and other outlets.
The acquisition was really to strengthen our capability in that area. The principal of Duo, Heather Blessington, is now our chief marketing officer. Her role here is to help us take the ARI offerings, the Duo offerings, put them together and kind of reboot our strategy with those products.
Boating Industry: They were a big player on the powersports side. Do you anticipate being able to apply what they were doing to your marine clients as well?
Olivier: The best practices in the industries are very, very similar, so we believe that a lot of the skillset and a lot of the things that they did in other vertical markets will translate directly into marine.
We’ve done 14 acquisitions in the last 15 years or so and if you look back at all of our acquisitions were designed to acquire primarily a dealer footprint or a product suite. Duo was the first time that we’ve done something that really wasn’t product or dealer footprint. It was designed to increase our capability in a specific area because we believe three years, four years from now, digital marketing will be much more important than it has been historically.
Boating Industry: Why is that important to the industry?
Olivier: Dealers that are not on top of and executing a good digital marketing strategy are simply going to get lost in the ocean of websites out there that are offering products and services to consumers. Helping dealers understand how to create a local, digital dialogue with customers and prospective customers, how do they manage their online reputation, how do they manage the various social media channels and drive traffic into the dealerships, that’s going to be more and more important.
Boating Industry: As you said, there have been a lot of acquisitions for ARI. What does ARI look at when making an acquisition?
Olivier: We have a pretty aggressive five-year growth plan. When we look forward over the next five years, I believe that half of our growth will come organically by growing our base business today. The other half of our growth will come through acquisitions. Those acquisitions are going to fall into a few broad buckets.
We do like to do acquisitions where we can roll-up competitors in a market we’re already in. We’ve purchased other e-catalog companies that have been direct competitors, we’ve purchased website companies that have been direct competitors, simply to strengthen our position in that market.
Secondarily, we’ve done acquisitions to bring on a new technology or a new vertical market where we want to have additional growth, either by taking a new product and selling it into the existing vertical markets that we’re in or we’ve acquired new vertical markets. For example, in 2008 we acquired ChannelBlade, which was a leader in marine. ARI was a much smaller player in marine, so that acquisitions allowed us to significantly grow our presence.
Boating Industry: What are some of the biggest mistakes you’re seeing companies make when it comes to their digital marketing?
Olivier: There’s a couple that we see over and over again. One is just not executing in general. That’s the dealers that either don’t have a strategy or haven’t taken the time to sit down and execute on the strategy they have selected.
The second one is not effectively measuring what’s working and what’s not. It’s easy to invest money in a lot of different areas, but I think the most successful dealers are very diligent about measuring what’s working and what’s not and investing heavily in those areas.
I was looking at some survey data and it’s interesting to see dealers’ perception of what works and doesn’t work and how they evaluate that. Some evaluate it not by leads, not by sales, but simply by, as an example, the number of people that have decided to follow them on a social media outlet. Effectively deciding where I’m going to invest and what metrics I’m going to use to decide if that investment makes sense is an area that’s evolving.
Boating Industry: What are the latest products rolling out from ARI?
Olivier: We rolled out a really cool product in 2013 that’s called AccessorySmart. Its first rollout was for the powersports segment, primarily motorcycle. What it does it allows you to say, “I have this mirror and this model product,” and it searches through 1,400 manufacturers worth of data and shows you what specifically fits your ride. As we move that product into marine, I think that will be an exciting new product that we’d like to accomplish in 2014 so you can see what will fit your boat.
We’ll also launch a new website platform this year that will take advantage of some of the best practices in digital marketing and tie their social media strategy to their dealer website.
Boating Industry: You mentioned the five-year plan. What is ARI focused on in 2014 and beyond?
Olivier: We’re focused on some pretty aggressive revenue growth targets. In 2014, we’re continuing to complete the integration of the three acquisitions we’ve made in the last 18 months. Long term, we’re continuing to look to grow ARI at a pretty aggressive rate.

It’s easy to understand why so many otherwise capable people are distressed, anxiety-ridden and almost paralyzed if they’re called upon to make a presentation — even a friendly audience of three — let alone 300. They often reveal how they feel by starting out with “I only wish I had more time to prepare” or “I’m not really good at ...

Olivier Roy (born 1949 in La Rochelle) is a French political scientist, professor at the European University Institute in Florence, Italy.[1][2] He has published articles and books on secularisation[3] and Islam [4] including "Global Islam",[5] and The Failure of Political Islam. He is known to have "a different view of radical Islam" than some other experts (seeing it as peripheral, Westernized and part of a radicalized and "virtual" rather than pious and "actual" Muslim community).[6] More recently he has written on the Charlie Hebdo shooting,[7] and the November 2015 Paris attacks.[8]

Early life[edit]
Roy was born in 1949 in La Rochelle.[9] Roy received an agrégation in philosophy and a master's degree in Persian language and civilization in 1972 from the French Institut National des Langues et Civilisations Orientales. In 1996, he received his PhD in Political Science from the IEP. At the beginning he worked in 1973 as high school teacher. In the 1970 years as young was active in the maoist movement "La Gauche prolétarienne" (Proletarian Left).[10]
Career[edit]
He was previously a research director at the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS) and a lecturer for both the School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences (EHESS) and the Institut d'Études Politiques de Paris (IEP).
From 1984 to 2008, he consulted with the French Foreign Ministry. In 1988, Roy served as a United Nations Office for Coordinating Relief in Afghanistan (UNOCA) consultant. Beginning in August 1993, Roy served as special Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) representative to Tajikistan until February 1994, at which time he was selected as head of the OSCE mission to Tajikistan, a position he held until October 1994.[11]
Roy is the author of books on Iran, Islam and Asian politics. These works include Globalized Islam: The search for a new ummah, Today's Turkey: A European State? and The Illusions of September 11. He also serves on the editorial board of the academic journal Central Asian Survey. His best-known book, L'Echec de l'Islam politique (1992) (The Failure of Political Islam) (1994), is a standard text for students of political Islam.
Roy wrote widely on the 2005 civil unrest in France, rebutting the suggestion that the violence was religiously inspired. He argues that Islamism is merely the rubric under which troubled youth enact their violent inclinations.[12] A view adamantly opposed by Roy's intellectual rival, Gilles Kepel.[12]
According to Judith Miller, in the wake of the September 11 attacks Olivier argued that militant Islamism of he type represented by Al Qaeda had peaked and was fading into insignificance.[13]
His book Secularism Confronts Islam (Columbia, 2007) offers a perspective on the place of Islam in secular society and looks at the diverse experiences of Muslim immigrants in the West. Roy examines how Muslim intellectuals have made it possible for Muslims to live in a secularized world while maintaining the identity of a "true believer."
In 2010 he published Holy Ignorance, When Religion and Culture Part Ways, an analysis of religion, ethnicity and culture and the results when these part ways.
After the Charlie Hebdo shooting he argued that most French Muslims were committed to prevent violence,[14] and after the November 2015 Paris attacks, he wrote a strategic analysis of ISIS and the fight against it, published in The New York Times.[8]

Olivier Roy (born 1949 in La Rochelle) is a French political scientist, professor at the European University Institute in Florence, Italy.[1][2] He has published articles and books on secularisation[3] and Islam [4] including "Global Islam",[5] and The Failure of Political Islam. He is known to have "a different view of radical Islam" than some other experts (seeing it as peripheral, Westernized and part of a radicalized and "virtual" rather than pious and "actual" Muslim community).[6] More recently he has written on the Charlie Hebdo shooting,[7] and the November 2015 Paris attacks.[8]

Early life[edit]
Roy was born in 1949 in La Rochelle.[9] Roy received an agrégation in philosophy and a master's degree in Persian language and civilization in 1972 from the French Institut National des Langues et Civilisations Orientales. In 1996, he received his PhD in Political Science from the IEP. At the beginning he worked in 1973 as high school teacher. In the 1970 years as young was active in the maoist movement "La Gauche prolétarienne" (Proletarian Left).[10]
Career[edit]
He was previously a research director at the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS) and a lecturer for both the School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences (EHESS) and the Institut d'Études Politiques de Paris (IEP).
From 1984 to 2008, he consulted with the French Foreign Ministry. In 1988, Roy served as a United Nations Office for Coordinating Relief in Afghanistan (UNOCA) consultant. Beginning in August 1993, Roy served as special Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) representative to Tajikistan until February 1994, at which time he was selected as head of the OSCE mission to Tajikistan, a position he held until October 1994.[11]
Roy is the author of books on Iran, Islam and Asian politics. These works include Globalized Islam: The search for a new ummah, Today's Turkey: A European State? and The Illusions of September 11. He also serves on the editorial board of the academic journal Central Asian Survey. His best-known book, L'Echec de l'Islam politique (1992) (The Failure of Political Islam) (1994), is a standard text for students of political Islam.
Roy wrote widely on the 2005 civil unrest in France, rebutting the suggestion that the violence was religiously inspired. He argues that Islamism is merely the rubric under which troubled youth enact their violent inclinations.[12] A view adamantly opposed by Roy's intellectual rival, Gilles Kepel.[12]
According to Judith Miller, in the wake of the September 11 attacks Olivier argued that militant Islamism of he type represented by Al Qaeda had peaked and was fading into insignificance.[13]
His book Secularism Confronts Islam (Columbia, 2007) offers a perspective on the place of Islam in secular society and looks at the diverse experiences of Muslim immigrants in the West. Roy examines how Muslim intellectuals have made it possible for Muslims to live in a secularized world while maintaining the identity of a "true believer."
In 2010 he published Holy Ignorance, When Religion and Culture Part Ways, an analysis of religion, ethnicity and culture and the results when these part ways.
After the Charlie Hebdo shooting he argued that most French Muslims were committed to prevent violence,[14] and after the November 2015 Paris attacks, he wrote a strategic analysis of ISIS and the fight against it, published in The New York Times.[8]

Olivier Roy (born 1949 in La Rochelle) is a French political scientist, professor at the European University Institute in Florence, Italy.[1][2] He has published articles and books on secularisation[3] and Islam [4] including "Global Islam",[5] and The Failure of Political Islam. He is known to have "a different view of radical Islam" than some other experts (seeing it as peripheral, Westernized and part of a radicalized and "virtual" rather than pious and "actual" Muslim community).[6] More recently he has written on the Charlie Hebdo shooting,[7] and the November 2015 Paris attacks.[8]

Early life[edit]
Roy was born in 1949 in La Rochelle.[9] Roy received an agrégation in philosophy and a master's degree in Persian language and civilization in 1972 from the French Institut National des Langues et Civilisations Orientales. In 1996, he received his PhD in Political Science from the IEP. At the beginning he worked in 1973 as high school teacher. In the 1970 years as young was active in the maoist movement "La Gauche prolétarienne" (Proletarian Left).[10]
Career[edit]
He was previously a research director at the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS) and a lecturer for both the School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences (EHESS) and the Institut d'Études Politiques de Paris (IEP).
From 1984 to 2008, he consulted with the French Foreign Ministry. In 1988, Roy served as a United Nations Office for Coordinating Relief in Afghanistan (UNOCA) consultant. Beginning in August 1993, Roy served as special Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) representative to Tajikistan until February 1994, at which time he was selected as head of the OSCE mission to Tajikistan, a position he held until October 1994.[11]
Roy is the author of books on Iran, Islam and Asian politics. These works include Globalized Islam: The search for a new ummah, Today's Turkey: A European State? and The Illusions of September 11. He also serves on the editorial board of the academic journal Central Asian Survey. His best-known book, L'Echec de l'Islam politique (1992) (The Failure of Political Islam) (1994), is a standard text for students of political Islam.
Roy wrote widely on the 2005 civil unrest in France, rebutting the suggestion that the violence was religiously inspired. He argues that Islamism is merely the rubric under which troubled youth enact their violent inclinations.[12] A view adamantly opposed by Roy's intellectual rival, Gilles Kepel.[12]
According to Judith Miller, in the wake of the September 11 attacks Olivier argued that militant Islamism of he type represented by Al Qaeda had peaked and was fading into insignificance.[13]
His book Secularism Confronts Islam (Columbia, 2007) offers a perspective on the place of Islam in secular society and looks at the diverse experiences of Muslim immigrants in the West. Roy examines how Muslim intellectuals have made it possible for Muslims to live in a secularized world while maintaining the identity of a "true believer."
In 2010 he published Holy Ignorance, When Religion and Culture Part Ways, an analysis of religion, ethnicity and culture and the results when these part ways.
After the Charlie Hebdo shooting he argued that most French Muslims were committed to prevent violence,[14] and after the November 2015 Paris attacks, he wrote a strategic analysis of ISIS and the fight against it, published in The New York Times.[8]

About This BookAbout the AuthorsReviewsTable of Contents 


“Is theocracy really the future of the world’s one billion Muslims? Or should it be? …Never has the question been as brilliantly argued as in Olivier Roy’s L’echec de l’Islam politique, now available in a superb English translation as The Failure of Political Islam. His closely reasoned, original and unsentimental conclusion is that political Islam has already failed—that ‘Islamism’ has already atrophied into a sterile, hypocritical—and very Western—neofundamentalism… The Failure of Political Islam addresses the history, sociology, economy and ‘geostrategy’ of political Islam, with excellent case studies of Iran and Afghanistan… [A] daring exploration… This book is a corrective of stunning power.”—Peter Theroux, Boston Book Review
“If you read only one book on political Islam, this should be it. Olivier Roy…has turned his attention to the phenomenon of Islamic radicalism with remarkable results. On practically every page one finds an interpretation or observation that is provocative and insightful.”—William B. Quandt, Foreign Affairs
“The Failure of Political Islam acts as both a keystone and a launchpad to understanding the political ferment in the Arab world today. In the same way we learned that our perception of Communism as a monolithic force was in error, Olivier Roy exposes the political implications of diversity and weakness within Islam.”—Princeton Borough, The Times [UK]
“A view of Islam as a religion of political extremism, containing the seeds of its own politicization in a manner inherently incompatible with much of the Western world, has gradually become well entrenched in Western policy circles… In this erudite and powerful book, Olivier Roy persuasively challenges such ahistoricism. Roy…uses his wide-ranging and detailed knowledge of the Muslim world to present a reading of contemporary Islamic movements that provides an important corrective to such gross simplifications. The argument is all the more pertinent at a time when well-known American political scientists see global politics reduced to a ‘clash of civilizations.’ …[This] is a forceful work—an eloquent contribution to an important current debate by a scholar with long experience in the world of political Islam.”—Leonardo A. Villalón, American Political Science Review
“Olivier Roy’s examination of ‘political Islam’ has already had an important impact on the study of Islamism. His analysis is carefully defined and clearly presented… Roy’s conclusions are…sophisticated and nuanced. He argues that a particular type of Islamist program has failed and been replaced, not by a non-Islamic mode of thought, but by a different Islamic approach… This book is essential reading for all interested in the late 20th century evolution of movements of religious activism and revival… The issues that [Roy] raises—regarding the nature of Islamist movements and their relationships with modern institutions and concepts—must be dealt with.”—John O. Voll, Middle East Journal
“Roy perceptively argues that the attempt to create a universal Islamist state is doomed to failure because of the conflicts between Sunni and Shia forms and other ethnic differences in the Islamic world. His is a keen, timely study; highly recommended.”—Library Journal

July 13: Liu Xiaobo and the Responsibility of Being Alive
The Chinese dissident and Nobel Peace Prize recipient Liu Xiaobo died today, a few short weeks after the Chinese government revealed that he was suffering from cancer that had progressed beyond treatment during his political imprisonment. The course of his life was forever altered by the Tiananmen Square demonstrations of 1989, and, as Perry Link notes at NYR Daily, Liu felt haunted by the “lost souls” of Tiananmen, “the aggrieved ghosts of students and workers alike whose ages would forever be the same as on the night they died.” His widow Liu Xia reports that he dedicated his Nobel Prize to them in 2010, as he’d done in 2003 after receiving an award from the Chinese Demo…

Argument

The New Islamists


How the most extreme adherents of radical Islam are getting with the times. 


By Olivier RoyOlivier Roy is a professor at the European University Institute in Florence, Italy, and the author of Globalized Islam.
April 16, 2012


















 The following is an excerpt from the book The Islamists Are Coming: Who They Really Are,  which will be released on April 18 by the U.S. Institute of Peace and the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. 
 The longstanding debate over whether Islam and democracy can coexist has reached a stunning turning point. Since the Arab uprisings began in late 2010, political Islam and democracy have become increasingly interdependent. The debate over whether they are compatible is now virtually obsolete. Neither can now survive without the other.  
 In Middle Eastern countries undergoing political transitions, the only way for Islamists to maintain their legitimacy is through elections. Their own political culture may still not be democratic, but they are now defined by the new political landscape and forced in turn to redefine themselves — much as the Roman Catholic Church ended up accepting democratic institutions even as its own practices remained oligarchic.  
 At the same time, democracy will not set down roots in Arab countries in transition without including mainstream Islamist groups, such as the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, Ennahda in Tunisia, or Islah in Yemen. The so-called Arab Spring cleared the way for the Islamists. And even if many Islamists do not share the democratic culture of the demonstrators, the Islamists have to take into account the new playing field the demonstrations created. 
 The debate over Islam and democracy used to be a chicken-and-egg issue: Which came first?  Democracy has certainly not been at the core of Islamist ideology. Egypt’s Muslim Brotherhood has historically been strictly centralized and obedient to a supreme guide, who rules for life. And Islam has certainly not been factored into promotion of secular democracy. Indeed, skeptics long argued that the two forces were even anathema to each other. 
 But the outside world wrongly assumed that Islam would first have to experience a religious reformation before its followers could embark on political democratization — replicating the Christian experience when the Protestant Reformation gave birth to the Enlightenment and then modern democracy. In fact, however, liberal Muslim intellectuals had little impact in either inspiring or directing the Arab uprisings. The original protesters in Cairo’s Tahrir Square referred to democracy as a universal concept, not to any sort of Islamic democracy. 
 The development of both political Islam and democracy now appears to go hand-in-hand, albeit not at the same pace. The new political scene is transforming the Islamists as much as the Islamists are transforming the political scene. 
 Today, the question of Islam’s compatibility with democracy does not center on theological issues, but rather on the concrete way believers recast their faith in a rapidly changing political environment. Liberal or fundamentalist, the new forms of religiosity are individualistic and more in tune with the democratic ethos.  
 The Evolution 
 When Islamism gained ground during the 1970s and 1980s, it was initially dominated by revolutionary movements and radical tactics. Over the next 30 years, however, the religious revival in Arab societies diversified, and social shifts reined in radicalism. The toll of death and destruction that radical Islamism left in its wake also diverted interest in militancy. 
 Even the proliferation of media free from overbearing state control played a role. In the mid-1990s, Al-Jazeera became the first independent satellite television station in the Arab world. Within a generation, there were more than 500 such stations. Many offered a wide range of religious programming — from traditional sheikhs to liberal Muslim thinkers — which in turn introduced the idea of diversity. Suddenly, there was no single truth in a religion that has preached one path to God for 14 centuries. 
 Islamists also changed both through victory and defeat — or a combination. Shiite Islamists won a political victory in Iran’s 1979 revolution, when Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini rose to power. But three decades later, the world’s only modern theocracy was increasingly ostracized by the world, leading many Islamists to ask, "What went wrong?" 
 In Algeria, Sunni Islamists were pushed aside in a military coup on the eve of an election victory in 1992. The party was banned, its leaders imprisoned. A more militant faction then took on the military, and more than 100,000 people were killed in a decade-long civil war. The bloody aftermath of the Arab world’s first democratic election had a ripple effect on the calculations of Islamist groups across the region. 
 As a result of their experience with the power of government repression, Islamists increasingly compromised to get in, or stay in, the political game. In Egypt, the Muslim Brothers ran for parliament whenever allowed, often making tactical alliances with secular parties. In Kuwait and Morocco, Islamists abided by the political rules whenever they ran for parliament, even when it meant embracing those countries’ monarchies. Morocco’s Justice and Development Party recognized the sacred dimension of the king in order to participate in elections, while Jordan’s Muslim Brotherhood publicly supports the king despite growing discontent among the Arab Bedouin tribes. 
 A generation of Islamic activists forced into exile also played a major role in redirecting their movements. Most leaders or members ended up spending more time in Western countries rather than Islamic nations, where they  came into contact with other secular and liberal dissidents as well as non-government organizations such as Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, and Freedom House. These new connections facilitated the flow of ideas, and their movements’ evolution. 
 In the 1990s, exiled activists increasingly framed their agendas in terms of democracy and human rights. They acknowledged that simplistic slogans like "Islam is the solution" were not enough to build programs or coalitions capable of removing dictators. Rachid Ghannouchi, co-founder of Tunisia’s Ennahda Party, concluded almost 20 years before the Arab uprisings that democracy was a better tool to fight dictatorships than the call for either jihad or sharia.  
 The Social Revolution 
 Islamists have changed because society has changed too. The rise of Islamists has reflected the social and cultural revolutions within Muslim societies as much as a political revolution. 
 A new generation has entered the political space, especially in the major cities. It is the generation of Tahrir Square, the epicenter of Egypt’s uprising against Hosni Mubarak. When the uprisings began, two-thirds of the Arab world’s 300 million people were under the age of 30. They are better educated and more connected with the outside world than any previous generation. Many speak or understand a foreign language. The females are often as ambitious as their male counterparts. Both genders eagerly question and debate. Most are able to identify and even shrug off propaganda. 
 The shift does not necessarily mean the baby-boom generation is more liberal or more secular than their parents. Many Arab baby boomers are attracted by new forms of religiosity that stress individual choice, direct relations with God, self-realization, and self-esteem. But even when they join Islamic movements, they bring along their critical approach and reluctance to blindly follow an aging leadership. 
 The transformation is visible even among young Egyptian Salafis, followers of a puritanical strain of Islam that emphasizes a return to early Islamic practices. They may wear baggy trousers and long white shirts in imitation of the Prophet Mohammed. But they also often wear shiny sunglasses and sport shoes. They are part of a global culture. 
 For decades, the Salafis opposed participation in politics. But after the uprisings, they completely reversed course. They jumped into politics, hastily registering as political parties. At universities, clubs of young Salafis — including females — have joined public debate forums. 
 The influence of the current baby-boom generation will be enduring. Their numbers are likely to dominate for much of their lives — potentially another 30 to 40 years — because the fertility rate has plummeted almost everywhere in the Arab world since their birth. 
 The Three Camps  
 During the centuries-old debate about Islam and democracy, Muslim religious scholars and intellectuals fell into three broad camps. 
 The first camp rejects both democracy and secularism as Western concepts that are not even worth refuting. In this fundamentalist view, participating even in everyday politics, such as joining a political party or voting, is haram, or religiously forbidden. This has been the position of the Wahhabi clerics in Saudi Arabia, the Taliban in Afghanistan and, for decades, the various Salafi schools across the Arab world. 
 The second camp claims that returning to the "true tenets" of Islam will create the best kind of democracy. In this conservative view, the faithful may deliberate to understand the true path, but the idea that religion is the ultimate truth is not negotiable. These Islamists invoke the concept of tawhid, or the oneness, uniqueness and sovereignty of God, which can never be replaced by the will of the people.  
 The second camp also invokes Muslim practices to claim modern political ideology meets the basic requirements of democracy. For example, it often points to the shura or advisory council, where ideas were debated before submitting proposals to the leader –as the equivalent of a parliament. 
 The third camp advocates ijtihad, or reinterpreting Islam to make it compatible with the universal concept of democracy. This position is more common among lay intellectuals than among clerics. But the opening up the doors of ijtihad, which conservative scholars had believed were closed in the Middle Ages, has already produced its own spectrum of ideas, not all in agreement. 
 The Islamist reformers often have a larger audience in the West than in their own countries — and not just because of censorship and harassment. Some are deemed to be too intellectual, too abstract, or tied to an artificial theology. Their philosophical approach is disconnected from popular religious practices and the teachings at most madrasas, or religious schools. 
 The Future 
 The new Islamist brand will increasingly mix technocratic modernism and conservative values. The movements that have entered the political mainstream cannot now afford to turn their backs on multiparty politics for fear of alienating a significant portion of the electorate that wants stability and peace, not revolution. 
 But in countries undergoing transitions, the Islamists will face a tough balancing act. In Egypt, for example, the Muslim Brotherhood cannot cede its conviction that Islam is all-encompassing. Yet it risks losing popular support unless it can also reconcile Islam with good governance and human rights. 
 To do that, the Muslim Brothers may have to translate Islamic norms into more universal conservative values — such as limiting the sale of alcohol in a manner more similar to Utah’s rules than to Saudi laws, and promoting "family values" instead of imposing sharia norms on women. 
 Many Islamist movements still do not share the democratic culture of the uprisings. But given their own demographics and the wider constituency they seek, they will increasingly have to take into account the new political playing field created by the demonstrations — even within their own movements. 
 The exercise of power can actually have a debilitating effect on ideological parties. And for all their recent political success, Islamists also face a set of constraints: They do not control the armed forces. Their societies are more educated and sophisticated in their worldviews, and more willing to actively express their opinions than in years past. Women are increasingly prominent players, a fact reflected in their growing numbers in universities. 
 Ironically, elected Islamists may face opposition from the clergy. Among Sunnis, Islamists usually do not control the religious institutions. Egypt’s Muslim Brotherhood does not control Al Azhar University, the Islamic world’s oldest educational institution dating back more than a millennium. The Brothers may have won a plurality in parliament, but none of them is authorized to say what is or is not Islamic without being challenged by a wide range of other religious actors, from clerics to university scholars. 
 The biggest constraint on Islamists, however, may be economic realities. Focusing simply on sharia will not spawn economic development, and could easily deter foreign investment and tourism. The labor force is outspoken and does not want to be forgotten, but economic globalization requires sensitivity to international pressures too. The newly elected Islamists face political rejection if they do not deliver the economic goods. 
 Israel is still unpopular and anti-Western xenophobia has visibly grown, but Islamist movements will need more than these old issuesto sustain their rise to power.  The Arab uprisings have shifted the battle lines in the Middle East, and Islamists will find it harder to play on the Arab-Israeli conflict or tensions with the international community. 
 At the moment, the most dangerous divide is persistent tensions between Sunnis and Shiites. The differences are symbolized by deepening political fault lines between the Sunni religious monarchy in Saudi Arabia and Iran’s Shiite theocracy, but they ripple across the region — from the tiny archipelago of Bahrain to strategically located Syria. 
 Just as Islamism is redefining the region’s politics, Islamic politics and sectarian differences are redefining its conflicts.
