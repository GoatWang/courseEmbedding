Actavis Announces Michael R. Gallagher and Peter J. McDonnell to Join Board of Directors







DUBLIN, March 17, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Actavis plc (NYSE: ACT) today announced that two former members of the Allergan Board of Directors - Michael R. Gallagher, Lead Independent Director, and Peter J. McDonnell, M.D. - have been named to the Actavis Board of Directors.  David E.I. Pyott, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Allergan, has elected not to join the combined company's Board of Directors, but will continue to serve as Chairman of The Allergan Foundation, a U.S.-based, private charitable foundation committed to providing a lasting and positive impact in the communities in which Allergan, Inc. employees live and work.
Logo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20130124/NY47381LOGO 
In addition to Mr. Gallagher and Dr. McDonnell, the Actavis Board includes Paul M. Bisaro Executive Chairman; Brenton L. Saunders, CEO and President; Catherine M. Klema, Nesli Basgoz, M.D., James H. Bloem, Christopher W. Bodine, Christopher J. Coughlin, Patrick J. O'Sullivan, Ronald R. Taylor, and Fred G. Weiss.  On February 5, 2015, in preparation for the closing of the acquisition of Allergan, the Actavis Board of Directors voted to reduce the Actavis Board from 14 members to 12, and announced the voluntary resignation of Tamar D. Howson, John A. King, Jiri Michal and Andrew L. Turner, effective upon the close of the transaction.
"The addition of Michael and Peter brings significant experience from Allergan to our Board, and I welcome their insights and expertise as we combine our two dynamic organizations," said Brent Saunders, CEO and President of Actavis.  "I want to thank the entire Allergan Board for their stewardship to Allergan shareholders in building a strong and successful company.  I also want to thank Tamar, John, and Jiri for serving on our Board since the acquisition of Warner Chilcott and guiding the foundational combination that expanded Actavis' position of leadership in key brand therapeutic categories, as well as Andy Turner, whose years of service, including previously as Chairman of the Board, have been instrumental as we have dramatically reshaped our Company.
"Finally, I want to offer my sincere appreciation to David Pyott for his support and hard work in leading Allergan to this historic combination.  His tremendous leadership and impact during his more than 17 years with the company have transformed Allergan into one of the leading healthcare companies in the world.  Since we announced the proposed acquisition last year, I have had the opportunity to work with David on an almost daily basis and appreciate his enthusiasm, counsel and hard work in helping to plan for the coming together of our two companies, ensuring that we will realize the full potential of the historic combination of Actavis and Allergan beginning on Day 1." 
"I am pleased that Michael and Peter will be joining the Board of the combined company. Their exceptional qualifications – in particular Michael's nearly two decades on the Allergan Board and Peter's leading stature in Ophthalmology – have been valuable contributors to Allergan's tremendous achievements during the last several years and will be critical in ensuring the continued success of the new company going forward,"  said David Pyott, Chairman and CEO of Allergan.  "Personally, I am excited for the opportunity to pursue new interests, including my work with a few public company boards, several universities in the U.S. and the UK and ophthalmic charities whose goals are to improve eye health in emerging markets. To this end, I am very pleased to be continuing as Chairman of the Board of The Allergan Foundation, where I can continue its important work.  I have been honored to work closely with Brent, Paul and members of the management teams of both companies as we have focused on the integration efforts to bring these two exceptional organizations together in a way that will position it for continued long-term growth."

"Finally, I want to offer my sincere appreciation to David Pyott for his support and hard work in leading Allergan to this historic combination.  His tremendous leadership and impact during his more than 17 years with the company have transformed Allergan into one of the leading healthcare companies in the world.  Since we announced the proposed acquisition last year, I have had the opportunity to work with David on an almost daily basis and appreciate his enthusiasm, counsel and hard work in helping to plan for the coming together of our two companies, ensuring that we will realize the full potential of the historic combination of Actavis and Allergan beginning on Day 1." 
"I am pleased that Michael and Peter will be joining the Board of the combined company. Their exceptional qualifications – in particular Michael's nearly two decades on the Allergan Board and Peter's leading stature in Ophthalmology – have been valuable contributors to Allergan's tremendous achievements during the last several years and will be critical in ensuring the continued success of the new company going forward,"  said David Pyott, Chairman and CEO of Allergan.  "Personally, I am excited for the opportunity to pursue new interests, including my work with a few public company boards, several universities in the U.S. and the UK and ophthalmic charities whose goals are to improve eye health in emerging markets. To this end, I am very pleased to be continuing as Chairman of the Board of The Allergan Foundation, where I can continue its important work.  I have been honored to work closely with Brent, Paul and members of the management teams of both companies as we have focused on the integration efforts to bring these two exceptional organizations together in a way that will position it for continued long-term growth."
